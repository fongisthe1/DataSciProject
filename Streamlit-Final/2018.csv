Recent developments in bifunctional air electrodes for unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cells – A review,"Hunsom M., Kaewsai D., Kannan A.M.",2018-11-15,"Air electrodes, Design and Development, Efficiency enhancement, Optimization of operating conditions, Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, PEM fuel cell, Performance improvements, Real-life applications, Bifunctional air electrode, Catalyst support, Electrocatalyst design, Unitized regenerative PEM fuel cell","Unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane fuel cell (UR-PEMFC) technology has progressed in the recent past and has started appearing towards few applications. However, the UR-PEMFC viability is limited by its lower round-trip efficiency mainly due to several reasons such as sluggish air electrode reactions, lower performance/stability, higher materials cost etc. In this context, many approaches are being implemented for efficiency enhancement including design and development of effective bifunctional air electrodes (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions) materials both for fuel cell and electrolyzer modes as well as for optimization of operating condition for performance stability in real life applications. This review focusses on the recent developments of air electrode active materials design/development for performance improvement in UR-PEMFC. Among all developed electrode materials, the catalysts with Pt- and Ir-based metals still provided the maximum round-trip efficiency of about 50% at 500 mA cm−2 in the unit cell.","energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
The benefit of punishment sensitivity on motor performance under pressure,"Manley H., Beattie S., Roberts R., Lawrence G.P., Hardy L.",2018-06-01,"Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Cognition, Female, Hand Strength, Humans, Male, Punishment, Stress, Psychological, Young Adult, anxiety, defensive distance, performance, reinforcement sensitivity theory, threat imminence","Objective: Humans are often required to perform demanding cognitive and motor tasks under pressure. However, in such environments there is considerable interindividual variability in the ability to successfully execute actions. Here, we consider how individual differences in self-reported sensitivity to punishment influence skilled motor performance under pressure and whether this relationship is moderated by the temporal detection of threat. Method: Across two studies, 160 UK participants (Study 1: N = 80, Mage = 21.6, 52 males; Study 2: N = 80, Mage = 24.95, 45 males) performed a precision-grip task and received either early or late warning of an upcoming stressful manipulation involving social evaluation and performance-dependent incentives. Results: In both studies, we report an interaction where punishment sensitivity was adaptive for motor performance only when threats were detected early and there was opportunity to prepare for the upcoming stressor. Further, our results suggest that the benefits of punishment sensitivity are likely underpinned by the effective use of cognitive strategies. Conclusion: Heightened sensitivity to punishment is adaptive for performance under pressure, provided threats are detected early and effective cognitive strategies are implemented.",psychology,Social Psychology
Are endocrine disrupting compounds environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorder?,"Moosa A., Shu H., Sarachana T., Hu V.W.",2018-05-01,"Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Endocrine Disruptors, Environmental Exposure, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene-Environment Interaction, Hormones, Humans, Inheritance Patterns, Risk Factors, Autism, Endocrine disrupting compounds, Epigenetics, Gene expression, Neurodevelopment, Sex hormones","Recent research on the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has shifted in part from a singular focus on genetic causes to the involvement of environmental factors and their gene interactions. This shift in focus is a result of the rapidly increasing prevalence of ASD coupled with the incomplete penetrance of this disorder in monozygotic twins. One such area of environmentally focused research is the association of exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) with elevated risk for ASD. EDCs are exogenous chemicals that can alter endogenous hormone activity and homeostasis, thus potentially disrupting the action of sex and other natural hormones at all stages of human development. Inasmuch as sex hormones play a fundamental role in brain development and sexual differentiation, exposure to EDCs in utero during critical stages of development can have lasting neurological and other physiological influences on the developing fetus and, ultimately, the child as well as adult. This review will focus on the possible contributions of EDCs to autism risk and pathogenesis by first discussing the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the autistic phenotype, followed by a review of documented human exposures to EDCs and associations with behaviors relevant to ASD. Mechanistic links between EDC exposures and aberrant neurodevelopment and behaviors are then considered, with emphasis on EDC-induced transcriptional profiles derived from animal and cellular studies. Finally, this review will discuss possible mechanisms through which EDC exposure can lead to persistent changes in gene expression and phenotype, which may in turn contribute to transgenerational inheritance of ASD.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience","Endocrinology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Behavioral Neuroscience"
Probabilistic regular grammar inference algorithm using incremental technique,"Penpinun T., Surarerks A.",2018-01-01,"Grammar inference, Grammatical inference algorithm, Grammatical inferences, Incremental techniques, Positive examples, Probabilistic finite state machines, Regular grammar, Writing rules, Grammar inference, Incremental technique, Probabilistic finite state machine","Grammatical inference has been studied for a long time where grammar is illustrated by a collection of re-writing rules, together with their probabilities. We are interested in regular language model which can be recognized by a finite state machine. The most popular technique is an Alergia algorithm. The objective is to construct a probabilistic finite state machine using only positive examples together with their probabilities (or frequency). In this work, we introduce a probabilistic grammatical inference algorithm in order to construct a prefix tree. The algorithm starts by considering the shortest positive example. Two types of regular grammar rules (productions) are introduced. Our experimental results show that the probabilities obtained from our probabilistic finite state machine can be more accurate than the one obtained from the previous algorithm. We hope that our algorithm will be an alternative way for constructing a probabilistic finite state machine.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Information Systems, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications"
Optimization of cinnamon oil nanoemulsions using phase inversion temperature method: Impact of oil phase composition and surfactant concentration,"Chuesiang P., Siripatrawan U., Sanguandeekul R., McLandsborough L., Julian McClements D.",2018-03-15,"Cinnamon oil, Medium chain triglycerides, Nano-emulsions, Natural products, Phase inversion temperature, Phase inversion temperature methods, Spontaneous generation, Surfactant concentrations, Cinnamon oil, Nanoemulsions, Natural product, Phase inversion temperature, Stability","Essential oils, such as those isolated from cinnamon, are effective natural antimicrobial agents, but their utilization is limited by their low water-solubility. In this study, phase inversion temperature (PIT) was used to prepare cinnamon oil nanoemulsions. To this aim, it was hypothesized that cinnamon oil nanoemulsions could be fabricated by optimizing the oil phase composition and surfactant concentration of the system and their stability could be enhanced using a cooling-dilution method during the PIT. A mixture of cinnamon oil, non-ionic surfactant, and water was heated above the PIT of the system, and then rapidly cooled with continuous stirring, which led to the spontaneous generation of small oil droplets. The impact of oil phase composition and surfactant concentration on the formation and stability of the nanoemulsions was determined. Cinnamon oil nanoemulsions with the smallest mean droplet diameter (101 nm) were formed using 40:60 wt% of cinnamon oil and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) in the total lipid phase. Increasing surfactant concentration significantly decreased the mean droplet diameter of the nanoemulsions but did not alter their particle morphology. In addition, using the cooling-dilution method, the nanoemulsions were stable for at least 31 days when stored at 4 °C or 25 °C.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Identifying factors associated with need for flexible ureteroscope repair: a Western Endourology STone (WEST) research consortium prospective cohort study,"Taguchi K., Harper J.D., Stoller M.L., Duty B.D., Sorensen M.D., Sur R.L., Usawachintachit M., Tzou D.T., Wenzler D.L., Isaacson D., Xu A., Chu C., Zaid U.B., Taylor E.R., Ramaswamy K., Chi T.",2018-11-01,"Adult, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure Analysis, Female, Humans, Lithotripsy, Male, Perioperative Period, Prospective Studies, United States, Ureter, Ureteroscopes, Ureteroscopy, Urolithiasis, Young Adult, Durability, Reusable flexible ureteroscope, Scope repair, Ureteral access sheath, Ureteroscopy","Maintenance of flexible ureteroscopes can involve high costs and administrative burden. Instrument fragility necessitates eventual repair, rendering scopes inaccessible during refurbishment. We conducted a multi-institutional prospective cohort study to identify perioperative factors influencing flexible ureteroscope durability. Patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy (URS) at six United States endourology centers were enrolled between August 2014 and June 2015. Surgeon self-reported concern and satisfaction with scope performance as well as upward and downward angles of deflection for each scope tip were measured before and after each procedure. The need for scope repair was determined by the operating surgeon at the time of the procedure and recorded. 424 URS cases using 74 flexible ureteroscopes were identified. Scope repair was required in 28 cases (6.6%) involving 26 scopes (35.1%). Upon univariate analysis, shorter patient height, absence of guidewire use, presence of a ureteral access sheath (UAS), longer procedure time, larger stone size, lithotrite type, surgeon training level, and self-reported concern were associated with scope repair. Upon multivariate analysis, UAS use (OR = 2.53, p = 0.005) and degree loss of scope upward flexion during a case (OR = 1.02, p = 0.03) increased the odds of a scope needing repair while the use of safety guidewire decreased the odds of a scope repair (OR = 0.50, p = 0.045). Lithotrite use and surgeon concern were associated with degree loss of scope upward flexion. The use of a UAS, absence of a safety guidewire, and the loss of upward ureteroscope flexion should be considered when evaluating means of optimizing reusable ureteroscope durability.","urology and nephrology, medical",Urology
"Serum tryptophan, tryptophan catabolites and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in subgroups of youngsters with autism spectrum disorders","Ormstad H., Bryn V., Verkerk R., Skjeldal O.H., Halvorsen B., Saugstad O.D., Isaksen J., Maes M.",2018-01-01,"5-Hydroxytryptophan, Adolescent, Analysis of Variance, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Child, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Electroencephalography, Female, Humans, Kynurenic Acid, Kynurenine, Male, Quinolinic Acid, Tryptophan, Autism spectrum disorders, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Intellectual disability disorder, Neurological development disorder, Serotonin, Tryptophan catabolites","Background: There is evidence that changes in neuro-immune responses coupled with dysfunctions in serotonin metabolism underpin the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Objective: This study aimed to delineate whether ASD subgroups or characteristics show aberrations in tryptophan and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) metabolism. Methods: 65 individuals with ASD (diagnosed according to ICD criteria) and 30 healthy control patients were included. Measured were serum levels of tryptophan, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA), quinolinic acid (QA), BDNF and PRO-BDNF and total blood 5-HT and 5-OH-tryptophan (5-HTP). Results: Elevated BDNF levels and lower tryptophan and KA levels were characteristics of both childhood autism and intellectual disability disorder, whilst elevated tryptophan and lower 5-HT synthesis were hallmarks of Asperger syndrome. A pathological MRI was associated with elevated tryptophan and lowered KA. Abnormal EEG results and dysmorphology were both associated with an elevated BDNF/ PRO-BDNF ratio. Any brain pathology and gastro-intestinal symptoms were accompanied by lowered KA. Conclusions: Increased BDNF production and changes in the metabolism of tryptophan are associated with many ASD characteristics, showing particularly strong associations with childhood autism and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. Peripheral BDNF and tryptophan metabolism appear to take part in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders and their phenotypes.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"
Delta-like ligand 4 in hepatocellular carcinoma intrinsically promotes tumour growth and suppresses hepatitis B virus replication,"Kunanopparat A., Issara-Amphorn J., Leelahavanichkul A., Sanpavat A., Patumraj S., Tangkijvanich P., Palaga T., Hirankarn N.",2018-09-14,"Animals, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Cell Line, Tumor, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Hep G2 Cells, Hepatitis B virus, Humans, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, Liver Neoplasms, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Neovascularization, Pathologic, RNA, Small Interfering, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2, Viral Proteins, Virus Replication, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, Delta-like ligand 4, Hepatocellular carcinoma, HepG2.2.15, Notch signalling","AIM To investigate the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) on tumour growth in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo . METHODS We suppressed DLL4 expression in an HBV expressing HCC cell line, HepG2.2.15 and analysed the growth ability of cells as subcutaneous tumours in nude mice. The expression of tumour angiogenesis regulators, VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 in tumour xenografts were examined by western blotting. The tumour proliferation and neovasculature were examined by immunohistochemistry. The viral replication and viral protein expression were measured by quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS Eighteen days after implantation, tumour volume in mice implanted with shDLL4 HepG2.2.15 was significantly smaller than in mice implanted with control HepG2.2.15 (P < 0.0001). The levels of angiogenesis regulators, VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 were significantly decreased in implanted tumours with suppressed DLL4 compared with the control group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the suppression of DLL4 expression in tumour cells reduced cell proliferation and the formation of new blood vessels in tumours. Unexpectedly, increased viral replication was observed after suppression of DLL4 in the tumours. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that DLL4 is important in regulating the tumour growth of HBV-associated HCC as well as the neovascularization and suppression of HBV replication.",medical,Gastroenterology

Cyanobacteria are the major groups of photosynthetic organisms often exposed to visible and UV radiations (UVR) in their natural habitats. UVR has detrimental effects on their physiological and biochemical life processes. Therefore, they have evolved diverse responses for UV protection at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Most response mechanisms include avoidance by migration to lower UVR conditions, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by UV exposure, screening by certain UV-absorbing compounds (UV sunscreens), and repair and resynthesis of macromolecules such as damaged DNA and proteins. It has been well documented that the effective UV sunscreens serve a crucial role in protection from UVR. In this chapter, we focus on the occurrence of natural UV sunscreens in cyanobacteria, such as mycosporine-like amino acids and scytonemin. Carotenoids and their glycosides are also thought to play an important role in UV light protection in cyanobacteria. We describe our current understandings of these cyanobacterial secondary metabolites, and place special emphasis on their biosynthetic pathways, regulations, and cellular functions. The future prospects of their applications are also discussed.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Herein, we have designed a facile synthetic methodology to obtain a ternary co-modified g-C3N4 composite via WS2 and carbon-doped TiO2 (C-TiO2) nanorods with highly efficient photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from deionized (DI) water and a natural seawater system under visible-light illumination. This composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4, WS2, C-TiO2 nanorods, and the reference-modified g-C3N4 composite with individual WS2 or C-TiO2 nanorods. Co-modified g-C3N4 composite shows a great photostability in both DI water and seawater. Under λ=420 nm monochromatic light illumination, the apparent quantum efficiency of the co-modified g-C3N4 composite in seawater solution is 13.08 %, which is higher than pure g-C3N4 (5.06 %). WS2, TiO2, and g-C3N4 constitute a ternary heterojunction boosting the fast separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, which plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the WS2 and C-TiO2 nanorod co-modified g-C3N4 composite with high photocatalytic performance provides a promising candidate for rationally utilizing the seawater resource to produce clean chemical energy.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, environmental, coastal engineering, Materials Science, energy","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Energy (all)"
Lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming,"Ukritchon B., Keawsawasvong S.",2018-06-10,"Anisotropic strength, Finite element limit analysis, Limit analysis, Lower bounds, Second-order cone programming, anisotropic strength, finite element limit analysis, limit analysis, lower bound, second-order cone programming, stability","In this paper, the formulation of the lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming is described. The finite element concept was used to discretize the soil mass into 3-noded triangular elements. The stress field was modeled using a linear interpolation within the elements while stress discontinuities were permitted to occur at the shared edges of adjacent elements. An elliptical yield criterion was adopted to model the anisotropic undrained strength of the clay. A statically admissible stress field was defined by enforcing the equilibrium equations within all triangular elements and along all shared edges of adjacent elements, stress boundary conditions, and no stress violation of the anisotropic strength envelope cast in the form of a conic quadratic constraint. The lower bound solution of the proposed formulation was solved by second-order cone programming. The proposed formulation of the anisotropic undrained strength criterion was validated through comparison of the model's predictions with the known exact solutions of strip footings, and was applied to solve undrained stability of a shallow unlined square tunnel. Computational performance between the proposed approach of second-order cone programming and linear programming was examined and discussed.","fluidex; related topics, modelling and numerical methods, engineering, Materials Science, earth sciences","Computational Mechanics, Materials Science (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanics of Materials"

The aim of this study was to determine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PNPLA3 (rs738409), COX-2 (rs689465) and DHCR7 (rs12785878) and advanced liver fibrosis in Thai patients. A total of 220 patients with HCV mono-infection, 200 patients with HCV/HIV co-infection and 200 healthy controls were enrolled. The SNPs were detected by allelic discrimination using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was assessed by transient elastography. Our results showed that the distribution of the studied SNPs were not significantly different between the HCV mono- and co-infected groups. The frequencies AG and GG genotypes of rs689465 and GG genotype of rs12785878 were less commonly found in the HCV mono- and co-infected groups compare with healthy controls (P < 0.01). Among patients with HCV infection, older age, HIV co-infection, GG genotype of rs738409 and GG genotype of rs689465 were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis (LSM=9.5 kPa) in multivariate analysis. Moreover, the percentage of patients with advanced liver fibrosis increased significantly along with the accumulated numbers of these risk genotypes. In conclusion, PNPLA3 (rs738409) and COX-2 (rs689465) polymorphisms were associated with advanced liver fibrosis in patients with HCV mono- and co-infection, suggesting that these variants might play an important role in progressive liver fibrosis in these patients.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

The drift-flux correlation includes two important drift-flux parameters, namely, the distribution parameter and void-fraction-weighted-mean drift velocity. In this study, an extensive literature survey for horizontal two-phase flow is conducted to establish void fraction database and to acquire existing drift-flux correlations. A total of 566 data is collected from 12 data sources and 4 flow-regime-dependent and 1 flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlations are identified. The predictive capability of the existing drift-flux correlations is assessed using the collected data. It is pointed out that the drift velocity determined by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity. In this study, a simple flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlation is developed. In the modeling approach, the void-fraction-weighted mean drift velocity is approximated to be 0 m/s, whereas the distribution parameter is given as a simple function of the ratio of non-dimensional superficial gas velocity to non-dimensional mixture volumetric flux. The newly developed correlation shows an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two-phase flow. Mean absolute error (or bias), standard deviation (random error), mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation are 0.0487, 0.0985, 0.0758 and 0.206, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the correlation is similar to the correlation of Chexal et al. (1991), which was formulated based on the drift-flux parameters by means of many cascading constitutive relationships with numerous empirical parameters.","physics, engineering, coastal engineering","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

Few studies exist regarding trends in intensity of end-of-life care for those under 65 years of age. Objectives To examine recent temporal trends in place of death, and both hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, for age-stratified decedents with chronic, life-limiting diagnoses (<65 vs. ≥65 years) who received care in a large healthcare system. Methods Retrospective cohort using death certificates and electronic health records for 22,068 patients with chronic illnesses who died between 2010 and 2015. We examined utilization overall and stratified by age using multiple regression. Results The proportion of deaths at home did not change, but hospital admissions in the last 30 days of life decreased significantly from 2010 to 2015 (hospital b = −0.026; CI = −0.041, −0.012). ICU admissions in the last 30 days also declined over time for the full sample and for patients aged 65 years or older (overall b = −0.023; CI = −0.039, −0.007), but was not significant for younger decedents. Length of stay (LOS) did not decrease for those using the hospital or ICU. Conclusion From 2010 to 2015, we observed a decrease in hospital admissions for all age groups and in ICU admissions for those over 65 years. As there were no changes in the proportion of patients with chronic illness who died at home nor in hospital or ICU LOS in the last 30 days, hospital and ICU admissions in the last 30 days may be a more responsive quality metric than site of death or LOS for palliative care interventions.","genergyal, Nursing, medical","Nursing (all), Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

However, the use of textual data involves text representation construction. Traditional methods like word embedding may not be suitable for representing the semantics of financial news due to problems of word sparsity in datasets. In this paper, we aim to improve stock market predictions using a deep learning approach with event embedding vectors extracted from news headlines, historical price data, and a set of technical indicators as input. Our prediction model consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architectures. We use accuracy and annualized return based on trading simulation as performance metrics, and then perform experiments on three datasets obtained from different news sources namely Reuters, Reddit, and Intrinio. Results show that enhancing text representation vectors and considering both numerical and textual information as input to a deep neural network can improve prediction performance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems"

We suggested that the concentrations of cysteine and FA-CP were the key factors for the formation of flower-like structure. In addition, the formation mechanism of the microflowers was tentatively identified as anisotropic hierarchical growth. The microflowers exhibited effective drug adsorption with the loading capacity of 142.2 mg g−1 for doxorubicin which was three times higher than that for the doxorubicin-loaded spherical SeNPs and showed more potent activity against cancer cells while showing less toxicity against normal cells. These data demonstrated that the microflower-like FA-CP/SeNPs structure could be a candidate anticancer drug template in drug delivery systems.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
Improved heterologous expression of the membrane-bound quinoprotein quinate dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter oxydans,"Yakushi T., Komatsu K., Matsutani M., Kataoka N., Vangnai A.S., Toyama H., Adachi O., Matsushita K.",2018-05-01,"Alcohol Oxidoreductases, Bacterial Proteins, Cloning, Molecular, Escherichia coli, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Gluconobacter oxydans, Recombinant Proteins, Acetic acid bacteria, Dehydrogenase, Membrane protein, Pyrroloquinoline quinone, Quinate","Gluconobacter oxydans produces 3-dehydroquinate by oxidation of quinate through a reaction catalyzed by the quinate dehydrogenase (QDH), membrane-bound, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenase. We previously reported the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of QDH and constructed a heterologous expression system of QDH in Pseudomonas sp. (A.S. Vangnai, W. Promden, W. De-Eknamkul, K. Matsushita, H. Toyama, Biochemistry (Moscow) 75:452–459, 2010). Through this study, we aim to update the sequences of QDH and improve the heterologous expression of QDH in Gluconobacter strains using a broad-host-range plasmid. Expression of QDH using a plasmid containing a long 5′-UTR was higher than that using a plasmid with a short 5′-UTR. In addition, the usage of the putative promoter region of the membrane-bound, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) of Gluconobacter resulted in higher expression levels compared to the usage of the lacZ promoter. Base substitution experiments allowed to identify the correct TTG initiation codon between two possibilities, and the result of these experiments were consistent with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the expressed QDH. However, change of the TTG codon to ATG did not increase QDH expression. Therefore, the optimal plasmid for QDH expression included the structural gene with a long 5′-UTR and the ADH promoter. Cell membrane of the recombinant Gluconobacter strain presented approximately 10-times higher specific QDH activity than that observed in the wild-type strain.","protein biochemistryistryhemistry; oxidoreductive enzymes (ec 1.); dehydrogenases, biochemistryistry",Biotechnology
Memory T cell subsets in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues,"Mahanonda R., Champaiboon C., Subbalekha K., Sa-Ard-Iam N., Yongyuth A., Isaraphithakkul B., Rerkyen P., Charatkulangkun O., Pichyangkul S.",2018-01-01,"CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Gingiva, Humans, Immunologic Memory, Periodontitis, T-Lymphocyte Subsets, Gingiva, Homeostasis, Interleukin-17, Memory, Periodontitis, T-lymphocytes","Background: In the gingival sulcus, effective and balanced innate and adaptive immune responses against subgingival plaque microbiome are crucial to maintain immune homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the memory T cell subsets in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues. Methods: Anatomical localization of T cells (CD3+,CD4+, and CD8+) in healthy gingiva and periodontitis tissues were examined immunohistochemically. Subsets of memory T cells from isolated gingival cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD69, anti-CD103, anti-CD45RA, anti-CCR7, anti-CD28, and anti-CD95). Intracellular cytokine staining of interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ expression on memory T cells in periodontitis tissues was also investigated. Results: We found that healthy gingiva contains two memory T cell populations; a CD69− recirculating population and a CD69+ gingiva-resident memory T cell population. CD4+ T cells with transitional memory (TTM) phenotype (CD45RA−CCR7−CD28+CD95+) constitute the major subset within these two populations. A significant increase in the proportion of CD4+CD69+CD103− memory T cells was observed in periodontitis tissues compared with healthy gingiva. CD4+ memory T cells from periodontitis tissues produced either IL-17 or IFN-γ whereas CD8+ memory T cells produced only IFN-γ. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that recirculating and gingiva-resident memory T cells could represent an important part of the immune surveillance network in the connective tissue, maintaining periodontal homeostasis. Imbalance of subgingival bacterial communities could damage gingival barrier allowing bacterial antigens to get access to the deeper connective tissue where they activate memory T cells leading to deleterious inflammation; a hallmark of periodontitis.",dentistry,Periodontics

The simulation tool is composed of a passenger arrival model for a single or group of elevators, their control system, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The developed GUI can display statistical information of the passengers traffic pattern and also the animation of elevator cars with the number of passengers inside. The current version allows both individual and batch Poisson arrival processes which could represent up-peak traffic in the morning and after lunch of office buildings respectively. The motion of elevator cars has been precisely modeled with real parameters of velocity, acceleration, distance, and jerk. However, only the basic nearest car algorithm is implemented for elevator group control systems. We believe, the developed simulator not only has its utility for educational purpose but also can serve as a software platform for future research on more advanced elevator group control systems.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, engineering, sociology, decision sciences","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Signal Processing, Information Systems and Management, Management Science and Operations Research"

To this end, we extend a specification language with the consideration of formal logic, so that some effective theorems can be derived for the verification of syntax, semantics, and inference rules in the workflow composition. The logic-based approach automates compliance checking effectively.

Influence of silica sources on structural property and activity of Pd-supported on mesoporous MCM-41 synthesized with an aid of microwave heating for partial hydrogenation of soybean methyl esters,"Na Rungsi A., Luengnaruemitchai A., Wongkasemjit S., Chollacoop N., Chen S.-Y., Yoshimura Y.",2018-08-05,"Fatty acid methyl ester, Fumed silicas, Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Pd/MCM-41, Silatrane, Fatty acid methyl ester, Fumed silica, Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Pd/MCM-41, Silatrane","MCM-41 has been hydrothermally synthesized using fumed silica (SiO2) and silatrane [Si(TEA)2] as silica sources. Pd nanoparticles were successfully impregnated to the mesoporous MCM-41 supports. Soybean oil methyl ester was partially hydrogenated by the Pd/MCM-41-SiO2 and Pd/MCM-41-silatrane catalysts under a mild condition (low temperature and pressure). Both catalysts could rapidly and selectively convert the polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (C18:3 and C18:2) to monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (C18:1) at 100 °C and 0.4 MPa H2 within 4 h. The results verified that the Pd/MCM-41-silatrane catalyst with the greater surface of Pd active sites had higher catalytic activity, representing in term of turnover frequency (TOF), in partial hydrogenation than Pd/MCM-41-SiO2 under both C18:2 conversions of 40% and 60%. Even if the lower selectivity toward cis-C18:1 was obtained for the former. In addition to the better stable structure of MCM-41-silatrane support as compared to MCM-41-SiO2 support, silatrane precursor is more favorable to diminish the extent of complete hydrogenation than fumed silica as it provided the lower index. Even though, this silica precursor sues for more synthetic step. Due to the higher oxidative stability of Pd/MCM-41-SiO2, MCM-41-SiO2 support was further studied for the later research. When varying the Pd loadings in 0.5–2 wt.% on MCM-41-SiO2 support, the Pd(2)/MCM-41-SiO2 catalyst gave the highest performance (TOF) whether the complete hydrogenation was concurrently accompanied. Results signify that the nature of the silica source and the Pd concentration modified the surface active sites and size distribution of metallic particles, which determine the catalytic reactivity and selectivity.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Recently, high levels of plasma NGAL (pNGAL) has been strongly correlated with poor AKI outcome. This is a feasibility study conducted to test whether early RRT initiation guided by pNGAL could improve AKI outcome. Material and methods The study comprised of triage trial and interventional trial running subsequently. As a guide for triage to RRT, we measured pNGAL at the enrollment time. Forty patients with pNGAL ≥ 400 ng/mL (high pNGAL group) were randomized to ‘early’ or 'standard’ group. Patients with pNGAL < 400 ng/mL (n = 20) were defined as low pNGAL group. Results The triggering pNGAL selected AKI patients with more severity of illness and worse clinical outcome. However, in high pNGAL group, early RRT did not result in different 28-day mortality from the standard group. The median numbers of day free from mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the early RRT group. Conclusions Our finding suggested that it was feasible to use pNGAL to triage severe AKI patients. However, early initiation of RRT in this high risk group did not affect the 28-day mortality.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

The results were verified by comparison with the available solution from the method of characteristics (slip-line analysis) for perfectly smooth and rough footings. The LB analyses were able to complete a prior solution of undrained bearing capacity with a linear increase in the strength profile by incorporating the influence of adhesion factor at the soil–footing interface.

By combining with ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we obtained a deeper map in the same region (1 σ depth ∼ 30 μJy beam−1 for a deep region with a 250 kλ-taper, and a synthesized beam size of 0.59 × 0.53), providing the largest sample of sources (25 sources at ≥5.0 σ, 45 sources at ≥4.5 σ) among ALMA blank-field surveys to date. The number counts show that 52+−118 % of the extragalactic background light at 1.2 mm is resolved into discrete sources at S1.2 mm > 135 μJy. We create infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) in the redshift range of z = 1–3 from the ASAGAO sources with Ks-band counterparts, and constrain the faintest luminosity of the LF at 2.0 < z < 3.0. The LFs are consistent with previous results based on other ALMA and SCUBA-2 observations, which suggest a positive luminosity evolution and negative density evolution with increasing redshift. We find that obscured star-formation of sources with IR luminosities of log (LIR/L) 11.8 account for ≈60%–90% of the z ∼ 2 cosmic star-formation rate density.","extraterrestrial physicsics and stellar phenomena, fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Methods: Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. Conclusion: High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Health Professions, Materials Science, engineering, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Therefore, the result of the current TARS may not good enough.

Then, we select the period in the past of the target user that has a similar preference to the current preference period to find the neighbors and predict the target item's rating. The proposed method does not necessary use the entire user data in the past but uses only the data in the past period of the target user that is similar to the current period for prediction. In the experiment, the proposed method is compared with the two current TARS methods on MovieLens dataset. The evaluation results can be confirmed that the proposed method provides more accuracy and coverage than the two current methods. Moreover, the proposed method uses smaller data than the other two methods.

Naturally acquired IgG antibodies to thrombospondin-related anonymous protein of plasmodium vivax (PvTRAP) in Thailand predominantly elicit immunological cross-reactivity,"Kosuwin R., Feng M., Makiuchi T., Putaporntip C., Tachibana H., Jongwutiwes S.",2018-01-01,"Antibodies, Protozoan, DNA, Protozoan, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Plasmodium vivax, Protozoan Proteins, Thailand, Cross-reactive antibody, IgG antibody response, Plasmodium vivax, Theombospondin-related anonymous protein, Thrombospondin repeats, Willebrand A-domain","background Thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) is a prime candidate for a malaria vaccine. Antibodies to Plasmodium vivax TRAP (PvTRAP) occur upon natural infection while specific antigenic domains remain to be addressed. methods The PvTRAP sequences were determined from 73 P. vivax isolates from Tak and Ubon Ratchathani provinces collected in 2013. The recombinant proteins representing four variants each for domain II (A domain) and domain IV (thrombospondin repeat region) of PvTRAP circulating in these areas were used as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against 246 serum samples from P. vivax-infected patients in both provinces collected during 2013 and 2014. results The prevalence of total IgG antibodies to at least one variant antigen of domain II and domain IV was 63.8% and 71.5%, respectively. Differential IgG antibody responses to these variant antigens of each domain were observed. Total IgG antibody responses to the variant antigens of each domain upon pairwise comparisons were highly correlated, suggesting immunological cross-reactivity in the majority of serum samples. A smaller proportion of serum samples contained non-crossreactive antibodies to variants of each domain; particularly domain II in which amino acid differences significantly influenced antibody recognition. Previous malaria exposure positively affected antibody responses to domain IV. Positive seroconversion and rising antibody titres occurred within a few weeks after resolution of infections. conclusions Both domains II and IV are targets of naturally acquired IgG antibodies. Despite sequence variation in these domains, most antibody responses were cross-reactive. A cross-sectional evaluation of antibodies to PvTRAP during acute infection could underestimate the seroprevalence.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Peripheral Alterations in Cytokine and Chemokine Levels After Antidepressant Drug Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Kohler C.A., Freitas T.H., Stubbs B., Maes M., Solmi M., Veronese N., de Andrade N.Q., Morris G., Fernandes B.S., Brunoni A.R., Herrmann N., Raison C.L., Miller B.J., Lanctot K.L., Carvalho A.F.",2018-05-01,"Antidepressive Agents, Chemokines, Depressive Disorder, Major, Humans, Treatment Outcome, Antidepressant, Chemokines, Cytokines, Depression, Inflammation, Meta-analysis","Mounting evidence suggests that aberrations in immune-inflammatory pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and individuals with MDD may have elevated levels of predominantly pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein. In addition, previous meta-analyses suggest that antidepressant drug treatment may decrease peripheral levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6. Recently, several new studies examining the effect of antidepressants on these cytokines have been published, and so we performed an updated meta-analysis of studies that measured peripheral levels of cytokines and chemokines during antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through March 9, 2017. Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (N = 1517). Peripheral levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, interferon-γ, IL-8, the C-C motif ligand 2 chemokine (CCL-2), CCL-3, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-13, IL-17, IL-5, IL-7, and the soluble IL-2 receptor were measured in at least three datasets and thus were meta-analyzed. Antidepressant treatment significantly decreased peripheral levels of IL-6 (Hedges g = −0.454, P <0.001), TNF-α (g = −0.202, P = 0.015), IL-10 (g = −0.566, P = 0.012), and CCL-2 (g = −1.502, P = 0.006). These findings indicate that antidepressants decrease several markers of peripheral inflammation. However, this meta-analysis did not provide evidence that reductions in peripheral inflammation are associated with antidepressant treatment response although few studies provided separate data for treatment responders and non-responders.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The adsorbent B-CMs were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of xylose and subsequent functionalization. They had a nonporous structure with a surface area of 76.1 m2/g and the presence of boronic acids on their surface was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The distribution of boronic acid on the surface of the B-CMs was analyzed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The adsorption kinetics for Cu(II), Ni(II), and Cr(VI) ions best fitted a pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption isotherms best fitted the Freundlich model, with Ni(II) showing the highest adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity for these three metal ions decreased by less than 10% and 15–25% after one and three uses, respectively. Thus, considering that the B-CMs showed high adsorption capacities and were derived from agricultural waste (xylose) by a simple hydrothermal process, they seem highly suited for use as efficient and environment-friendly heavy metal adsorbents.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

This plant has been reported to relieve postmenopausal symptoms, prevent and reverse bone loss, inhibit the growth of breast cancer, and alleviate cardiovascular diseases in preclinical and clinical studies. However, there is little information on the oral bioavailability and tissue distribution of puerarin with respect to its pharmacodynamic activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of puerarin, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, in rats. Moreover, this is the first study to examine the tissue distribution of puerarin in the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland. Methods: Adult female rats were administered puerarin at 1 mg/kg intravenously or 5 and 10 mg/kg orally. Blood, tissue, urine, and feces were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Puerarin reached a maximum concentration in the blood of 140-230 μg/L within 1 h of oral dosing, and had an absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 7%. Following intravenous administration, puerarin was widely distributed in several tissues, including the hippocampus, heart, lung, stomach, liver, mammary gland, kidney, spleen, femur, and tibia. Approximately 50% of the intravenous dose was excreted as glucuronide metabolites via the urinary route. Conclusions: The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 7% at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. Puerarin was widely distributed to several organs related to the diseases of aging, including the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland. Glucuronides were the major metabolites of puerarin and were mainly excreted in the urine. These results are useful for the development of puerarin and Pueraria candollei var. mirifica as phytopharmaceutical products.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

From the viewpoint of carrier-based modulation, there are two cases of overmodulation which correspond to (1) over output-voltage range and (2) over input-current range. Three simple strategies to limit the modulating functions under overmodulation are then studied. It is also clarified how the switching patterns and space vector utilization change in the overmodulation range. And the effects of the switching patterns and space-vector utilization on the current and voltage distortions are compared. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the error of fundamental amplitude between the output voltage and the desired output voltage is small with the so-called <2u1d>PWM, while using the max-input-phase as the reference in the carrier-based modulation gives low output voltage distortion.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this study, we studied the feasibility of fabricating hydroxyapatite by hydrothermal conversion of calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO4•0.5H2O) based mixture. The spherical samples (7 mm in diameter) were three dimensionally printed and hydrothermally treated in 1M disodium hydrogenphosphate (Na2HPO4) at 100°C -180°C for 2-8 hrs. Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction indicated that monetite (CaHPO4) coexisted with hydroxyapatite when hydrothermally treating the samples at pH 9. However, when pH of disodium hydrogenphosphate was adjusted to pH 11, the samples were completely converted to hydroxyapatite without any structural destruction. Therefore, hydrothermal reaction could possibly be employed to enhance the phase conversion of hydroxyapatite in term of conversion rate compared to typical atmospheric conversion.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Firstly, carboxylic acid functionalized ABS particles were synthesized by grafting polymethacrylic acid (PMAA) onto ABS particle surface using potassium persulfate as an initiator. The reaction was followed by FTIR analysis. The resultant carboxylated ABS was melt mixed with virgin PLA in an internal mixer to obtain PLA/PLA-g-ABS blends. The obtained PLA/PLA-g-ABS blends were subject to injection molding to obtain specimens for testing evaluation. It was found that impact resistance values significantly outperformed neat PLA by 60 %, 87 %, and 150 % for PLA/PLA-g-ABS 10 wt%, PLA/PLA-g-ABS 20 wt%, and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 30 wt%, respectively. A significant increase in impact strength was contributable to ABS rubber which exhibited even dispersion and good interfacial adhesion. The impact strength was dependent on the percent loading of PLAg-ABS; the more the PLA/PLA-g-ABS the higher the impact strength value. In a similar manner, tensile strength increases when loaded with PLA/PLA-g-ABS albeit at lesser effect. Considering the percent elongation, a massive increase in percent elongation was recorded in case of PLA/PLA-g-ABS 20 wt% and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 30 wt%, implying that these blends were extremely flexible and tough when compared to neat PLA, control, and PLA/PLA-g-ABS 10 wt%.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

There are three main types of HAPs: a fixed wing aeroplane, an airship, and a balloon. This study aims at designing an unmanned solar-powered aeroplane for communication, functioning as a satellite. The values of solar radiation power on the equinox, summer solstice and winter solstice were estimated as well as a required power from each mission profile. Those values of the required power and the available one were used as constraints for a required solar cell area and a required battery capacity. Then, the wing planform was sized. To optimise the wing, three aerofoils with different tip dihedral angles were simulated with ANSYS so that the one with the optimal rolling, pitching and yawing moments could be selected. The mass of each aircraft component was later estimated, tail was sized based on those masses and their locations. The static margin was calculated to validate the tail sizing with the HAP centre of mass. The verification of power consumption was also performed by a simulation of the whole aircraft. The final conceptual HAP model is equipped with 19.5-aspect-ratio Eppler 397 wing with an angle of incidence of 5 degrees and tip dihedral angle of 8 degree at 7.5 metres from the longitudinal centre line.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, sociology","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Automotive Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Transportation"

Current DIVA vaccines and assays are highly effective in the control and/or eradication of ADV, but detection of wild-type ADV infection relies on testing individual pig specimens, for example, serum or muscle exudate (“meat juice”). Oral fluid specimens have been shown to be highly effective for the surveillance of a variety of swine pathogens and could offer the means to improve the efficiency of ADV surveillance in the field. In this study, the temporal patterns of ADV DNA and antibody detection in oral fluid and serum specimens were established in ADV-inoculated pigs (n = 14) using gB and gE PCRs, virus neutralization (VN) and three commercial serum antibody ELISAs (gB bELISA, gI bELISA and ADV iELISA). ADV DNA was detected in oral fluid samples (20% to 100%) from 3 to 21 days postinoculation (DPI), but not in serum. ADV antibody was detected in oral fluid specimens at DPI ≥ 10 with the gB bELISA (36% to 79%) and ADV iELISA (29% to 100%), but not the gI bELISA. These results suggest that oral fluid could be used as an alternative to individual pig sampling for ADV surveillance using PCR- and/or antibody-based assays.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Classification models for stock's performance prediction: A case study of finance sector in the stock exchange of Thailand,"Phongmekin A., Jarumaneeroj P.",2018-08-13,"Area Under the Curve (AUC), Classification models, Classification technique, K nearest neighbor (KNN), Linear discriminant analyses (LDA), Performance prediction, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Stock Exchange of Thailand, classification model, data mining, stock exchange of Thailand (SET)","Within stock market, the objective of both stock buyers and sellers is to make profit on price difference based on their expectation on a company's current and future value. There is no investing strategy that is considered to be the best by experts, and investing decision criteria remain contingent upon an individual investor's experiences and bias. To address the challenges, this paper uses financial ratios and company's industry data of stocks in finance sector of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) to construct two classification models predicting (i) whether stock's one-year return will outperform the SET Index and (ii) whether the return will be positive. Various classification techniques, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are explored, whose performances are evaluated by Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the AUC values, we can conclude that, on average, all methods are comparatively good, with LR and LDA being the most useful classifiers for risk averse investors- A s both are not subject to uncertainty due to true positive counting bias.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Engineering (miscellaneous), Instrumentation"
A Self-Microemulsifying Formulation of Oxyresveratrol Prevents Amyloid Beta Protein-Induced Neurodegeneration in Mice,"Sangsen Y., Sooksawate T., Likhitwitayawuid K., Sritularak B., Wiwattanapatapee R.",2018-07-01,"Administration, Oral, Alzheimer Disease, Amyloid beta-Peptides, Animals, Antioxidants, Artocarpus, Biological Availability, Drug Delivery Systems, Emulsions, Hippocampus, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred ICR, Neuroprotective Agents, Peptide Fragments, Plant Extracts, Rats, Wistar, Stilbenes, Alzheimer's disease, Artocarpus lacucha, bioavailability, Moraceae, neuroprotection, oral delivery, oxyresveratrol, self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems","The polyphenol compound, oxyresveratrol (OXY) possesses potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of potential utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the low oral bioavailability limits its neuroprotective effect and clinical application. The neuroprotective effect of orally administered OXY-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (OXY-SMEDDS) was compared with free OXY in vivo. Mice were orally administered either free OXY or OXY-SMEDDS once daily at a dose of 90, 180, or 360 mg/kg for 14 d. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotoxic amyloid β (A β) 25-35 peptide at day 8 during oral treatment. The OXY-SMEDDS formulation resulted in four-times reduction of the free OXY dose required for prevention of neurotoxicity effects due to A β 25-35 peptide as demonstrated by a significant decline in behavior impairments, lipid oxidation levels, and neuronal cell loss in all hippocampal subfields (p < 0.0001). These results indicate the potential of OXY-SMEDDS by oral delivery to improve the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

We previously reported that addition of human fibroblast growth factor 18 (hFGF18) to acryloyl group-modified cholesterol-bearing pullulan (CHPOA) nanogel-crosslinked (NanoClik) hydrogels that contain human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (hBMP2) stabilized bone healing in mouse calvarial defect model. In this study, we evaluated the use of disc-shaped dried nanogel-crosslinked gel as carriers of growth factors in order to seek possible clinical application in future. Both conventionally-dried NanoClik disc and nanogel-crosslinked porous (NanoCliP) disc made by freeze-drying that contained the growth factors induced bone healing but not as much as with NanoClik hydrogel application but addition of RGD peptides (RGD-NanoCliP disc) improved the healing. All type of discs showed the same biphasic ovalbumin-Alexa Fluor 488 protein release profile in vitro, an initial burst followed by a gradual sustained release more than one week, which was confirmed in vivo. Histological analysis showed remarkable new bone formation with more calcification in RGD-NanoCliP disc with the growth factors and the osteogenesis appeared to begin in the dura mater in contact with the disc. These observations suggest: (1) the fitness of the durable discs to the bone defect is a critical factor for bone healing, which is supplemented by addition of RGD peptides, (2) the porosity is suitable for osteoblast recruitment, (3) growth factor release pattern of the CHPOA nanogel based gels is ideal for bone healing.","biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

This study should offer an alternative powerful tool essential for the modeling of both near-surface and deeply embedded defects in a rock/soil medium. A system of governing equations is established using a pair of weakly singular, weakform, displacement and traction integral equations for the cracked whole space along with the symmetric condition. The final equations contain only unknown crack-face data in a lowerhalf of the whole space. In addition to their capability to treat cracks of arbitrary shape, material anisotropy and general loading conditions, all involved kernels are weakly singular allowing all integrals to be interpreted in the sense of Riemann. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the Galerkin approximation is implemented to solve the governing integral equations for the unknown crack-face data. To further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, special basis functions are introduced to approximate the near-front field and the interpolation technique is adopted to evaluate all kernels for generally anisotropic materials. The solved crack-face displacement data is then utilized to postprocess for the essential fracture information along the crack front. Various scenarios are employed to verify the proposed technique and a selected set of results is presented to demonstrate its accuracy and computational robustness.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Engineering (all)

The hexavalent chromium was pre-concentrated using the HF-LPME technique via ion exchange or a coupled transport process through a supported ionic liquid (Aliquat 336) prior to colorimetric detection with diphenylcarbazide on the µPAD. The violet colour could be seen by the naked eye. Images from the µPADs were scanned using a commercial desktop scanner at 600 dpi resolution. ImageJ software was used for quantitative analysis by measuring the intensity values at green colour channel since it gave the best sensitivity among the RGB colour. Under optimal conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range 10–90 µg L-1, with a limit of detection of 3 µg L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the level of hexavalent chromium spiked into natural water samples at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level, and the results were in good agreement with those obtained using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The developed method was able to improve the detection limit of the conventional µPAD, and was expected to be used for the effective analysis of hexavalent chromium in natural water.","mixing and separation, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

This study investigated the effect of iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, on cell proliferation and the expression of angiogenesis-related genes in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs) in vitro. The hPDLs were treated with 10−9–10−6 M iloprost for 1, 6 and 24 h. Cell proliferation was determined by an MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alpha-1 type I collagen (COL1), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) mRNA expression were determined by semi-quantitative and qPCR. ELISA was employed for assessment of VEGF expression. Immunofluorescence staining for COL1 protein expression was performed. A prostacyclin receptor (IP) antagonist was used to verify the signaling pathway. The Kruskal–Wallis and Tukey significant difference tests were used to analyze the results. From the results, iloprost treatment did not affect cell morphology or proliferation. Iloprost induced the upregulation of VEGF and COL1 mRNA levels as shown by PCR. The effect of iloprost on bFGF mRNA expression was not observed. The immunofluorescence assay revealed that COL1 protein expression was increased in the iloprost groups. Pretreating the hPDLs with the IP antagonist significantly suppressed the enhancing effect of iloprost on VEGF and COL1 mRNA expression and suppressed COL1 protein expression. In conclusion, iloprost promoted mRNA and protein expression of VEGF and COL1, but not of bFGF in hPDL cells. The increased effect of iloprost was abolished by IP receptor antagonist pretreatment. Iloprost might be a promising agent in dentin-pulp regeneration.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Sociodemographic and psychopathological correlates of food addiction as well as associations with quality (QoL) domains were also investigated. Methods This cross-sectional study obtained data from a Brazilian anonymous web-based research platform (N = 7639; 71.3% females). Participants provided sociodemographic data and completed the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0, PHQ-9, hypomania checklist (HCL-32), Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, AUDIT, modified Skin picking-Stanford questionnaire, Minnesota impulsive disorders interview, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised inventory (SCL-90R), early trauma inventory self report-short form, and the WHO Quality of Life instrument-Abbreviated version (WHOQOL-Bref). Associations were adjusted to potential confounders through multivariable models. Results The prevalence of food addiction was 4.32% (95%CI: 3.89–4.80%), and was more common among females. Food addiction was associated with a positive screen for a major depressive episode (OR = 4.41; 95%CI: 3.46–5.62), bipolar spectrum disorder (OR = 1.98; 95%CI: 1.43–2.75), and skin picking disorder (OR = 2.02; 95%CI: 1.31–3.09). Food addiction was also independently associated with exposure to early life psychological and sexual abuse (P = 0.008) as well as with reduced physical, psychological, social, and environment QoL (all P < 0.001). Conclusions Food addiction may be common in low and middle-income countries, though possibly less prevalent than in the US. Food addiction was associated with co-occurring mood disorders and skin picking disorder as well as with early life psychological and sexual abuse. Finally, food addiction was independently associated with broad reductions in QoL. Public health efforts towards the early recognition and management of food addiction are warranted.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Exposure to cold air may impair ciliary beat frequency. While saline nasal irrigation improves in ciliary beat activity, there is no evidence supporting the use of heated saline irrigation in treating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Objective: To compare the effects of heated saline to room-temperature saline nasal irrigation on mucociliary clearance in chronic rhinosinusitis patients. Methods: Adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were randomized into two groups receiving either heated saline or room-temperature saline nasal irrigation. Healthy subjects were included as control. Saccharin transit time was measured before and after nasal irrigation. Nasal patency was assessed by peak nasal inspiratory flow, anterior rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, nasal obstruction score, and breathe-comfort score. Any adverse events were reported. Results: Twenty-three patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nine healthy subjects were enrolled. Saccharin transit time was decreased after nasal irrigation in both heated saline subgroup (baseline 12.3 ± 4.5 min vs. postirrigation 8.4 ± 4.9 min, p = 0.05) and room-temperature subgroup (baseline 12.8 ± 5.0 min vs. postirrigation 8.9 ± 4.2 min, p = 0.01). The saccharin transit time improvement was not different between heated saline (3.8 ± 6.2 min) and room-temperature saline (3.8 ± 4.0 min), p = 0.13. Postheated saline irrigation saccharin transit time of chronic rhinosinusitis patients (8.4 ± 4.9 min) was not different to healthy subjects (9.2 ± 3.7 min), p = 0.69. Nasal patency was not different between groups. There was no adverse event reported. Conclusion: Nasal saline irrigation is beneficial to patients with chronic rhinosinusitis on mucociliary improvement.

The selected materials must have low thermal expansion coefficient, high strength, low water absorption and high thermal shock resistance, reasonable in cost and easy to be produced. Cordierite and spodumene composite has been interested for ceramic cookware due to their fitted properties. In previous work, study in the cordierite-spodumene composite with low thermal expansion coefficient of 2.60 x 10-6 /oC when sintered at 1250oC with a ratio of spodumene 60 wt% and cordierite 40 wt% can withstand the pot shape samples. However, the sample showed relatively high water absorption and low strength which was not appropriate for using in this application. In this research, mullite is added in the formula to improve strength and densification of ceramic composites. Spodumene, ball clay, calcined talc and calcined alumina are used as starting raw materials and formed by slip casting. All samples are sintered in a temperature range from 1250-1275oC in an electric furnace. Water absorption and bulk density were tested by Archimedes method, modulus of rupture was tested by the three-point bending method, microstructure were investigated by SEM and the coefficient of thermal expansion was measured by dilatometer.

Inhibition of amyloid aggregation using natural products is proposed as a new strategy to prohibit the development of amyloid diseases. Herein, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), a natural anthocyanin with multiple biological activities, against insulin amyloid fibrillation. The results showed that increased insulin concentration resulted in faster growth and higher amounts of insulin fibrils. C3R (10.6–170 μM) concentration dependently decreased insulin fibril growth and increased the duration of lag time of insulin fibril formation. Moreover, C3R directly decreased the secondary structure transition from α-helix to β-sheet structure. C3R (0.31–5 μM) attenuated insulin fibrils-induced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, C3R reduced insulin fibrils-induced erythrocyte membrane disruption through the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The findings also suggest that C3R reduced fibrils-induced membrane lipid peroxidation by maintaining the catalase activity and oxidized/reduced glutathione content (GSH/GSSH) in erythrocytes. These findings suggest that C3R may serve as a potential inhibitory agent against amyloid fibril formation and insulin fibrils-induced oxidative hemolysis.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Postpartum depression is predicted by end of term prenatal depressive symptoms whilst a lifetime history of mood disorders appears to increase the risk for both prenatal and postpartum depression. This review provides a critical appraisal of available evidence linking IO&NS pathways to prenatal and postpartum depression. The electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus were sources for this narrative review focusing on keywords, including perinatal depression, (auto)immune, inflammation, oxidative, nitric oxide, nitrosative, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), kynurenine, leaky gut and microbiome. Prenatal depressive symptoms are associated with exaggerated pregnancy-specific changes in IO&NS pathways, including increased C-reactive protein, advanced oxidation protein products and nitric oxide metabolites, lowered antioxidant levels, such as zinc, as well as lowered regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses. The latter pathways coupled with lowered levels of endogenous anti-inflammatory compounds, including ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, may also underpin the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Although increased bacterial translocation, lipid peroxidation and TRYCAT pathway activation play a role in mood disorders, similar changes do not appear to be relevant in perinatal depression. Some IO&NS biomarker characteristics of mood disorders are found in prenatal depression indicating that these pathways partly contribute to the association of a lifetime history of mood disorders and perinatal depression. However, available evidence suggests that some IO&NS pathways differ significantly between perinatal depression and mood disorders in general. This review provides a new IO&NS model of prenatal and postpartum depression.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; depression, pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

Sixty affective warning pictorials were designed and categorized into three affective state groups equally as positive, neutral, and negative. Forty Thai male participants participated in this study for affective warning pictorials’ validation. Participants were asked with agreement to attend the affective manipulation by watching pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to adjust participants’ affective state as neutral state before starting the experiment. The Self-Assessment Manikin was used to assess valence and arousal of participants after seeing each of sixty affective warning pictorials. The result showed that affective warning pictorials were able to evoke specific affective state of warning pictorials to participants such as positive, neutral, and negative state. Affective warning pictorials from this research can be implemented as the alcohol container labels.

Here, we identified and characterized the alanine dehydrogenase gene in Aphanothece halophytica (ApalaDH) that is involved in alanine assimilation/dissimilation. Functional analysis revealed that ApalaDH encodes a bifunctional protein catalyzing the reversible reaction of pyruvate to l-alanine via its pyruvate reductive aminase (PvRA) activity, the reaction of l-alanine to pyruvate via its alanine oxidative dehydrogenase activity, and the non-reversible reaction of glyoxylate to glycine via its glyoxylate reductive aminase (GxRA) activity. Kinetic analysis showed the lowest affinity for pyruvate followed by l-alanine and glyoxylate with a Km of 0.22 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.04, and 1.91 ± 0.43 mM, respectively. ApalaDH expression was upregulated by salt. Only PvRA and GxRA activities were detected in vivo and both activities increased about 1.2- and 2.7-fold upon salt stress. These features implicate that the assimilatory/dissimilatory roles of ApAlaDH are not only selective for l-alanine and pyruvate, but also, upon salt stress, can catabolize glyoxylate to generate glycine.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. Methods: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. Results: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented.

The Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Neuroprogressive Diseases: Emerging Pathophysiological Role and Translational Implications,"Morris G., Puri B.K., Walder K., Berk M., Stubbs B., Maes M., Carvalho A.F.",2018-12-01,"Animals, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Humans, Mitochondria, Mitochondrial Dynamics, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Translational Medical Research, Unfolded Protein Response, Endoplasmic reticulum stress, Molecular neurobiology, Mood disorders, Neurodegeneration, Neuroprogression, Unfolded protein response","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main cellular organelle involved in protein synthesis, assembly and secretion. Accumulating evidence shows that across several neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases, ER stress ensues, which is accompanied by over-activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although the UPR could initially serve adaptive purposes in conditions associated with higher cellular demands and after exposure to a range of pathophysiological insults, over time the UPR may become detrimental, thus contributing to neuroprogression. Herein, we propose that immune-inflammatory, neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative, as well as mitochondrial pathways may reciprocally interact with aberrations in UPR pathways. Furthermore, ER stress may contribute to a deregulation in calcium homoeostasis. The common denominator of these pathways is a decrease in neuronal resilience, synaptic dysfunction and even cell death. This review also discusses how mechanisms related to ER stress could be explored as a source for novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases. The design of randomised controlled trials testing compounds that target aberrant UPR-related pathways within the emerging framework of precision psychiatry is warranted.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Development of paper-based analytical devices for minimizing the viscosity effect in human saliva,"Noiphung J., Nguyen M.P., Punyadeera C., Wan Y., Laiwattanapaisal W., Henry C.S.",2018-01-01,"Australia, Chemistry Techniques, Analytical, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Nitrites, Paper, Saliva, Sensitivity and Specificity, Specimen Handling, Viscosity, Nitrite, Oral cancer biomarkers, Paper-based analytical devices, PH testing, Saliva analysis, Viscosity","Rationale: Saliva as a sample matrix is rapidly gaining interest for disease diagnosis and point-of-care assays because it is easy to collect (non-invasive) and contains many health-related biomarkers. However, saliva poses particular problems relative to more common urine and blood matrices, which includes low analyte concentrations, lack of understanding of biomolecule transportation and inherent viscosity variability in human samples. While several studies have sought to improve assay sensitivity, few have addressed sample viscosity specifically. The goal of this study is to minimize the effect of sample viscosity on paper-based analytical devices (PADs) for the measurement of pH and nitrite in human saliva. Methods: PADs were used to measure salivary pH from 5.0 to 10.0 with a universal indicator consisting of chlorophenol red, phenol red and phenolphthalein. Nitrite determination was performed using the Griess reaction. Artificial saliva with viscosity values between 1.54 and 5.10 mPa·s was tested on the proposed PAD. To ensure the proposed PADs can be tailored for use in-field analysis, the devices were shipped to Australia and tested with human specimens. Results: Initial experiments showed that viscosity had a significant impact on the calibration curve for nitrite; however, a more consistent curve could be generated when buffer was added after the sample, irrespective of sample viscosity. The linear range for nitrite detection was 0.1 to 2.4 mg/dL using the improved method. The nitrite measurement in artificial saliva also showed a good correlation with the standard spectrophotometry method (p=0.8484, paired sample t-test, n=20). Measured pH values from samples with varying viscosities correlated well with the results from our pH meter. Conclusions: The inherent variation of salivary viscosity that impacts nitrite and pH results can be addressed using a simple washing step on the PAD without the need for complex procedures.","medical, pharmacology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)"

Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: A tertiary-care university hospital. Participants: Adult patients undergoing an elective thoracotomy between June 2011 and February 2015. Interventions: Patients were allocated randomly into the parecoxib group (n = 80) and the control group (n = 80). In the parecoxib group, 40 mg of parecoxib was diluted into 2 mL and given intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and then every 12 hours postoperatively for 48 hours. In the control group, 2 mL of normal saline was given to the patients at the same intervals. Measurements and Main Results: A numerical rating scale was used to assess the intensity of ISP at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after surgery. Intravenous morphine (0.05 mg/kg) was used as the rescue medication for ISP during the 96-hour period. Baseline characteristics of patients in both groups were comparable. Patients in the parecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of ISP, both overall (42.5% v 62.0%, p = 0.014) and of moderate-to-severe ISP when compared with the control group (26.2% v 49.4%, p = 0.003). Parecoxib reduced the risk of ISP by a statistically significant 32% (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.93, p = 0.016). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse effects between the groups. Conclusions: Intravenous parecoxib significantly can reduce the incidence and severity of ISP after thoracotomy.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

In this article, the alginate/chitosan beads were fabricated by spray drying and external gelation techniques using different processes: (1) dropping a sodium alginate solution into a CaCl2 solution containing chitosan and (2) incubating calcium alginate beads in a solution of chitosan. These beads were introduced as microcarrier to enhance the stability and bioavailability of anthocyanin. We showed that the beads fabricated by different processes could encapsulate the anthocyanin at different amounts. All alginate/chitosan beads had high swelling percentage under pH 6 and 7.4 but not completely swell at pH 1 and 4. The alginate/chitosan beads degraded in a simulated gastric fluid condition (SGF) in the faster rate than that in a simulated intestinal fluid condition (SIF). Under SGF condition, the release of anthocyanin seemed to be governed by electrostatic interaction while the release of anthocyanin under SIF condition may be manipulated by the beads’ degradation. Herein, we showed that the beads produced by incubating calcium alginate beads in 0.05% chitosan solution were the most appropriate microcarriers for encapsulation of mulberry-extracted anthocyanin which showed high encapsulation efficiency and had resistance to gastric condition.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, medical, engineering, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomedical Engineering, Pharmaceutical Science"

The TiO2 supports were commercially available pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 21 and 43 nm with specific surface area 63 and 10 m2/g, respectively), solvothermal-synthesized pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 15 nm, 69 m2/g), P-25 TiO2 (mixed anatase/rutile phase, 46 m2/g), and rutile TiO2 (dXRD 40 nm, 6 m2/g). In order to obtain high catalytic activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, a combination of highly dispersed vanadium oxides and a strong interaction of V-Ti species were found to be necessary. As revealed by the XPS, Raman, and O2-TPD results, the interaction between active V component and TiO2 support was shown by the presence of partially reduced V-Ti species. Due to the strong interaction between V and TiO2 support, the active V component, which was not fully oxidized, led to more oxygen vacancies being formed and facilitated a rapid catalyst regeneration from V4+ to V5+ (re-oxidation). Hence, the capability of the catalysts for H2S removal was greatly enhanced. Among them, the V2O5 supported on anatase TiO2 with dXRD 21 nm exhibited the best catalyst performances using the feed molar ratio (O2/H2S) of 0.5.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

For an N-class problem, in the worst case the proposed method requires only N +1 binary classifiers to obtain the classification result as same as in the traditional framework. Our proposed method will properly create the necessary set of One-Versus-One (OVO) classifiers corresponding to OVA data inseparabilities in advance. On the other hand, it will not needlessly construct an OVO classifier if the data separability between that pair of classes is good enough. This is more practical than the traditional A&O technique that suggests to train OVO classifiers on-demand which consumes time while the system is in use. Especially in same cases of real-time applications, it may be very important to keep high speed response and maintain highly accurate results. Experimental results show that the proposed technique gives significantly better performance compared to the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques, while providing comparable accuracy compared to the OVO method. Moreover, a required number of binary classifiers in our proposed method is considerably smaller than in the OVO approach as similar as in the OVA and the traditional A&O techniques.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, sociology","Computer Networks and Communications, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Information Systems and Management, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Public Administration"

ES is one of the most important energies among the interaction energies in a protein. It is determined from the RES, the residues which mainly contribute to stabilize the structure of each subunit, and the binding energy between two subunits can be estimated. The RES of all residues in subunit A (Sub A) and subunit B (Sub B) were attractive forces, even though the residues contain net negative or positive charges. This reveals that the ES energies of any of the residues can contribute to stabilize the protein structure.

There was a significant correlation between HOMA2IR with both IFN-γ (ρ=0.289, p<0.05) and TGF-β1 (ρ=0.364, p<0.05). Conclusion: The present study further confirms that MDD is accompanied by activation of the immune system with significant elevations in the levels of four cytokines. These results indicate stimulation of the immune system and increased IR and modulation of IR by increased cytokine levels in MDD. These findings show that immune activation and associated IR are a new drug target in depression.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"

Remediation of this problem using microorganisms has been widely researched to find a sustainable solution. Obligate halophilic fungi comprising Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus gracilis, Aspergillus penicillioides (sp. 1), Aspergillus penicillioides (sp. 2), Aspergillus restrictus and Sterigmatomyces halophilus were used for the biosorption of cadmium, copper, ferrous, manganese, lead and zinc. The metals were supplemented as salts in potato dextrose broth for the growth of obligate halophilic fungi and incubated for 14 days. The supernatant and biomass were obtained by the acid digestion method. The biosorption was screened by atomic absorption spectroscopy. All tested fungi showed moderate to high adsorption of heavy metals, amongst which A. flavus and S. halophilus showed the best average adsorption of all heavy metals studied, with an average of 86 and 83%, respectively. On average, Fe and Zn are best removed from the liquid media of obligate halophilic fungi, with an average of 85 and 84%, respectively. This pioneering study of biosorption by obligate halophilic fungi using inexpensive media in stagnant conditions provides a cost-effective environmental solution for the removal of heavy metals.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, heavy metals, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, the 36 species of the Felidae family have species- and individual-specific reproductive cycles and respond differently to exogenous hormones. Monitoring the ovarian cycle of wild felids can improve their natural breeding and maximize their reproductive success. Moreover, fundamental knowledge on the hormonal patterns of each feline species offers the opportunity to develop ARTs, particularly in threatened and endangered species. Currently, several ovarian activity control regimens have been established with higher precision for artificial insemination, oocyte aspiration and embryo transfer. In this review, we highlight the efforts made in ovarian control and its outcomes showing promising applications to enhance wild felid conservation. Currently, ovarian monitoring has been studied in two-thirds of the feline species with thorough reports on 16 species only. To increase the genetic diversity of shrinking populations of these wild felids there still is a critical need for better knowledge of feline reproductive biology. Sustained successes will be achieved by controlling several factors influencing pregnancy successes by natural and assisted breeding.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

The present work, for the first time, demonstrates preparation of one pot triple network hydrogel of chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (HA-triazole/CS-Cu(II) gel), formed by triazole linkage, metal-coordination, and CS-HA polyion complexation. The salt containing water system favors polyion complex formation of CS and HA without precipitation. HA functionalized with alkyne and azide groups in aqueous EDC/NHS allows crosslinking of HA via triazole linkage using Cu(I) azide-alkyne Click chemistry (CuAAC). The required Cu(I) catalyst is generated from Cu(II) in the CS-Cu complex upon addition of sodium ascorbate. The CS/NHS system leads to the solubilization of CS, thus enabling ionic gelation. The mechanical properties and morphologies can be controlled by simply varying the CS-HA mole ratios. In addition, the CS-HA triple-network (TN) hydrogels show biocompatibility based on studies with chondrocyte cells.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The addition of steam less than 10% was found to enhance both selectivities for hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a significant reduction of power consumptions. The highest hydrogen selectivity and yield with the lowest power consumptions were achieved at a steam content of 10 mol%, a total feed flow rate of 100 cm3/min (corresponding to a very short residence time of 1.37 s), an applied voltage of 13.5 kV and an input frequency of 300 Hz. Under these optimum conditions, the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions to produce hydrogen were dominant with the minimum activities of all undesired reactions of cracking and coupling. Both of the short residence time (1.37 s) with a low bulk temperature (lower than 200°C) in the plasma zone under atmospheric pressure, indicate that the studied plasma reactor (gliding arc system) is superior to conventional catalytic reactors for reforming of natural gas.","geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Femtocell clustering and modeling an optimum number of ABS (OPNA) are, however, two major challenges to reuse frequency in femtocells deployed in buildings using ABS-based eICIC. In this paper, we address these challenges by exploiting the high external wall penetration loss of any buildings and in-between distance of neighboring buildings, and propose a femtocell clustering approach by considering all femtocells in any buildings as a femtocell cluster to avoid an additional computational complexity from clustering. We develop a frequency reuse and scheduling algorithm (FRSA) for an arbitrary number of ABSs for a multi-tier network, which consists of in-building femtocells and outdoor picocells in the coverage of an urban macrocell. We then propose a model for estimating the OPNA and derive an OPNA per femtocell cluster basis under two schemes, namely adaptive OPNA and non-adaptive OPNA, in order to vary the number of ABSs imposed on femtocells within a building dynamically based on the presence of indoor macrocell users within the building to avoid cross-tier interference with femtocells. An optimization algorithm for OPNA schemes is developed, and its implementation aspects are discussed. The impact of varying the number of ABSs and femtocells per building on the throughput performance of FRSA is analyzed through an extensive system-level simulation, and the capacity outperformance of the adaptive over the non-adaptive OPNA scheme is shown. Finally, a schematic of the scheduler implementation for FRSA is developed, and the capacity outperformance of FRSA over a number of existing works is shown. © 2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

This paper proposes a systematic procedure to derive an equivalent carrier-based modulation for an arbitrary space-vector modulation by decomposition of voltage commands and addition of generalized zero voltages. The proposed procedure is based on two key mathematical concepts 1) the barycentric coordinates for space-vector calculation and 2) the generalized dipolar modulation concept.

The influence of operating condition, e.g., temperature and pressure of reformer, supercritical water to glycerol (S/G) molar ratio, and calcium oxide to glycerol (CaO/G) molar ratio was examined. Then, the electrical performance of each integrated process was considered with respect to the SOFC conditions comprising temperature, pressure, and current density. The simulation results revealed that both processes have same favourable conditions for temperature and pressure operated at 800 °C and 240 atm, respectively. The suitable S/G and CaO/G molar ratios for in situ process are 10 and 2 whereas those for ex situ process are 20 and 1.

The interactions between GO sheet and fluorophore directly affect the fluorescence quenching efficiency of GO. To understand these interactions, methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB) and sulforhodamine B (SRhB) were used as model fluorophores at various pH values in aqueous buffer solutions. The synthesized GO was characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, zeta potential measurement and particle size measurement. The interactions between GO and dyes were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence quenching efficiency of GO to each dye is differently affected by the pH attributed to electrostatic interaction, π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding. While electrostatic interaction is the most important interaction for GO–MB and GO–RhB, the π–π stacking also plays an important role for GO–SRhB system. The temperature dependence of the quenching efficiency suggests a static quenching mechanism and the decrease of the quenching efficiency with the reducing GO size is probably due to a lower number of sp2 domains in the GO sheets.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The influence of several operating parameters including SCWG temperature, SCWG pressure, reforming temperature, reforming pressure and feed concentration on the syngas composition and process efficiency was investigated. In addition, the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations have been carried out based on Gibbs free energy minimization by using Aspen Plus. The results showed that the higher H2 production could be obtained at higher SCWG temperature, the H2 concentration increased from 5.40% at 400 °C to 38.95% at 600 °C. The lower feed concentration was found to be favorable for achieving hydrogen-rich gas. However, pressure of SCWG had insignificant effect on the syngas composition. The addition of reformer to the SCWG system enhanced H2 yield by converting high methane content in the syngas into H2. The modified SCWG enhanced the productivity of syngas to 151.12 kg/100kgfeed compared to 120.61 kg/100kgfeed of the conventional SCWG system. Furthermore, H2 yield and system efficiency increased significantly from 1.81 kg/100kgfeed and 9.18% to 8.91 kg/100kgfeed, and 45.09%, respectively, after the modification.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Resulting waves ensure the pose and, moreover, effort tracking of the teleoperation system under appropriate conditions. Passivity of the system is guaranteed by the nonnegative power dissipation constraint on the corrective wave signals, or by the help of dissipative elements in the controllers.

Moreover, the factors which affect adsorption process of heavy metals on geopolymer materials were investigated. The kaolin as used in this research was from Thailand. The metakaolin geopolymer was synthesized by mixed raw materials with an alkaline solution. The metakaolin geopolymer was washed and sieved through 100 mesh. The produced metakaolin geopolymer powder was used as an adsorbent. The XRD results showed a highly amorphous structure in obtained metakaolin geopolymer. Moreover, the BET surface area of metakaolin and geopolymer particles were 9.83 m2/g and 20.36 m2/g, respectively. The parameters of adsorbent amount, initial pH, time of shaking, temperature and initial metal ions concentration on the removal potential of geopolymer were studied. In addition, the multi-and mono-cations solution were demonstrated to compare the efficiency of each heavy metal ions. The results showed that the amount of Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ ions adsorbed onto metakaolin geopolymer increased with an increasing contact time, pH, temperature and amount of geopolymer. It is concluded that Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+ ions in aqueous solution are efficiently removed by metakaolin geopolymer which could be applied as a low cost and good alternative for wastewater treatment.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The data is gathered from the activity and the environmental factors in the cage by none invasive method. The model separated observed data into two main classes: the upper-level data and the lower-level data. The upper-level data represents the environment data such as temperature, humidity, and light density. Moreover, the landscape of the captivity area also takes into consideration. On the other hand, the lower-level represents the location of the animal of interested in the captivity area. The working strategy of this work is to cluster the each type of data and link them together by a stochastic approach. Both layers of data will be handled independently in clustering algorithm and determine probabilistic of state transaction. From the data observed from the sensor, the Probabilistic Automaton (PA) function is constructed. It is a function of producing the next stage based on the previous behavior states. The initial state of the framework is in the lower-level data (the current location of the animal). Then, the PA using the current lower stage and the current upper stage generates the next stage, location of the animal.

By utilizing field work interviews, case study methods and reviews of the literatures, a model of social management innovation in this article indicates three important elements as inputs, throughputs and outputs. The inputs comprise of human activities, times and places. The throughputs require four components including big data, super software, highly qualified computers and artificial intelligence to process the interface between these digital technologies and the past. The outputs are happy societal communities resulting from reduced crime rates, corrective information and an intelligent city.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, engineering, sociology, decision sciences","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Signal Processing, Information Systems and Management, Management Science and Operations Research"

In general, probiotic supplements could enhance recovery and protect piglets against enteric pathogens. Seven local lactic acid bacteria (LAB), (Ent. faecium 79N and 40N, Lact. plantarum 22F, 25F and 31F, Ped. acidilactici 72N and Ped. pentosaceus 77F) from pig feces were well-characterized as high potential probiotics. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) and live LAB were evaluated for antiviral activities by co-incubation on Vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of PEDV isolated from pigs in Thailand. Cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence. At 1:16, CFS dilution (pH 6.3–6.8) showed no cytotoxicity in Vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays. The diluted CFS of all Lact. plantarum showed the antiviral effect against PEDV; however, the same antiviral effect could not be observed in Ent. faecium and Pediococcus strains. In competitive experiment, only live Lact. plantarum 25F and Ped. pentosaceus 77F showed CPE reduction in the viral infected cells to <50% observed field area. This study concluded that the CFS of all tested lactobacilli, and live Lact. plantarum (22F and 25F) and Pediococcus strains 72N and 77F could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of PEDV from pigs in Thailand on the target Vero cells.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology"

With the addition of nickel (Ni), the phase composition of alloys changes from α phase to α phase + hexagonal close packed (hcp) C14 Laves-phase. The thickness of lamellar α phase decreases with increasing Ni content. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that C14 Laves-phase is formed on the boundary. The Zr-Ti-3wt.%Ni alloys exhibits better ultimate compressive strength and compressive plasticity (1715 MPa and 9.70%) than that of Zr-Ti alloys (1598 MPa and 12.40%). The decrease of the average thickness of the lamellar α-phases (from 0.183 μm to 0.065 μm) leads to the improvement of the strength of the alloy. Additionally, the solid solution strengthening and the second phase strengthening are also important reasons for the improvement of the strength.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

In numerical models, the soil slope was modeled as volume elements with the hardening soil material. Interface elements were used at the bottom plane to simulate the low interface friction plane and at the side support to simulate fully rough surface for the models with side supports. Stage analyses in numerical models were performed following excavation processes in physical models until failure. The effects of the side support and the slope length to increase the stability of undercut slopes were considered. Failure widths, failure mechanisms, and stress distributions associated with slope angles and boundary conditions of side support were discussed and compared.",engineering,Civil and Structural Engineering

The in-process prediction model of tool wear is developed during the CNC turning process. The relations of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the depth of cut, the decomposed cutting forces, and the tool wear are investigated. The Daubechies wavelet transform is used to differentiate the tool wear signals from the noise and broken chip signals. The decomposed cutting force ratio is utilized to eliminate the effects of cutting conditions by taking ratio of the average variances of the decomposed feed force to that of decomposed main force on the fifth level of wavelet transform. The tool wear prediction model consists of the decomposed cutting force ratio, the cutting speed, the depth of cut, and the feed rate, which is developed based on the exponential function. The new cutting tests are performed to ensure the reliability of the tool wear prediction model. The experimental results showed that as the cutting speed, the feed rate, and the depth of cut increase, the main cutting force also increases which affects in the escalating amount of tool wear. It has been proved that the proposed system can be used to separate the chip formation signals and predict the tool wear by utilizing wavelet transform even though the cutting conditions are changed.","engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Software, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Methods Eighteen artificial caries slabs were created from the proximal surfaces of nine chemically demineralized premolars. The slabs were scanned by Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) to determine the baseline mineral density of the initial lesions and randomly allocated into 2 groups. The test group was applied with 38% SDF in adjunct to fluoride toothpaste and the control group was treated with fluoride toothpaste alone. The specimens underwent bacterial pH-cycling for 5 d and were re-evaluated using Micro-CT. The pre-treatment and post-treatment mineral densities were plotted and the areas under the curves were used to calculate the remineralization percentage of both groups. Results Mineral density significantly increased in both groups after pH-cycling (p < 0.05) although to different depths (control group = 260 μm, test group = 300 μm). The test group demonstrated a significantly higher mineral density to a depth of 120 μm and higher remineralization percentage (p < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion The adjunctive use of 38% SDF enhances the remineralization of initial carious lesions based on mineral density, depth, and remineralization percentage compared with the use of 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste alone. SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste to remineralize incipient caries lesions on smooth tooth surfaces. Clinical significance In non-compliant patients, the application of 38% SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste, to remineralize incipient caries lesions of permanent teeth where esthetics is not a concern.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Polyethyleneimine (PEI) in ethanol with initial concentration of 0.2 g l-1 and 1 mol dm-3 lithium nitrate (LiNO3) were prepared to improve the adsorption capacity. In the impregnation process, various adsorbents, i.e., GAC, CVD/GAC and zeolite A were placed in a vial containing 0.2 g l-1 of PEI and 1 mol dm-3 of LiNO3 solution, at different ratios of adsorbent and various solutions of 30%W/W. The adsorbents (GAC, PEI/CVD/GAC:PEI/GAC, LiNO3/CVD/GAC:LiNO3/ GAC, zeolite 5A, PEI/zeolite 5A and LiNO3/zeolite 5A) were tested by using the synthetic biogas (45% CO2, 10% N2, 45% CH4 and 105 mg dm-3 of H2S). The performance of CO2 and H2S adsorption results have shown that PEI/CVD/GAC is the best adsorbent for low concentration of H2S and LiNO3/5A is the best adsorbent for CO2 adsorption.

Integrated genome-wide Alu methylation and transcriptome profiling analyses reveal novel epigenetic regulatory networks associated with autism spectrum disorder,"Saeliw T., Tangsuwansri C., Thongkorn S., Chonchaiya W., Suphapeetiporn K., Mutirangura A., Tencomnao T., Hu V.W., Sarachana T.",2018-04-16,"Alu Elements, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Case-Control Studies, Cells, Cultured, DNA Methylation, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genome, Human, Humans, Male, Transcriptome, Alu elements, Autism spectrum disorder, DNA methylation, Epigenetic regulation, Gene expression profiles, Lymphoblastoid cell lines, Neuroinflammation, Retrotransposon, Sex bias, Subgrouping","Background: Alu elements are a group of repetitive elements that can influence gene expression through CpG residues and transcription factor binding. Altered gene expression and methylation profiles have been reported in various tissues and cell lines from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the role of Alu elements in ASD remains unclear. We thus investigated whether Alu elements are associated with altered gene expression profiles in ASD. Methods: We obtained five blood-based gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and human Alu-inserted gene lists from the TranspoGene database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASD were identified from each study and overlapped with the human Alu-inserted genes. The biological functions and networks of Alu-inserted DEGs were then predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). A combined bisulfite restriction analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 36 ASD and 20 sex- and age-matched unaffected individuals was performed to assess the global DNA methylation levels within Alu elements, and the Alu expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: In ASD blood or blood-derived cells, 320 Alu-inserted genes were reproducibly differentially expressed. Biological function and pathway analysis showed that these genes were significantly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological functions involved in ASD etiology. Interestingly, estrogen receptor and androgen signaling pathways implicated in the sex bias of ASD, as well as IL-6 signaling and neuroinflammation signaling pathways, were also highlighted. Alu methylation was not significantly different between the ASD and sex- and age-matched control groups. However, significantly altered Alu methylation patterns were observed in ASD cases sub-grouped based on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised scores compared with matched controls. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Alu expression also showed significant differences between ASD subgroups. Interestingly, Alu expression was correlated with methylation status in one phenotypic ASD subgroup. Conclusion: Alu methylation and expression were altered in LCLs from ASD subgroups. Our findings highlight the association of Alu elements with gene dysregulation in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. Moreover, the classification of ASD individuals into subgroups based on phenotypes may be beneficial and could provide insights into the still unknown etiology and the underlying mechanisms of ASD.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Molecular Biology, Developmental Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The safety and immunogenicity profile of the WHO-approved two-site intradermal Thai Red Cross regimen (modified TRC-ID regimen; 2–2-2–0-2) with a new chromatographically purified Vero-cell rabies vaccine (CPRV) is lacking. Area covered: We studied the safety and immunogenicity of the TRC-ID regimen with a new CPRV in non-immunized Thai children with possible or proven rabies exposure. Thirty-nine seronegative patients (age range 2–14 years) with rabies exposure (WHO categories II or III) received two 0.1-mL intradermal doses of CPRV at both deltoid regions on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Twenty-five patients (64.1%) received rabies immunoglobulin due to having rabies exposure, according to WHO category III. All serum samples were tested for rabies neutralizing antibody (Nab) by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) before vaccination, and on days 14 and 90 after vaccination. All patients had an adequate immune response (Nab titers ≥ 0.5 IU/mL) on days 14 and 90. No patients died of rabies infection. No serious adverse reactions were observed. Expert commentary: CPRV is economic, safe, and immunogenic if given as the modified TRC-ID regimen in children.","Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

One of the key antigens for malaria vaccines is the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the surface protein for erythrocyte invasion of the parasite. The gene encoding AMA-1 has been sequenced from populations of P. falciparum worldwide, but the haplotype diversity of the gene in P. falciparum populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Thailand, remains to be characterized. In the present study, the AMA-1 gene was PCR amplified and sequenced from the genomic DNA of 65 P. falciparum isolates from 5 endemic areas in Thailand. The nearly full-length 1,848 nucleotide sequence of AMA-1 was subjected to molecular analyses, including nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity and deduced amino acid sequence diversity and neutrality tests. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise population differentiation (Fst indices) were performed to infer the population structure. The analyses identified 60 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, predominately located in domain I of AMA-1. A total of 31 unique AMA-1 haplotypes were identified, which included 11 novel ones. The phylogenetic tree of the AMA-1 haplotypes revealed multiple clades of AMA-1, each of which contained parasites of multiple geographical origins, consistent with the Fst indices indicating genetic homogeneity or gene flow among geographically distinct populations of P. falciparum in Thailand’s borders with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. In summary, the study revealed novel haplotypes and population structure needed for the further advancement of AMA-1-based malaria vaccines in the GMS.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Herein, to realize improved photocatalytic activity, sodium-doped gC3N4 (Na-gC3N4) is prepared through a novel solid-state process based on the thermal polycondensation of urea in the presence of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. The proposed solid-state process is simple, requires no solvent, and provides a general route for rapid and large-scale synthesis of metal-doped gC3N4. The Na species exist in + 1 oxidation state and bind N atoms in the nitride ring of gC3N4. The photocatalytic activity improvement of gC3N4 for the mineralization of 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) under visible light is seen after the Na doping. The improved photocatalytic activity is due to increased absorption of light, increased separation of charge carriers, stronger oxidation ability of valance band holes, and increased specific surface area. The typical photocatalytic activity of 0.6 wt% Na-gC3N4 for the EE2 mineralization with an initial EE2 concentration of 1 mg/L and a catalyst concentration of 1 g/L is 95.7% within 2 h of visible light irradiation.

The electrical conductivity of the uPPP with a surfactant was higher than that without a surfactant due to the smaller particle size. From the doping, the electrical conductivity of the doped-PPP (dPPP) increased with the doping agent to monomer mole ratio up to 50:1.

Electrochemical immunoassay using open circuit potential detection labeled by platinum nanoparticles,"Charoenkitamorn K., Tue P.T., Kawai K., Chailapakul O., Takamura Y.",2018-02-03,"Electrochemical immunosensors, Human chorionic gonadotropins, Open circuit potential, Platinum nano-particles, Screen-printed carbon electrodes, Biosensing Techniques, Electrochemical Techniques, Electrodes, Gold, Humans, Immunoassay, Metal Nanoparticles, Platinum, Reproducibility of Results, Electrochemical immunosensor, Human chorionic gonadotropin, Open circuit potential, Platinum nanoparticles, Screen-printed carbon electrode","In this work, a simple electrochemical immunoassay based on platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) using open circuit potential (OCP) detection was developed. The detection of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) as a model analyte, was demonstrated by direct electrical detection of PtNPs in hydrazine solution using OCP measurement without any application of either potential or current to the system. Disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) were utilized for the development of our immunosensor, which required a sample volume as small as 2 µL. After preparation of a sandwich-type immunosystem, hydrazine solution was dropped on the electrode’s surface, which was followed immediately by electrical detection using OCP. The change of the OCP signal originated from electrocatalytic oxidation of the hydrazine on PtNPs. Under the optimal conditions of a pH of 6.0 and a hydrazine concentration of 1 mM, a detection limit of 0.28 ng mL−1 and a linearity of 0–10 ng mL−1 were obtained. The PtNP-based OCP method is a simpler electrochemical detection procedure than those obtained from other electrochemical methods and has an acceptable sensitivity and reproducibility. The simplicity of the detection procedure and the cost-effectiveness of the disposable SPCE illustrate the attractive benefits of this sensor. Moreover, it could be applied to a simplified and miniaturized diagnostic system with minimal user manipulation.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Agreement of Anterior Segment Parameters Obtained From Swept-Source Fourier-Domain and Time-Domain Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography,"Chansangpetch S., Nguyen A., Mora M., Badr M., He M., Porco T.C., Lin S.C.",2018-03-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anterior Chamber, Anterior Eye Segment, Female, Fourier Analysis, Glaucoma, Humans, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Iris, Lens, Crystalline, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Regression Analysis, Tomography, Optical Coherence, Trabecular Meshwork, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, CASIA2, swept-source fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography, time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography, Visante OCT","PURPOSE. To assess the interdevice agreement between swept-source Fourier-domain and time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). METHODS. Fifty-three eyes from 41 subjects underwent CASIA2 and Visante OCT imaging. One hundred eighty–degree axis images were measured with the built-in two-dimensional analysis software for the swept-source Fourier-domain AS-OCT (CASIA2) and a customized program for the time-domain AS-OCT (Visante OCT). In both devices, we examined the angle opening distance (AOD), trabecular iris space area (TISA), angle recess area (ARA), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), and lens vault (LV). Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation (ICC) were performed. Orthogonal linear regression assessed any proportional bias. RESULTS. ICC showed strong correlation for LV (0.925) and ACD (0.992) and moderate agreement for ACW (0.801). ICC suggested good agreement for all angle parameters (0.771– 0.878) except temporal AOD500 (0.743) and ARA750 (nasal 0.481; temporal 0.481). There was a proportional bias in nasal ARA750 (slope 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.95– 3.18), temporal ARA750 (slope 2.57, 95% CI: 2.04–3.40), and nasal TISA500 (slope 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12–1.54). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated in all measured parameters a minimal mean difference between the two devices ( 0.089 to 0.063); however, evidence of constant bias was found in nasal AOD250, nasal AOD500, nasal AOD750, nasal ARA750, temporal AOD500, temporal AOD750, temporal ARA750, and ACD. Among the parameters with constant biases, CASIA2 tends to give the larger numbers. CONCLUSIONS. Both devices had generally good agreement. However, there were proportional and constant biases in most angle parameters. Thus, it is not recommended that values be used interchangeably.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The HF voltage is injected into the rotor winding, and according to the concept of synchro, the rotor position can be simply extracted from the phase difference among the stator current and the rotor current regardless of machine and grid parameters. In addition, the proposed scheme is robust against the disturbance of HF stator voltage propagated from the grid. The vector phase-locked loop (PLL) technique is employed to calculate rotor position and rotor speed simultaneously, and the global stability of the PLL is mentioned. The tracking performances during acceleration and deceleration, and sinusoidal perturbation are investigated. The feasibility of the proposed concept is verified by the experimental results with a 4-kW DFIM drive. The performances of the drive system are evaluated in various operating conditions, e.g., subsynchronous, synchronous and supersynchronous speeds, voltage sag, and flying start.",engineering,"Control and Systems Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this work, alkaline yttrium fluoride doped by ytterbium and thulium (AYF4: 20%Yb3+, 0.5%Tm3+) were synthesized by molten salt method at 400 °C for 2 hours with different eutectic molten salts, i.e. NaNO3-KNO3, NaNO3-LiNO3, KNO3-LiNO3, and NaNO3-KNO3-LiNO3. Pure hexagonal NaYF4 microrods were successfully synthesized using eutectic NaNO3-KNO3 molten salt. Under 980 nm laser diode excitation, upconversion luminescence in both visible and ultraviolet region was clearly observed. On the other hand, for the use of other eutectic molten salts containing LiNO3, the mixed phases of tetragonal LiYF4 and orthorhombic Y6O5F8 were obtained. These powders emitted only visible light with 10 times lower intensity than the hexagonal NaYF4 microrods synthesized using NaNO3-KNO3.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Inadequate calcium intake increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Kit ligand/c-Kit signaling plays an important role in regulating bone homeostasis. Mice with c-Kit mutations are osteopenic. The present study aimed to investigate whether impairment of or reduction in c-Kit signaling affects bone turnover during calcium deprivation. Three-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (W/Wv) mice with c-Kit point mutation, KitW-sh/HNihrJaeBsmJ (Wsh/Wsh) mice with an inversion mutation in the regulatory elements upstream of the c-Kit promoter region, and their wild-type controls (WT) were fed either a normal (0.6% calcium) or a low calcium diet (0.02% calcium) for 3 weeks. μCT analysis indicated that both mutants fed normal calcium diet had significantly decreased cortical thickness and cancellous bone volume compared to WT. The low calcium diet resulted in a comparable reduction in cortical bone volume and cortical thickness in the W/Wv and Wsh/Wsh mice, and their corresponding controls. As expected, the low calcium diet induced cancellous bone loss in the W/Wv mice. In contrast, Wsh/Wsh cancellous bone did not respond to this diet. This c-Kit mutation prevented cancellous bone loss by antagonizing the low calcium diet-induced increase in osteoblast and osteoclast numbers in the Wsh/Wsh mice. Gene expression profiling showed that calcium deficiency increased Osx, Ocn, Alp, type I collagen, c-Fms, M-CSF, and RANKL/OPG mRNA expression in controls; however, the Wsh mutation suppressed these effects. Our findings indicate that although calcium restriction increased bone turnover, leading to osteopenia, the decreased c-Kit expression levels in the Wsh/Wsh mice prevented the low calcium diet-induced increase in cancellous bone turnover and bone loss but not the cortical bone loss.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Endocrinology"

PDMS strongly absorbs infrared (IR) light in the mid infrared region, which can be alleviated by using thin-film PDMS devices. However, IR detection with PDMS devices usually requires an IR-transparent backbone material. Here, we report a microfluidic system using a 160 m PDMS thin-film device (50-m path length) without a supporting backbone for IR spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC). The PDMS device is assembled with four layers: microchannel-supporting window, microchannel thin film, electrode-embedded thin film, and electrode-supporting window. In this work, mapping of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated under an IR microscope. An electrochemical reaction, occurring between the working and counter electrodes, was observed clearly. Moreover, the electron-transfer process of ferrocyanide oxidation was investigated from the IR absorbance spectrum. This mapping study demonstrates that the relationship between the electrochemical reactants and products partly agree well with the Nernst equation. Accordingly, PDMS thin-film devices have the capability for studying electrochemical reactions by using IR-SEC measurements with low sample consumption.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Chemistry (all)

Current study aims to investigate the effect of culture history on the biotransformation of EE2 by nitrifying sludge which was enriched under different ammonia loading rates in continuous flow reactors. Result showed that past growth condition largely affected not only the metabolic rate of NH3 oxidation but also EE2 cometabolism. Sludge previously acclimated with higher NH3 loads as well as sludge dominated with AOB belong to high growth cluster (Nitrosomonas europaea-Nitrosococcus mobilis) showed higher rate of EE2 biotransformation than those one being acclimated with lower NH3 loads because of its ability to provide more reducing power from NH3 oxidation. Moreover, the correlation between the degradation rates of NH3 and EE2 was higher in sludge being acclimated with higher load of NH3 in comparison with other sludge. Implication of the findings emphasized the role of volumetric NH3 loading rate in determining EE2 removal in wastewater treatment system.",environmental,Environmental Engineering

Patients and methods: In the first phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 64 physically active elderly senior housing residents. Data on sociodemographics, health status, Barthel Index (BI) of activities of daily living, and fall experiences were collected through face-to-face interviews. Data on balance scores were obtained from Time Up and Go (TUG) test and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). In the second phase, a qualitative study was conducted on 41 physically active elderly who had experienced falls. Data regarding perception on falls, fall preventions, and fall management, were gathered through in-depth interviews from November 2017 to December 2017. Results: The prevalence of falls among participants in senior housings was 64.1%. Univariate analysis found that a higher BI was associated with fall (P<0.004). Multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression showed that a higher BI (OR=6.00, 95% CI=1.24–29.10) together with ≥2 environmental hazards (OR=6.33, 95% CI=1.24–32.29) were associated with fall. The result from content analysis indicated that the elderly were aware that they were at risk of fall. In addition, the elderly also perceived that fall could be avoided even though they did not know how to prevent it. Conclusion: The prevalence of fall among physically active elderly in senior housings was relatively high. A higher BI scale and having ≥2 environmental hazards were associated risk factors of falls. Although the elderly perceived that fall could be avoided, they did not know how to prevent it. The intervention that focuses on environmental modification, balancing enchantment, and education on fall prevention is highly required.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology

Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei)'s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. Methods: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January-December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). Conclusions: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

We studied a population of macaques on Koram Island, Thailand, and examined model-based biases during interactions by unskilled individuals with tool-using group members. We first compared the prevalence of interactions (watching, obtaining food, object exploration) and proximity to tool users during interactions, in developing individuals (infants, juveniles) versus mature non-learners (adolescents, adults), to provide evidence that developing individuals are actively seeking information about tool use from social partners. All infants and juveniles, but only 49% of mature individuals carried out interacted with tool users. Macaques predominantly obtained food by scrounging or stealing, suggesting maximizing scrounging opportunities motivates interactions with tool users. However, while interactions by adults was limited to obtaining food, young macaques and particularly infants also watched tool users and explored objects, indicating additional interest in tool use itself. We then ran matrix correlations to identify interaction biases, and what attributes of tool users influenced these. Biases correlated with social affiliation, but macaques also preferentially targeted tool users that potentially increase scrounging and learning opportunities. Results suggest that social structure may constrain social learning, but the motivation to bias interactions towards tool users to maximize feeding opportunities may also socially modulate learning by facilitating close proximity to better tool users, and further interest in tool-use actions and materials, especially during development.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, psychology","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology"

The interspersed method is commonly carried out by spot-replacing old timber sleepers with new concrete sleepers. Although this interspersed approach provides a short-term solution, such method has a negative effect on the long-term performance of railway tracks. It is evident that the performance of interspersed tracks can quickly deteriorate after some years. As a result, this paper is the first to evaluate dynamic responses of the interspersed track caused by a moving train load in order to understand the root cause of swift track deterioration. Interspersed track models in three-dimensional space have been developed using a finite element package, STRAND7. The model was validated earlier with experimental results. Parametric studies have been conducted to evaluate dynamic responses of the interspersed railway tracks, including dynamic displacement, frontal uplift, rear uplift and accelerations of rail over sleeper, rail at midspan, sleeper at rail seat, and sleeper at midspan. Dynamic amplification phenomena are highlighted as they convey a new insight into dynamic phenomena identifying the real source of track deterioration.","engineering, Mathematics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

Thus, there exists a potential benefit of a booster dose of tetanus- diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine administered during pregnancy. Here, we report the vaccine reactogenicity profile and birth outcomes in Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women who have or have not had prior immunization with tetanus vaccine, and the IgG levels to B. pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera at delivery. Materials and methods: Pregnant women (N = 370) aged 18–40 years were administered the Tdap vaccine (Boostrix® GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) at 26–36 weeks gestation. Adverse events following vaccination were identified by follow-up telephone call and medical record review. IgG against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA) and pertactin (anti-PRN) in both maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery were quantitatively evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN® Lübeck, Germany). Results: There was no reported increase in the severity or duration of adverse events associated with the administration of an extra tetanus-containing vaccine within the previous five years (N = 181) or multiple doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during the current pregnancy (N = 98). Vaccination at least eight weeks prior to delivery resulted in high antibody titers to all B. pertussis antigens studied. Conclusions: The reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy was not affected by prior tetanus toxoid immunization. High transplacental antibody against B. pertussis antigens in the cord blood provides evidence of antibody transfer and should thus help to protect newborns from pertussis during early life.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Therefore, the objectives of this paper are 1) to describe the current situation of the KM process in general; and 2) to study the current KM tools and technologies available to small restaurant entrepreneurs in Thailand. This study uses the qualitative approach by conducting in-depth interviews with nine small business entrepreneurs well-diversified by demographics in terms of age, and number of years' experience in the restaurant business. The researchers have chosen content analysis to analyse the interview transcripts. The results from the exploratory study indicate some interesting findings as evidenced by four main KM processes. The results also show that entrepreneurs of small restaurants lack the appropriate KM tools and technologies for each KM activity. Moreover, the appropriate use of offline and online KM tools can be essential for facilitating KM.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management of Technology and Innovation"

Methods: A Seemingly Unrelated Regression was used to assess the impact of tobacco consumption on rural household expenditure. To detect tobacco consumption causing heterogeneity in self-rated health among adults in rural China, this study employed a random effects generalized ordered probit model. 2010–2014 China Family Panel Studies was used for the analysis. The data set included 3,611 households and 10,610 adults in each wave. Results: Tobacco consumption households assign significantly lower budget shares to food, health care, dress, and education in rural China. Moreover, self-rated health factor has a significantly positive coefficient with respect to non-smokers and ex-smokers, that is, when the individuals is a non-smoker or ex-smoker, he/ she will be more likely to report his/her health status as positive. Conclusions: The first analysis showed that tobacco consumption crowds out expenditures on food, dress, health care, and education for rural households in China, and the second analysis indicated that non-smokers and ex-smokers are more likely to report their health status as better compared with last year. The results of the present study revealed that Chinese policymakers might consider controlling tobacco consumption since tobacco control can improve not only rural household welfare but also rural household members' health status.

Materials and methods: We created a new derivative of DOX that was derived via simple conjugation of the 3′ amino group of DOX to the dexamethasone molecule. Results: Despite having a lower cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 cells, the conjugated product, DexDOX, exerted its actions in a manner that was different to that of DOX. DexDOX rapidly induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis without entering the nucleus. Further analysis showed that Dex-DOX increased cytosolic oxidative stress and did not interfere with the cell cycle. In addition, the conjugated product retained its cytotoxicity in multidrug resistance-1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells that had an approximately 16-fold higher resistance to DOX. Conclusion: We have synthesized a new derivative of DOX, which has the ability to overcome multidrug resistance-1-induced resistance. This molecule may have potential as a future chemotherapeutic agent.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery"
Biphasic Effect of ATP on In Vitro Mineralization of Dental Pulp Cells,"Techatharatip O., Nowwarote N., Taebunpakul S., Pavasant P.",2018-01-01,"Adenosine Triphosphate, Calcification, Physiologic, Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Dental Pulp, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans, Osteogenesis, Tooth, Deciduous, ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE (ATP), IN VITRO MINERALIZATION, OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION, STEM CELLS ISOLATED FROM HUMAN EXFOLIATED DECIDUOUS TEETH (SHEDs)","Dental pulp cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in response to intrapulpal pressure and the amount released depends on the magnitude of the pressure. ATP regulates the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes and osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether extracellular ATP influences the stemness and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). Therefore, this study investigated the effects of extracellular ATP at a low (0.1 μM) and high (10 μM) concentration on the stemness and osteogenic differentiation of SHEDs. Cells were cultured in either growth medium or osteogenic medium with or without 0.1–10 μM ATP. In growth medium, both concentrations of ATP increased the mRNA expression of pluripotent and osteogenic markers. In contrast, in osteogenic medium, 0.1 μM ATP enhanced in vitro mineralization, whereas 10 μM ATP inhibited this process. In addition, 10 μM ATP stimulated the mRNA expression and activity of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP), an enzyme that regulates the phosphate/pyrophosphate ratio. Thus, depending on the growth condition and its concentration, ATP stimulated stemness and in vitro mineralization or inhibited mineralization. In growth medium, both ATP concentrations stimulated pluripotent and osteogenic marker gene expression. However, in osteogenic medium, a biphasic effect was found on in vitro mineralization; the low concentration stimulated, whereas the high concentration inhibited, mineralization. We propose that ATP released due to mechanical stress modulates the stemness and differentiation of SHEDs. J. Cell.

Environmental risk factors and nonpharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for obesity: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials,"Solmi M., Kohler C.A., Stubbs B., Koyanagi A., Bortolato B., Monaco F., Vancampfort D., Machado M.O., Maes M., Tzoulaki I., Firth J., Ioannidis J.P.A., Carvalho A.F.",2018-12-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Child, Child Abuse, Child Abuse, Sexual, Cohort Studies, Depressive Disorder, Educational Status, Environment, Humans, Mothers, Obesity, Observational Studies as Topic, Pediatric Obesity, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sleep Wake Disorders, bias, cohort studies, evidence, meta-analyses, obesity, risk factors, treatment, umbrella review","Background: Multiple environmental factors have been implicated in obesity, and multiple interventions, besides drugs and surgery, have been assessed in obese patients. Results are scattered across many studies and meta-analyses, and they often mix obese and overweight individuals. Materials and methods: PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched through 21 January 2017 for meta-analyses of cohort studies assessing environmental risk factors for obesity, and randomized controlled trials investigating nonpharmacological and nonsurgical therapeutic interventions for obesity. We excluded data on overweight participants. Evidence from observational studies was graded according to criteria that included the statistical significance of the random-effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a meta-analysis, the number of obesity cases, heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects and excess significance. The evidence of intervention studies for obesity was assessed with the GRADE framework. Results: Fifty-four articles met eligibility criteria, including 26 meta-analyses of environmental risk factors (166 studies) and 46 meta-analyses of nondrug, nonsurgical interventions (206 trials). In adults, the only risk factor with convincing evidence was depression, and childhood obesity, adolescent obesity, childhood abuse and short sleep duration had highly suggestive evidence. Infancy weight gain during the first year of life, depression and low maternal education had convincing evidence for association with paediatric obesity. All interventions had low or very-low-quality evidence with one exception of moderate-quality evidence for one comparison (no differences in efficacy between brief lifestyle primary care interventions and other interventions for paediatric obesity). Summary effect sizes were mostly small across compared interventions (maximum 5.1 kg in adults and 1.78 kg in children) and even these estimates may be inflated. Conclusions: Depression, obesity in earlier age groups, short sleep duration, childhood abuse and low maternal education have the strongest support among proposed risk factors for obesity. Furthermore, there is no high-quality evidence to recommend treating obesity with a specific nonpharmacological and nonsurgical intervention among many available, and whatever benefits in terms of magnitude of weight loss appear small.","genergyal, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry"

In addition, the effect of reaction volume of each reactor type was also investigated. For the smallest reaction volume of 165 mL, homogenizer and 20 kHz ultrasonic reactors offered the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield for both sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts. When the reaction volume was increased from 165 to 500 and 1000 mL with constant power input (80 W), homogenizer reactor did not significantly alter the rate of fatty acid methyl ester formation, unlike the other reactors which showed the decrease in the reaction rate. The reactor performance was evaluated in term of yield efficiency which was based on the amount of fatty acid methyl ester production, power consumption and reaction time. The increase of the reaction volume increased the yield efficiency of both the cavitation reactors and the mechanical stirred reactor. The highest yield efficiencies of 169.46 × 10−4 and 8.27 × 10−4 g/J were obtained from homogenizer reactor using sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide catalysts, respectively, using the reaction volume of 1000 mL. The homogenizer reactor also shows high flexibility of reaction volume usage with high biodiesel production performance in a batch system.","energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Influence of lignite bottom ash on pyroplastic deformation of stoneware ceramic tiles,"Prasartseree T., Wasanapiarnpong T., Mongkolkachit C., Jiraborvornpongsa N.",2018-01-01,"Anorthite, Bottom ash, Chemical compositions, Concrete applications, Electricity generation, High temperature, Manufacturing process, Warpages, Anorthite, Lignite Bottom Ash, Pyroplastic Deformation, Warpage","Electricity generation at Mae Moh Power Plant in Lampang, Thailand, uses lignite as fuel. The output is 3.0 to 3.5 million tons of fly ash per year and 1.5 to 2.0 million tons of bottom ash per year. Fly ash is widely used in concrete application but for bottom ash, it is not very useful. When considering the phase of bottom ash containing quartz, anorthite and hematite, it was found that there are suitable chemical compositions for replacement of raw materials in ceramic tile. Generally, the stoneware tiles are composed of quartz, mullite, feldspar, and glass phase. Water absorption of stoneware ceramic tiles is below 5%, high strength, fire resistance, and low warpage. Firing or sintering at rather high temperature as 1000-1250oC is the manufacturing process for this type of tile. The changes in crystal structure and glassy phase formation in tile during sintering will be often result the tile to warpage or bent depends on the viscosity of the glassy phase that occurs at high temperatures. In the tile, if less viscosity will cause higher warping rate that effect on the shape, and quality of the workpiece. The research has reported that anorthite phase improves the viscosity of a liquid phase or glassy phase when the tile is sintering at high temperatures and lead to high density and low water absorption. This research is interested in studying the effect of using lignite bottom ash as an ingredient in ceramic tile texture to produce low water absorption type by analyzing the effect of percentage of lignite bottom ash to warpage and important properties of ceramic tiles.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: Eighty-eight LTNPs, 53 Progressors, and 323 healthy controls completed annual assessments of cognitive and emotional health as part of a prospective study. The 2 HIV-infected groups and the healthy controls were matched on age and sex distribution at enrollment. Plasma HIV RNA, T-cell counts/percentages, activated monocytes, perivascular monocytes, and markers of macrophage activation (sCD163 and sCD14) were compared by progression subtype. Cognitive and emotional outcomes were compared using cross-sectional linear regression analysis and longitudinal sensitivity models. Results: LTNPs exhibited the same cognitive phenotype and emotional dysregulation as Progressors, with worse outcomes in both groups compared with controls. In addition, cognitive and emotional symptoms were evident before children reached the minimum age for LTNP designation (8 years). Baseline plasma HIV RNA, sCD163, activated monocytes, and perivascular monocytes were lower in LTNPs versus Progressors, with no difference in T-cell counts/percentages or sCD14 levels. Most LTNPs converted to a progressive disease subtype during the study, with similar cognitive and emotion profiles between these subgroups. Conclusions: Pediatric LTNPs experience cognitive and emotional difficulties that mirror symptoms of progressive disease. The abnormalities are present at young ages and persist independent of plasma T-cell counts. The findings highlight the neurodevelopmental risk of pediatric HIV, even in those with early innate disease control.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

A questionnaire was used to gather demographic data for the analysis of heavy metal contamination in feed, drinking water and wastewater. The correlation between the amounts of heavy metal contamination in eggs was studied against the heavy metals found in feed, drinking water and wastewater. The levels of Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu in eggs from large-scale farms were significantly higher than small farms and free grazing farms at P < 0.001. Zn in eggs from free grazing farms was higher than in the small farms and large-scale farms sampled. The contamination of Pb in eggs from all types of farms exceeded the standard limits of ACFS 6703–2005. The average levels of Pb in the eggs from small-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Pb found in the feed at P < 0.05, while the average levels of Pb in eggs from free grazing duck farms correlated significantly with the levels of Pb found in the drinking water at P < 0.05. Additionally, the average level of Cu in duck egg from large-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Cu found in the feeds at P < 0.001. Furthermore, from a calculation of the provisional tolerable daily intake (WHO-FAO) of heavy metals in this study, it was concluded that consumers face health risks from Cd contamination. Thus, heavy metal contamination, especially Pb and Cd in duck egg, must be of concern due to the health risks and the route of crucial heavy metals contamination should be elucidated and long - term monitoring of heavy metals posing health effects in farm systems should be carried out.","toxicology; toxic epidemiology; environmentalronmental, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The compositions of wak, baat, stanza, paragraph, and chapter are identified as main elements for the conceptual framework. For theatrical works, essential elements including <sound> and <stage> tags were also implemented. TNHC selectively applied certain standard TEI encoding elements, in XML format, to describe the content structure of the poetry. This is an early attempt to develop a metadata scheme for classical Thai poetry.

The simplified image analysis method is used to assess the saturation distributions of water and diesel in the flow domain under transient condition. The experiments are undertaken on two homogeneous sands to study the effects of different particle sizes. The two-phase experimental data illustrate soil–liquid characteristic curves (SLCCs) of water/air and diesel/air systems. The SLCCs of diesel/water systems can be predicted by scaling procedure. A descending order of matric suction at a given saturation of wetting phase is in the order of air/water, diesel/water and air/diesel systems. Coarser particle size gives smaller entry pressure, residual matric suction and residual degree of saturation. The three-phase (air/water/diesel) experimental data illustrate that, during imbibition stages, air and diesel are entrapped below water table with the entrapped air saturations of 18–24% and entrapped diesel saturations of 6–10% for fine sand. Coarser particle size yields smaller entrapped diesel saturations and larger entrapped air saturations. The residual diesel saturations during drainage stages and entrapped diesel saturations during imbibition stages do not show any systematic difference as these stages are repeated. During imbibition stages, 37–47% of the total amount of diesel fuel is entrapped under the water table. Also, there is no systematic difference in the amount of diesel fuel entrapped under the water table when imbibition stages are repeated.","environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering"

Spontaneous gut leakage, determined by (i) the presence of FITC-dextran, (ii) elevated serum endotoxin, and (iii) elevated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), was demonstrated in symptomatic lupus but not in the asymptomatic group. In parallel, spontaneous gut leakage, detected by elevated serum BG without fungal infection, was demonstrated in patients with active lupus nephritis. Gut leakage induced by dextran sulfate solution (DSS) or endotoxin administration together with BG or endotoxin alone, but not BG alone, enhanced the severity of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis more prominently in 8-week-old FcGRIIb-/- mice. Additionally, the bone marrow-derived macrophages of FcGRIIb-/- mice produced higher cytokine levels when coexposed to endotoxin and BG, when compared to wild-type mice. In summary, spontaneous gut leakage was demonstrated in symptomatic FcGRIIb-/- mice and the induction of gut permeability worsened sepsis severity. Gut translocation of endotoxin and BG had a minor effect on wild-type mice, but the synergistic effect of BG and endotoxin was prominent in FcGRIIb-/- mice. The data suggest that therapeutic strategies addressing gut leakage may be of interest in sepsis conditions in patients with lupus.",medical,Immunology and Allergy

Design criteria are comprised of a quadratic cost function and bounded magnitudes of control inputs. Specifically, we formulate a control synthesis of closed-loop systems operated in a given bounded domain characterized by a semi-algebraic set. We consider an extended class of rational Lyapunov functions and derive an upper bound of the cost function, together with a state-feedback control law. By exploiting bounds on the control input magnitudes, the controller design condition can be cast as a parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (PDLMI), which is convex optimization and can be efficiently solved by sum-of-squares (SOS) technique. In addition, we derive a sufficient condition to compute a lower bound of the cost function. When choosing polynomial structure of the solution candidate, the lower bound can also be written as PDLMI. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all), Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The precursors are prepared from methacrylation of their hydroxyl-terminated oligomers. These include commercial HO-capped PBA prepolymer (HO-PBA), and bis-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and glycolized PLA (GPLA), which are obtained from glycolysis reactions of their post-consumer products and original resin. The optimal conditions for methacrylation of each prepolymer, i.e., molar ratios of prepolymer to methacrylic anhydride (MAAH), temperature and time, are examined. The most efficient conditions are 1:4/120 °C/3 h (HO-PBA), 1:2.5/120 °C/2 h (BHET), and 1:4/140 °C/3 h (GPLA), respectively. These conditions are justified, where the highest degree of substitution and double bond content are obtained without self-curing side reaction. The resulting methacrylated precursors from HO-PBA and BHET are isothermally cured faster than those of GPLA. Thermosetting copolyesters developed from binary mixtures of the precursors possess tunable thermal stability, and physical and mechanical properties. The degradable copolyesters can be applied in various applications, especially in packaging and agricultural fields.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

However, an unknown severe contagious disease associated with severe neurological signs and egg production losses in ducks, resembling to DTMUV infection, was observed in Thailand since 2007. To determine the presence of DTMUV in 2007, the clinical samples from affected ducks collected in 2007 were tested for DTMUV using pathological and virological analyses. Gross and histopathological lesions of affected ducks were mostly restricted to the ovary, brain and spinal cord, and correlated with the presence of flavivirus antigen in the brain and spinal cord samples. Subsequently, DTMUV was identified by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the polyprotein gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the polyprotein gene sequence revealed that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was a unique virus, belonged within DTMUV cluster 1, but distinctively separated from the Malaysian DTMUV, which was the most closely related DTMUV. It is interesting to note that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was genetically different from the currently circulating Thai and Chinese DTMUVs, which belonged to cluster 2. Our findings indicated that the 2007 Thai DTMUV emerged earlier from a common ancestor with the recently reported DTMUVs; however, it was genetically distinctive to any of the currently circulating DTMUVs. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV in the Thai ducks since 2007, prior to the first report of DTMUV in China in 2010. This study indicates that DTMUV may have circulated in the region long before 2010 and highlights high genetic diversity of DTMUVs in Asia.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

However, data supporting the role of antibiotics are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between antibiotic use and new-onset IBD. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study using the Rochester Epidemiology Project of Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified 736 county residents diagnosed with IBD between 1980 and 2010 who were matched to 1472 controls, based on age, sex and date of IBD diagnosis. Data on antibiotic use between 3 months and 5 years before IBD diagnosis were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between antibiotic use and IBD, and were expressed as adjusted odds ratio [AOR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]. Results: Antibiotic use occurred in 455 IBD cases [61.8%] and 495 controls [33.6%] [p < 0.001]. In multivariate analysis, there were statistically significant associations between antibiotic use and new-onset IBD [AOR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.40-3.58], Crohn's disease [CD] [AOR, 3.01; 2.27-4.00] and ulcerative colitis [UC] [AOR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.23-3.88].

Firstly, surface modifications of AC were carried out using sulfuric acid/nitric acid and followed by sodium hydrosulfite/ammonia, resulting in nitro group functionalized AC and free amine group functionalized AC, respectively. Functionalized groups were confirmed by FTIR analysis. Then, PANi was deposited onto modified AC surface through oxidation polymerization of aniline using ammonium persulfate as an initiator. After that, AC-NO2/PANi composites (1:0.25 and 1:0.5) and AC-NH2-g-PANi (1:0.25 and 1:0.5) were prepared. SEM images revealed that PANi was successfully deposited onto modified AC surface due to polar-polar interaction (in case of AC-NO2) and grafting reaction (in case of AC-NH2). Interestingly, at low aniline concentration, PANi nanofiber was produced, resulting in PANi having the highest surface area. As a result, the PANi nanofiber on porous activated carbon electrode exhibited high EDL capacitance value of 242 F/g. In contrast, PANi granular form exhibited significantly decreased in EDL capacitance value.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Nonetheless, according to the ligature-induced periodontitis model, significantly lower level of bone resorption was found in OC-STAMP-KO mice compared to WT mice. Anti–OC-STAMP-neutralizing mAb down-modulated in vitro: 1) the emergence of large multinuclear tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cells, 2) pit formation, and 3) mRNA and protein expression of CD9, but not DC-STAMP, in receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated OC precursor cells (OCps). While anti–DC-STAMP-mAb also down-regulated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, it had no effect on CD9 expression. In our mouse model, systemic administration of anti–OC-STAMP-mAb suppressed the expression of CD9 mRNA, but not DC-STAMP mRNA, in periodontal tissue, along with diminished alveolar bone loss and reduced emergence of CD9+ OCps and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive multinuclear OCs. The present study demonstrated that OC-STAMP partners CD9 to promote periodontal bone destruction by up-regulation of fusion during osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that anti–OC-STAMP-mAb may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic regimen for periodontitis.—Ishii, T., Ruiz-Torruella, M., Ikeda, A., Shindo, S., Movila, A., Mawardi, H., Albassam, A., Kayal, R.

However, there is little evidence directly showing the contribution of AOA to ammonia oxidation in these engineered systems. In this study, DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with labeled 13 C-HCO 3 − was introduced to sludge from a municipal WWTP. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that AOA amoA genes outnumbered AOB amoA genes in this WWTP sludge. AOA amoA gene sequence analysis revealed that AOA present in this WWTP were specific to one subcluster within the group 1.1b Thaumarchaeota. When ammonia was supplied to DNA-SIP incubation, the DNA-SIP profiles demonstrated the incorporation of the 13 C into AOA and AOB. However, the 13 C was not found to be assimilated into both microorganisms in the incubation without ammonia. Specific primers were designed to target amoA genes of AOA belonging to the subcluster found in this WWTP. Applying the primers to DNA-SIP experiment revealed that AOA of this subcluter most likely utilized inorganic carbon during ammonia oxidation under the studied conditions.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
Asiaticoside induces osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells through the Wnt pathway,"Fitri A.R., Pavasant P., Chamni S., Sumrejkanchanakij P.",2018-05-01,"Alkaline Phosphatase, Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Humans, Osteogenesis, Periodontal Ligament, Triterpenes, Wnt Signaling Pathway, DMP1 protein, human, osteogenesis, periodontal ligament, regeneration, triterpenes, Wnt signal transduction","Background: Asiaticoside is a compound isolated from Herb Centella asiatica, which has been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells. This study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the asiaticoside-induced osteogenic differentiation of hPDL cells. Methods: hPDL cells were incubated with various concentrations of asiaticoside to test cell viability by MTT assay. The mRNA expression levels were analyzed by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Osteogenic differentiation was determined by alkaline phosphatase activity assay and alizarin red staining. The subcellular localization of β-catenin was analyzed by both immunofluorescence and western blot. Results: The results showed that asiaticoside had no effect on the cell viability at any of the tested concentrations. Real-time PCR revealed that osterix (OSX) and dentin matrix protein1 (DMP1) mRNA were significantly enhanced by asiaticoside treatment. Alkaline phosphatase activity and in vitro mineralization were also significantly induced. Interestingly, asiaticoside dose-dependently increased WNT3A mRNA expression, but not WNT5A and WNT10B. The activation of Wnt signaling was shown to result in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin as evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Pre-treatment with recombinant human Dickkopf1 (rhDKK1) inhibited asiaticoside-induced β-catenin nuclear translocation and osteoblast marker gene expression. Moreover, rhDKK1 attenuated asiaticoside-induced DMP1 protein expression. Conclusion: The data demonstrate that asiaticoside induces osteogenic differentiation of hPDL cells by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The findings suggest that asiaticoside could be used as a novel therapeutic drug for periodontal tissue regeneration.",dentistry,Periodontics

In this report, we created an inventory of Phlebotomine sand flies from southern Thailand. A novel tryp-anosome was found in a specimen of Phlebotomus stantoni, and two sand fly species newly recorded in the country, Sergentomyia khawi and Sergentomyia hivernus, were described. PCR primer pairs specific for the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) gene of trypanosomatids were used to demonstrate the presence of the parasite in the sand fly. In addition, the Cytochrome b (CytB) gene was used to identify the sand fly species. Among the 45 samples of the sand fly that were collected, seven samples were Ph. stantoni sand flies and a single sample was positive for Trypanosoma sp. through PCR analysis. This study represents the first detection of Trypanosoma sp. in a sand fly from Thailand. The ITS1 and SSU rDNA sequences indicated that this specimen is suspected to be a novel Trypanosoma species. Further studies of this suspected new Trypanosoma species, including its vertebrate hosts and pathogenic potential, are therefore necessary.","Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (all), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

Thailand’s ‘War on Drugs’ campaign was launched in 2003. This study reports trends in illicit substance use in Thailand over the period 2001–2011. Design and Methods: National Household surveys on illicit drug use were conducted in 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011. A stratified multi-stage cluster random sampling technique was implemented for each survey. Provinces in four regions were systematically selected using a probability proportionate to the size of the targeted population. Participants were interviewed using structured questionnaires on their history of substance use. Results: The prevalence of illicit drug use within the past drastically decreased from 4.5% in 2001 to 1.0% in 2003 (P < 0.05). Since 2003, the prevalence of illicit use within the past year varied between 1.0% and 1.3%. By 2011, it was estimated that 0.84% have used kratom (a substance derived from Mitragyna speciosa) within the past year. Around 0.20% and 0.19% reported using cannibis and yaba (metamphetamine tablet) within a year of the 2011 survey. Other types of illicit drugs were less commonly used in Thailand. Discussion and Conclusions: There was a decrease in prevalence of illicit drug use within the past year between 2001 and 2003 in Thailand. Since 2003, the past year prelavence of illicit drug use has remained relatively stable. From 2001 to 2011, cannabis, kratom and yaba have remained the three most commonly reported types of illicit drugs used in Thailand.","medical, sociology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Health (social science)"

The prepared wood-plastic composites (WPCs) were investigated for their impact strength (IS), tensile strength (TS), Young's modulus (E), elongation at break (EB), flammability and morphology. The results showed that the 80/20/20 PLA/HIPS/WF composite exhibited higher IS, TS and E than the neat PLA, but at the expense of reducing the EB. It was also found that the WPCs filled with MH at all loadings provided much higher flame resistance and E over the neat PLA, HIPS, PLA/HIPS blend and PLA/HIPS/WF composite.

Therefore, potent and effective compounds for treatment of this cancer type are essential. Phoyunnanin E, isolated from Dendrobium venustum (Orchidaceae), has promising pharmacological activities; however, it is unknown if phoyunnanin E affects apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The apoptosis-inducing activity of phoyunnanin E on H460 lung cancer cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342, and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. The underlying mechanism was determined via monitoring apoptosis-regulatory proteins by western blot analysis. The apoptotic effect of the compound was confirmed in H23 lung cancer cells. Results: Phoyunnanin E significantly induced apoptotic cell death of H460 lung cancer cells, as indicated by condensed and fragmented nuclei with the activation of caspase-3 and -9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Phoyunnanin E mediated apoptosis via a p53- dependent pathway by increasing the accumulation of cellular p53 protein. As a consequence, anti-apoptotic proteins including induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were found to be significantly depleted, while proapoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) protein was upregulated. Furthermore, it was found that expression of an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, markedly reduced in response to phoyunnanin E treatment. The apoptosis-inducting effect was also found in phoyunnanin E-treated H23 lung cancer cells. Conclusion: These results indicate the promising effect of phoyunnanin E in induction of apoptosis, that may be useful for the development of novel anticancer agents.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

A potent and rapid mechanism for heat generation is shivering. Research has shown that women prefer a warmer environment and feel less comfortable than men in the same thermal condition. Using the Blanketrol® III, a temperature management device commonly used to study brown adipose tissue activity, we tested whether the experimental temperature (TE) at which men and women start to shiver differs. Twenty male and 23 female volunteers underwent a cooling protocol, starting at 24 °C and gradually decreasing by 1–2 °C every 5 min until an electromyogram detected the shivering or the temperature reached 9 °C. Women started shivering at a higher TE than men (11.3 ± 1.8 °C for women vs 9.6 ± 1.8 °C for men, P = 0.003). In addition, women felt cool, scored by a visual analogue scale, at a higher TE than men (18.3 ± 3.0 °C for women vs 14.6 ± 2.6 °C for men, P < 0.001). This study demonstrates a sex difference in response to cold exposure: women require shivering as a source of heat production earlier than men.

Class V cavities were prepared on extracted human premolars and restored with light-cured resin composite using either AQ-Bond or Single-Bond2 adhesives. Four conditions: no bleaching (control), restored before bleaching (RB), bleached and immediately restored (BIR), bleached and stored in artificial saliva for 7 days then restored (B7R), were used for each adhesive group. After soaking in basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours, all specimens were vertically sectioned through the middle of restorations to measure the distance and/or the thickness of dye penetration. No microleakage was found either on enamel and cementum/dentin margins of control group using AQ-Bond. Whereas leakage was found in the control group using Single-Bond2 and bleached groups. Statistically significant differences in leakage distance and/or thickness were found among groups at the cementum/dentin margin (P <.05). Dye could penetrate into the pulp chamber of BIR (60%) and B7R (15%) specimens. Clinical Significance: The negative control or leakage-free group is very important when discussing the effects of bleaching on marginal seal or microleakage. Bleaching using 38% H2O2 increases the microleakage distance and dye penetration area of cementum/dentin margin more than that of enamel margin. The bleached tooth is not a good substrate for reliable bonding and complete seal and it is also a channel for external stimuli reaching the pulp.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study that included consecutive patients with or without glaucoma, either with open or narrow angles but without peripheral anterior synechiae, who underwent phacoemulsification. Eyes with intraoperative complications and secondary glaucoma were excluded. A preoperative gonioscopy score was created, summing the Shaffer gonioscopy grading in 4 quadrants (range, 0 to 16). To determine variables associated with IOP change at 6 months, univariate and multivariate linear mixed-effects regression analysis was performed adjusting for age, sex, and preoperative IOP. Results: In total, 188 eyes from 137 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 75.0 (±8.5) years and the average preoperative IOP was 15.6 (±3.6)mmHg with 0.7 (range, 0 to 4) glaucoma medications. The mean IOP reduction after phacoemulsification was 3.0 (±2.6)mmHg at postoperative month 6. After multivariate analysis, preoperative IOP [β=0.49 (0.41-0.58), P<0.0001], gonioscopy score [β=?0.17 (?0.24 to ?0.09), P<0.0001], anterior chamber depth (ACD) [β=?0.88 (?1.64 to ?0.14), P=0.02], and IOP/ACD ratio [β=0.45 (0.07 to 0.83) P=0.021] were associated with IOP reduction at 6 months. Conclusions: Preoperative predictors for IOP reduction after cataract surgery were preoperative IOP, ACD, gonioscopy score, and IOP/ACD ratio. The IOP/ACD ratio and gonioscopy score can be easy parameters to obtain and may help clinicians to estimate the IOP reduction after phacoemulsification.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

Individuals with attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often lack self-control, making them at risk for substance abuse and game addiction. There are conflicting results, however, between studies on the pattern of video gaming and game addiction between those with ADHD and healthy controls. We therefore compared the pattern of video game use and game addiction between Thai children with ADHD and healthy controls. Methods: A total of 80 participants with ADHD (median age, 9.5 years) and 102 controls (median age, 10 years) were recruited in this study. ADHD was diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician. Each control subject's teacher completed the ADHD questionnaire to ensure that they did not have the diagnosis of ADHD. Pattern of video game use and Game Addiction Screening Test (GAST) were completed by participants’ parents. Results: More than half of the children with and without ADHD spent >2 h/day playing video games rather than engaging in other age-appropriate leisure activities, particularly on weekends. Participants with ADHD, however, had a higher rate of compulsive video game use than controls (37.5% vs 11.8%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although video game playing was relatively prevalent in children regardless of ADHD status, those with ADHD had a higher rate of problematic video game use than controls. The pattern of leisure activities including video game use should be assessed during health supervision visits. As such, those at risk for game addiction could be identified early, resulting in appropriate intervention.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Although many affected children have structurally normal brains, some have associated developmental disorders or brain anomalies. Objectives: To determine the range of extent of brain melanosis as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate the frequency and types of associated brain anomalies. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed brain and spine MRIs of 80 patients with congenital melanocytic nevi (range: 1 day to 22 years of age) affiliated with Nevus Outreach Inc. from 1998 to 2017. Central nervous system (CNS) melanosis was diagnosed when a mass with abnormal parenchymal T1 hyperintensity was seen. The locations of abnormal signal, associated malformations, the presence of contrast enhancement and, in patients with more than one MRI, changes over time were recorded. Associations among findings were analyzed using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Results: Brain abnormalities were identified in 33 patients. The most common finding was melanosis in the amygdala, which was found in 31 patients (an isolated finding in 14 patients). Nineteen patients had melanosis in the brainstem, cerebellum, cerebral cortex or thalamus. Cerebral and/or spinal leptomeningeal enhancement was uncommon (five patients). Hindbrain melanosis was associated with cerebellar and pontine hypoplasia (P=0.012). Brain melanosis was most easily seen on T1 images prior to myelination; reduced/loss of visibility was noted as the CNS matured. Conclusion: Brain melanosis is a common manifestation in children with large cutaneous melanotic nevi, most commonly found in the anterior temporal lobes (amygdala), brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Hindbrain melanosis is associated with hypoplasia of the affected structures. Early imaging is optimal to provide the greatest sensitivity for diagnosis and to guide proper management.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

We investigate the effects of particle ending profiles and orientation on the initial motion. The boundary element method is used to analyze the electric field, forces, and torques on the particles. The calculated liftoff electric field is smaller than the estimated value based on a model of infinitely long cylinder, and slightly decreases for a particle with a sharp end when the sharp tip is separated from the electrode. The measured liftoff electric field agrees with the tendency obtained from the numerical analysis. Particles mostly began the motion at either end. When the sharp tip was separated from the electrode, the initial motion almost exclusively took place at the sharp end. On the other hand, the probability was slightly higher for the motion at the rounded end when the sharp tip was close to the electrode. The numerical calculation clarifies that the electrostatic and gravitational torques contribute to such liftoff behavior.","Materials Science, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study aimed to describe children's media use, including media multitasking, as well as the associations between media use and their psychosocial adjustment. Methods: This study recruited 339 participants aged 10–15 years from an international school. The children and their care givers were asked to complete the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire independently to evaluate the psychosocial problems of the children. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 12.4 ± 1.5 years, who were recruited from grades 5 to 9. Multitasking media use was reported in 59.3% of participants. The average total media exposure time was 7.0 h/day. The behavioural problem scores from self-reports were greater with increased media use time. After adjusting for confounding variables, the school report and sleep problems were among the factors associated with the total behavioural problem scores from the multiple linear regression analysis (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively), whereas age and average total media exposure time were significantly associated with the prosocial behaviour scores reported by the children (P = 0.004 and 0.02, respectively). Multitasking media use was not significantly associated with the total difficulties scores or the prosocial behaviour scores in this study. Conclusion: Increased media use time was significantly associated with decreased prosocial behaviour scores in children in this study. This can provide important information to parents regarding media use in children.","pediatrics and pediatric surgery, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"
Inhibitory effects of mycosporine-2-glycine isolated from a halotolerant cyanobacterium on protein glycation and collagenase activity,"Tarasuntisuk S., Patipong T., Hibino T., Waditee-Sirisattha R., Kageyama H.",2018-09-01,"Aphanothece halophytica, Collagenase, Collagenase activity, Cyanobacterium, Halotolerant, Inhibitory activity, Metal chelating, Mycosporine-2-glycine, Mycosporine-like amino acids, Protein crosslinking, Bacterial Proteins, Clostridium histolyticum, Collagenases, Cyanobacteria, Cyclohexanols, Glycation End Products, Advanced, Glycine, Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors, Sodium Chloride, collagenase, metal chelating, mycosporine-2-glycine, mycosporine-like amino acid, protein cross-linking","Mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, was purified and characterized in order to determine its utility as a cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredient. M2G efficiently inhibited protein crosslinking. The inhibitory activity of M2G was significantly greater than that of the well-known Maillard reaction inhibitor aminoguanidine. In addition, M2G and other known mycosporine-like amino acids inhibited bacterial collagenase activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing that M2G specifically inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which play a critical role in ageing process and age-related diseases. These observations indicate that M2G may have potential therapeutic applications by suppressing the formation of AGEs and inhibiting excess collagenase activity. Significance and Impact of the Study: Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are known as multifunctional natural compounds. The MAA mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, has potential therapeutic applications for the prevention of skin ageing. Purified M2G was endotoxin-free. M2G had greater inhibitory activity of protein cross-linking compared with well-known inhibitor, aminoguanidine and hindered bacterial collagenase activity. The mechanisms for these inhibitory activities of M2G are discussed in this study.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; culture selection and improvement; discovery and characterization, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Immunology",Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology

In 2016 alone CDs were the subject of over 2200 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and mentioned in over 2300 patents and patent applications, many of which were on pharmaceutical applications. Natural CDs and their derivatives are used as enabling pharmaceutical excipients that enhance aqueous solubility of poorly soluble drugs, increase drug permeability through biological membranes and improve drug bioavailability. Unlike conventional penetration enhancers, their hydrophilic structure and high molecular weight prevents them from penetrate into lipophilic membranes leaving biological membranes intact. The natural CDs and some of their derivatives have monographs in pharmacopeias and are also commonly used as food additives and in toiletry products. CDs form inclusion complexes with lipophilic moieties of hydrophobic drugs. Furthermore, CDs are able to form non-inclusion complexes and self-assembled aggregates; small and large complex aggregates with micellar-like structures that can enhance drug solubility. Excipients commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations may have additive or inhibiting effect on the CD solubilization. Here various methods used to investigate CD aggregate formation are reviewed as well as techniques that are used to increase the solubilizing effects of CDs; methods that enhance the apparent intrinsic solubility of drugs and/or the complexation efficacy and decrease the amount of CD needed to develop CD-containing pharmaceutical formulations. It will be explained how too much or too little CD can hamper drug bioavailability, and the role of CDs in solid dosage forms and parenteral formulations, and examples given on how CDs can enhance drug delivery after ocular, nasal and pulmonary administration.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

IDO chronic immune activation and tryptophan metabolic pathway: A potential pathophysiological link between depression and obesity,"Chaves Filho A.J.M., Lima C.N.C., Vasconcelos S.M.M., de Lucena D.F., Maes M., Macedo D.",2018-01-03,"Depression, Humans, Immunity, Cellular, Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Obesity, Signal Transduction, Tryptophan, Comorbid depression/obesity, Depression, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, Obesity, Tryptophan catabolites","Obesity and depression are among the most pressing health problems in the contemporary world. Obesity and depression share a bidirectional relationship, whereby each condition increases the risk of the other. By inference, shared pathways may underpin the comorbidity between obesity and depression. Activation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a key factor in the pathophysiology of depression. CMI cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-1β, induce the catabolism of tryptophan (TRY) by stimulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) resulting in the synthesis of kynurenine (KYN) and other tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). In the CNS, TRYCATs have been related to oxidative damage, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytotoxicity, excitotoxicity, neurotoxicity and lowered neuroplasticity. The pathophysiology of obesity is also associated with a state of aberrant inflammation that activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a pathway involved in the detection of intracellular or environmental changes as well as with increases in the production of TRYCATs, being KYN an agonists of AHR. Both AHR and TRYCATS are involved in obesity and related metabolic disorders. These changes in the TRYCAT pathway may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms in obesity. This paper reviews the role of immune activation, IDO stimulation and increased TRYCAT production in the pathophysiology of depression and obesity. Here we suggest that increased synthesis of detrimental TRYCATs is implicated in comorbid obesity and depression and is a new drug target to treat both diseases.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

The immobilized film could solve the problem of separation and recovery of powder cata lyst in practical applications. Therefore, the imobilized systems are an advantage for wastewater treatment because they are cost-effective, eco-friendly and reusable with relatively high photocatalytic performance.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The role of angiotensin II and the signaling of type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AGT1R) in T-lymphocyte activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production are largely unknown. Materials and Methods: Jurkat T-cells were treated with AGT1R inhibitor candesartan and stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. T-Cell activation, associated cytokine production and levels of signaling proteins were evaluated by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. Results: Candesartan significantly suppressed PMA and ionomycin-induced CD25 expression and IL-2 production. Regarding the molecular mechanism involved, we showed that such suppressive effects of blocking of AGT1R by candesartan resulted in the significant inhibition of ERK activation in PMA-stimulated Jurkat T-cells. The effect of ERK inhibition on T-cell activation was further confirmed. Treatment with FR180204, a specific ERK inhibitor, reduced T-cell activation and IL-2 secretion. Conclusion: AGT1R signaling is essential for T-cell activation and IL-2 production, and the inhibition of this pathway suppressed T-cell activation via an ERK-dependent mechanism.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology"

Objectives To develop a brief version called the PROMPT, and test its psychometric properties. Setting Four public hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. Method Secondary analysis of three databases used to develop and evaluate the original PROMPT-QoL. Items for the short-form PROMPT were selected based on expert and patient evaluations of content and importance, and lack of redundancy. All domains of the original version are represented in the PROMPT. Main outcome measures Psychometric properties (internal consistency and test–retest reliability, criterion, convergent and discriminant validity, and responsiveness), and indicators of practicality (e.g., administration time, missing data). Results Analyses of the PROMPT and its domain subscales demonstrated good internal consistency and fair-to-excellent test–retest reliability. Correlations between the original and short-form, overall and by domain, were high. Expectations for convergent and discriminant validity were met as correlations between the PROMPT and generic health-related quality of life measures (WHOQoL-BREF domains and summary scores of the SF-12v2) were modest (< 0.40). Based on data from a trial of pharmaceutical care, the PROMPT short-form was very responsive to reductions in medication related problems. Administration time for the PROMPT is estimated to be about 5 min, and across all datasets used, no missing data were found amongst the 16 items of the PROMPT. Conclusion The 16-item PROMPT appears to be a practical, reliable, valid, and responsive instrument to identify patient’s drug-related needs and to assess the humanistic impact of patient-centered pharmaceutical care.","Health Professions, pharmacology, medical","Pharmacy, Toxicology, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Pharmacology (medical)"

According to the hexane and EtOAc extracts showing significant activity with IC 50 values of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL, respectively, chromatographic fractionation of the extracts was performed and led to the isolation of 10 sesquiterpenes (1 - 10). Costunolide (1), a major compound, and dehydrocostus lactone (4) exhibited high efficiency in decreasing TNF- α levels, with IC 50 values of 2.05 and 2.06 μM, respectively. In addition, sesquiterpene analogues were synthesized to establish their structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile. Among the semi-synthetic analogues, compounds 6a and 16 showed the most potent activity with IC 50 values of 1.84 and 1.97 μM, respectively. More importantly, compound 6a showed less toxicity than costunolide and 16. These results provided the first SAR profile of sesquiterpene lactones and indicated that the α -methylene- γ -lactone moiety plays a crucial role in TNF- α inhibition. Additionally, the epoxide derivative 6a might represent a lead compound for further anti-TNF- α therapies, owing to its potent activity and reduced toxicity.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

Materials and methods: Three hundred and sixty-five hand and wrist radiographs of 8–20 years old Thai patients were retrospectively collected. The radiographs were taken between 2011–2016. Greulich–Pyle, Tanner–Whitehouse 3 radius, ulna and selected short bones (RUS), and Fishman method were applied for each radiograph. Comparisons between the estimated age from each method and the chronological age were done using Wilcoxon signed ranks test with Bonferroni correction. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy tests were performed on the important legal age thresholds in Thailand (10, 13, 15 and 18 years old). Intra- and inter-observer reliability were evaluated by weighted kappa analysis. Results: The estimated ages from the three methods were significantly different from the chronological age, except for Tanner–Whitehouse 3 RUS in males. Regarding the legal age thresholds, Greulich–Pyle showed the best accuracy (83.2% for females and 79.63% for males) for legal age threshold of 10 years old. Fishman method showed the best accuracy for legal age threshold of 13 (77.5% for females and 74.31% for males) and 15 years old (83.08% for females and 73.77% for males). For age threshold of 18 years old, Greulich–Pyle showed an accuracy of 53.85% for females and 54.44% for males. The reliability tests showed substantial to almost perfect agreement. Conclusions: This study showed no significant difference between Tanner–Whitehouse 3 RUS age and chronological age for male subjects of contemporary Thai children and adolescents. However, Greulich–Pyle and Fishman method were superior regarding the accuracy of prediction based on Thai legal age thresholds. Due to the possible effects from ethnical difference and secular changes, adaptation of age estimation methods specifically for contemporary Thai population should be further studied.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

By tuning the ratio of Zn/Bi, the morphology varies from nanoplates, flowers to nanoparticles. The heterojunction formed between ZnO and BiOI decreases the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and enhances the photocatalytic activity of ZnO/BiOI composites. The obtained ZnO/BiOI heterostructured nanocomposites exhibit a significant improvement in the photodegradation of rhodamine B under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation as compared to single-phase ZnO and BiOI. A sample with a Zn/Bi ratio of 3:1 showed the highest photocatalytic activity (≈99.3% after 100 min irradiation). The photodegradation tests indicated that the ZnO/BiOI heterostructured nanocomposites not only exhibit remarkably enhanced and sustainable photocatalytic activity, but also show good recyclability. The excellent photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the high separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron-hole pairs as well as the high specific area.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Physics and Astronomy (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Health equity funds that have improved access to public health services for poor people have gradually been extended to the entire country. Using the World Health Organization's methods for the analysis of healthcare expenditure and household survey data from the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Cambodian Socio-Economic Survey, we assessed trends in reported illness, utilization of healthcare services and associated financial burden on households. The impact of out-of-pocket expenditures for health on catastrophic health expenditures, poverty headcount and depth over the same 10-year period are presented, disaggregated by consumption quintile and place of residence (rural, urban and capital). At the aggregated national level, evolution of these indicators was very positive and correlates with a substantial increase in the capacity-to-pay of households, which reduced the average financial burden on households. However, over time inequalities grew between rural and urban areas. By 2014, the national incidence of catastrophic health expenditure was 4.9%, but four times more likely among rural households than their peers in the capital. For rural households with members seeking medical care, catastrophic health expenditure incidence was 12.3%. The impoverishment rate due to health spending among the lowest consumption quintile was 15.3%; the highest rate in this analysis. These findings suggest that economic and health sector developments have indeed benefited many Cambodian people. However, these gains mainly benefited urban residents; especially those in the capital city. We argue that more resources should be allocated to rural health services to address inequalities and healthcare-related financial hardship, which traps vulnerable people into poverty.",medical,Medicine (all)

This result was consistent with that in the smaller subset of East Asian patients in PROFILE 1014. The subsequent study reported here prospectively evaluated crizotinib in a larger East Asian patient population. Methods: In this open-label phase III study (PROFILE 1029), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive orally administered crizotinib 250 mg twice daily continuously (3-week cycles) or intravenously administered chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , plus cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 , or carboplatin [at a dose to produce area under the concentration–time curve of 5–6 mg·min/mL]) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. PFS confirmed by independent radiology review was the primary end point. Results: Crizotinib significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio, 0.402; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.286–0.565; p < 0.001). The median PFS was 11.1 months with crizotinib and 6.8 months with chemotherapy. The objective response rate was 87.5% (95% CI: 79.6–93.2%) with crizotinib versus 45.6% (95% CI: 35.8–55.7%) with chemotherapy (p < 0.001). The most common adverse events were increased transaminase levels, diarrhea, and vision disorders with crizotinib and leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia with chemotherapy. Significantly greater improvements from baseline in patient-reported outcomes were seen in crizotinib-treated versus chemotherapy-treated patients. Conclusions: First-line crizotinib significantly improved PFS, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in East Asian patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, which is similar to the results from PROFILE 1014.

It is increasingly being used for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. In comparison to mammography (2D breast image), DBT provides higher sensitivity (true-positive rate). Recently, there have been many state-of-the-art methods for the detection of masses and calcifications in DBT. However, these previous studies can identify just only one type of breast lesions (abnormality class), while there can be multiple breast lesions simultaneously (multi-label classification); each of them requires different treatment procedures. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-label classification approach that takes into account the pseudo-3D nature of DBT and able to automatically detect two major types of malignant lesions: soft tissue and calcifications. The proposed network is a real 3D convolutional network (ConvNet) with two additional strategies: global kernel and global average pooling. Also, an inversion augmentation is invented; it does not only alleviate a small size of training data, but also help an occlusion overlapping issue. Such system can be used to support radiologists in DBT analysis by prompting suspicious locations. Our in-house dataset consists of 115 DBT volumes, including 91 volumes of cancer detected cases (contained biopsy-proven malignant lesions) and 24 volumes of normal cases.

Factors influencing nurse-assessed quality nursing care: A cross-sectional study in hospitals,"Liu Y., Aungsuroch Y.",2018-04-01,"Adult, Burnout, Professional, China, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Job Satisfaction, Male, Middle Aged, Nurse-Patient Relations, Nursing Care, Quality of Health Care, Reproducibility of Results, Surveys and Questionnaires, Translations, Workplace, Young Adult, burnout, intention to leave, job satisfaction, nurse, patient-to-nurse ratio, quality nursing care, structural equation modelling, work environment","Aim: To propose a hypothesized theoretical model and apply it to examine the structural relationships among work environment, patient-to-nurse ratio, job satisfaction, burnout, intention to leave and quality nursing care. Background: Improving quality nursing care is a first consideration in nursing management globally. A better understanding of factors influencing quality nursing care can help hospital administrators implement effective programmes to improve quality of services. Although certain bivariate correlations have been found between selected factors and quality nursing care in different study models, no studies have examined the relationships among work environment, patient-to-nurse ratio, job satisfaction, burnout, intention to leave and quality nursing care in a more comprehensive theoretical model. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Methods: The questionnaires were collected from 510 Chinese nurses in four Chinese tertiary hospitals in January 2015. The validity and internal consistency reliability of research instruments were evaluated. Structural equation modelling was used to test a theoretical model. Results: The findings revealed that the data supported the theoretical model. Work environment had a large total effect size on quality nursing care. Burnout largely and directly influenced quality nursing care, which was followed by work environment and patient-to-nurse ratio. Job satisfaction indirectly affected quality nursing care through burnout. Conclusions: This study shows how work environment past burnout and job satisfaction influences quality nursing care. Apart from nurses’ work conditions of work environment and patient-to-nurse ratio, hospital administrators should pay more attention to nurse outcomes of job satisfaction and burnout when designing intervention programmes to improve quality nursing care.",Nursing,Nursing (all)
Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Tunvirachaisakul C., Gould R.L., Coulson M.C., Ward E.V., Reynolds G., Gathercole R.L., Grocott H., Supasitthumrong T., Tunvirachaisakul A., Kimona K., Howard R.J.",2018-02-01,"Depressive Disorder, Major, Humans, Late Onset Disorders, Risk Factors, Treatment Outcome, Late-life depression, Major depressive disorder, Meta-analysis, Predictor, Systematic review","Background Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments, and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Dipentylammonium is a simple amine, which is structurally similar to a number of other identified sigma-1 receptor ligands with high affinities such as (2R-trans)-2butyl-5-heptylpyrrolidine, stearylamine and dodecylamine. This study investigates whether dipentylammonium is able to provide neuroprotective effects similar to those of sigma-1 receptor agonists such as PRE-084. Here we identify dipentylammonium as a sigma-1 receptor ligand with nanomolar affinity. We have found that micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium protect from glutamate toxicity and prevent NFκB activation in HT-22 cells. Micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium also protect stably expressing amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutant (APP/Swe) Neuro2A cells from toxicity induced by 150 μM dopamine, suggesting that dipentylammonium may be useful for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms in Alzheimer’s patients which are often associated with a more rapid deterioration of cognitive and physical ability. Finally, we found that low micromolar concentrations of dipentylammonium could out preform known sigma-1 receptor agonist PRE-084 in potentiating neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells, further suggesting that dipentylammonium has a potential use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and could be acting through the sigma-1 receptor.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

However, conventional paper patterning methods are mostly restricted to the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) patterns. Here, we present a novel patterning method for the fabrication of 2D and 3D paper-based devices. For the first time, a 3D fluidic channel network with multiple crossings of fluidic channels is successfully fabricated on a layer of paper without sophisticated procedures. The proposed method utilizes a commercially available inkjet printer to print water pattern as a protective mask onto both sides of a paper substrate and followed by soaking the sample into a non-polar solution which contains a hydrophobic substance to form hydrophobic barriers on the paper substrate. The printed water mask helps preventing the adsorption of the non-polar solution into the printed water area resulting in the formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas. This opens up a new route towards the development of 2D and 3D paper-based devices using low-cost equipment and a variety of materials.",Materials Science,Polymers and Plastics

Especially in computer science, many researchers attempt to use data mining techniques for analyzing large amount of data to discover pattern or knowledge from those data. In this study, a classification technique with supervised learning is considered. From the preliminary study, each classification technique yields different performance. With this reason, a new classification model that combines the advantage of individual classifiers is proposed to achieve higher performance. The proposed model consists of two classification stages. Three techniques composed of Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method and Naïve Bayes approach are applied to an instance separately for the first stage. Then, the results from the techniques will be fed into multi-layer perceptron with back-propagation learning for the second classification stage. Moreover, heart disease, one of the leading causes of death in Thailand, has been selected for diagnosis in this study. A dataset of the disease consists of two classes: risk and non-risk. From the experimental results, the proposed model mixed from three techniques outperforms the existing classifiers including the individual techniques.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

Rapid and accurate HPV genotyping is crucial both for the assessment of patients with HPV infection and for surveillance studies. Methods: Fifty-eight cervicovaginal samples were tested for HPV genotypes using four methods in parallel: nested-PCR followed by conventional sequencing, INNO-LiPA, electrochemical DNA chip, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results: Seven HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 56, and 58) were identified by all four methods. Nineteen HPV genotypes were detected by NGS, but not by nested-PCR, INNO-LiPA, or electrochemical DNA chip. Conclusions: Although NGS is relatively expensive and complex, it may serve as a sensitive HPV genotyping method. Because of its highly sensitive detection of multiple HPV genotypes, NGS may serve as an alternative for diagnostic HPV genotyping in certain situations.","biochemistryistry, medical","Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"
Baseline atrial fibrillation is associated with contrast-induced nephropathy after cardiac catheterization in coronary artery disease: Systemic review and meta-analysis,"Prasitlumkum N., Kanitsoraphan C., Kittipibul V., Rattanawong P., Chongsathidkiet P., Cheungpasitporn W.",2018-12-01,"Atrial Fibrillation, Cardiac Catheterization, Contrast Media, Coronary Artery Disease, Global Health, Humans, Kidney Diseases, Morbidity, Risk Factors, Survival Rate, atrial fibrillation, contrast-induced nephropathy, mortality","Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, independently associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Recent studies suggest that AF is potentially associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing catheterization. However, the association was not conclusive. Thus, we assessed the association between AF in patients with CAD and CIN by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Hypothesis: AF is a predictor of CIN in patients with CAD. Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2018. Included studies were published observational studies that compared the risk of CIN among CAD patients with AF vs those without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Eight cohort studies from June 2007 to November 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 16,691 subjects with CAD (1,030 with AF and 15,661 without its presence). The presence of AF was associated with CIN (pooled risk ratio = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.50-3.14, P < 0.001, I 2 = 54.1%). In our subgroup analysis by urgency and multivariable adjustment, both groups still showed substantial association between AF and CIN (P < 0.05). Conclusions: AF increased the risk of CIN up to two fold among patients with CAD compared to the absence of it. Our study suggests that the presence of AF in CAD is prognostic for the development of CIN.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features in Asian Practice: Perspectives for Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology,"Bychkov A., Jung C.K., Liu Z., Kakudo K.",2018-09-01,"Adenocarcinoma, Follicular, Asia, Humans, Incidence, Pathology, Surgical, Thyroid Cancer, Papillary, Thyroid Neoplasms, Asia, Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, NIFTP, Papillary thyroid carcinoma, Thyroid cancer","The introduction of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) was initiated and promoted by pathologists. Recent Asian studies added new knowledge to the existing literature to aid a better understanding of NIFTP. Our original data and the results of a meta-analysis suggest that the initial rate of NIFTP has been overestimated, averaging 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0–12.7%) of all papillary thyroid cancers worldwide. The incidence of NIFTP in the Asian population (1.6%, 95% CI 0.9–2.5%; 7 studies) is significantly lower than that reported in the non-Asian series (13.3%, 95% CI 9.0–18.3%; 18 studies). Such difference could be attributed to various perceptions of histological diagnostic thresholds, different nature of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and different approaches in the management of thyroid nodules. The active surveillance for indeterminate nodules and NIFTP, largely represented in the indeterminate cytologic categories, promoted by Japanese institutions establishes a new paradigm to reduce overtreatment of these patients. The lower prevalence of NIFTP in the Asian series indicates a low impact on the risk of malignancy in cytopathology, as it was demonstrated in our original multi-institutional cohort of thyroid nodules, and may predict a low impact on the performance of commercial molecular tests. Several Korean studies addressed the issue of BRAF mutation in NIFTP, which prompted the current refinement of the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. Our survey of Asian pathologists found that the term NIFTP has not been universally adopted in the local practice. Endocrine pathologists must promote the new entity through provision of educational activities.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

This work presents sensing devices fabricated with Ag-doped CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) thin films using a cost effective sol-gel deposition method. When compared with undoped CCTO sensors, very low doping levels of Ag cause a dramatic improvement of the response towards H2S gas. The Ag-doped CCTO films were found to be remarkable sensors towards H2S in the concentration range of 0.2–10 ppm. In addition, the response of these sensors towards NH3, H2, NO2 and ethanol vapor was up to two orders of magnitude lower than that for H2S, yielding a highly selective mean of detecting and quantifying H2S. Gas sensing experiments were conducted at operating temperatures ranging from 150 to 350 °C with an optimum response found at 250 °C. In the studied temperature range, Ag-doped CCTO film sensors also showed much shorter response times than that of undoped one. It is found that Ag plays a role promoting the adsorption and catalytic oxidation of H2S leading to drastic changes in the electrical resistance via electron injection into CCTO.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; measurement methods, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Screening of SCCmec types and characterization of the attachment site was carried out using PCR amplification and Sanger's sequencing method. The result showed that a large proportion of the MRSA isolates carried SCCmec type III 7/11 (63%). Three isolates 3/11 (27%) and 1/11 (9.0%) carried SCCmec type II and IVd respectively. Amplification of the universal insertion site of the SCCmec (orfX) and attachment site (attB) showed that all 16 S. aureus isolates were positive for the orfX gene, while only 7 were positive for the attB gene. Phylogenetic diversity showed that the isolates clustered around strains with features similar to a community acquired MRSA. In conclusion, a high carriage rate of SCCmec type III was observed.

Short dispersal distance of males in a wild white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) population,"Matsudaira K., Ishida T., Malaivijitnond S., Reichard U.H.",2018-09-01,"Animals, Anthropology, Physical, DNA, Mitochondrial, Female, Hylobates, Male, Microsatellite Repeats, Thailand, Y Chromosome, autosomal microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA, spatial genetic structure, Y-chromosome","Objectives: It has long been recognized that in gibbons both sexes disperse from the natal group. However, the fate of dispersed individuals was rarely documented. Here we provide the first detailed information on sex differences in dispersal patterns by analyzing the spatial genetic structure of a well-known white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) population. Materials and methods: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal haplotypes, and autosomal microsatellite genotypes were determined for individuals of the Mo Singto study site, Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. Mantel tests for the three genetic marker types were performed for 17 gibbon groups comprising 23 adult males and 18 adult females. Results: Significant positive Mantel correlations were observed for spatial distance and both autosomal microsatellite-based as well as Y-chromosomal haplotype-based genetic distance among adult males. Neighboring adult males tended to be genetically related and share Y-chromosomal haplotypes. Conversely, no significant Mantel correlations were observed either in autosomal microsatellites or mtDNA among adult females. Discussion: Our results confirm, at a genetic level, hypotheses from long-term demographic observations that white-handed gibbon males of the Mo Singto population primarily disperse into adjacent groups. Instead, females disperse more opportunistically either to adjacent or more distant groups. This sex-specific difference reflects an apparent greater tolerance between males than between females. The higher tolerance of adult males allows the formation of stable multimale groups and facilitates male dispersal into an adjacent group. Stable multifemale groups have never been documented for white-handed gibbons probably due to feeding competition between females.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical, sociology","Anatomy, Anthropology"

Findings: Nursing competency trended towards definitions using a holistic lens and behavior statements reflecting the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and judgment required for effective performance in the nursing profession. By using inductive content analysis, 11 components emerged. Additionally, six instruments were found to measure generalist RNs’ competencies across countries. The variables related to generalist nursing competency included sociodemographic variables, professional-related variables, and work environment variables. Conclusions: This review provides the research evidence for updating definitions, components, measurements, and variables related to RNs’ competency in the global community. Further research should consider cross-cultural validation of instruments and influencing factors related to nursing competency.

The most reproducibly identified risk genes affect alcohol metabolism. Well-known functional variants at the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase B and other alcohol dehydrogenases affect risk in European and African ancestry populations. Similarly, variants mapped to these same genes and a well-known null variant that maps to the gene that encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) also affect risk in various Asian populations. In this study, we completed the first GWAS for 3 traits related to alcohol use in a Thai population recruited initially for studies of methamphetamine dependence. Methods: All subjects were evaluated with the Thai version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA). A total of 1,045 subjects were available for analysis. Three traits were analyzed: flushing, maximum number of alcoholic beverages consumed in any lifetime 24-hour period (“MAXDRINKS”), and DSM-IV alcohol dependence criterion count. We also conducted a pleiotropy analysis with major depression, the only other psychiatric trait where summary statistics from a large-scale Asian-population GWAS are available. Results: All 3 traits showed genomewide significant association with variants near ALDH2, with significance ranging from 2.01 × 10 −14 (for flushing; lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PTPN11* rs143894582) to p meta = 5.80 × 10 −10 (for alcohol dependence criterion count; lead SNP rs149212747). These lead SNPs flank rs671 and span a region of over a megabase, illustrating the need for prior biological information in identifying the actual effect SNP, rs671. We also identified significant pleiotropy between major depression and flushing. Conclusions: These results are consistent with prior findings in Asian populations and add new information regarding alcohol use-depression pleiotropy.","medical, pharmacology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Toxicology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Here, we examined the expression responses of the shrimp hemocyte transcriptome to V. parahaemolyticus AHPND (VPAHPND) by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Using libraries (SRA accession number SRP137285) prepared from shrimp hemocytes under experimental conditions, a reference library was de novo assembled for gene expression analysis of VPAHPND-challenged samples at 0, 3/6, and 48 h post infection (hpi). Using the library from 0-hpi as the control, 359 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in the 3/6-hpi library, while 429 were differentially expressed in the 48-hpi library. The expression patterns reported in the RNA-seq of 9 representative genes such as anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (LvALF), crustin p (CRU), serpin 3 (SER), C-type lectin 3 (CTL), clottable protein 2 (CLO), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1 (PKA) and DNAJ homolog subfamily C member 1-like (DNJ) were validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of these genes was also analyzed in shrimp that were injected with the partially purified VPAHPND toxin. A VPAHPND toxin-responsive gene, LvALF was identified, and its function was characterized by RNA interference. LvALF knockdown resulted in significantly rapid increase of shrimp mortality caused by toxin injection. Protein-protein interaction analysis by molecular docking suggested that LvALF possibly neutralizes VPAHPND toxin through its LPS-binding domain. The data generated in this study provide preliminary insights into the differences in the immune response of shrimp to the bacterial and toxic aspect of VPAHPND as a disease.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Roles and competences for educators of undergraduate dental students: a discussion paper,"Chuenjitwongsa S., Bullock A., Oliver R.G.",2018-02-01,"Education, Dental, Faculty, Dental, Professional Competence, Professional Role, dental educators, educator roles and competences, undergraduate dental education","Introduction: Dental educators are important people who contribute to the development of every aspect of dental education. In part due to the lack of understanding of their roles and competences, dental educator development has so far received little consideration. With the aim of enhancing the dental profession's contribution to the development of undergraduate dental education, this article explores common roles of educators of undergraduate dental students and the competences needed to be effective educators. Methods: This is a discussion paper based on a wide reading of the literature on the education of health professionals with a specific focus on roles and competences of educators. Results and discussion: Roles of educators of undergraduate dental students typically encompass four areas: teaching, research, administration and providing healthcare. Educators may not be involved in every role; they normally perform the roles relevant to their work contexts. Competences for dental educators based on the four main roles comprise 12 domains: educational theories and principles; modes of education; learner issues; educational materials and instructional design; assessment and feedback; curriculum matters; evaluation; educational research; educational management; quality assurance; patient care and healthcare system and professionalism. Not all competences are required by all educators although educators need to be competent in the areas related to their roles and duties. Conclusion: Understanding the roles and competences for educators of undergraduate dental students can help individual educators to improve their personal effectiveness and institutions to tailor staff development programmes appropriate to the needs of their staff. Faculty development contributes to sustained enhancement of undergraduate dental education.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"

Given the strong and well-understood evolution of the interstellar medium from the present to z = 2, we investigate the behaviour of the [CII] emission and empirically identify its primary driver. We detect [C II] from six galaxies (four secure and two tentative) and estimate ensemble averages including non-detections. The [C II]- to-infrared luminosity ratio (L[C II]/LIR) of our sample is similar to that of local main-sequence galaxies (~2 × 10-3), and ~10 times higher than that of starbursts. The [CII] emission has an average spatial extent of 4-7 kpc, consistent with the optical size. Complementing our sample with literature data, we find that the [CII] luminosity correlates with galaxies' molecular gas mass, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.2 dex and without evident systematics: the [CII]- to-H2 conversion factor (α[C II] ~ 30 M⊙/L⊙) is largely independent of galaxies' depletion time, metallicity, and redshift. [C II] seems therefore a convenient tracer to estimate galaxies' molecular gas content regardless of their starburst or main-sequence nature, and extending to metal-poor galaxies at low and high redshifts. The dearth of [C II] emission reported for z > 6-7 galaxies might suggest either a high star formation efficiency or a small fraction of ultraviolet light from star formation reprocessed by dust.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

This study reviewed the main contents of the NSP-AMR and the mandates of relevant implementing agencies and identified challenges and recommends actions to mitigate implementation gaps. Methods: This study analysed the contents of NSP-AMR, reviewed institutional mandates and assessed the implementation gaps among agencies responsible for NSP-AMR. Results: Two of six strategies are related to monitoring and surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumption in human and animal. Two other strategies aim to improve antibiotic stewardship and control the spread of AMR in both clinical and farm settings. The remaining two strategies aim to increase knowledge and public awareness on AMR and establish national governance for inter-sectoral actions. Strategies to overcome implementation challenges are sustaining cross-sectoral policy commitments, effective cross-sectoral coordination using One Health approach, generating evidence which guides policy implementation, and improving enforcement capacities in regulatory authorities. Conclusions: To address AMR, Thailand requires significant improvements in implementation capacities in two dimensions. First, technical capacities among implementing agencies are needed to translate policies into practice. Second, governance and organizational capacities enable effective multi-sectoral actions across human, animal, and environmental sectors.","genergyal, public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, medical","Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

They have been designed for working with patient's limbs and can be used for hand positioning and executing task which help reduce therapist's workload and give them an alternative way to rehabilitate patients. However, there are some patients with permanent impairments, which cannot improve from rehabilitation. Thus, portable assistive devices could greatly help them performing simple activities of daily living (ADL), but such device has not been fully explored, the present design of tendon routing cannot closely replicate finger orientation and motion during grasping. Improving the flexion tendon would increase the possibility of grasping for patients with hand disability. This research aims to develop a tendon routing design of a soft exoskeleton to increase compatibility with human hand, while it can execute tasks and exercises more naturally compared to normal limbs to help stroke patients to live independently. The results convinced that the proposed flexion routing can closely replicate human grasping motion with sufficient fingertip force to perform daily activities.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Computational Mechanics"

From monthly measures over 1 yr we show that litter removal caused lower: fine root (≤2 mm diameter) standing mass, fine root standing length, fine root length production and fine root length survivorship. Litter addition did not significantly change fine root mass or length or production. Nutrient concentrations in fine roots in litter removal plots were lower than those in controls for nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), concentrations in fine roots in litter addition plots were higher for N and Ca. Chronic litter removal has resulted in reduced forest growth due to lack of nutrients, probably nitrogen.

Methods: Data on 6095 adults aged ≥ 50 years old from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) was analyzed. Participants completed the CAGE instrument to screen for problematic alcohol use at baseline between October 2009 and February 2011. Outcomes were incident (assessed by the CES-D scale) and anxiety (assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive scale) symptoms after a two-year follow-up as well as persistence of probable depression and anxiety among those with a positive screen for those disorders at baseline. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders through multivariable models. Results: In the overall sample, problem drinking did not predict incident and persistent depression and anxiety in this sample. Among females, problem drinking increased the risk for incident depression (OR = 2.11; 95%CI = 1.12–4.00) and anxiety (OR = 2.22; 95%CI = 1.01–4.86). In addition, problem drinking increased the risk of persistent depressive symptoms (OR = 2.43; 95%CI = 1.05–5.06) among females. Conclusion: Problem drinking may increase the risk of incident probable depression and anxiety among older females. Furthermore, problem drinking led to a higher likelihood of persistent depressive symptoms in older female participants. Interventions targeting problem drinking among older females may prevent the onset and persistence of depression in this population, while also decreasing the incidence of anxiety symptoms.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Obtained results indicate that MDD is characterized by increased sIL-1RA, sTNF-R1, and TBARS concentrations. Melancholic depression is associated with increased sIL-6R but lowered IL-1α levels. A current episode of depression is accompanied by significantly increased sIL-6R compared to the remitted state. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is accompanied by increased sIL-6R and TBARS but lowered sTNF-R2 levels compared to non-TRD patients. These immune markers are not significantly correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), number episodes, or age at onset. Our findings show that increased sIL-1RA, sTNF-R1, and TBARS levels may be trait markers of depression, while increased sIL-6R levels may be a state marker of melancholia and an acute phase of depression. MDD is accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and simultaneous activation of immune pathways, and the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system (CIRS). TRD is characterized by highly increased oxidative stress and probably increased TNFα and IL-6 trans-signalling. Novel treatments for major depression should target oxidative stress pathways, while new treatments for TRD should primary target lipid peroxidation and also activated immune-inflammatory pathways.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

The patchy tremor landscape: Recent advances in pathophysiology,"Nieuwhof F., Panyakaew P., Van De Warrenburg B.P., Gallea C., Helmich R.C.",2018-08-01,"Dystonic Disorders, Essential Tremor, Humans, Neuroimaging, Parkinson Disease, Tremor, Dystonia, Essential tremor, Parkinson, Pathophysiology, Tremor","Purpose of review We focus on new insights in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor, tremor in dystonia, and orthostatic tremor. Recent findings Neuroimaging findings suggest that Parkinson's disease resting tremor is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, serotonergic dysfunction, or both. Not all tremors in Parkinson's disease have the same pathophysiology: postural tremor in Parkinson's disease can be subdivided into pure postural tremor, which involves nondopaminergic mechanisms, and re-emergent tremor, which has a dopaminergic basis. Unlike Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor has an electrophysiological signature suggestive of a single (or several tightly coupled) oscillators. Visual feedback increases essential tremor and enhances cerebral activity in the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit, supplementary motor area, and parietal cortex. Little is known about dystonic tremor but the available evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum play a role. Finally, recent work in orthostatic tremor points towards the role of the pontine tegmentum and dysfunctional cerebellar-SMA circuitry. Summary Many pathological tremors involve the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuitry, and the clinical and pathophysiological boundaries between tremor disorders are not always clear. Differences between tremor disorders-or even individual patients-may be explained by the specific balance of neurotransmitter degeneration, by distinct circuit dynamics, or by the role of regions interconnected to the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

The electromechanical properties of the pectin hydrogel as crosslinked by Fe2+ were superior to other pectin hydrogels. The pristine pectin hydrogel and the P2ClAn/Pectin hydrogel blended with 0.10%v/v P2ClAn provided the high storage modulus sensitivity values of 8.61 and 14.01, respectively, under the electric field strength of 800 V/mm. The P2ClAn/Pectin hydrogel blend responded to the electric field with higher dielectrophoretic forces, but lower deflections relative to the pristine pectin hydrogel due to the additional P2ClAn polarization and the latter lower rigidity.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

Pulp cells’ behaviours including cell proliferation, colony-forming unit, osteogenic differentiation, pluripotent markers, and mesenchymal stem cell markers were investigated. Results: The proband had opalescent brown primary teeth with extensive loss of enamel. Mutation analysis revealed a novel heterozygous 4-bp deletion, c.1915_1918delAAGT (p.K639QfsX674), in exon 5 of the DSPP associated with DGI. Analysis of the extracted primary incisor demonstrated a decrease in brightness but an increase in yellow and red chroma. The dentin showed reduced mineral density. The dentinal tubules were present in the predentin, but progressively collapsed in the dentin. The pulp cells exhibited markedly reduced CD105 expression, decreased cell proliferation, and smaller colony-forming units.

They result in excessive prolactin secretion and important changes in the vasculature. Pericytes are perivascular cells associated with capillaries and have crucial roles in physiological and pathological neovascularization. We previously reported that pericytes produce type I and III collagens in the anterior pituitary of adult rats. In addition, pituitary pericytes contained well-developed cell organelles and actively synthesized collagens during early postnatal development. However, the characteristics of pericytes in pituitary tumors are unclear. In this study, we used diethylstilbestrol (DES)-treated rats as an animal model of prolactinoma. Using five common pericyte markers, more pericytes were observed in rats treated with DES for 3 months (prolactinoma) compared to the control. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that attached and semidetached pericytes exhibited active cell organelles. Moreover, we identified pericyte migration between capillaries. Although the fine structure of pituitary pericytes was active in prolactinoma, expressions of type I and III collagen mRNAs were greatly diminished. In sum, the characteristics and functions of pericytes were altered in pituitary tumors. This study is the first to clarify fine structural changes of pericytes in rat prolactinomas and improves our understanding of the function of pericytes under pathological conditions.","endocrinology, medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Molecular Biology"

It is quite difficult to acquire sign language skills since there are vast number of sign language words and some signing motions are very complex. Several attempts at machine translation have been investigated for a limited number of sign language motions by using KINECT and a data glove, which is equipped with a strain gauge to monitor the angles at which fingers are bent, to detect hand motions and hand shapes. One of the key features of our proposed method is using an optical camera and colored gloves for detection of sign language motion. The optical camera is implemented in a smartphone. This makes it possible to remove the limitation of using area and occasion as a machine translation tool. The authors propose two new schemes. One is to add the two feature elements, that is, hand direction obtained from the angle between the wrist and fingertips, and hand rotation calculated from the visible size of the palm and wrist incorporating the four conventional elements comprising motion trajectory, motion velocity, hand position and hand shape. The other is integrating the results which is obtained by each classifier to enhance the recognition performance. The six kinds of classifiers have been applied to 35 sign language motions. A total of 3150 pieces of motion data, that is, 2100 pieces of motion data as training data and 1050 pieces as evaluation data, were used to evaluate the proposed method. The recognition results were examined by integrating the feature elements and classifier. The success rate for 35 words was respectively 76.2% and 94.2%, for the selection of the first ranked answer, and the selection of the first, second or third ranked answers. These values suggest that the proposed method could be used as a review tool for assessing how well learner have mastered sign language motions.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

GG carrying patients had significantly reduced risk for hypocitraturia (adjusted OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05–0.48, AA as reference). In selected 15 calcium oxalate stone patients, AA carriers had significantly higher intrarenal NaDC-1 mRNA than GG and AG carriers. Homozygous GG of rs11567842 SNP in NaDC-1 gene was a protective genotype for hypocitraturia in kidney stone patients. The findings suggested that patients with AA genotypes were more susceptible to hypocitraturia than those with GG, hence carrying a higher risk for kidney stone recurrence.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

It occurs when bacteria convert high levels of naturally occurring histidine into histamine resulting that when people eat fish containing high levels of histamine, they suffer allergic type reactions. Deeply considering, histamine and histidine consist of the primary amine and imidazole unit in their structures. As a result, the selectively discriminate detection of each species has been a greatly challenge task for determining the freshness of seafood. In the present work, the successful development of a new fluorescence sensors based on the superior Histamine blue (HB) doped in nanoporous silica (NPS) and surface modification with FC to provide FRET On-Off process and highly discriminate detection of histamine among other biogenic amines through the charge repulsion of FC and histidine and the specific reaction of mesoionic acid fluoride based Histamine blue (HB) with the amine group of Him via self-catalytic reaction of imidazole group in Him. This simple HB@NPS@FC sensory platform allows accurate determination of histamine in the linear response ranges of 29.12-166.67 μM of Him. The detection limit of the sensor was calculated equal to 8.55 μM. This HB@NPS@FC platform was investigated with success on real salmon and tuna samples. On the discovery of highly selective Him detection, the couple of two sensors and surface selector offers the potentially specific detection of Him in the field of food chemistry.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Mineralogical and geochemical characterization of waste rocks from a gold mine in northeastern Thailand: application for environmental impact protection,"Assawincharoenkij T., Hauzenberger C., Ettinger K., Sutthirat C.",2018-02-01,"Conservation of Natural Resources, Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Pollutants, Gold, Industrial Waste, Mining, Thailand, Waste Disposal Facilities, AMD, Gold mine, Gossan, Heavy metal, Waste rock","Waste rocks from gold mining in northeastern Thailand are classified as sandstone, siltstone, gossan, skarn, skarn-sulfide, massive sulfide, diorite, and limestone/marble. Among these rocks, skarn-sulfide and massive sulfide rocks have the potential to generate acid mine drainage (AMD) because they contain significant amounts of sulfide minerals, i.e., pyrrhotite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite. Moreover, both sulfide rocks present high contents of As and Cu, which are caused by the occurrence of arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, respectively. Another main concern is gossan contents, which are composed of goethite, hydrous ferric oxide (HFO), quartz, gypsum, and oxidized pyroxene. X-ray maps using electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) indicate distribution of some toxic elements in Fe-oxyhydroxide minerals in the gossan waste rock. Arsenic (up to 1.37 wt.%) and copper (up to 0.60 wt.%) are found in goethite, HFO, and along the oxidized rim of pyroxene. Therefore, the gossan rock appears to be a source of As, Cu, and Mn. As a result, massive sulfide, skarn-sulfide, and gossan have the potential to cause environmental impacts, particularly AMD and toxic element contamination. Consequently, the massive sulfide and skarn-sulfide waste rocks should be protected from oxygen and water to avoid an oxidizing environment, whereas the gossan waste rocks should be protected from the formation of AMD to prevent heavy metal contamination.","genergyal, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Real-Time Polyps Segmentation for Colonoscopy Video Frames Using Compressed Fully Convolutional Network,"Wichakam I., Panboonyuen T., Udomcharoenchaikit C., Vateekul P.",2018-01-01,"Colonoscopy, Convolutional networks, Polyp detection, Real-time detection, Video frame, Colonoscopy, Convolutional network, Polyp detection, Real-time detection, Video frame segmentation","Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. As of now, colonoscopy is the most effective screening tool for diagnosing colorectal cancer by searching for polyps which can develop into colon cancer. The drawback of manual colonoscopy process is its high polyp miss rate. Therefore, polyp detection is a crucial issue in the development of colonoscopy application. Despite having high evaluation scores, the recently published methods based on fully convolutional network (FCN) require a very long inferring (testing) time that cannot be applied in a real clinical process due to a large number of parameters in the network. In this paper, we proposed a compressed fully convolutional network by modifying the FCN-8s network, so our network is able to detect and segment polyp from video images within a real-time constraint in a practical screening routine. Furthermore, our customized loss function allows our network to be more robust when compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. The experiment was conducted on CVC-EndoSceneStill database which consists of 912 video frames from 36 patients. Our proposed framework has obtained state-of-the-art results while running more than 7 times faster and requiring fewer weight parameters by more than 9 times. The experimental results convey that our system has the potential to support clinicians during the analysis of colonoscopy video by automatically indicating the suspicious polyps locations.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

Materials and Methods: Normal subjects above 40 years old and self-identified as being Caucasian and Chinese were recruited. They were evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (RTVue-100). Parameters related to the optic nerve head, pRNFL, and GCC analysis protocols were acquired. Multivariable linear regression was performed adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Data from 116 Caucasian and 130 Chinese subjects were available for analysis. Mean age of all participants was 66.72 (SD 10.82) years. There were statistically significant differences for disc area (DA), area cup-to-disc, vertical cup-to-disc, and cup volume (P=0.02, 0.004, 0.02, and 0.03, respectively), greater in Chinese. After adjusting for age, sex, axial length (AL), intraocular pressure (IOP), DA, and GCC thickness, Chinese subjects had significantly greater thickness in all pRNFL parameters (mean differences ranged between 4.29 and 9.93 μm; all P<0.001) except the nasal quadrant. GCC outcomes were also adjusted for DA and pRNFL; Caucasians had significantly higher average GCC and inferior GCC (mean difference 2.97 and 3.45 μm, respectively; P<0.01), whereas the Chinese group had significantly higher ganglion cell global loss volume (mean difference 2.47 %, P<0.001). Conclusions: This study suggests there is significantly greater pRNFL thickness in Chinese, which were independent of age, AL, IOP, and DA, and possibly greater GCC in Caucasians after adjustment for age, AL, IOP, DA, and pRNFL thickness.",medical,Ophthalmology

Variations in the shape and attachment point of the PMi could cause discomfort in the shoulders. The aim of this study was to observe the types of morphological insertion patterns and attachment sites of the PMi. Methods: Seventy-four sides of fresh, embalmed Korean (42 sides; mean age 78 years) and Thai (32 sides; mean age 78 years) cadavers were dissected to analyze the morphological insertion types and attachment sites of the PMi. Results: Unusual insertion patterns were evident in about 23% of the samples. When the portion of the PMi tendon ran over the coracoid process, the most common attachment site was the glenohumeral joint capsule. We also confirmed the attachment of the PMi to the clavicle. Costal attachments of the PMi that extend from the second rib to the fourth rib were observed frequently as well. Conclusions: Unusual insertion patterns of the PMi are common. Some authors consider that tendon attachment to the joint capsule can cause shoulder pain. In addition, the PMi tendon could be utilized in acromioclavicular joint reconstruction. Surgeons need to be aware of the possibility of a PMi variant being found during surgery even when this is not visible in magnetic resonance or ultrasound imaging.",medical,"Anatomy, Surgery, Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
Relaxation Effect on Intrapore Diffusivities of Highly Charged Colloidal Particles Confined in Porous Membranes,"Yooprasertchuti K., Dechadilok P.",2018-06-01,"Charged colloidal particles, Cylindrical Pores, Electrical double layers, Electrolytic solution, Highly charged particles, Hydrodynamic interaction, Relaxation effect, Track-etched membrane, Colloids, Cylindrical pore, Diffusion, Electrical double layer, Relaxation effect, Track-etched membrane","During the particle intrapore diffusion, the particle–pore hydrodynamic interaction enhances the drag on the particle, resulting in a particle diffusivity reduction. For charged particles submerged in an electrolytic solution, the distortion of electrical double layer caused by particle motion creates an additional drag: a phenomenon known as the relaxation effect. Such effect on intrapore diffusivities of rigid spherical particles confined in long cylindrical pores is determined by employing a perturbation scheme involving particle Peclet number. Comparison between present simulation results and previous results from perturbations involving both particle Peclet number and surface charge density indicates that the perturbation involving surface charge density overestimates the electrokinetic retardation. Our results demonstrate that, whereas a particle surface charge density increase always amplifies the excess drag due to relaxation, effects of pore surface charge density are more complicated and dependent on values of particle surface charge density and Debye length. If a highly charged particle is confined in a charged pore, this additional drag increases as a function of Debye length if the Debye length is small, but becomes constant despite the increasing Debye length if the Debye length is comparable or larger than the pore radius. For particles confined in uncharged pores, however, the Debye length increase always amplifies the electrokinetic retardation, causing the particle diffusivity reduction of a highly charged particle in an uncharged pore to be larger than that of a similar particle confined in a charged pore if the Debye length is comparable to or larger than the pore radius.","geobase; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (all)"
Healthy behaviours and productive activities among Thai older adults: A repeated cross-sectional analysis,Witvorapong N.,2018-09-01,"Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Employment, Female, Health Behavior, Humans, Life Style, Male, Social Participation, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thailand, Elderly, Labour participation, Lifestyle, Multivariate probit, Social participation, Thailand","Based on a nationally representative repeated cross-sectional sample of older individuals from the 2007 and 2011 Surveys of Older Persons in Thailand (n = 50,138, with the participation rate of 95.79%), this study investigates the extent to which healthy behaviours are interrelated with productive activities in old age. Healthy behaviours were represented by alcohol abstinence, tobacco abstinence, physical exercise, and consumption of a nutritious diet, encompassing all major lifestyle choices that could lower mortality risks among the general population. Productive activities were represented by social participation and labour participation, consistent with the paradigms of Active and Productive Ageing promoted by the World Health Organization. A multivariate probit model, whereby all six behaviours were jointly estimated, was explored. Conditional on pairwise combinations of the two productive activities, the probabilities of contemporaneously undertaking all four healthy behaviours were calculated. The results illustrate that the relationships among productive activities and health behaviours are inextricable and complex. Considering each of the four healthy behaviours separately, social participation and labour participation are associated with lower probabilities of abstaining from alcohol and tobacco but higher probabilities of exercising and keeping a nutritious diet among older adults. Considering all four healthy behaviours together, the productive activities are associated with a significant increase in the probability that a Thai older adult would simultaneously abstain from alcohol, abstain from tobacco, exercise, and eat healthily, compared to if the same individual undertakes neither social participation nor labour participation. This study calls for a consistent set of multiple-behaviour interventions to promote healthy and productive ageing.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, geobase; related topics, sociology, arts","Health (social science), History and Philosophy of Science"

RNA sequencing of kidney distal tubule cells reveals multiple mediators of chronic aldosterone action,"Poulsen S.B., Limbutara K., Fenton R.A., Pisitkun T., Christensen B.M.",2018-05-01,"Aldosterone, Animals, Cells, Cultured, Cluster Analysis, Gene Expression Profiling, Kidney Tubules, Collecting, Kidney Tubules, Distal, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Transgenic, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Transcriptome, Aldosterone, Aldosterone-sensitive distal tubule (ASDT), Kidney, Min-eralocorticoid receptor (MR), MRNA transcripts","The renal aldosterone-sensitive distal tubule (ASDT) is crucial for sodium reabsorption and blood pressure regulation. The ASDT consists of the late distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule (CNT), and collecting duct. Due to difficulties in isolating epithelial cells from the ASDT in large quantities, few transcriptome studies have been performed on this segment. Moreover, no studies exist on isolated DCT2 and CNT cells (excluding intercalated cells), and the role of aldosterone for regulating the transcriptome of these specific cell types is largely unknown. A mouse model expressing eGFP in DCT2/CNT/ initial cortical collecting duct (iCCD) principal cells was exploited to facilitate the isolation of these cells in high number and purity. Combined with deep RNA sequencing technology, a comprehensive catalog of chronic aldosterone-regulated transcripts from enriched DCT2/CNT/ iCCD principal cells was generated. There were 257 significantly down-regulated and 290 upregulated transcripts in response to aldosterone (P < 0.05). The RNA sequencing confirmed aldosterone regulation of well-described aldosterone targets including Sgk1 and Tsc22d3. Changes in selected transcripts such as S100a1 and Cldn4 were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The RNA sequencing showed downregulation of Nr3c2 encoding the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and cell line experiments showed a parallel decrease in MR protein. Furthermore, a large number of transcripts encoding transcription factors were downregu-lated. An extensive mRNA transcriptome reconstruction of an enriched CNT/iCCD principal cell population was also generated. The results provided a comprehensive database of aldosterone-regulated transcripts in the ASDT, allowing development of novel hypotheses for the action of aldosterone.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Physiology, Genetics"

In the visible region, the experimental absorption spectrum of the solution showed a broad peak with the longest wavelength of maximal absorption (λmax) value at 708 nm. For the theoretical method, a trans-IG monomer and a trans-IG bound with two water molecules (IG.2W) were optimized in the ground state using the B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 calculations with the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set and the SCRF-CPCM model for taking solvent effect into account was also applied. Sequentially, the UV–Visible spectra and λmax of the optimized trans-IG and IG.2W models in the implicit water were simulated by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The TD-DFT methods including BLYP, B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, M06-2X, ωB97XD, LC-BLYP, and LC-ωPBE functionals without and with the D3 correction and the 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set were selected. The results pointed out that BLYP and BLYP-D3 were the best methods because they could reproduce the experimental λmax value of IG in aqueous solution. The predicted λmax values of IG.2W were almost equal to 708 nm (the experimental data), indicating that IG.2W could be responsible for optical properties of IG.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, physics","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Chemistry (all), Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics"

METHODS: Forty-two, 5-month old female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham (OVI) or ovariectomy (OVX) groups (n = 21). When rats reached 6 months old, 7 mm diameter calvarial defects were created and treated, further dividing each group into blood clot control, mPCL-TCP, or ACS subgroups (n = 7). After four weeks, the calvarial specimens were evaluated using micro-computed tomography for bone volume fraction (BVF), and histopathology. RESULTS: The effects of ovariectomy were confirmed by changes in body, uterine, and vaginal weight, and osteopenia in the femur. A significant increase in BVF was observed in ACS-subgroups compared with their respective control groups (p < 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed no cellular inflammatory infiltrate in any group. Fibrous tissue encapsulated the mPCL-TCP, while the ACS was well-integrated with the bone matrix. The OVX groups presented more osteoid and enlarged marrow cavities compared with the OVI groups.

PRRSV infection usually weakens lung defense mechanisms, leading to porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Induction of circulatory Treg is one of the reported mechanisms involved in PRRSV-induced immunomodulation. However, whether PRRSV can induce tissue-infiltrating Treg in the lungs and lymph nodes is still unclear. To investigate the effect of PRRSV on induction of porcine Treg in the tissues, we isolated mononuclear cells from the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and identified the existence of Treg by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that PRRSV could induce Treg proliferation in the cultured mononuclear cells derived from lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, regardless of the pig's PRRSV infective status. Furthermore, PRRSV-infected pigs exhibited higher numbers of total tissue-infiltrating Treg and PRRSV-specific Treg in the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes than the PRRSV-negative pigs. To determine if the lung Treg could produce an inhibitory cytokine, the numbers of IL-10-producing Treg were determined. Significantly higher numbers of IL-10-producing Treg in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs were observed. Altogether, our findings indicate the potent effect of PRRSV on induction of Treg in the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes of the infected pigs.

Preoperative management is therefore crucial, and the exenteration procedure is usually performed in an elective setting. In cases of rectal cancer, however, tumor-related complications may cause a patient's condition to deteriorate rapidly, despite optimal management. Urgent pelvic exenteration then may be an option for these patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the outcomes of pelvic exenteration between the urgent and elective settings. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. SETTING: This study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between February 2006 and June 2012. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were included. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent pelvic exenteration for locally advanced rectal cancer. They were assigned to urgent and elective setting groups according to their preoperative conditions. The urgent setting group included patients who required urgent pelvic exenteration because of intestinal obstruction, bowel perforation, bleeding, or uncontrolled sepsis, despite optimal management preoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-six patients were classified in the urgent setting group, and 27 were classified in the elective setting group. Three-year overall and disease-free survivals were compared between the 2 groups. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity and mortality were also studied. RESULTS: Three-year overall survival was 62.2% and 54.4% in the elective and urgent groups (p = 0.7), whereas three-year disease-free survival was 43% and 63.8% (p = 0.33). The median follow-up time was 33 months. Thirty-day morbidity did not differ between the 2 groups (p = 0.49). A low serum albumin level was a significant risk factor for complications. There was no postoperative mortality in this study. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study performed at 1 institution, and it lacked quality-of-life scores. CONCLUSION: Pelvic exenteration in an urgent setting is feasible and could offer acceptable outcomes. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A591.",medical,Gastroenterology

Towards this end, 40 healthy controls and 80 schizophrenia patients were investigated with six tests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), assessing spatial working memory, paired-association learning, one touch stocking, rapid visual information (RVP), emotional recognition test and intra/extradimensional set shifting. The Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAMA) Rating Scales and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) as well as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were also used. There were highly significant associations between all 6 CANTAB tests and HDRS, HAMA and CDSS (except RVP) scores. The most significant items associating with neurocognitive impairments in schizophrenia were self-depreciation (CDSS), fatigue, psychomotor retardation and agitation, psychic and somatic anxiety (HDRS), fears, cognitive symptoms, somatic-muscular, genito-urinary and autonomic symptoms and anxious behavior (HAMA). The selected HDRS and HAMA symptoms indicate fatigue, fears, anxiety, agitation, retardation, somatization and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) and are therefore labeled “FAARS”. Up to 28.8% of the variance in the 6 CANTAB measurements was explained by FAARS, which are better predictors of neurocognitive impairments than the PANSS negative subscale score. Neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia are best predicted by FAARS combined with difficulties in abstract thinking.

Efficient decision trees for multi-class support vector machines using entropy and generalization error estimation,"Kantavat P., Kijsirikul B., Songsiri P., Fukui K.-I., Numao M.",2018-01-01,"10-fold cross-validation, Fast classification, Generalization Error, Generalization error estimations, Multi-class classification, Multi-class support vector machines, Traditional techniques, UCI machine learning repository, decision tree, entropy, generalization error, multi-class classification, support vector machine","We propose new methods for support vector machines using a tree architecture for multi-class classification. In each node of the tree, we select an appropriate binary classifier, using entropy and generalization error estimation, then group the examples into positive and negative classes based on the selected classifier, and train a new classifier for use in the classification phase. The proposed methods can work in time complexity between O(log 2 N) and O(N), where N is the number of classes. We compare the performance of our methods with traditional techniques on the UCI machine learning repository using 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the methods are very useful for problems that need fast classification time or those with a large number of classes, since the proposed methods run much faster than the traditional techniques but still provide comparable accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Engineering (miscellaneous), Applied Mathematics"

Materials and Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase III study, women were randomized 2:1 to receive EV/DNG or placebo tablets daily for seven 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume between the run-in and efficacy phases (90 days each). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of women with successful treatment (i.e., no episodes of MBL ≥80 mL and a decrease of <50% in MBL), percent change in MBL from the run-in phase, and change in hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study. Results: Of the 341 women (mean age 34.7 ± 7.7 years; 309 Asians, 32 non-Asians) randomized, 270 completed the study. Mean reduction in MBL volume from run-in phase was significantly greater with EV/DNG than placebo (366.75 mL vs. 149.14 mL; p < 0.0001), with ∼52% and 12% of women, respectively, experiencing successful treatment. Percent decrease in MBL volume from the run-in phase was significantly greater with EV/DNG than placebo (63.5% vs. 24.8%; p < 0.0001). Hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were increased with EV/DNG compared with placebo. Study drug-related AEs were reported in 16.3% and 8.2% of women with EV/DNG and placebo, respectively, none of which were of severe intensity. Conclusions: EV/DNG may be a safe and effective option in the treatment of HMB in Asian and non-Asian women who desire contraception.",medical,Medicine (all)

This creates a new problem of space and time complexities where the incoming data can overflow the memory of an analysing machine and the flow of data may contain some scattered portions of data from different clusters. This situation leads to the incorrect clustering results. The challenge of the clustering on streaming data is clustering the data which continuously growing, unstable, and non-existent from time to time. This paper proposed the concept of discard-after-cluster based on the structure of adaptive hyper-elliptic micro-cluster components. Instead of gradually including each datum into its true cluster, a newly proposed set of algorithms capture the data in forms streaming batch and identify the cluster afterwards. The number of micro-clusters can be increased or decreased according to the dynamical distribution of incoming data as well as the overlap conditions of micro-clusters. A set of new recursive functions for updating parameters, checking overlap conditions, removing micro-clusters, and merging micro-clusters after discarding previously clustered data were introduced. The proposed algorithm was tested on synthetic and real data sets. The elliptic-micro-cluster structure is more suitable for capturing data than the other structures in the compared previous methods. In addition, our method named BEstream showed the more efficient results than the previous data stream clustering algorithms based on the rand index and normalized mutual information measures.",decision sciences,Information Systems and Management

The functional and safety properties of the strains were assessed by in vitro tests. The functional properties tested were their abilities in tolerating low pH values under simulated gastric conditions, their cell surface properties (hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation), antibacterial activity against the common enteric pathogenic bacteria in pigs (such as pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella Choleraesuis and Streptococcus suis), and diacetyl production. The safety of the strains was analyzed based on the absent of haemolysis on blood and bile salt hydrolase activity. Although all strains demonstrated diacetyl production, good survivability and antibacterial activities, L. plantarum 22F and 25F showed the best performance with the strongest antibacterial actions against the indicator pathogens. Of the strains, only P. pentosaceus 77F exhibited haemolysis or bile salt hydrolase activity. Furthermore, a principal component analysis revealed that L. plantarum 22F possessed superior functional and safety aspects compared to the other four autochthonous strains and to reference strains L. plantarum JCM 1149 and P. acidilactici DSM 20284.

After long-term exposure to high temperature, γ' precipitate is known to exhibit catastrophic changes in size and distribution which cause deterioration of its properties and failure of the component. In this study, a damaged blade removed froma land-based gas turbine generator was subjected to nonpreheat- treated GTAW and laser welding repair with various welding powers in the range of 135 to 295 J × mm-1, followed by post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at 1473 K for 7200 s and strain aging at 1118 K for 86 400 s. Results show no significant relationship between welding powers, size and area fraction of the γ' precipitate in the fcc γ matrix in both GTAW and laser-welded specimens. The final γ' precipitate size and distribution depend mainly on PWHT parameters as γ' precipitates in all GTAW and laser welded specimens showed similar size and area fraction independently of the heat input from welding. Unmixed zones are observed in all laser welding specimens which may cause preferential weld corrosion during service. Microcrack occurrence due to welding and PWHT processes is also discussed.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Moreover, the inflammatory responses to both dressings were also deeply investigated. For in vivo study, expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines were intensely considered in the tissue interfacing area. The result showed that IL-4 and TGF-β from BCSP-treated tissue had advantages over Bactigras®-treated tissue at 14 and 21 days post-implantation. For clinical study, a single-blinded, randomized controlled study was generated. The half of STSG donor site wound was randomly assigned to cover with BCSP or Bactigras®. Twenty-one patients with 32 STSG donor site wounds were enrolled. The results showed that wound-healing time was not significantly different in both dressings. However, wound quality of BCSP was better than Bactigras® at healing time and after 1 month (p < 0.05). The pain scores of BCSP-treated wound were statistically significant lower than Bactigras®-treated wound (p < 0.05). No sign of infection or adverse event was observed after treatment with both dressings. In conclusion, the inflammation responses of the dressing were clearly clarified.

In a previous study, it was reported that two recombinant rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin (OsDEF) genes (OsDEF7 and OsDEF8) produced heterologously by bacteria inhibited the growth of several phytopathogen. Here, we analyzed gene expression patterns in Thai jasmine rice (O. sativa L. ssp. indica ‘KDML 105’) using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and compared them with those in Japanese rice (O. sativa L. ssp. japonica ‘Nipponbare’). Although the cultivars exhibited similar gene expression patterns at the developmental stages examined, the expression levels differed between organs. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs were highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection, suggesting that they play a role in pathogen defense. Moreover, in silico analyses revealed that OsDEF expression levels were affected by drought, cold, imbibition, anoxia, and dehydration stress. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, we found that both OsDEFs were in the extracellular compartment, confirming their functions against pathogen infection. However, when recombinant OsDEFs (without GFP) were produced in tobacco BY-2 cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, they could not be detected in either the culture medium or the cells. Yet, N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with OsDEF7 or OsDEF8 constructs exhibited in planta inhibitory activity against the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines, suggesting that recombinant OsDEFs were present. Additionally, when targeting them to the ER compartment, recombinant OsDEFs could be detected. Lower inhibitory activity was observed when recombinant OsDEFs were targeted to the ER. These results suggest that OsDEFs play a role in controlling plant diseases.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Genetics, Plant Science"

Although EMT involves alterations of cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules, the role of microtubules in EMT is not fully understood. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by microtubule-binding proteins, and one such protein is CAMSAP3, which binds the minus-end of microtubules. Here, we show that CAMSAP3 is important to preserve the epithelial phenotypes in lung carcinoma cells. Deletion of CAMSAP3 in human lung carcinoma-derived cell lines showed that CAMSAP3-deficient cells acquired increased mesenchymal features, mostly at the transcriptional level. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying these changes demonstrated that tubulin acetylation was dramatically increased following CAMSAP3 removal, leading to the upregulation of Akt proteins (also known as protein kinase B proteins, hereafter Akt) activity, which is known to promote EMT. These findings suggest that CAMSAP3 functions to protect lung carcinoma cells against EMT by suppressing Akt activity via microtubule regulation and that CAMSAP3 loss promotes EMT in these cells.",biochemistryistry,Cell Biology

Universum Selection for Boosting the Performance of Multiclass Support Vector Machines Based on One-versus-One Strategy,"Songsiri P., Cherkassky V., Kijsirikul B.",2018-11-01,"Binary support vector machines, Labeled training data, Multi-class classification, Multi-class support vector machines, Multiclass classification problems, one-versus-one, State-of-the-art algorithms, Universum support vector machine (USVM), multi-class classification, one-versus-one, Support vector machine (SVM), Universum support vector machine (USVM)","We propose a novel framework to enhance the performance of the one-versus-one support vector machine by using Universum. For solving a multiclass classification problem, one-versus-one is one of the state-of-the-art algorithms, which constructs N(N−1)/2 binary classifiers for an N-class problem. Each binary classifier is originally learned by two classes of data as positive and negative classes while the other N−2 remaining classes are ignored, even if they might also represent a hidden concept of the application domain and can help to boost the performance of the classifier. Vapnik et al. [20, 21] introduced Universum binary support vector machines to enable the use of samples that do not belong to positive and negative classes and called these samples Universum samples. However, not all Universum samples can be helpful; moreover, improper selection of Universum samples can prevent the construction of an effective binary classifier. For the construction of a Universum binary classifier in the one-versus-one strategy, there are 2N−2 candidate subsets of classes of Universum data; a proper selection of them can be difficult, based on the number of classes. We design an algorithm to obtain a suitable subset of classes of Universum data by applying the proposed performance measure that reflects the properties of Universum data relative to labeled training data. This measure is based on the analysis of the projection of Universum data onto the normal direction vector of the standard binary SVM hyperplane. We demonstrate experimentally that our proposed strategy outperforms existing methods.","computer science, Business, decision sciences","Software, Management Information Systems, Information Systems and Management, Artificial Intelligence"

Abstract: Starch debranching enzyme (DBE) or isoamylase (ISA) (EC.3.2.1.68), an important enzyme in starch metabolism, catalyses the hydrolysis of α-1,6 glycosidic linkages of amylopectin. Isoforms of ISAs have been reported in higher plants and algae (Fujita et al. in Planta 208:283–293, 1999; Hussain et al. in Plant Cell 15:133–149, 2003; Ishizaki et al. in Agric Biol Chem 47:771–779, 1983; Mouille et al. in Plant Cell 8:1353–1366, 1996). In the current work, cassava ISA genes were isolated from cDNA generated from total RNA from tubers of Manihot esculanta Crantz cultivar KU50. MeISA1 and MeISA2 were successfully amplified and cloned into a pETDuet1 vector. The putative MeISA1 and MeISA2 proteins comprised 763 and 882 amino acids, with substantial similarity to StISA1 and StISA2 from potato (84.4% and 68.9%, respectively). Recombinant MeISA1 and MeISA2 were co-expressed in Escherichia coli SoluBL21 (DE3). HistrapTM-Purified rMeISA1 and rMeISA2 showed approximate molecular weights of 87 and 99 kDa, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. Debranching activity was only detectable in the column fractions where both recombinant ISA isoforms were present. The heteromeric DBE from crude extracts of 4–5 h induced cultures analysed by gel filtration chromatography and western blot showed combinations of rMeISA1 and rMeISA2 at ratios of 1:1 to 4:1. Pooled fractions with DBE activity were used for enzyme characterisation, which showed that the enzyme was specific for amylopectin, with optimum activity at 37 °C and pH 7.0. Enzyme activity was enhanced by Co2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, but was strongly inhibited by Cu2+. Debranched amylopectin products showed chain length distributions typical of plant DBE.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Agronomy and Crop Science, Genetics, Plant Science"

"The Development of Late-Stage Continental Breakup: Seismic Reflection and Borehole Evidence from the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia","Bastow I.D., Booth A.D., Corti G., Keir D., Magee C., Jackson C.A.L., Warren J., Wilkinson J., Lascialfari M.",2018-09-01,"Continental break-up, Continental rifting, Danakil, Ethiopia, Evaporites, Magmatic intrusions, rifting, Seismic reflections, borehole, Danakil, Ethiopia, evaporite, rifting, seismology","During continental breakup, the locus of strain shifts from a broad region of border faulting and ductile plate stretching to a narrow zone of magma intrusion in a young ocean basin. Recent studies of volcanic rifts and margins worldwide suggest this shift occurs subaerially, before the onset of seafloor spreading. We test this hypothesis using recently acquired seismic reflection and borehole data from the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, a unique region of transition between continental rifting and seafloor spreading. Our data, located near Dallol, ~30 km northwest of the Erta'Ale Volcanic Segment, reveal a remarkably thick (>1-km) sequence of young (~100-ka) evaporites in a basin bound by a major (≤400-m-throw), east-dipping normal fault. To generate such a large amount of subsidence in such a relatively short time, we propose that upper-crustal extension in Danakil is currently dominated by faulting, not magmatic intrusion. Given the region's markedly thinned crust (~15-km-thick), relative to elsewhere in Afar where magma-assisted rifting dominates and maintains crustal thickness at ~25 km, mechanical extension in Danakil is likely coupled with ductile extension of the lower-crust and mantle lithosphere. Despite proximity to the voluminous lavas of the active Erta'Ale Volcanic Segment, evidence for igneous material in the upper ~2 km of the 6- to 10-km-wide basin is limited. Late-stage stretching was likely aided by thermal/strain-induced lithospheric weakening following protracted magma-assisted rifting. Basin formation immediately prior to the onset of seafloor spreading may also explain the accumulation of thick marine-seepage-fed evaporite sequences akin to those observed, for example, along the South Atlantic rifted margins.","applied seismology, earth sciences","Geophysics, Geochemistry and Petrology"
Ultrasound evaluation of arterial anastomosis of the forehead,"Tansatit T., Phumyoo T., Jitaree B., Sawatwong W., Rungsawang C., Jiirasutat N., Sahraoui Y.M.E., Lee J.H.",2018-12-01,"Adult, Arteries, Female, Forehead, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Ophthalmic Artery, Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color, Young Adult, arterial anastomosis, filler injection, forehead arteries, ocular complication","Background: Color Doppler ultrasound has a potential role as an imaging guide in aiding filler injections which are blinded procedures. Objective: This study investigated the forehead arteries and provided insight into their anastomoses. This was performed by challenging their function to provide blood through these anastomoses when the main artery was temporary occluded by compression. Methods: Three arteries were identified on each side of the forehead, the supratrochlear, the supraorbital and the superficial temporal arteries. Under ultrasound monitoring, each target artery and corresponding anastomosis was studied separately by compressions performed in a sequential and accumulative manner. Results: Data from the current study imply that accidental cannulation of either the supratrochlear artery or the supraorbital artery can cause ophthalmic artery embolization in every case recorded. If the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery is cannulated, the chance of blindness as a complication occurs in one fifth of volunteers. Anastomosis between both sides of the terminal branches of ophthalmic arteries creates the possibility of bilateral ocular complications when accidental cannulation occurs at one of these branches, especially the supratrochlear artery. Thus, injury to the supratrochlear artery carries a greater risk of complication than the supraorbital artery. Conclusion: These findings emphasize that the chance of ocular complication is less when accidental cannulation occurs at the superficial temporal artery compared with injury to the supratrochlear or the supraorbital arteries as the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery. Ultrasound can assist in the identification and evaluation of all the arteries at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of vascular complications.",medical,Dermatology

Purpose: To estimate doses and risks for dental radiological examinations in children. Material and methods: A pediatric population consisting of 7150 children and young adults which underwent 12252 dental radiological examinations (4220 intraoral, 1324 cephalometric, 5284 panoramic radiographs and 1424 CBCTs) within two years were included. Two groups were studied: CBCT group (exposed to CBCT ± conventional radiographs) and 2D group (exposed only to 2D radiological examinations). The effective doses were corrected according to age at exposure and settings parameters (mA;FOV) by using logarithmic fit equations for dose interpolation. The individual cumulative dose, per-caput collective dose and radiation risk were calculated for each group. Results: The median effective and cumulative doses for conventional radiographs were lower than 20 μSv and did not vary with age. Children exposed to CBCT had a higher median effective dose (127.2 μSv) and cumulative dose (156.5 μSv) with a significant increased cumulative dose between 11 and 14 years. The CBCT contributed with 70% to the collective dose and per caput collective dose was 184 μSv for CBCT exposures. The Life Attributable Risk (LAR) and Relative Radiation Level (RRL) were significantly higher for children exposed to CBCT under the age of 18. The highest radiation dose for CBCT was equivalent with 34.1 days of natural background radiation and it was found for ages between 11 and 15. Conclusion: The CBCT doses and radiation risk vary but remain in the lower levels of the relative risk of medical exposures.","toxicology; clinical toxicology (by agent); industrial and environmentalronmental pollutants; radiation and radionuclides, medical","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The MA units in the copolymer serve as built-in feature for multiple functionalization, namely introducing additional thiol groups as active sites for binding with the AuNRs and conjugating with doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug via acid-labile hydrazone linkage. The MPC units, on the other hand, provide biocompatibility and antifouling characteristics. The chemically modified PMAMPC can act as an effective stabilizer for AuNRs yielding PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs with a fairly uniform size and shape with good colloidal stability. In vitro cytotoxicity suggested that PMAMPC can not only improve the AuNRs biocompatibility, but also decrease DOX toxicity to a certain extent. The PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs were efficiently internalized inside cancer cells and localized in lysosomes, where DOX was presumably acid-triggered released as monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the combined photothermal-chemo treatment of cancer cells using PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs exhibited a higher therapeutic efficacy than either single treatment alone. These results suggested that the PMAMPC-DOX-AuNRs could potentially be applied in pH-triggered drug delivery for synergistic cancer therapy.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery"

Methods: A total of 121 Thai patients with HBeAg-negative CHB recruited from a previous randomized trial of 48-week PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir were enrolled. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcrAg levels were serially examined. Paired biopsy samples taken at baseline and after treatment were assessed for intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Results: Persistent virologic remission (PVR, defined by persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <2000 IU/mL) and HBsAg clearance at 3 years after treatment were 29% (35/121) and 9% (11/121) respectively. Baseline HBcrAg correlated with HBV DNA and cccDNA but not with HBsAg. Baseline HBsAg, as well as HBsAg and HBcrAg, declines were associated with PVR, while HBsAg decline was predictive of HBsAg clearance. High baseline antigen levels (HBsAg ≥3.4 log10 IU/mL plus HBcrAg ≥3.7 log10 U/mL) yielded high negative predictive values of PVR (45/50, 90%) and HBsAg clearance (50/50, 100%). At week 12, declines of HBsAg, HBcrAg and both antigens combined of <0.5 log10 yielded negative predictive values for PVR of 90% (71/79), 82% (61/74) and 96% (48/50) respectively. Conclusions: Quantitative HBcrAg was significantly associated with cccDNA in HBeAg-negative CHB. This novel antigen, together with HBsAg, could identify patients with low probability of PVR and HBsAg clearance in long-term follow-up.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Materials and Methods: A total of 287 nonduplicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates, which were at least resistant to one of the carbapenems, were identified and detected for carbapenemase genes by multiplex PCR covering blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaOXA-48-like. All positive genes were then sequenced. These isolates were phenotypically tested for the production of carbapenemases by mCIM and Carba NP tests to evaluate the efficacy of these methods. Results: Seven species of carbapenem-resistant isolates mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae were detected. Of these isolates, three families of carbapenemase genes, including blaNDM (blaNDM-1, -4, -5, -9), blaOXA (blaOXA-48, -181, -232), and blaIMP-14, were found. Of these, 223 (77.70%) carried at least one of the carbapenemase genes. The blaNDM was detected in 160/223 (71.75%) isolates, of which 153/160 (95.63%) were the blaNDM-1. Three types of the blaOXA-48-like group, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-181, and blaOXA-232, were found, 91/104 (87.5%) harbored the blaOXA-232. In addition, 25.11% (56/223) of the carbapenemase-producing isolates harbored a combination of blaNDM and blaOXA-48-like. Phenotypic detection methods, mCIM and Carba NP, showed 100% sensitivity and specificity to blaNDM, blaIMP-14, and blaOXA-48, while the mCIM was positive in all blaOXA-181 and blaOXA-232 isolates, only 12.5% (1/8) and 28.95% (11/38), respectively, were detected by the Carba NP test. Conclusions: This study revealed a unique prevalence of carbapenemase genes in Bangkok, Thailand, as well as demonstrated the efficacy and limitation of phenotypic detection methods of carbapenemase in the area where blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-232 were predominant.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, pharmacology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Pharmacology, Microbiology (medical)"

We aimed to determine discordances in genotypic drug resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs) between blood plasma and semen or rectal secretions among newly diagnosed, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, HIV-1-infected Thai men who have sex with men (MSM). Blood plasma, semen, and rectal secretions of HIV-1-infected Thai MSM enrolled from the Test and Treat cohort were tested for genotypic mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. Seven participants with baseline DRAMs in blood plasma were included in this analysis. In anogenital samples, HIV-1 RNA could be fully amplified for DRAMs assessment in semen from three participants and in rectal secretions from four participants. DRAMs were identified in semen from two of three participants and in rectal secretions from four of four participants. Three participants had DRAMs in anogenital compartments that were not detected in blood plasma - one had DRAMs in semen that was not detected in blood plasma (I54FI) and two had DRAMs in rectal secretions that was not detected in blood plasma (I47IM; K70N, L74I, Y115F, M184V, K103N, V108I, and H221Y). Discordance in DRAMs between blood plasma and anogenital compartments is not uncommon among newly diagnosed, ART-naive, HIV-1-infected Thai MSM. Monitoring of drug-resistant virus in these vector compartments is warranted particularly as pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment as prevention are increasingly used as the mainstay strategies to end the AIDS epidemic.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Virology, Infectious Diseases"

The results showed that metal concentrations in sediments (4.05–7.14, 16.68–18.13, 164–213 mg kg −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) and water samples (0.16–0.44, 0.15–0.26, and 0.32–0.48 mg L −1 for Cd, Pb, and Zn, respectively) were below the threshold effects concentration of the sediment quality guidelines for adverse effects to occur and the marine water quality standards of Thailand. A human risk assessment was performed and the results showed that the risks associated with M. optima consumption at Saphan Hin and Paklok were negligible for most of the metals studied, with the maximum estimated daily intake value being observed for Zn (0.00663 mg kg −1 per day) at Saphan Hin. In addition, Cd, Zn, Pb, and Hg would be unlikely to pose a risk to human health with a hazard quotient of less than 1, with only the bioaccumulation factor of Zn being detectable in both locations (0.034 and 0.026 at Saphan Hin and Paklok, respectively).

Design/methodology/approach: The maintenance management plan consists of plans for three levels of management: strategy, tactical and operational maintenance plans. The Deming cycle is a continuous improvement tool use for controlling and monitoring activities of the plans. There are three Deming cycles according to these plans, the first of which involves the improvement of machine performance and investment evaluation. The second involves the improvement of plans, schedule, and activities of preventive maintenance including autonomous maintenance. The third is for human resource development on maintenance works. Moreover, the feedback of a prior round of each cycle comes early to detect abnormalities that provide better capability in maintenance. Findings: Three Deming cycles can use for enhancing the maintenance management. The parameters are availability (A) of machines and the capability process (Cpk) of the transportation process. The results of this research state that the availability value of machines increases to 80-92 percent while the process capability value increases to 0.56. Practical implications: The maintenance management, especially strategic plan, tactical plan and operational plan via the Deming cycle, can be implemented in other medium-sized industries with limited technology and personnel. It was found that the implementation of the plans has continued to progress with the Deming cycle. Originality/value: This paper proposes how to successfully implement the maintenance management for medium-sized industries with limited technology and personnel. The maintenance management of three levels is carried out simultaneously by using the Deming cycle.

The structure of synthesized geopolymer was found to be highly amorphous due to the dissolution of fly ash phase. Moreover, the fly ash geopolymer powder has higher surface area compares to original fly ash with specific surface area of 85.01 m2/g and 0.83 m2/g, respectively. For this reason, the geopolymer powder has much higher removal efficiency compared to the original fly ash powder. The removal efficiency was affected by contact time, geopolymer amount, heavy metal initial concentration, pH, and temperature. The four heavy metals were chosen (Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Cd2+) for adsorption test. The highest heavy metal removal capacity was obtained at pH 5. The geopolymer powder adsorbed metal cations in the order of Pb2+>Cu2+>Cd2+>Ni2+. In addition, Langmuir model is more suitable for fly ash geopolymer powder adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution than Freundlich model. The results showed that the fly ash geopolymer powder has high efficiency for removal metal which could be employed excellent alternative for wastewater treatment.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The primary outcome was Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) at six and 12 months, and the secondary outcomes included renal SLEDAI, non-renal SLEDAI, modified SLEDAI-2K, immunity SLEDAI, and disease activity remission. Eighty-four patients were randomized. One patient who was randomized to the TAC group withdrew from the study immediately after randomization. Therefore, 42 patients received MMF and 41 patients received TAC. Disease activity remission rate and time to disease activity remission were similar in both groups. Twelve patients (28.57%) in the MMF group and 10 patients (24.39%) in the TAC group achieved disease activity remission. For disease activity scores, both regimens significantly improved SLEDAI-2K during induction and maintenance therapy. Overall, SLEDAI-2K score in the MMF group decreased more compared with the TAC group. In the MMF group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 11.6 ± 4.8 to 6.3 ± 3.9 after induction therapy and to 5.4 ± 4.4 after maintenance therapy. In the TAC group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 9.0 ± 3.7 to 6.3 ± 5.1 after induction therapy and to 7.1 ± 5.4 after maintenance therapy. Renal SLEDAI and modified SLEDAI-2K showed a similar pattern with SLEDAI-2K. In non-renal SLEDAI and immunity SLEDAI, both regimens also resulted in decreased disease activity scores during the first two months. After that the scores were slightly increased. In the MMF group, the scores were still lower than baseline but in the TAC group were not. In conclusion, disease activity remission rate was similar in the MMF and TAC groups. For disease activity score as measured by SLEDAI-2K, TAC was comparable with MMF during induction but MMF was more effective on disease activity of active LN classes III and IV at 12 months, especially in the renal system.",medical,Rheumatology

Conclusion: The range of PROMs used in clinical studies of patients with OLP is wide and include instruments for oral symptoms, psychosocial status and quality of life. The vast majority of these instruments have no evidence of psychometric properties and interpretability for patients with OLP. Further qualitative and validation studies are required to investigate whether these instruments are appropriate for use in this patient population.","genergyal, otorhinolaryngology, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Cancer Research, Periodontics"

They are useful in agricultural and industrial applications. Their antagonistic activities against postharvest pathogens make them suitable bioagents for the postharvest preservation of fruits and vegetables, while they possess antimicrobial activities against bacteria and fungi. Additionally, A. pullulans appears to be a potent source of single-cell protein. Many strains of A. pullulans harbor a wide range of industrially important enzymes, while the trademark exopolysaccharide pullulan that they produce has been extensively studied and is currently used in many applications. They also produce poly (β-l-malic acid), heavy oil liamocins, siderophore, and aubasidan-like β-glucan which are of interest for future applications. Ongoing studies suggest that A. pullulans holds many more interesting properties capable of further potential biotechnological applications.",Immunology,Microbiology
Synergistic study between CaO and MgO sorbents for hydrogen rich gas production from the pyrolysis-gasification of sugarcane leaves,"Bunma T., Kuchonthara P.",2018-08-01,"Gasification temperatures, Oxygenated compounds, Pyrolysis gasifications, Sorption-enhanced hydrogen productions, Steam gasification, Synergistic effect, Volatile components, Water gas shift (WGS) reaction, Catalyst and sorbent, Pyrolysis, Sorption-enhanced hydrogen production (SEHP), Steam-gasification","This study focused on investigating the sorption-enhanced hydrogen (H2)-rich gas production during the pyrolysis-steam gasification of biomass in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The mixed CaO/MgO sorbents were employed in order to enhance the H2 production through the water-gas shift reaction associated with the capturing of CO2. The CaO/MgO sorbents prepared by dry- and wet-physical mixing with different molar ratios were examined. In addition, the effect of different devolatilization temperatures (400–800 °C) and gasification temperatures (600–800 °C) on the H2 yield were explored. It was found that the dry-mixed CaO/MgO sorbent exhibited a synergistic effect in the pyrolysis-steam gasification of the biomass, where a CaO:MgO molar ratio of 2:1 gave the highest H2 yield (16.8 mmol/gbiomass) and H2 concentration (75.0%). The wet-mixed sorbent gave superior results, affording a higher H2 yield (21.2 mmol/gbiomass) and H2 concentration (79.8%) with the same CaO: MgO molar ratio of 2:1. The CO2 yield was also reduced to 1.14 mmol/gbiomass compared to that with the dry mixed sorbent (1.72 mmol/gbiomass). The oxygenated compounds mainly derived at the devolatilization temperature of 600 °C were conceivably preferable to the sorption-enhanced hydrogen production in the gasification, leading to the highest yield and concentration of H2. Increasing the gasification temperature above 600 °C provided a higher H2 yield but caused a lower H2 concentration. A comprehensive discussion on these aspects related to volatile components released from different temperatures and reactivity of sorbents is provided.","mixing and separation, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

The responses of various zeolites towards SO2 were investigated through the change in the electrical conductivity during the exposure to SO2 under the effects of the zeolite type, cation type, and Si/Al ratio. The zeolites were characterized by BET, FT-IR, XRD, and AAS techniques. Among all zeolites, the NH4 +ZSM-5 with the Si/Al ratio of 23 (NH4 +ZSM-5 (23)) showed the highest positive response towards SO2 with full reversibility. The cyclic response and the SO2 concentration dependence were also investigated. The relative response increased with increasing SO2 concentration. The NH4 +ZSM-5 (23) exhibited a reliable relative response towards SO2 down to 50 ppm. Furthermore, the pristine NH4 +ZSM-5 (23) was ion-exchanged with metal chloride solutions (NaCl, MgCl2, or AlCl3) to study the effect of ion valence on the sensing performance of the ion-exchanged zeolites. The ion-exchanged zeolite with Al3+ possessed the higher relative response towards SO2 at the same ion-exchange percentage than Mg2+ and Na+ due to its higher ionic charge and electronegativity. The interactions among the zeolites and the SO2 molecules were examined and proposed via infrared spectroscopy.

Iloprost is a synthetic prostacyclin that promotes angiogenesis. A three-dimensional culture that mimics the in vivo condition has been used in tissue engineering. This study investigated the effect of iloprost on promoting dental pulp angiogenesis by using the tooth slice organ culture system. Methods: Tooth slices with intact pulp tissue were cut from molars extracted from 12 patients. Dental pulp tissue viability was determined by live/dead staining. The tooth slices were cultured with iloprost for 1 or 3 days. The microvessel density and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Collagen density was determined by using Masson trichrome and immunofluorescent staining. Results: The pulp tissue in the tooth slices remained viable when cultured in serum-free medium. Iloprost increased the microvessel density as shown by a higher number of von Willebrand factor–positive cells. A significant increase in vascular endothelial growth factor expression was observed in the tooth slices cultured with iloprost. Iloprost stimulated collagen deposition, and this effect was abolished after inhibition of protein kinase A activity. Conclusions: Human tooth slices provide a valuable and easy-to-obtain model to investigate the effect of bioactive molecules used in dental pulp regeneration. This study showed for the first time that tooth slices could be kept viable under serum-free conditions for up to 3 days. Iloprost promoted angiogenesis, increased new vessel formation, and induced collagen deposition. This study proposes the clinical value of iloprost as a drug for inducing angiogenesis that can increase the success of pulp regeneration.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Therefore, this paper proposes an approximate equation of equivalent attractive radius in a simplified term. This will be investigated through a Generic model (GM) of a vertical conducting rod. Moreover, the result of this equation will be compared focusing on accuracy with the high correctness solution of numerical calculation, such as the midpoint method. As a result, these should be equivalent due to the absolute error of no more than one percent. Furthermore, the result of R-{ao}(h) through this equation, can be analyzed by the number of strikes per year (Ns), which corresponds with the actual experimental data. Also, the approximate equation in this paper is appropriately utilized to be practical. Finally, correlation of the approximate equation will analyze R-{ao}(h) and Ns of a tall building, namely the Khema-pirataram temple, to evaluate the risk due to lightning flashes to the top of the structure.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

An increase in the detection rate of SVA in several countries suggests that the disease has become a widespread problem. Herein, we report the detection of SVA in Thailand and the characterization of full-length genomic sequences of six Thai SVA isolates. Phylogenetic, genetic, recombination, and evolutionary analyses were performed. The full-length genome, excluding the poly (A) tail of the Thai SVA isolates, was 7282 nucleotides long, with the genomic organization resembling other previously reported SVA isolates. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses based on full-length genome demonstrated that the Thai SVA isolates were grouped in a novel cluster, separated from SVA isolates from other countries. Although the Thai SVA isolates were closely related to 11-55910-3, the first SVA isolate from Canada, with 97.9–98.2%, but they are different. Evolutionary and recombinant analyses suggested that the Thai SVA isolates shared a common ancestor with the 11-55910-3 isolate. The positive selection in the VP4 and 3D genes suggests that the virus was not externally introduced, but rather continuously evolved in the population prior to the first detection. Addition, the presence of SVA could have been ignored due to the presence of other pathogens causing similar clinical diseases. This study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the SVA in Thailand.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The tuberous roots of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica contain isoflavonoids and are widely used as dietary supplements and in therapeutics. The present study was aimed at producing reliable sources of isoflavonoids from single Pueraria cells and at optimizing a culture medium with increased biomass and isoflavonoid content. The medium optimized for prolonged maintenance of callus was MS medium supplemented with 200 mg/L KH2PO4, 1 mg/L thiamine HCl, 100 mg/L of myo-inositol with 0.2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and subculturing for 30 days for the highest growth. The amount of isoflavonoids varied among calli obtained from different explants. The highest amounts of puerarin and daidzein were quantified as 0.63 and 1.80 mg/g of dry weight (DW) in the examined suspension cell culture of single clones, whereas daidzein (0.50 mg/g) and genistein (0.03 mg/g) were present in the suspension cell culture obtained from a mixture of cells. The suspension of cell cultures from the same origin gave comparable amounts of isoflavonoids, but cells from different sources showed varied amounts of isoflavonoids. The amount of isoflavonoid also varied depending on the cell age. The present study provided the first evidence of Pueraria cell suspension from single cells and highlighted the importance of screening the starting cells from a single cell line and the cell age prior to the scale-up process to select desired sources of isoflavonoid compounds.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Horticulture

Publications were systematically searched in several databases from 1980 to December 2016. Relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were retrieved and assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers. Quality of evidence was assessed and rated according to GRADE guidelines. Eight randomized controlled trials and three non-randomized controlled trials were included in this review, of which 10 were rated as high-quality studies. The break programs were highly heterogeneous with work duration ranging from 5 min to 2 h and break duration ranging from 20 s to 30 min. The results showed low-quality evidence for the conflicting effect of breaks on pain and low-quality evidence for the positive effect of breaks on discomfort. When stratified by type of breaks, moderate-quality evidence was found for the positive effect of active breaks with postural change for pain and discomfort. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that the use of breaks had no detrimental effect on work productivity. More high-quality studies are needed before recommendations can be given. Within a number of methodological limitations that are present in the published studies, active breaks with postural change may be effective in reducing pain in workers with acute low back pain and to prevent discomfort in healthy subjects.","occupational Health Professionsth and industrial medicalcine, fluidex; related topics, sociology, Health Professions, engineering","Human Factors and Ergonomics, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of anxiety in MAFD, namely bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), and MAFD characteristics and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Recruited were 82 participants with anxiety disoders and 83 without anxiety disoders, including 101 MAFD patients and 51 healthy controls. We used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) to measure severity of anxiety and made the diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and phobias. The HAM-A score is significantly predicted by higher number of depressive episodes, GAD and phobias, childhood trauma, tobacco use disorder, metabolic syndrome and lowered HDL-cholesterol. Increased HAM-A scores are, independently from severity of depression, associated with lowered quality of life, increased disabilities and suicidal ideation. Lithium treatment significantly lowers HAM-A scores. It is concluded that severity of anxiety significantly worsens the phenomenology of MAFD. Therefore, treatments of MAFD should target increased severity of anxiety and its risk factors including low HDL-cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, childhood trauma and tobacco use disorder.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Existing national and international guidelines for the treatment of adult spastic paresis tend to focus on the treatment of muscle overactivity rather than the comprehensive approach to care, which may require life-long management. Person-centered care is increasingly adopted by healthcare systems in a shift of focus from ""disease-oriented"" towards ""person-centered"" medicine. The challenge is to apply this principle to the complex management of spastic paresis and to include an educative process that engages care providers and patients and encourages them to participate actively in the long-term management of their own disease. To address this issue, a group of 13 international clinicians and researchers used a pragmatic top-down methodology to evaluate the evidence and to formulate and grade the strength of recommendations for applying the principles of person-centered care to the management of spastic paresis. There is a distinct lack of clinical trial evidence regarding the application of person-centered medicine to the rehabilitation setting. However, the current evidence base supports the need to ensure that treatment interventions for spastic paresis should be centered on as far as reasonable on the patient's own priorities for treatment. Goal setting, negotiation and formal recording of agreed SMART goals should be an integral part of all spasticity management programs, and goal attainment scaling should be recorded alongside other standardized measures in the evaluation of outcome. When planning interventions for spastic paresis, the team should consider the patient and their family's capacity for self-rehabilitation, as well as ways to enhance this approach. Finally, the proposed intervention and treatment goals should consider the impact of any neuropsychological, cognitive and behavioral deficits on rehabilitation. These recommendations support a person-centric focus in the management of spastic paresis.","Health Professions, medical","Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation"

Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of PmDDX41, the first cytosolic DNA sensor in shrimp. By searching a Penaeus monodon expressed sequence tag (EST) database (http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th), three cDNA fragments exhibiting similarity to DDX41 in various species were identified and assembled, resulting in a complete open reading frame of PmDDX41 that contains 1863-bp and encodes a putative protein of 620 amino acids. PmDDX41 shares 83% and 79% similarity to DDX41 homolog from the bee Apis florea and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, respectively and contains three conserved domains in the protein: DEADc domain, HELICc domain, and zinc finger domain. The transcript of PmDDX41 was detected in all tested tissues and was up-regulated upon infection with a DNA virus, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). However, PmDDX41 mRNA expression was not significantly changed and down-regulated in response to a bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, or an RNA virus, yellow head virus (YHV), respectively, compared with the control phosphate-buffered saline-injected shrimp. Furthermore, the suppression of PmDDX41 by dsRNA-mediated gene silencing resulted in more rapid death of WSSV-infected shrimp and a significant decrease in the mRNA expression levels of several immune-related genes (PmIKKβ, PmIKKɛ, PmRelish, PmCactus, PmDorsal, PmPEN3, PmPEN5, and ALFPm6). These results suggest that PmDDX41 is involved in the antiviral response, probably via a DNA-sensing pathway that is triggered through the IκB kinase complex and leads to the activation of several immune-related genes.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

Tailings were collected from four pits from 0 to 16 m depth, approximately. The samples were divided into the three types, based on their position in the tailings and on other physical characteristics, of the sulphide (c. 5 m depth), mixing (c. 1m depth) and oxide (c. 10 m depth) zones. This study was primarily concerned with the concentrations of As and Mn, which were found to exceed the Thailand Industrial Effluent Standard (TIES) in the tailings from all zones. Principal component analysis revealed that the release of metals and As from the tailings under acidic conditions, as well as the metals and As mobility, was mainly controlled by the pH and redox conditions. Moreover, the first principal component had high positive loadings of Mn, Pb, Co and Ni (R2 > 0.80), indicating that these four metals are either released into the environment from a common source or/and their geochemical behaviour in the aqueous phase is similar.","wastewater and other effluent/liquid waste engineeringn., groundwater problems and environmentalronmental effects, chemistry, environmental, earth sciences","Chemistry (all), Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology, Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

Theoretical analysis of orientations and tautomerization of genistein in β-cyclodextrin,"Hanpaibool C., Chakcharoensap T., Arifin, Hijikata Y., Irle S., Wolschann P., Kungwan N., Pongsawasdi P., Ounjai P., Rungrotmongkol T.",2018-09-01,"Density functional tight bindings, Genistein, Inclusion complex, Molecular dynamics simulations, Tautomerizations, Umbrella sampling, Density-functional tight-binding, Genistein, Inclusion complex, Keto-enol tautomerization, Molecular dynamics simulation, Umbrella sampling, β-Cyclodextrin","Genistein is an isoflavone with promising pharmaceutical applications. However, its low water solubility interferes with its potency, and therefore cyclodextrins (CDs) have been considered as possible drug delivery system (DDS). To investigate the complexation mechanism of genistein in cyclodextrin, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on classical potentials and the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) quantum chemical potential. Both classical and quantum chemical MD simulations predict that the phenol ring of genistein is preferentially complexed in the cavity of CD. The complexation process reduces the water-accessible solvation shell, and it is found that a hydrogen bond is formed between genistein and CD. The DFTB-based MD simulations reveal that spontaneous keto-enol tautomerization occurs even within a hundred picoseconds, which suggests that the encapsulated genistein is complexed in the ordinary enol form of the drug molecule. Analyses of the molecular charge distributions suggest that electrostatic interactions partially induce the complex formation, rather than extensive formation of hydrogen bonds.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst could reduce the acidity strength especially the strong acid site. As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, addition of In by impregnation on Pt/Mg(Al)O also led to the formation of metallic In and PtIn alloy, which greatly enhanced the catalyst activity and reduced coke formation on the support. Nevertheless, excessive In loading (i.e., Pt1.0In) resulted in a descending trend of catalyst activity compared to the Pt0.8In, due probably to the large amount of metallic In being formed, which was disadvantageous in propane dehydrogenation.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

This study investigated the expression profile of HPV16 E1 in various stages of cervical cancer development and the factors that control E1 expression. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four HPV16-positive cervical samples ranging from normal to CIN 1, CIN 2/3, and SCC lesions were studied. E1 mRNA expression was determined by ddPCR. Methylation of promoters p97 and p670 was quantified by pyrosequencing, while PCR, qPCR, and sequencing were used to determine the physical state and variations of the HPV16 E1 genome. Results: Increased E1 mRNA expression related to disease progression (normal 0.18, CIN 1 0.41, CIN 2/3 0.65, and SCC 0.79) was demonstrated with a significant positive correlation (r = 0.661, p = 0.019). No association between physical state and E1 expression was found. Methylation of p97 and p670 promoters showed significant elevation in SCC compared to normal samples. Only 4.2% showed genomic variations of HPV16 E1 63-bp duplication. Conclusion: E1 may play a role in cancer development. The detection of E1 mRNA and promoter methylation may be useful as cancer prognostic markers.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Examples of microfluidic devices coupled with infrared spectroscopy have been limited, however, largely due to the difficulties associated with fabricating systems in common infrared transparent materials like CaF2. Recent reports have shown that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can be used as an IR transparent substrate when fabricated with thin layers. The use of soft lithography with PDMS expands the library of possible designs that can be achieved for IR measurements in microfluidics. In initial reports with thin PDMS, the target analytes were small molecules; however, IR spectroscopy offers a powerful tool to study protein structure and reactions. Here, a PDMS microfluidic device compatible with IR spectroscopy was fabricated by means of spin-coating of PDMS pre-polymer to obtain thin PDMS microfluidic features. The device was comprised of only PDMS and IR absorption of PDMS was significantly minimized due to the thickness (∼40 μm) of the PDMS layer. The use of thin PDMS allowed for measuring the amide I and II vibrational bands of proteins that have been difficult to measure in other microfluidic devices. To demonstrate the power of the system, the microfluidic device was successfully used to measure the enzyme kinetics as one class of important biochemical reactions with broad use in a variety of fields from medicine to biotechnology. As a model, the reaction of glucose oxidase with glucose was tracked by following the formation of gluconic acid. Michaelis-Menten kinetics from the device were compared with bulk solution measurements and found to be in good agreement.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, process equipment, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

However, no previous study examined whether TRYCAT pathway activation is associated with deficit schizophrenia. We measured IgA responses to TRYCATs, namely quinolinic acid, picolinic acid, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, and anthranilic acid and 3-OH-kynurenine, in 40 healthy controls and in schizophrenic patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit, defined according to the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS). Primary deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by an activated TRYCAT pathway as compared to controls and nondeficit schizophrenia. Participants with deficit schizophrenia show increased IgA responses to xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid, and quinolinic acid and relatively lowered IgA responses to kynurenic and anthranilic acids, as compared to patients with nondeficit schizophrenia. Both schizophrenia subgroups show increased IgA responses to 3-OH-kynurenine as compared to controls. The IgA responses to noxious TRYCATs, namely xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid, quinolinic acid, and 3-OH-kynurenine, but not protective TRYCATS, namely anthranilic acid and kunyrenic acid, are significantly higher in deficit schizophrenia than in controls. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are significantly and positively associated with increased IgA responses directed against picolinic acid and inversely with anthranilic acid, whereas no significant associations between positive symptoms and IgA responses to TRYCATs were found. In conclusion, primary deficit schizophrenia is characterized by TRYCAT pathway activation and differs from nondeficit schizophrenia by a highly specific TRYCAT pattern suggesting increased excitotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress. The specific alterations in IgA responses to TRYCATs provide further insight for the biological delineation of deficit versus nondeficit schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Subjects and Methods: Physical and oral features were characterised. DNA was collected from an affected Thai family. Whole-exome sequencing was employed to identify the pathogenic variants associated with inherited orodental anomalies. The presence of the identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: We observed unique orodental manifestations including oligodontia, retained primary teeth, taurodont molars, peg-shaped maxillary central incisors, high attached frenum with nodule and midline diastema in the proband and her mother. Mutation analyses revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift deletion, c.573_574delCA, p.L193QfsX5, in exon 5 of PITX2A in affected family members. The amino acid alterations, localised in the transcriptional activation domain 2 in the C-terminus of PITX2, were evolutionarily conserved. Mutations in PITX2 have been associated with autosomal-dominant Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome and non-syndromic eye abnormalities, but never been found to cause isolated oral anomalies. Conclusions: This study for the first time demonstrates that the PITX2 mutation could lead to non-syndromic orodental anomalies in humans. We propose that the specific location in the C-terminal domain of PITX2 is exclusively necessary for tooth development.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

Hence, three-dimensional bio-engineered organoids are essential to regenerate the damaged SG. Herein, a recently validated three-dimensional (3D) biofabrication system, the magnetic 3D bioprinting (M3DB), is tested to generate innervated secretory epithelial organoids from a neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cell, the human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC). Cells are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and spatially arranged with magnet dots to generate 3D spheroids. Next, a SG epithelial differentiation stage was completed with fibroblast growth factor 10 (4–400 ng/ml) to recapitulate SG epithelial morphogenesis and neurogenesis. The SG organoids were then transplanted into ex vivo model to evaluate their epithelial growth and innervation. M3DB-formed spheroids exhibited both high cell viability rate (>90%) and stable ATP intracellular activity compared to MNP-free spheroids. After differentiation, spheroids expressed SG epithelial compartments including secretory epithelial, ductal, myoepithelial, and neuronal. Fabricated organoids also produced salivary α-amylase upon FGF10 stimulation, and intracellular calcium mobilization and trans-epithelial resistance was elicited upon neurostimulation with different neurotransmitters. After transplantation, the SG-like organoids significantly stimulated epithelial and neuronal growth in damaged SG. It is the first time bio-functional innervated SG-like organoids are bioprinted. Thus, this is an important step towards SG regeneration and the treatment of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia.","biophysicsics, bioengineeringneering and medicalcal instrumentation, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Mechanics of Materials"

Here, OsNUC1-S’s function was investigated using transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsNUC1-S. Under non-stress conditions, the transgenic lines showed a lower yield, but higher net photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates than wild type only in the second leaves, while in the flag leaves, these parameters were similar among the lines. However, under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage, the higher yields in transgenic lines were detected. Moreover, the gas exchange parameters of the transgenic lines were higher in both flag and second leaves, suggesting a role for OsNUC1-S overexpression in photosynthesis adaptation under salt-stress conditions. Moreover, the overexpression lines could maintain light-saturation points under salt-stress conditions, while a decrease in the light-saturation point owing to salt stress was found in wild type. Based on a transcriptome comparison between wild type and a transgenic line, after 3 and 9 days of salt stress, the significantly differentially expressed genes were enriched in the metabolic process of nucleic acid and macromolecule, photosynthesis, water transport, and cellular homeostasis processes, leading to the better performance of photosynthetic processes under salt-stress conditions at the booting stage.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

"In major affective disorders, early life trauma predict increased nitro-oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and recurrence of major affective disorders, suicidal behaviors and a lowered quality of life","Moraes J.B., Maes M., Roomruangwong C., Bonifacio K.L., Barbosa D.S., Vargas H.O., Anderson G., Kubera M., Carvalho A.F., Nunes S.O.V.",2018-08-01,"Adult, Adult Survivors of Child Abuse, Bipolar Disorder, Case-Control Studies, Catalase, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depressive Disorder, Female, Humans, Lipid Peroxidation, Male, Malondialdehyde, Middle Aged, Nitrosation, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidative Stress, Quality of Life, Recurrence, Suicidal Ideation, Suicide, Attempted, Superoxide Dismutase, Surveys and Questionnaires, Antioxidants, Bipolar disorder, Child abuse, Depressive disorder, Oxidative stress, Suicide","Early life trauma (ELT) may increase the risk towards bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MDD), disorders associated with activated neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways. It has remained elusive whether ELTs are associated with O&NS and which ELTs are associated with distinct affective disorder phenotypes. This case-control study examined patients with BD (n = 68) and MDD (n = 37) and healthy controls (n = 66). The Child Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used to assess specific ELT. We measured malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP); NO metabolites (NOx), paraoxonase 1 activity, zinc, albumin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and -SH groups and computed z-unit weighted composite scores. Physical neglect significantly predicts higher z-unit weighted composite scores of LOOH+SOD, LOOH+SOD+NOx, LOOH+SOD+NOx + MDA and LOOH+SOD+NOx + AOPP. Sexual abuse was associated with a significantly lower composite score of zinc+albumin+SH. Emotional abuse was associated with severity of depression and anxiety, number of depressive and manic episodes, alcohol and hypnotics use, lifetime suicidal behavior and lowered quality of life. Sexual abuse was associated with an increased risk towards BD, but not MDD. ELT, especially physical neglect, may drive increased (nitro-)oxidative stress coupled with lipid and protein oxidation, which - together with emotional abuse - may play a role in severity of illness, lowered quality of life and MDD. ELTs are also associated with the onset of BD, but this link did not appear to be related to activated O&NS pathways. These novel findings deserve confirmation in prospective studies.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; depression, biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Amphipol polymeric surfactants (APols) have been developed to replace conventional detergents in membrane-protein studies, but the role of free amphipol is unclear. It has previously been shown that the removal of free APol causes monodisperse outer membrane protein F (OmpF) to form long filaments. However, any remaining APol could not be resolved using electron microscopy. Here, small-angle neutron scattering with isotope contrast matching was used to separately determine the distributions of membrane protein and amphipol in a mixed sample. The data showed that after existing free amphipol had been removed from monodisperse complexes, a new equilibrium was established between protein–amphipol filaments and a pool of newly liberated free amphipol. The filaments consisted of OmpF proteins surrounded by a belt of Apol, whilst free oblate spheroid micelles of Apol were also present. No indications of long-range order were observed, suggesting a lack of defined structure in the filaments.","protein biochemistryistryhemistry; structural studies; molecular recognition; protein-membrane interaction, biochemistryistry",Structural Biology

We explore two series of 7 monocarboxylic DA monomers and the resulting PDAs, constituting systematic variation of alkyl chain length at the tail and carboxylic head group position. The shortening of DA alkyl tail causes a reduction of its melting temperature. The shortening of alkyl segment adjacent to the carboxylic head group, in contrary, causes the opposite effect. The DA monomer constituting the shortest alkyl segment exhibits the highest melting temperature. Infrared spectroscopy is utilized to probe the strength of local interactions within these DA assemblies. X-ray diffraction reveals the variation of segmental orientation within the lamella bilayer structure of these DAs and PDAs depending on the alkyl chain length. The change of alkyl length also affects morphology and particle size. The color-transition behaviors of these PDAs investigated upon exposure to heat, ethanol and NaOH show discrepancies. The thermochromic transition temperature of PDAs is consistent with the melting temperature of their DA precursors. Interestingly, perturbation of the systems by adding ethanol or NaOH results in rather different trends, attributed to different local interactions of these stimuli at the interfacial region.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Improving Thai word and sentence segmentation using linguistic knowledge,"Nararatwong R., Kertkeidkachorn N., Cooharojananone N., Okada H.",2018-12-01,"Conditional random field, Linguistic knowledge, Sentence segmentation, Splitting algorithms, Summarization, Thai, Topic extraction, Word segmentation, Summarization, Thai, Topic extraction, Translation, Word segmentation","Word boundary ambiguity in word segmentation has long been a fundamental challenge within Thai language processing. The Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is among the best-known methods to have achieved remarkably accurate segmentation. Nevertheless, current advancements appear to have left the problem of compound words unaccounted for. Compound words lose their meaning or context once segmented. Hence, we introduce a dictionary-based word-merging algorithm, which merges all kinds of compound words. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm can accomplish a high-accuracy of word segmentation, with compound words being preserved. Moreover, it can also restore some incorrectly segmented words. Another problem involving a different word-chunking approach is sentence boundary ambiguity. In tackling the problem, utilizing the part of speech (POS) of a segmented word has been found previously to help boost the accuracy of CRF-based sentence segmentation. However, not all segmented words can be tagged. Thus, we propose a POS-based word-splitting algorithm, which splits words in order to increase POS tags. We found that with more identifiable POS tags, the CRF model performs better in segmenting sentences. To demonstrate the contributions of both methods, we experimented with three of their applications. With the word merging algorithm, we found that intact compound words in the product of topic extraction can help to preserve their intended meanings, offering more precise information for human interpretation. The algorithm, together with the POS-based word-splitting algorithm, can also be used to amend word-level Thai-English translations. In addition, the word-splitting algorithm improves sentence segmentation, thus enhancing text summarization.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Artificial Intelligence"

The performance of the SOEC with different sintering additives is determined in terms of relative density, electrochemical performance, and catalytic activity toward reverse water gas shift reaction. BaCeO3 (BC) and BaCe0.9Gd0.1O3−δ (BCG) are synthesized using conventional precipitation method, comparing to ultrasonic-assisted precipitation. The sintering additives promote both densification and grain growth. The relative density of the BCG without sintering additive is 69% while that of the BCG with 1 wt% of Co2O3, NiO and ZnO is 95%, 95% and 88%, respectively. The SEM images indicate that the BCG with sintering additives exhibits dense grains with relatively large grain size. Although the BGC with NiO and Co2O3 exhibit maximum relative density, the sample with ZnO shows relatively highest conductivity with the lowest activation energy of conduction and the sample with NiO provides the largest CO yield and CO2 conversion. The activation energy of conduction is found to be 375.41, 70.06, 66.86 and 61.80 kJ mol−1 for BCG, BCG with 1 wt% Co2O3, NiO and ZnO, respectively. The BCG with 1 wt% NiO provides the highest CO2 conversion and CO yield at temperature below 700 °C (62% CO2 conversion and 32% CO yield at 700 °C). Temperature program of oxidation (TPO) reveals that carbon deposition can cause the low CO yield at the operating temperature above 700 °C.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; specialty products; manufactured gases, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Totally, 30 male pigs were classified by castration protocol into three groups: T1 (n = 10) consisted of pigs immunocastrated at 14 and 18 weeks of age, T2 (n = 10) included pigs immunocastrated at 9 and 19 weeks of age, and C (n = 10) contained intact pigs. The results revealed that testicular length of pigs in C was longer than that of both T1 (8.1 ± 0.76 vs 6.5 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.001) and T2 (8.1 ± 0.76 vs 6.9 ± 1.0, p = 0.007).

Generally, mean Ki-67 index and mean H-scores of AR and ERβ of pigs in T1 were not different from those in T2 (p > 0.05). However, mean Ki-67 index and mean AR H-scores of T1 and T2 were significantly different from C group (p < 0.05). In summary, the immunocastration significantly affected testicular length, including expressions of Ki-67, AR, and ERβ in pig testes. Moreover, the duration between two shots of GnRH vaccine could be extended from 4 to 10 weeks without difference in Ki-67 protein, AR, and ERβ immunoexpressions.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

We determined whether dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI could differentiate benign from malignant lesions and compared model-independent and model-dependent methods of data analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies of 37 enhancing orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions. The data were processed using model-independent analysis and model-dependent analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The time-signal intensity curve and semiquantitative parameters from the model-independent method (area under the curve [AUC] after the initial 60, 90, and 120 s; time to peak; maximum signal enhancement ratio; maximum slope of increase; and washout ratio) and the quantitative parameters from the model-dependent method (Ktrans, kep, and ve) were derived for comparison with pathologic diagnoses. Results: The time-signal intensity curves demonstrated different perfusion characteristics and were classified into 4 types. All the lesions that demonstrated curve types 1 and 4 were benign, while type 3 lesions were significantly associated with malignancy (P = 0.001). AUC60, AUC90, AUC120, and kep were significantly lower in benign lesions than in malignant lesions (P = 0.020, 0.018, 0.015, and 0.018, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that AUC120 yielded the best diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) in differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. Conclusions: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is useful in evaluating orbital and anterior visual pathway lesions. The model-independent analysis method is equivalent to the model-dependent method in differentiating benign from malignant lesions.","biochemistryistry, engineering, medical","Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Objective: We aimed to characterize a recombinant form of Blo t 7 (rBlo t 7) in terms of IgE reactivity, lipid-binding activity and ability to stimulate innate immunity. Methods: The mature Blo t 7 cDNA was cloned by PCR methods for the expression of a secreted form of the allergen in P. pastoris. The IgE reactivity to purified rBlo t 7 as well as the potential cross-reactivity with Der p 7 was determined by ELISA. The lipid-binding capacity of rBlo t 7 was assayed using fluorescent lipid probes. The stimulation of TLR2 signalling pathway by rBlo t 7 was examined in cell activation and reporter assays. Results: The amplified mature Blo t 7 cDNA revealed the presence of a 60 base pair insertion compared with the reference sequence registered in the GenBank database. Multiple protein sequence alignments of group 7 mite allergens confirmed that this longer deduced amino acid sequence was the authentic Blo t 7 polypeptide chain. Analysis of IgE reactivity can classify rBlo t 7 as an intermediate B. tropicalis allergen which displayed weak cross-reactivity with Der p 7. Purified rBlo t 7 was shown to bind selectively the naturally fluorescent lipid probe cis-parinaric (cPNA) with a dissociation constant of 2 μmol/L. The group 7 Blomia allergen stimulated the TLR2-, NF-kB- and MAPK-dependent production of IL-8 and GM-CSF in respiratory epithelial cells. Conclusions & Clinical Relevance: Through its propensity to transport fatty acids/lipids and to stimulate TLR2 signalling pathways in airway epithelial cells, Blo t 7 can represent a key allergen for the initiation of the B. tropicalis-induced airway inflammation.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce biodiesel over calcined dolomite: The role of magnesium oxide,"Jindapon W., Ngamcharussrivichai C.",2018-09-01,"Calcination conditions, Calcination temperature, Calcium hydroxide (Ca2), Dolomite, Mixed oxide, Rhombohedral crystals, Solid base catalysts, Structural stabilities, Calcium oxide, Dolomite, Magnesium oxide, Mixed oxide, Transesterification","Calcined dolomite, composed of calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), is a potential solid base catalyst for the transesterification of triglycerides with methanol to produce biodiesel. However, the catalytic role of MgO in the calcined dolomite is not well understood. We studied the effect of calcination conditions on the formation of the metal oxide phases and the catalytic activity of the resulting dolomite-derived mixed metal compounds. Natural calcite with an analogous trigonal-rhombohedral crystal was used for comparison. The surface basicity of the calcined materials was dependent on the type and cluster size of the oxides, which were controlled by varying calcination temperature and heating rate, while their catalytic activity was principally determined by the bulk CaO content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the growth of MgO on the calcined dolomite, which possessed an oxygen-deficient surface. The generated MgO exhibited a low basicity, low reactivity with methanol and glycerol in phase transformation, and low transesterification catalytic activity under the studied conditions. The oxide materials obtained from the calcite and dolomite calcined at 800 °C exhibited the highest basicity and catalytic activity, giving the FAME yield of >99 wt% under the studied conditions. The CaO nanocrystallites obtained from the dolomite were highly accessible and more reactive than those derived from calcite in the methoxide formation. An in situ formation of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) was observed for the oxide materials directly reacted with methanol or glycerol and those spent in the transesterification. The small crystallites of dolomite-derived mixed oxides maintained the structural stability of Ca(OH)2 as an active phase, resulting in a lower formation of bulk glyceroxides.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

In this concept, H2O2 generated from the active enzymatic reaction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (CHOx) enables to react with GQDs resulting in a “turn-off” photoluminescence of GQDs. A “turn-on” photoluminescence of GQDs at 467 nm was recovered in the presence of organophosphate. Definitely, the photoluminescence changes of GQDs/AChE/CHOx biosensor reasonably correspond to the amount of pesticide. The detection limit of GQDs/AChE/CHOx biosensor towards dichlorvos was 0.172 ppm (0.778 μM).

Dispersed carbon nanofibers (CNF) are immobilized in the pores of a single-stranded polypropylene hollow fiber (CNF@HF) membrane, which is thereafter accommodated in a stereolithographic 3D-printed extraction chamber without glued components for ease of assembly. The analytical method involves continuous-flow extraction of the acidic drugs from a flowing stream donor (pH 1.7) into an alkaline stagnant acceptor (20 mmol L−1 NaOH) containing 10% MeOH (v/v) across a dihexyl ether impregnated CNF@HF membrane. The flow setup features entire automation of the microextraction process including regeneration of the organic film and on-line injection of the analyte-laden acceptor phase after downstream neutralization into a liquid chromatograph (LC) for reversed-phase core-shell column-based separation. Using a 12-cm long CNF@HF and a sample volume of 6.4 mL, linear dynamic ranges of ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen, taken as models of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, spanned from ca. 5–15 µg L−1 to 500 µg L−1 with enhancement factors of 43–97 (against a direct injection of 10 µL standards into LC), and limits of detection from 1.6 to 4.3 µg L−1. Relative recoveries in real urine samples ranged from 97% to 105%, thus demonstrating the reliability of the automatic CNF@HF-LPME method for in-line matrix clean-up and determination of drugs in urine at therapeutically relevant concentrations.","mixing and separation, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Comparing Filtering Techniques in Restaurant Recommendation System,"Koetphrom N., Charusangvittaya P., Sutivong D.",2018-08-27,"component, Content based filtering, Hybrid filtering, regression, restaurant satisfaction, cluster analysis, collaborative filtering, component, content-based filtering, data mining, hybrid filtering, recommendation system, regression, restaurant satisfaction","This paper studies the key analytics of the restaurant recommendation system, namely predicting restaurant satisfaction rating based on customer and restaurant characteristics. As food industry grows and offers more variety of restaurants, customers generally have difficulty discovering a restaurant that suits or satisfies them. This paper aims to predict restaurant satisfaction rating based on three methodologies: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering. For content-based filtering, this paper proposes using regression to create a prediction model from customer and restaurant characteristics. For collaborative filtering, our proposed model employs a combination of cluster analysis, similarity test, and weighted sum in order to analyze factors that influence the satisfaction rating. Cluster analysis helps to reduce the impact of sparsity in collaborative filtering. Subsequently, hybrid filtering is proposed to combine the results from the two techniques above to generate the final rating. Our results have shown that hybrid filtering outperforms content-based filtering using regression model and collaborative filtering using cluster-based technique.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Computational Mechanics"
Differences in taste perception and spicy preference: A thai-japanese cross-cultural study,"Trachootham D., Satoh-Kuriwada S., Lam-ubol A., Promkam C., Chotechuang N., Sasano T., Shoji N.",2018-01-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Case-Control Studies, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Female, Food Preferences, Humans, Japan, Male, Middle Aged, Spices, Taste Perception, Taste Threshold, Thailand, Cross-culture, Electrogustometer threshold, Older persons, Spicy preference, Taste recognition threshold, Umami","Taste perception is influenced by several factors. However, the relation between taste perception and food culture is unclear. This study compared taste thresholds between populations with different food culture, i.e. Thai and Japanese. A matched case-control study was conducted in 168 adults (84 for each; aged between 50 and 90 years). The age, sex, systemic disease, medication, smoking, xerostomia, and oral hygiene of both groups were not different. Recognition thresholds (RTs) of sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami were measured using filter paper disc (FPD). Detection taste thresholds were measured using electrogustometry. Spicy preference was measured by calibrated questionnaires. Higher RTs of all tastes and higher detection taste thresholds were found in Thai as compared to those of Japanese (P < 0.0001). Separate analyses of healthy and unhealthy persons confirmed the significant differences between 2 countries. The average thresholds for sweet, salty, sour, and bitter in Thai and Japanese were 4 and 2, respectively. The average threshold for umami in Thai and Japanese was 5 and 3, respectively. Moreover, Thai population had stronger preference for spicy food (P < 0.0001) with 70% mild- or moderate and 10% strong lovers, compared to over 90% non- or mild-spicy lovers in Japanese. In addition, 70% of Thai consumed spicy food weekly, whilst 80% of Japanese consumed it monthly. Our findings suggested that population with stronger spicy preference such as Thai had much poorer taste sensitivity and perception than that with milder preference like Japanese. Extensive international survey is needed to conclude the influence of food culture on taste perception.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Physiology, Sensory Systems, Physiology (medical), Behavioral Neuroscience"

Method: Data were collected through five focus group interviews with 36 community nurses in northeastern Thailand. Latent content analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Findings: Healthy aging was characterized by the interconnection of older persons, older persons’ family members, and the community. Healthy aging was associated with two themes: “being strong” and “being a supporter and feeling supported.” The nurses’ experiences in promoting healthy aging were described by the themes “providing health assessment,” “sharing knowledge,” and “having limited resources.” Conclusions: The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the meaning of healthy aging from a holistic viewpoint. Community nurses must pay attention to older persons and their surroundings when planning how to promote healthy aging. Person-centeredness should be applied in practice to promote healthy aging. The current findings contribute useful information that should help policy makers develop healthy aging strategies in Thailand.",Nursing,Nursing (miscellaneous)

In this study, we immobilized this molecule on cotton fabrics and showed that this modified surface (DA) exhibited significant antibacterial activities in both Gram-negative bacteria and a Gram-positive bacterium. Studies on the structure-activity relationship revealed that additional chemical modifications on DA usually led to lowered antibacterial activities, emphasizing an importance of having free amino groups. Further investigation by fluorescence microscope indicated that this modified surface likely interfered with the membrane integrity of bacteria, leading to cell lysis.

The water solubility, partition coefficient, release characteristics, and antinociceptive activity of CurDG were compared to those of curcumin. The aqueous solubility of CurDG (7.48 μg/mL) is significantly greater than that of curcumin (0.068 μg/mL). A study in human plasma showed that the CurDG completely releases curcumin within 2 h, suggesting the ability of CurDG to serve as a prodrug of curcumin. A hot plate test in mice showed the highest antinociceptive effect dose of curcumin at 200 mg/kg p.o., whereas CurDG showed the same effect at an effective dose of 100 mg/kg p.o., indicating that CurDG significantly enhanced the antinociceptive effect compared to curcumin. The enhanced antinociceptive effect of CurDG may be due to improved water solubility and increased oral bioavailability compared to curcumin.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Organic Chemistry"

The photocatalytic composite membranes (PCMs) were fabricated by electrospraying TiO2 nanoparticle suspension into microcluster form that dispersed and entrapped within nylon-6 electrospun fiber membrane. Three PCMs membrane with TiO2 content of 52.0, 83.6, and 91.7 wt.% were successfully fabricated. The membrane consisted of TiO2 microclusters, ranging in sizes from around 0.3 to 10 μm, distributed uniformly within the nylon-6 nanofibrous network. PCMs photocatalytic activity against Methylene Blue (MB) in aqueous solution showed more than 98% MB removal efficiency after 120 min of photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) for all PCMs. For PCM with the highest TiO2 content tested for 5 PCO cycles, it was found that most of their TiO2 content remained incorporated within the nanofibrous structure.

Direct conversion of simulated propene-rich bio-syngas to liquid iso-hydrocarbons via FT-oligomerization integrated catalytic process,"Zhang Q., Wang T., Weng Y., Zhang H., Vitidsant T., Li Y., Zhang Q., Xiao R., Wang C., Ma L.",2018-09-01,"Catalytic performance, FT-Oli, Gasoline-range hydrocarbons, Hydrogenation reactions, Integration configurations, Olefin hydrogenation, Syn-gas, Transformation process, Bio-syngas, Biomass, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), FT-Oli, Isomerized hydrocarbon, Oligomerization","The bio-syngas formed from the catalytic cracking of bio-oil include two types of useful components which are light olefin and H2, CO. The integration of FTS and olefinic polymerization seems potential way for the production of hydrocarbon bio-fuels while fully utilizing the olefin-rich bio-syngas. This work aimed to develop an integrated process for the production of liquid hydrocarbons directly from the olefin-rich bio-syngas through a one-stage process, which included the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons via the oligomerization of light olefin over HZSM-5 along with the FT (Fischer-Tropsch) synthesis of H2, CO over FeMn catalyst. A series of integration configuration composed of Fe-based catalyst (FeMn) and acidic zeolite (HZSM-5) were investigated, it was found that the undesired hydrogenation of lower olefin on the nearby metal active site seems greatly affected the yield of C5+. More significantly, the proximity of the two active components plays a crucial role in suppressing the undesired hydrogenation reaction and contributing to the high selectivity of liquid hydrocarbons. The optimal catalytic performance yields a high selectivity to gasoline-range hydrocarbons (87.3%) with excellent low olefin hydrogenation selectivity (7.4%). Meanwhile, the obtained gasoline-range hydrocarbon showed high degree of isomerization. The integrated transformation process potentially provides an alternative way for the production of gasoline range isomerized hydrocarbon fuels using olefin-rich bio-syngas.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Adv Physiol Educ 42: 140-145, 2018; doi: 10.1152/advan.00046.2017.—Interactive laboratory class (ILC) is a two-way communication teaching method that encourages students to correlate laboratory findings with materials from lectures. In Thai medical education, active learning methods are uncommon. This paper aims to establish 1) if ILCs would effectively promote physiology learning; 2) if effectiveness would be found in both previously academically high-performing and low-performing students; and 3) the acceptability of ILCs to Thai medical students as a novel learning method. Two hundred seventy-eight second-year medical students were recruited to this study. We conducted three ILC sessions, which followed corresponding lectures. We carried out multiple-choice pre-and post-ILC assessments of knowledge and compared by repeated-measures ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare high-performance (HighP) and low-performance (LowP) students. After the ILCs, participants self-rated their knowledge and satisfaction. Post-ILC test scores increased significantly compared with pre-ILC test scores in all three sessions. Mean scores of each post-ILC test increased significantly from pre-ILC test in both LowP and HighP groups. More students self-reported a “very high” and “high” level of knowledge after ILCs. Most students agreed that ILCs provided more discussion opportunity, motivated their learning, and made lessons more enjoyable. As an adjunct to lectures, ILCs can enhance knowledge in medical students, regardless of previous academic performance. Students perceived ILC as useful and acceptable.

In addition to the hybrid genomes of Trichosporon coremiiforme and Trichosporon ovoides that we described previously, we identified an interspecies hybrid genome in Cutaneotrichosporon mucoides (formerly Trichosporon mucoides). This hybrid genome had a gene retention rate of ~55%, and its closest haploid relative was Cutaneotrichosporon dermatis. After constructing the C. mucoides subgenomes, we generated a phylogenetic tree using genome data from the 27 haploid species and the subgenome data from the three hybrid genome species. It was a high-quality tree with 100% bootstrap support for all of the branches. The genome-based tree provided superior resolution compared with previous multi-gene analyses. Although our backbone tree does not include all Trichosporonales genera (e.g. Cryptotrichosporon), it will be valuable for future analyses of genome data. Interest in interspecies hybrid fungal genomes has recently increased because they may provide a basis for new technologies. The three Trichosporonales hybrid genomes described in this study are different from well-characterized hybrid genomes (e.g. those of Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces bayanus) because these hybridization events probably occurred in the distant evolutionary past. Hence, they will be useful for studying genome stability following hybridization and speciation events.

Shrimp hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein (PmHHAP) interacts with WSSV134 to control apoptosis in white spot syndrome virus infection,"Apitanyasai K., Amparyup P., Charoensapsri W., Sangsuriya P., Tassanakajon A.",2018-05-01,"Animals, Apoptosis, Arthropod Proteins, Gene Silencing, Hemocytes, Homeostasis, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Penaeidae, Viral Proteins, White spot syndrome virus 1, Apoptosis, Caspase, Hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein, Shrimp immunity, White spot syndrome virus","Hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein (PmHHAP) was first identified as a viral-responsive gene, due to a high upregulation in transcription following white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Functional studies using RNA interference have suggested that PmHHAP is involved in hemocyte homeostasis by controlling apoptosis during WSSV infection. In this study, the role of PmHHAP in host–viral interactions was further investigated. Yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PmHHAP binds to an anti-apoptosis protein, WSSV134. The viral protein WSSV134 is a late protein of WSSV, expressed 24 h post infection (hpi). Gene silencing of WSSV134 in WSSV-infected shrimp resulted in a reduction of the expression level of the viral replication marker genes VP28, wsv477, and ie-1, which suggests that WSSV134 is likely involved in viral propagation. However, co-silencing of PmHHAP and WSSV134 counteracted the effects on WSSV infection, which implies the importance of the host–pathogen interaction between PmHHAP and WSSV134 in WSSV infection. In addition, caspase 3/7 activity was noticeably induced in the PmHHAP and WSSV134 co-silenced shrimp upon WSSV infection. Moreover, PmHHAP and WSSV134 inhibited caspase-induced activation of PmCasp in vitro in a non-competitive manner. Taken together, these results suggest that PmHHAP and WSSV134 play a role in the host–pathogen interaction and work concordantly to control apoptosis in WSSV infection.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

This review focuses on the current understanding of the surveillance, pathogenesis, and treatment of SJS/TEN, including the role of genomics and pharmacogenomics in the etiology, treatment, and eradication of preventable causes of drug-induced SJS/TEN. Gaps, unmet needs, and priorities for future research have been identified for the optimal management of drug-induced SJS/TEN in various ethnic populations. Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for optimal patient stratification and theranostics, yet its clinical implementation needs to be cost-effective and sustainable.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologyne response disorders; autoImmunologynity; diagnosis and therapy, biochemistryistry, medical","Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"
Bifunctional activity of fused Plasmodium falciparum orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase,"Paojinda P., Imprasittichai W., Krungkrai S.R., Palacpac N.M.Q., Horii T., Krungkrai J.",2018-02-01,"Artificial Gene Fusion, Escherichia coli, Gene Fusion, Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified, Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase, Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase, Plasmodium falciparum, Protozoan Proteins, Bifunctional fused enzyme, Catalytic efficiency, Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, Orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase, Plasmodium falciparum","Fusion of the last two enzymes in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the inversed order by having a COOH-terminal orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and an NH2-terminal orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), as OMPDC-OPRT, are described in many organisms. Here, we produced gene fusions of Plasmodium falciparum OMPDC-OPRT and expressed the bifunctional protein in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using affinity and anion-exchange chromatography, exhibited enzymatic activities and functioned as a dimer. The activities, although unstable, were stabilized by its substrate and product during purification and long-term storage. Furthermore, the enzyme expressed a perfect catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The kcat was selectively enhanced up to three orders of magnitude, while the Km was not much affected and remained at low μM levels when compared to the monofunctional enzymes. The fusion of the two enzymes, creating a “super-enzyme” with perfect catalytic power and more flexibility, reflects cryptic relationship of enzymatic reactivities and metabolic functions on molecular evolution.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"
Role of the immune system in autism spectrum disorders (ASD),"Ormstad H., Bryn V., Saugstad O.D., Skjeldal O., Maes M.",2018-01-01,"Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Humans, Immune System, PubMed, Autism spectrum disorders, Autoimmunity, Cytokines, Immunology, Neurodevelopment, Prenatal infections","Background: The evidence based supports that multifactorial and complex immune interactions play a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but contradictory findings are also reported. Objective: The aim of this selective review was to identify trends in the research literature on this topic, focusing on immunology and other aberrations with respect to the different ASD subtypes. Methods: This selective review is based on original and review articles written in English and identified in literature searches of PubMed. Results: Several studies have found that the risk of ASD is greater among children whose mothers suffered from autoimmune diseases while pregnant. Moreover, individuals with ASD show increased levels of antibodies that are specific for several specific proteins. Studies also show that mothers of children with ASD have antibodies against fetal brain proteins. There are also reports on the associations between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and ASD. Finally, infections in mothers during pregnancy are linked to an increased risk of ASD. Conclusion: We propose that the large inconsistencies in findings among studies in the field are due to differences in subdiagnoses among the included children with ASD. Well-phenotyped ASD samples are needed to understand the biological and immunological mechanisms underpinning ASD and its subdiagnoses. Future research should apply new strategies to scrutinize the link between ASD and changes in immune responsivity. Important new research avenues are to investigate the associations (a) between different ASD phenotypes and aberrations in (auto)immune pathways and (b) between reduced natural regulatory autoimmune responses during pregnancy, which are in turn associated with increased oxidative and nitrosative stress in maternal blood and putative detrimental effects in the offspring.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"
Awareness of middle sacral artery pathway: A cadaveric study of the presacral area,"Singhatanadgige W., Kang D.G., Wiranuwat D., Tanavalee C., Yingsakmongkol W., Limthongkul W.",2018-01-01,"Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cadaver, Female, Humans, Iliac Artery, Intervertebral Disc, Lumbar Vertebrae, Male, Middle Aged, Sacrum, Spinal Fusion, Approach, AxiaLif, Middle sacral artery, Minimal invasive, Presacral","Purpose: To assess the anatomic path of the middle sacral artery (MSA) at the presacral area and its relationship to the spinal midline during an axial lumbar interbody fusion (AxiaLif) approach. Methods: Fifty human cadavers (25 males, 25 females) were used in this study. A transabdominal approach was used to expose the anterior aspect of the L5/S1 intervertebral disc and the presacral space. We measured the size and distance from the spinal midline at the following positions: (a) middle of the L5/S1 disc level, (b) 1 cm below the sacral promontory (SP), and (c) 2 cm below the SP. Each parameter was measured three times by two observers, and the mean value analyzed. Results: The MSA was present and originated from the left common iliac artery in all cadavers with a mean width of 2.14 mm. The position of the MSA in relation to the midline was most commonly on the left side (LS, 56%) followed by the right side (RS, 34%) and midline (ML, 10%). In the LS group, the distance from the midline is relatively constant in the three measured positions with a mean value of (a) 1.78 mm (range, 0–8.17 mm), (b) 2.08 mm (range, 0–7.10 mm), and (c) 2.06 mm (range, 0–9.76 mm). In the RS group, the distance from the midline increased from cephalad to caudad, with a mean value of (a) 1.44 mm (range, 0–9.64 mm), (b) 2.19 mm (range, 0–9.95 mm), and (c) 2.92 mm (range, 0–10.03 mm). Conclusions: Our study found the presacral anatomic path of the MSA was most commonly at the left of midline. In addition, the right-sided MSA variant had increasing distance from the midline along its anatomic path from cephalad to caudad. Our findings suggest an AxiaLif approach at the left of midline may place the MSA at greatest risk.",medical,Surgery

Methods and Study Design: A total of 15 healthy Chinese men were recruited to this study. On each visit, subjects consumed one of the following three treatments, i.e. glucose solution (T1), grass jelly (Mesona chinensis L.) solution with glucose (T2) or grass jelly gel with glucose (T3). Capillary blood glucose and venous plasma insulin were analysed over a period of 180 min. Results: The incremental area under the curve for capillary glucose and venous plasma insulin for glucose group, grass jelly solution group and grass jelly gel was found to be statistically not significant (p > 0.05). In a previous study the co-ingestion of grass jelly with complex carbohydrate was found to reduce glycaemic response. The key difference between the two studies was the use of monosaccharide glucose in the present study, compared to complex carbohydrates in the other. The present study suggests that the glycaemic lowering effect of grass jelly may be dependent on the inhibition of carbohydrase enzymes. Conclusions: The co-ingestion of Mesona chinensis L. appears to reduce glycaemic response of only complex carbohydrates through the inhibition of carbohydrase. This conclusion was arrived at by the lack of any effect of Mesona chinensis L. on the monosaccharide glucose.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

Silk, however, has few cell signaling domains, so silk alone might not be sufficient to use as the scaffolds for tissue engineering. Here, we demonstrated the improvement of silk scaffold properties by the incorporation of type I collagen [Col; 0, 3.61, 7.69, 14.89, and 50% (w/w)] into silk-based scaffolds. The morphology and properties, including biocompatibility, of the scaffolds were then investigated. Notably, moderate amounts of Col (7.69 and 14.89%) improved fibroblast attachment and supported proliferation on the scaffolds compared to those of silk alone. Both 7.69 and 14.89% Col scaffolds exhibited more organized and smaller pore sizes (144.09 ± 25.97 and 140.67 ± 38.28 μm in diameter, respectively) with thinner walls compared to higher silk content (0 and 3.61% Col) scaffolds. The 7.69 and 14.89% Col also improved the scaffold stability over 21 days, whereas silk alone scaffolds dramatically lost their weight by day 21. The incorporation of collagen also increased water adsorption ability of the scaffolds. Therefore, this study demonstrated the effects of type I collagen toward improving the properties of silk-based scaffolds.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

There is much research on location recommendations and route suggestions for sightseeing based on check-in frequency to extract the popularity of a location, which is used to infer a user’s interest in a place. However, the popularity of a location is not sufficient for the location recommendation, and user’s preferences in a place cannot be extracted using only the check-in frequency. In this study, we propose a recommendation system for sightseeing places based on user’s photo-taking behavior, where a large amount of photo data can be classified into five genres: scenery, architecture, nature, activity, and food. These data are leveraged to recommend popular sightseeing places according to a user’s preference that is extracted from the user’s photo-taking behavior. In the experiment, we test the classification capability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in deep learning for five genres of photo data that we collected using smartphones. The proposed system could be realized by incorporating CNN as a photo classifier into our photo sharing service to recommend sightseeing places.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

MG also causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. Isoferulic acid (IFA), a naturally occurring cinnamic acid derivative, is considered to be an antiglycating agent. However, the effect of IFA on MG-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the protective effect of IFA against MG-induced mitochrondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. The results showed that pretreatment of INS-1 cells with 100 μM IFA for 48 h prevented MG-induced decrease in cell viability and impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In addition, 100 μM IFA pretreatment also decreased MG-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression. Furthermore, IFA pretreatment reduced MG-induced increase in caspase-3 activity, suggesting a reduction of apoptotic cell death. IFA (50–100 μM) itself markedly increased the activity of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), a major enzyme for the detoxification of MG. The results showed that 100 μM IFA protected MG-induced loss of GLO1 activity in INS-1 cells. These findings suggest that IFA pretreatment attentuates MG-induced dysfunction and apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells through mitochondrial survival pathway and increasing GLO1 activity.","genergyal, pharmacology",Pharmacology

FTIR and SEM/EDXS characterizations indicated that the hydrogel composites were the crosslinked copolymer composed of acrylamide and acrylic acid in TiO2 particles. TiO2 hydrogel composites could adsorb up to 90% of 5 ppm methylene blue dye solution. Decolorization of methylene blue by the hydrogel composites was evaluated by colorimetry in term of K/S value. Approximately 83% of methylene blue was decolorized in 8 h by 5% TiO2 hydrogel composite and 90% decolorization in 8 h for 10% TiO2 hydrogel composites. The maximum color fading of methylene blue in the hydrogel composites at various UV irradiation times was observed by the slope of the linear region at different amounts of TiO2. It reveals that AMAA5050T10C1 gave the highest methylene blue fading of 91.6% with an R2 of 0.9999. The slope of 5 ppm Congo red in AM-T20-C1 adsorbent obeying a Pseudo-first order gave the highest dye removal of 44.8% with an R2 of 0.9572. This technique meets the criteria of green chemistry because the reaction does not need any organic photoinitiator or co-photoinitiator and the reaction takes place at room temperature. Congo red in polyacrylamide hydrogel composite containing 20% TiO2 obeyed a Pseudo-first order kinetics giving qe,exp = 2.22 mg g−1 (qe,cal = 2.24 mg g−1) while methylene blue in poly[acrylamide-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composite at 50:50 monomer weight ratio containing 5% TiO2 followed a Pseudo-second order kinetics having qe,exp = 4.86 mg g−1 (qe,cal = 4.73 mg g−1). The rheological measurement of the TiO2/poly[arylamide-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composites revealed a strong gel-like material and the self-degradation of the hydrogel composites evolved under UVA irradiation. TiO2/poly[(acrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogel composites synthesized in current work can be used as a model for both green synthesis of the hydrogel composites using an ionic photocatalyst, TiO2, and for degradation of organic dyes and self-degradation of the composites upon UV irradiation.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Physics and Astronomy (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Sixty-five studies met eligibility criteria (N = 4034 MDD participants and 3293 controls), and there was substantial between-study variability in the methodological quality of included studies. However, few replicated findings emerged from this literature with only 22 studies providing data for meta-analyses (882 participants with MDD and 616 controls). Total hippocampal volumes did not significantly vary in MDD participants or controls carrying either the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ (386 participants with MDD and 376 controls) or the 5-HTTLPR short 's’ (310 participants with MDD and 230 controls) risk alleles compared to non-carriers. Heterogeneity across studies was explored through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Gender distribution, the use of medications, segmentation methods used to measure the hippocampus, and age emerged as potential sources of heterogeneity across studies that assessed the association of 5-HTTLPR short 's’ alleles and hippocampal volumes. Our data also suggest that the methodological quality of included studies, publication year, and the inclusion of brain volume as a covariate contributed to the heterogeneity of studies that assessed the association of the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ risk allele and hippocampal volumes. In exploratory voxel-wise meta-analyses, MDD participants carrying the 5-HTTLPR short 's’ allele had white matter microstructural abnormalities predominantly in the corpus callosum, while carriers of the BDNF Val66Met ‘Met’ allele had larger gray matter volumes and hyperactivation of the right middle frontal gyrus compared to non-carriers. In conclusion, few replicated findings emerged from imaging genetics studies that included participants with MDD. Nevertheless, we explored and identified specific sources of heterogeneity across studies, which could provide insights to enhance the reproducibility of this emerging field.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

However, most developing countries including Thailand have been facing with lack of recycling facilities and low level of source separation practice. By employing questionnaire surveys, this study investigated Bangkok residents' source separation intention and willingness to pay (WTP) for improving MSW service and recycling facilities (n = 1076). This research extended the theory of planned behavior to explore the effects of both internal and external factors. The survey highlighted perceived inconvenience and mistrust on MSW collection being major barriers to carrying out source separation in Bangkok. Promoting source separation at workplace may possibly create spill-over effect to people's intention to recycle their waste at home. Both subjective norms and knowledge on MSW situation were found to be a positive correlation with Bangkok residents' source separation intention and WTP (p < 0.001). Besides, the average WTP values are higher than the existing rate of waste collection service, which shows that Bangkok residents have preference for recycling programs. However, the WTP figures are still much lower than the average MSW management cost. These findings suggest that Bangkok Metropolitan Administration targets improving people knowledge on waste problems that could have adverse impact on the economy and well-being of Bangkok residents and improve its MSW collection service as these factors have positive influence on residents' WTP.","mixing and separation, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Different surface topologies of PCL were induced by phase separation using solvents with various solubility parameters. The investigated solvents were chloroform, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and ethanol (EtOH). The PCL films with different surface topologies and protein-adsorbed PCL films were studied with respect to their hydrophobicity, the concentration and nature of functional groups on their surface, their surface roughness, and their cytotoxicity. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the films with the roughest surface were cast from 40:60 EtOH:THF and contained significantly larger amounts of adsorbed protein. Proteins preferentially adsorbed onto rough surfaces.

MHPC spheres are produced by water-in-oil emulsification coupled with sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol containing Fe(NO3)3 and formaldehyde to make spherical carbon precursors with a macroporous framework inside, followed by carbonization with N2 or CO2 activation to transform them into MHPC spheres. Carbonization at temperatures higher than 800 °C resulted in not only graphitic feature formation, but also both micro- and mesopores in the macroporous framework. Moreover, CO2 activation at 900 °C both remarkably enhanced the graphitic features and increased the mesopore volume to 2.16 cm3/g. The magnetic property could be developed by both carbonization and CO2 activation at 900 °C. MHPC spheres obtained from CO2 activation developed tremendous adsorption capacities, as high as 1522.6 mg/g under neutral conditions, which were suitable to be reused for MO removal for at least four consecutive cycles without efficiency loss.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all)"

A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Use of agro-industrial residue from the canned pineapple industry for polyhydroxybutyrate production by Cupriavidus necator strain A-04,"Sukruansuwan V., Napathorn S.C.",2018-07-23,"Agro-industrial residue, Aqueous extracts, Lignocellulosic biomass, Lignocellulosic feedstocks, PHB production, Polyhydroxybutyrate, Value-added production, Waste management practices, Agro-industrial residue, Canned pineapple industry, Crude aqueous extract, Low-cost PHB production, Polyhydroxybutyrate","Background: Pineapple is the third most important tropical fruit produced worldwide, and approximately 24.8 million tons of this fruit are produced annually throughout the world, including in Thailand, which is the fourth largest pineapple producer in the world. Pineapple wastes (peel and core) are generated in a large amount equal to approximately 59.36% based on raw material. In general, the anaerobic digestion of pineapple wastes is associated with a high biochemical oxygen demand and high chemical oxygen demand, and this process generates methane and can cause greenhouse gas emissions if good waste management practices are not enforced. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the feasibility of pineapple wastes for promoting the high-value-added production of biodegradable polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from the available domestic raw materials. The objective of this study was to use agro-industrial residue from the canned pineapple industry for biodegradable PHB production. Results: The results indicated that pretreatment with an alkaline reagent is not necessary. Pineapple core was sized to - 20/+ 40 mesh particle and then hydrolyzed with 1.5% (v/v) H2SO4 produced the highest concentration of fermentable sugars, equal to 0.81 g/g dry pineapple core, whereas pineapple core with a + 20 mesh particle size and hydrolyzed with 1.5% (v/v) H3PO4 yielded the highest concentration of PHB substrates (57.2 ± 1.0 g/L). The production of PHB from core hydrolysate totaled 35.6 ± 0.1% (w/w) PHB content and 5.88 ± 0.25 g/L cell dry weight. The use of crude aqueous extract (CAE) of pineapple waste products (peel and core) as a culture medium was investigated. CAE showed very promising results, producing the highest PHB content of 60.00 ± 0.5% (w/w), a cell dry weight of 13.6 ± 0.2 g/L, a yield (Y-{{{P \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {P S}} \right. \kern-0pt} S}}} Y P / S) of 0.45 g PHB/g PHB substrate, and a productivity of 0.160 g/(L h). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pineapple waste products from the canned pineapple industry as lignocellulosic feedstocks for PHB production. C. necator strain A-04 was able to grow on various sugars and tolerate levulinic acid and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, and a detoxification step was not required prior to the conversion of cellulose hydrolysate to PHB. In addition to acid hydrolysis, CAE was identified as a potential carbon source and offers a novel method for the low-cost production of PHB from a realistic lignocellulosic biomass feedstock.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology, energy, environmental","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Among all the influential factors, cathode material and catalyst play a critical role in electricity production and oxygen reduction. Pt nanocatalysts deposited on single-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt/SWCNT) were prepared via the deposition-precipitation (DP) method under optimal conditions. The results showed that DP could be a potential method for the preparation of Pt/SWCNT due to its simple, cost-effective and time-saving procedure, in addition to being highly efficient at creating small Pt particles (0.9 nm) that were very uniformly distributed. The synthesized Pt/SWCNT suspension was spray-coated on to carbon cloth and then used as a cathode for MFC. The electricity generation of MFC equipped with a Pt/SWCNT cathode was assessed in terms of open circuit voltage (0.6954 V), internal resistance (63.3 Ω•sq m) and maximum power density (2,022 mW/sq m). The chemical oxygen demand removal, biological oxygen demand removal, total dissolved solids removal, total suspended solids removal and silver recovery was satisfactory at 84.5%, 74.0%, 45.7%, 60.0% and 99.0%, respectively.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial biotechnology; biofuels, alcohol and solvents, petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

This study evaluates efficacy and safety of PR treatment and pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in this population. Methods: HIV/HCV co-infected Thai patients were treated with PR for 24 or 48 weeks. Sustained virological response 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24) was used to describe efficacy. (laboratory) safety parameters and ribavirin plasma concentrations were evaluated during study visits. Ribavirin concentrations were compared with t-tests for patients with and without anaemia (haemoglobin <10 g/dl) and SVR24. Results: A total of 101 HIV/HCV co-infected patients were included; 88% were male (n = 88), and 46% were infected with genotype 3. The median (IQR) start dose was 14.28 mg/kg/day. SVR24 rate was 56%. All patients reported at least one (serious) adverse event, of which 28% of patients developed anaemia. Seven patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity issues. Geometric mean (IQR) ribavirin concentration was 1.81 (1.42–2.32) mg/l at week 8 of treatment. At week 8, patients with and without anaemia and SVR had ribavirin concentrations of 2.29 and 1.63 mg/l and 1.91 and 1.74 mg/l, respectively. Conclusions: PR treatment has comparable response rates and toxicity profile in Thai HIV/HCV co-infected patients as in Western HIV/HCV patients. However, ribavirin plasma concentrations were comparable with previously published studies in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, but both, just as SVR rate, were lower than in mono-infected patients.","genergyal, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The hybrid materials were crystallized under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions in order to understand the influence of NPCC on the crystallization behavior of PBS matrix. For both of these conditions, the nucleating effect induced by the addition of NPCC was clearly shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) additionally to an increase of crystallinity. The analysis of isothermal crystallization by Avrami theory allowed to notice a variation of the crystallization mechanism in the presence of the filler and the apparition of secondary stage crystallization. The nanocomposites exhibited higher nucleation activity than the neat PBS and a faster crystallization process as indicated by the values of the half-time of crystallization. Ozawa and Mo theory applied on DSC data highlighted the variations of PBS crystallization behavior in the presence of NPCC. Finally, the crystallization ability of each material was evaluated via the theories of Takhor and Augis–Bennett. The crystallization activation energy showed a promotion of polymer chain diffusion that was correlated with the simultaneous apparition of secondary crystallization stage.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry","Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

In this study, the application of modified chitosan as a potential vector for gene delivery to testicular cells was carried out. Transfection efficiency was investigated in mouse-derived spermatogonia cells (GC-1 cells) using green fluorescent protein as a reporter gene. GnRH-conjugated chitosan exhibited higher transfection activity and specificity compared to the unmodified chitosan. Furthermore, the GnRH-modified chitosan showed less cytotoxicity.

Loss of Gsα in osteocytes leads to osteopenia due to sclerostin induced suppression of osteoblast activity,"Fulzele K., Dedic C., Lai F., Bouxsein M., Lotinun S., Baron R., Divieti Pajevic P.",2018-12-01,"Animals, Antibodies, Neutralizing, Bone Diseases, Metabolic, Cancellous Bone, Cortical Bone, Extracellular Matrix Proteins, Female, Femur, Glycoproteins, GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs, Male, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Knockout, Osteoblasts, Osteocytes, Osteogenesis, X-Ray Microtomography, Bone lining cells, Gsα, Neutralizing antibody, Osteoblasts, Osteocytes, Sclerostin","The stimulatory subunit of G-protein, Gsα acts as a secondary messenger of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that primarily activates cAMP-induced signaling. GPCRs, such as the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), are critical regulators of bone formation as shown by number of genetic manipulation studies targeting early osteoblast lineage cells. In this study, we have examined the role of Gsα in osteocytes, the terminally differentiated and most abundant cells of the osteoblast lineage. Mice lacking the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes (DMP1-GsαKO) have significant decrease of both trabecular and cortical bone, as assessed by μCT. Histomorphometric analysis showed that the osteopenia was mostly driven by more than 90% decrease in osteoblast numbers and activity whereas osteoclasts were only slightly decreased. The decrease in osteoblast number was associated with a striking lack of endocortical osteoblasts. We have previously shown that loss of the stimulatory subunit of G-proteins (Gsα) in osteocytes in vitro or in vivo induces high expression of sclerostin. To determine if the increased sclerostin levels contributed to the decreased endosteal bone lining cells and osteopenia, we treated wild-type mice with recombinant sclerostin and the DMP1-GsαKO mice with anti-sclerostin antibody. Treatment of wild-type mice with 100 μg/kg sclerostin for 3-weeks significantly reduced the numbers of bone lining cells and led to osteopenia. Next, the DMP1-GsαKO and control littermates were treated with the anti-sclerostin antibody (25 mg/kg, 2 times per week) for 4-weeks. Upon the antibody treatment, the endocortical osteoblasts reappeared in the DMP1-GsαKO mice to a comparable level to that of the vehicle treated control littermates. In control mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were observed in parallel with the endocortical osteoblasts with higher dendrite density towards the endocortical osteoblasts. In DMP1-GsαKO mice, E11/gp38 positive osteocytes were lacking dendrites and were randomly scattered throughout the bone matrix. After treatment with anti-sclerostin antibody, DMP1-GsαKO mice showed increased E11/gp38 positive osteocytes near the endosteal bone surface and endosteal osteoblasts. The anti-sclerostin antibody treatment proportionally increased the bone volume but it could not completely rescue the osteopenia in the DMP1-GsαKO mice. Taken together, this data suggests that Gsα signaling in osteocytes leads to osteopenia driven, at least in part, by increased secretion of sclerostin.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Physiology, Histology"

Herein we report a rapid screening method based on PCR assay combined with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to design a DNA sensor for detecting E. canis in early stages of infection. The test relies on DNA amplification of target nucleotide sequences via PCR followed by detecting DNA-DNA hybridization using QCM. The approach did not result in any cross-hybridization toward other blood bacteria or parasites in dogs, such as Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis and Trypanosoma spp, but turned out selective for the target species. The limit of detection of QCM was as low as 4.1 × 109 molecules/μl of 289 bp E. canis PCR products corresponding to 22 copy numbers/μl of E. canis. Furthermore, the technique is also simple, does not require complicated equipment and can in principle be reused.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

The developed model of the mandibular first molar consisted of multicomponent of enamel, dentin and dental pulp. The masticatory loading condition for simulation was performed in three conditions at the average biting force of 54.3 MPa. The results showed that the average occlusal pressure did not cause failure of the tooth components as the max Von Mises stress did not exceed its ultimate strength. Simulation results revealed that the average normal stresses at the peaks of the dental pulp was only 0.003 MPa, which was less than 1% of that exerted on the enamel.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Because ethnic differences in genetic predisposition to SJS/TEN among different populations have been proposed, we focused on Thai patients and investigated the association between HLA class I genotypes and CM-SJS/TEN with SOC. Methods This multicentre case-control study was conducted between September 2014 and August 2017. Seventy-one Thai patients with SJS/TEN with SOC and 159 healthy Thai controls were enrolled. HLA typing was performed. Genetic relationships were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Results Of 71 patients with SJS/TEN with SOC (28 male, 43 female), 49 (69%) had a history of taking cold medications prior to SJS/TEN onset. The mean age of onset was 26.7±17.1 years (range, 2-77 years).

This study aimed to detect and identify staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains from different sources, and to investigate the relationship between their sequence types (STs) and SE gene patterns. Methodology. The profiles of 17 SE genes in 93 MRSP strains isolated from dogs (n=43), humans (n=18) and the environment (n=32) were detected by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to analyse the clonal relatedness between the molecular type and SE gene profiles. Results/Key findings. The human MRSP strains harboured the greatest number of SE genes (12/17; sea, sec, seg, sei, sek, sel, sem, sen, seo, sep, seq and tst-1) compared to those from dogs (5/17; sec, sel, sem, seq and tst-1) and environmental sources (3/17; sec, seq and tst-1). Using MLST and PFGE, different SE gene profiles were found within the same clonal type. Conclusion. We show that isolates of MRSP vary in their virulence gene profiles, depending on the source from which they have been isolated. This insight should encourage the development of appropriate monitoring and mitigation strategies to reduce the transmission of MRSP in veterinary hospitals and households.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"

Methods: Clinical and genetic data were collected. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in cld cells were performed. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass and activity were measured. Results: In vitro studies showed that LPL mass and activity in the media of cells transfected with the p.Arg270Gly variant were significantly reduced. In the cell lysates, however, LPL mass was preserved but LPL activity was reduced, suggesting that the LPL defect was in the secretion and activity. For the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant, LPL mass in the cell lysate was relatively preserved compared to that of the wild-type, while LPL mass in the media was decreased albeit not significantly. LPL activities in the cell lysate and in the media of cells transfected with this variant were significantly reduced, suggesting that the p.Asp308Glyfs*3 variant might affect the activity, and possibly, secretion of LPL.

At pH 3 in emulsion system, the CS chains are under charge-charge repulsive force, leading the polysaccharide chains to align as the hollow nanospheres and at that time, the crosslink leads to the nanocapsules. The CS nanocapsules allow the model cargos, i.e., corrosion inhibitors, entrapment not only via the noncovalent bond based on the weak interaction in the core for 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) cargo but also via the chemical bonds based on the amino group remaining on CS structure to result in either amide or Schiff base linkage in case of 3-nitrosalicylic acid (3NiSA) cargo. The release studies indicate that CS nanocapsules can release two cargoes upon pH change due to the acidic/basic-triggered cleavage of bonds between cargoes and nanocapsules. Once corrosion occurs, resulting in variation of the local pH value, the CS nanocapsules release MBT in fast and 3NiSA in a slow, sustained manner. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated using the nanocapsules for hindering the corrosion of copper as measured by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance.","corrosion, chemistry, Materials Science, physics","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"
Visible light active photocatalytic C-doped titanium dioxide films deposited via reactive pulsed DC magnetron co-sputtering: Properties and photocatalytic activity,"Ratova M., Klaysri R., Praserthdam P., Kelly P.J.",2018-03-01,"Carbon doping, Photocatalytic activities, Photocatalytic property, Photoinduced hydrophilicity, Reactive magnetron co-sputtering, Visible light photocatalytic activity, Visible light responsive, Visible spectrophotometries, Carbon doping, Magnetron sputtering, Photocatalyst, Titanium dioxide, Visible light responsive","Doping of TiO2 with carbon is known to be an efficient method of enhancing visible light photocatalytic activity. The present work describes the deposition of carbon-doped titania coatings deposited by reactive magnetron co-sputtering of Ti and C targets. Undoped titania coatings were produced under similar deposition conditions for comparison purposes. Following deposition, all coatings were annealed in air at 873 K for 30 min to develop the required crystalline structure; and then analysed with EDS, XRD, AFM, XPS and UV–visible spectrophotometry. A number of tests, including methylene blue and stearic acid decomposition tests, and photo-induced hydrophilicity measurements, were employed for the assessment of the photocatalytic properties of the C-doped and un-doped titanium dioxide coatings under UV and visible light irradiation. It was found that carbon-doped titania coatings significantly outperformed undoped titania when using both visible and UV irradiation. Similar trends were observed for other properties. While excessive carbon doping has been shown to have a negative effect on the photocatalytic properties of the titanium dioxide, overall, carbon doping via reactive co-sputtering has been confirmed as an efficient method of photocatalytic property enhancement. This is due to a narrowing of the bandgap and to extended lifetimes of the photo-generated charge carriers.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Most patients with CCA have an unresectable tumor at the time of diagnosis. In Western countries, the risk of CCA increases in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, whereas liver fluke infection appears to be the major risk factor for CCA in Asian countries. A diagnosis of liver fluke infection often relies on stool samples, including microscopic examination, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, and fluke antigen detection. Tests of serum, saliva and urine samples are also potentially diagnostic. The presence of liver fluke along with exogenous carcinogens magnifies the risk of CCA in people living in endemic areas. The ""liver fluke-cholangiocarcinoma"" carcinogenesis pathways consist of mechanical damage to the bile duct epithelium, immunopathologic and cellular reactions to the liver fluke's antigens and excretory/secretory products, liver fluke-induced changes in the biliary tract microbiome and the effects of repeated treatment for liver fluke. A vaccine and novel biomarkers are needed for the primary and secondary prevention of CCA in endemic areas.

As for other types of cancers, also in HCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumour initiation, progression and therapy failure. However, as rare subpopulations of tumour tissue, CSCs are difficult to isolate, thus making the development of suitable and reliable model systems necessary. In our study, we generated HepG2 subclones with enriched CSC potential by application of the spheroid formation method and subsequent single-cell cloning. Analyses in several 2D and 3D cell culture systems as well as a panel of functional assays both in vitro and in vivo revealed that the generated subclones displayed characteristic and sustained features of tumour initiating cells as well as highly aggressive properties related to tumour progression and metastasis. These characteristics could clearly be correlated with the expression of CSC markers that might have prognostic value in the clinical HCC setting.

To identify the proteins that interact with UT-A1 and AQP2 in native rat IMCD cells, we carried out chemical cross-linking followed by detergent solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and LC-MS/MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated material. The analyses revealed 133 UT-A1-interacting proteins and 139 AQP2-interacting proteins, each identified in multiple replicates. Fifty-three proteins that were present in both the UT-A1 and the AQP2 interactomes can be considered as mediators of housekeeping interactions, likely common to all plasma membrane proteins. Among proteins unique to the UT-A1 list were those involved in posttranslational modifications: phosphorylation (protein kinases Cdc42bpb, Phkb, Camk2d, and Mtor), ubiquitylation/ deubiquitylation (Uba1, Usp9x), and neddylation (Nae1 and Uba3). Among the proteins unique to the AQP2 list were several Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab2a, Rab5b, Rab5c, Rab7a, Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab14, Rab17) involved in membrane trafficking. UT-A1 was found to interact with UT-A3, although quantitative proteomics revealed that most UT-A1 molecules in the cell are not bound to UT-A3. In vitro incubation of UT-A1 peptides with the protein kinases identified in the UT-A1 interactome revealed that all except Mtor were capable of phosphorylating known sites in UT-A1. Overall, the UT-A1 and AQP2 interactomes provide a snapshot of a dynamic process in which UT-A1 and AQP2 are produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, processed through the Golgi apparatus, delivered to endosomes that move into and out of the plasma membrane, and are regulated in the plasma membrane.","cell and developmental biology; membranes and cell transport; cell surface and plasma membrane; proteins and glycoproteins, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Physiology, Cell Biology"

After routine orchiectomy, testes were collected, and the degree of white streak areas on cut surfaces was subjectively assessed. Later, testicular tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome for evaluation of germ cell degeneration and the proportion of interstitial connective tissue, respectively. Semiquantitative severity scoring of germ cell degeneration and quantitative analysis of spermatogenic cells for spermatic index (SI) and Sertoli cell index (SEI) was performed. The score of white streak on cut surface area of the testes increased with age, being higher (p < 0.05) in senile dogs than other age groups; no difference was found between adult and old dogs. The proportion of testicular interstitial fibrosis was highest (p < 0.05) in senile dogs. Positive correlations between age and white streak area (rho = 0.77, p < 0.01) as well as age and interstitial fibrosis (rho = 0.63, p < 0.01) were observed. The severity of germ cell degeneration gradually increased with age and differed among age groups (p < 0.05). Age positively correlated with atrophy of seminiferous tubules (rho = 0.93, p < 0.01). The SI was lower (p < 0.05) in senile dogs compared to other age groups, and SI was not different among young, adult and old dogs. Conversely, SEI was significantly higher in senile dogs compared to young, adult and old dogs. A negative correlation between age and SI (rho = −0.69) and a positive correlation between age and SEI (rho = 0.68) were significant (p < 0.01).

We aimed to determine the impact of NIFTP on risk of malignancy within a cohort of thyroid nodules from Asian countries, and to compare distribution of diagnostic categories between NIFTP and invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (eFV-PTC). Consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspirates from six institutions were retrospectively analysed. Histopathology slides with a diagnosis of eFV-PTC were reviewed and reclassified into invasive eFV-PTC and NIFTP. The risk of malignancy was calculated with and without NIFTP. Of 11,372 thyroid nodules, 2044 had available surgical follow-up. NIFTP was diagnosed in 59 cases, which constituted 2.9% of all excised nodules, and 5.3% of malignant nodules. Preoperative cytological diagnoses for NIFTP were non-diagnostic (10.2%), benign (18.6%), atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (22.0%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) (32.2%), suspicious for malignancy (SM) (11.9%), and malignant (5.1%). The only category which showed a relative reduction in risk of malignancy after reclassification of more than 20%, was FN/SFN (24.4%). There was a significantly higher prevalence of benign cytology in NIFTP (p = 0.04) and SM/malignant in invasive eFV-PTC (p = 0.05). A majority of NIFTP cases were classified in indeterminate categories, which decreased the corresponding risk of malignancy. However, the magnitude of NIFTP impact was much lower than in the Western reports. Asian countries may not experience significant effects of NIFTP reclassification on the practice of thyroid cytopathology.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

The effect of different citric acid (CA):iron nitrate (N) molar ratios and acid types on the FTS performance of catalysts were investigated. The CA:N molar ratios had an important influence on the formation of iron active phases and FTS activity. The iron carbide (FexC), which is known to be one of the iron active phases, was demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Increasing the CA:N molar ratios up to 0.1 increased CO conversion of catalyst to 86.5%, which was then decreased markedly at higher CA:N molar ratios. An excess of CA resulted in carbon residues covering the catalyst surface and declined FTS activity. The optimal catalyst (CA:N molar ratio = 0.1) achieved the highest CO conversion when compared with other autocombustion catalysts as well as reference catalyst prepared by impregnation method, followed by a reduction step. The autocombustion method had the advantage to synthesize more efficient catalysts without a reduction step. More interestingly, iron-based FTS catalysts need induction duration at the initial stage of FTS reaction even after reduction, because metallic iron species need time to be transformed to FexC. But here, even if without reduction, FexC was formed directly by autocombustion and induction period was eliminated during FTS reaction.","energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

Its transcript was expressed in all tissues tested including the hemocytes, stomach, gill, lymphoid organ, muscle, intestine and heart albeit less in hepatopancreas and eyestalk. The expression of SPIPm5 gene was also up-regulated by heat stress, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection and yellow head virus (YHV) infection. Injection of recombinant rSPIPm5 protein into normal shrimp to mimic heat stress condition did not have or had little stimulating effect on the expression of other immune genes: crustinPm1, penaeidin3, penaeidin5, Hsp70, SPIPm2 and SPIPm5. Like some other proteinase inhibitors, the rSPIPm5 could inhibit the hemolymph proPO activity. In survival experiments, the rSPIPm5 could prolong the life of WSSV-infected shrimp similar to the effect of heat stress. The rSPIPm5 also helped the YHV-, Vibrio harveyi- and V. parahaemolyticus-infected shrimp survive longer. The increased endurance against microbial infection was due to the inhibitory effects presumably activated by rSPIPm5 on viral replication and bacterial growth but not the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, the SPIPm5 plays an important role in shrimp innate immunity against the viral and bacterial infection.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

The 3D-printing cassette contained two circular holes for display of letters “A” and “B” on the PAD. Whole blood was dropped onto hydrophilic letters A and B on the PAD, in which the anti-A and anti-B were pre-immobilized, respectively. An absorbent gel pad was used to adsorb excess blood sample and washing solution during the washing step. The particle size of agglutinated red blood cells (RBCs) could not be eluted out of the paper by the elution solution. In contrast, non-agglutinated RBCs were washed out by means of elution solution. The devices could be used for real blood samples in a wide range of hematocrit levels, 21–59%. Unknown blood group samples (n = 500) were identified by the developed device and the results were compared with the conventional method, revealing 100% accuracy.

However, it needs to be compared with contralateral normal hip leading to limited use in bilateral disease. We, therefore, develop a ratio between epiphyseal height and metaphyseal width of affected hips to estimate lateral pillar involvement. This study aimed to assess the height-width ratio of the proximal femoral epiphysis in non-Perthes children, and to find the relationship between the height-width ratio and lateral pillar classification in Perthes disease. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2009 and 2015. Phase I included children aged 2 to 15 years who did not have Perthes disease. Phase II included children aged 2 to 15 years who had Perthes disease. Other abnormal proximal femoral epiphysis was excluded. Lateral pillar height and metaphyseal width were independently measured twice by 2 assessors in each phase. Intraobserver and interobserver levels of agreement, height-width ratio and cut-off points to differentiate lateral pillar types were determined. Results: There were 69 children (87 hip radiographs) who had non-Perthes hips, and 18 boys with Perthes disease (20 hip radiographs). Height-width ratio in the non-Perthes group increased from 0.38 to 0.48 at 2 to 10 years of age and remained constant until maturity. Average height-width ratio in lateral pillar A/non-Perthes hip was 0.47±0.05, lateral pillar B or B/C 0.32±0.05, and lateral pillar C 0.18±0.05. Intraobserver and interobserver level of agreements of height-width ratio in Perthes disease were 0.007 (95% confidence interval, -0.030 to 0.043) and 0.006 (95% confidence interval, -0.119 to 0.107), respectively. Cut-off values to differentiate lateral pillar A and B or B/C was 0.40, and to differentiate lateral pillar B or B/C, and C was 0.25 with 90% accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9. Conclusions: Height-width ratio is useful for grading severity in unilateral and bilateral Perthes disease. It has excellent reliability and validity with exact cutoff values to estimate lateral pillar classification.

Indeed, depression is associated with increased expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α). In contrast, reductions of the activity of major histocompatibility complex protein molecules - class I and class II and natural killer cells are also observed. Similarly, cancers present elevated levels of TNF-α, reduced major histocompatibility complex class I and II, and natural killer cells. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway, is induced by interferon-γ, interleukin-6, TNF-α, and oxidative stress. IDO catabolizes tryptophan, the amino acid precursor of serotonin and melatonin, to the metabolites collectively called TRYCATs. TRYCAT pathway activation is accompanied by downregulation of immune cell proliferation, function, and survival. The increase in IDO activity in tumor microenvironments is related to tumor cell escape from immune surveillance. Despite the evidence of inflammatory mechanisms underlying cancer and depression, it is important to emphasize that both diseases are heterogeneous and, as such, inflammatory mechanisms may not be relevant to all patients. Thus, the purpose of this review is to examine whether detrimental TRYCATs - synthesis of which increases in depression and cancer - are a pathophysiological link between the two diseases, and whether IDO is a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of the comorbid depression and cancer.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
New application of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging for the assessment of deglutitive tongue movement,"Ekprachayakoon I., Miyamoto J.J., Inoue-Arai M.S., Honda E.-I., Takada J.-I., Kurabayashi T., Moriyama K.",2018-12-01,"Adult, Cephalometry, Deglutition, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine, Malocclusion, Movement, Reference Values, Tongue, Cine-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, Deglutition, Movement, Tongue","Background: Deglutitive motion of the tongue may function to maintain tooth position. However, the causation between abnormal patterns of orofacial muscle function and dental malocclusion remains unclear. To clarify the pathogenic mechanism of malocclusion, it is important to determine the relative positional relationship between the tongue tip and incisor edge or the dorsal tongue and palate during deglutition. Here, we assessed the utility of 3-T segmented cine-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, combined with static MR images for hard tissue visualization, in assessing the relationship between the tongue and the surrounding tissues during deglutitive tongue movement. Methods: Cine-MR images were acquired from three healthy female volunteers during deglutition who had no history of swallowing disorder or other chronic illness, normal alignment and occlusion, and a skeletal class I relationship. Three cine-MR images were taken during deglutition in accordance with an auditory cue for each volunteer. During static imaging, custom-made, contrast-medium-filled clear retainers were positioned in the mouth to allow visualization of the upper and lower incisors and hard palate boundaries. Static images were superimposed onto images of the three stages in deglutitive tongue movement, which were selected from a series of cine-MR images. These superimpositions were assessed five times by tracing cephalometric parameters to examine the reproducibility of the method. Results: Traces varied little across repeated measurements, and all subjects had a similar pattern of dorsal tongue movement. Tongue-to-palate contact increased slightly during the first to second stage of swallowing and abruptly increased during the second to third stage, while the tongue tip position remained constant. Conclusions: Segmented cine-MR imaging combined with static MR images is useful for assessing soft tissue motion during deglutition. This method is particularly useful in dentistry to evaluate the relationship between tongue function and maxillofacial morphology in terms of orthodontic treatment and orofacial myofunctional therapy, and for improving tongue movement during speech therapy.",dentistry,Orthodontics

The specimens were prepared by the electrodeposition technique with controlled bath compositions and varied applied current waveforms. The microstructural and chemical investigations indicate that current pulsation with 50% duty cycle and 50 Hz frequency provides significantly smoother coating surface of uniform nodules, with comparable Fe content but different phase composition, as compared to the direct current condition. The vibrating sample magnetometer evidently shows that the deposits prepared with a pulsed current exhibit relatively small coercivity, below 4 Oe. Using the four-point probe technique, the MI ratio of the pulse deposits is found to reach a significantly high value above 2,000% with decent sensitivity.

A signal transition graph is one of the effective alternatives to represent the behavioral design of a huge asynchronous system. The design could be verified beforehand to assure several essential properties including its consistency property. In this paper, the formal modeling scheme of a signal transition graph is proposed along with the consistency property in term of the linear temporal formula. The target signal transition graph is written in Promela code and verified using SPIN model checker. The result shows that the method can verify consistency property automatically.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Modeling and Simulation"
Prevalence and associated factors of obstructive sleep apnea in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery,"Kositanurit W., Muntham D., Udomsawaengsup S., Chirakalwasan N.",2018-03-01,"Adult, Bariatric Surgery, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Male, Obesity, Morbid, Polysomnography, Prevalence, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, Thailand, Bariatric surgery, Morbid obesity, Obstructive sleep apnea","Purpose: Our goal in this study is to determine the prevalence and associated factors of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2007 to 2015. Data of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery were included using ICD-10 code for principle diagnosis “morbid obesity” (E668) and ICD-9 code for “bariatric surgery” (4389, 4438, 4439). Results: Baseline characteristics of 238 patients who met the inclusion criteria demonstrated 49.2% male, mean age of 33.9 ± 10.8 years, and mean BMI of 52.6 ± 11.6. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery were performed in 51.5 and 48.5%; respectively. High risk for OSA using STOP-Bang as a screening questionnaire (≥3 points) was 92.7%. The prevalence of OSA using respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5 was demonstrated at 85.7%. Mild, moderate, and severe OSA was observed in 8.8, 15.3, and 75.9%, respectively. Snoring, STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, fatty liver, and BMI were significantly correlated with OSA compared to the group without OSA with the odds ratio of 17.04 (p = OpenSPiltSPi0.0001, 95% CI = 6.67–43.49), 16 (p = 0.01, 95% CI = 1.95–131.11), 4.75 (p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.82–12.37), and 1.04 (p = 0.045, 95% CI = 1.0009–1.09), respectively. Comparison between non-severe and severe OSA groups demonstrated dyslipidemia and BMI to be correlated with OSA severity (odds ratio = 3.06, 95% CI 1.36–6.89, p = 0.007 and odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.13, p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is frequently observed in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and the severity tends to be severe. Snoring, STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, fatty liver, and BMI were significantly correlated with OSA. Dyslipidemia and BMI were demonstrated to be associated factors for severity of OSA in this population.",medical,"Otorhinolaryngology, Neurology (clinical)"
The Effects of Electro-Chemical Chloride Extraction on the Migration of Ions and the Corrosion State of Embedded Steel in Reinforced Concrete,"Nguyen H.Y.T., Pansuk W., Sancharoen P.",2018-08-01,"Chloride extraction, Chloride removal, Cylindrical concrete, desalinization, Electrochemical chloride extraction, Extraction process, Half-cell potential, Water/binder ratios, chloride removal, corrosion, desalinization, electro-chemical chloride extraction","The effects of electrochemical chloride extraction were evaluated using different electrolytes and binders on cylindrical concrete specimens with a water/binder ratio of 0.4. Two-percent NaCl by weight of binder was added to the water as a chloride source during concrete casting. After the specimens were immersed in water for three months, direct current 0.5 A/m2 was applied to release approximately 30% initial chloride. The use of intermittent mode during extraction process was more efficient in releasing chloride than a continuous mode. After treatment, although the average remaining-chloride content was higher than threshold value, its content at the interface was only approximately 0.4%. The accumulation of alkaline ions around the embedded steel was noticeable but the distribution of calcium ions showed as different tendency. The migration of ions from the electrolyte was insignificant. This demonstrated the important role of internal ions in transferring the charge during extraction; simultaneously, the decomposition or transformation of hydrated products is inevitable. After the treatment was stopped for four weeks, the half-cell potential of the steel reached to low-corrosion state.",engineering,Civil and Structural Engineering

Development of vaccine tends to be the most promising and cost-effective remedy against the said pathogen. Herein, we implement a combinatorial approach for screening proteins harboring potential broad-spectrum antigenic epitopes in the proteome of P. mirabilis. The targets are host non-homologous, essential and virulent, and have localization in the extracellular and outer membrane. Immuno-informatics revealed antigenic, surface exposed and broad-spectrum B-cell derived T-cell epitopes for three membrane usher family candidates: AtfC, PMI2533 and PMI1466, which could evoke a substantial immune response. Protein-protein interactions of targeted three proteins have shown their involvement in biologically significant pathways indispensable for the growth and survival of the pathogen. The antigenic epitopes are conserved among all completely annotated strains and docked deeply in the binding cavity of the most prevalent allele-DRB1*0101 in human population. Future work is necessary to characterize the shortlisted proteins and epitopes for immune protection in animal models.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology; human vaccines, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology"
Detection of differential settlement of man-made structures coupled with urban development by using persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI),"Susaki J., Maruo N., Tsujino M., Boonyatee T.",2018-07-01,"Differential interferometric sar, Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radars, Differential settlement, Man-made structures, Permanent scatterers, Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), Satellite synthetic aperture radar images, Underground pipeline, Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), Differential settlement, Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)","Many cities are prone to land subsidence, particularly due to the overuse of ground water. However, because man-made structures are normally built upon foundations that are stiffer than the surrounding ground, such structures react to land subsidence to a lesser extent. This settlement mismatch between ground and buildings, also known as differential settlement (DS), may cause serious problems in urban management, such as foundation overloading due to down-drag forces and damage to underground pipelines. Here, we present a technique for determining DS from multi-temporal satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Permanent scatterers originating from ground and man-made structures are extracted using the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique, whereupon the DS is obtained by subtracting the settlement of the former from that of the latter. For validation purposes, we demonstrate that the estimated DS in Bangkok is consistent with field observations.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)
Chronic exposure to low-level cadmium induced zinc-copper dysregulation,"Satarug S., Nishijo M., Ujjin P., Moore M.R.",2018-03-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Cadmium, Carrier Proteins, Copper, Creatinine, Environmental Pollutants, Female, Humans, Kidney, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Assessment, Young Adult, Zinc, Cadmium toxicity, Copper to zinc ratio, Kidneys, Metal homeostasis, Toxicity threshold, Zinc transporters","Background and objectives Exposure to cadmium (Cd) has been associated with aberrant zinc and copper homeostasis. This study investigated if Cd exposure impairs renal reabsorption of metals. Methods Renal tubular reabsorption of metals were calculated from urine to serum metal ratios and analyzed for an independent association with Cd exposure levels, using data from 100 men and 100 women, aged 16–60 years. Results The smoking prevalence was 30% in men and 0% in women. The male and female means (SD) for urine Cd were 0.54 (0.43) and 0.62 (0.43) μg/g creatinine. The mean (SD) for fractional zinc reabsorption was 77.2 (23) % in men and 87.7 (13.3) % in women, while the copper reabsorption was 100% in both men and women. Lower zinc reabsorption levels were associated with higher Cd exposure (P < 0.001), higher serum copper to zinc ratios (P = 0.007) and higher tubular impairment levels (P = 0.024). Reduced zinc reabsorption was particularly severe in smokers as those with high Cd exposure had 44.9% and 37.2% (P < 0.001) lower zinc reabsorption than those with low and moderate exposures. The mean zinc reabsorption in male non-smokers with high Cd exposure was 25.8% (P < 0.001) and 18.2% (P = 0.003) lower than those with low and moderate exposures, while the corresponding figure for female non-smokers was 17% (P < 0.001), and 12.8% (P = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions This is the first report demonstrating Cd-dose dependent reduction in renal zinc reabsorption and high serum copper to zinc ratios.","biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Inorganic Chemistry"
Anxiety disorders: Sex differences in serotonin and tryptophan metabolism,"Songtachalert T., Roomruangwong C., Carvalho A.F., Bourin M., Maes M.",2018-01-01,"Animals, Anxiety Disorders, Female, Humans, Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase, Male, Serotonin, Sex Characteristics, Tryptophan, 5-HT, Anxiety disorders, Immune system, Inflammation, Sex, Tryptophan","Introduction: Anxiety disorders manifest in women more than in men by almost twofold. This narrative review aims to summarize the sex-related biological factors, which underpin anxiety, focusing on the interactions of sex and tryptophan/serotonin with anxiety. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception until December 31, 2017. Results: This review shows that sex may interact with many serotonin functions thereby modulating anxiety, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors, 5-HT transporter and central 5-HT concentrations and metabolism. Sex-steroids modulate the expression of serotonin transporter genes, creating a difference in serotonin availability. Sex and estrous cycle phases lead to varying anxiety responses to tryptophan depletion. Testosterone, progesterone and estrogen are important factors in mediating sex differences in serotonin responses to anxiety-generating behavioral tests. At prenatal levels, there are sex-related differences in the reciprocal relationships between serotonin and the HPA-axis, which modulate anxiety-like behaviors. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways induce indoleamine-2,3-dioxynease (IDO) and the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway thereby increasing tryptophan degradation and increasing the production of TRYCATs including kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which may create an overall anxiogenic effect. The effects of immune activation on IDO are significantly more pronounced in women than men, and therefore, females may show increased levels of anxiogenic TRYCAT following immune challenge. Aberrations in the IDO-activated TRYCAT pathway are found in pregnant females and parturients and are associated with increased anxiety levels in the postnatal period. Conclusion: The results of this review underscore the necessity of studying the associations between serotonin and anxiety in both sexes taking into account the effects of immune activation on IDO and production of anxiogenic TRYCATs. Future anxiety research should focus on the interactions between serotonin/tryptophan and sex, sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the HPA axis and the immune system through the production of anxiogenic TRYCATs.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery
Effects of iron content on the microstructure and corrosion behavior of Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys,"Gao X., Xia C., Zhang X., Jing Q., Ma M., Qin J., Liu R.",2018-10-01,"304 stainless steel, Capacitive behavior, Corrosion behavior, Corrosion current densities, Impedance spectrum, Passive film breakdown, Pitting potential, Potentiodynamic polarization curves, EIS, Microstructure, Pitting corrosion, Polarization, Titanium alloy","The microstructure and corrosion behavior of the hot-rolled Ti-30Zr-5Al-3V-xFe alloys were investigated. All the alloys are composed of α and β phases. With the increase of Fe content, α laths gradually decreases and the relative content of β phase increases. Potentiodynamic polarization curves recorded in 3.5% NaCl and 5% HCl solutions show that all the alloys exhibit a passivation behavior at potential in the range of 0.25–1.25 V (SCE). An evident change in corrosion current density is presented for all of the alloys in both solutions, which can be attributed to the passive film breakdown caused by pitting corrosion. All the alloys exhibit more positive pitting potential compared with the typical 304 stainless steel. The impedance spectra were fitted using equivalent circuit with two time constants. The alloys with different Fe contents exhibit capacitive behavior with phase angles closed to −80° and high impedance values at low frequency. Containing Fe alloys exhibit commendable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which is markedly superior to the typical 304 stainless steel although the corrosion resistance decreases by the addition of Fe. The relative content of α and β phases and the segregations of Fe and V elements are identified as the main factors that affect the corrosion resistance of the hot-rolled alloys.","corrosion, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Although the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on comorbid asthma have been relatively well studied, the outcomes of ESS on comorbid bronchiectasis have rarely been examined. Objective: We sought to determine sinonasal and pulmonary clinical outcomes of ESS in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. Method: We reviewed all bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS at our institution from 2006 to present. The sinonasal outcome test 22 (SNOT-22) was administered preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years postoperatively. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were measured preoperatively and at 6 months and 1 year post operation to assess the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced viral capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC values. Paired t test and Pearson correlation were used to compare pre- and postsurgical results. Results: A total of 141 bronchiectasis patients who had ESS for CRS were studied. The most common cause of bronchiectasis was cystic fibrosis (CF) (42.55%). SNOT-22 scores improved at 3 months post operation and were maintained at 1 year and 3 years post operation (P <.001). All SNOT sub-domains showed a significant improvement after surgery (P <.01). However, PFTs did not change at 6 months post operation and 1 year post operation (P >.05). There were significant differences in the outcomes in CF versus non-CF patients (P <.05) but not by sex or age. Conclusion: ESS is effective in improving long-term sinonasal outcomes in bronchiectasis patients with CRS. However, ESS does not appear to improve the pulmonary function.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Otorhinolaryngology"
Parameter-controllable microchannel reactor for enhanced deposition of copper sulfide thin films,"Kosoljitkul P., Rakkroekkong P., Vas-Umnuay P.",2018-01-31,"Controllable parameters, Controlled deposition, Copper sulfides, Heterogeneous nucleation and growth, Mass transfer characteristics, Micro channel reactors, Micro-scale structures, Solution-based deposition, Copper sulfide thin films, Microchannel reactor, Solution-based deposition","A microchannel reactor was designed and fabricated based on the unique fluid-flow and mass transfer characteristics in a closely parallel channel for the deposition of copper sulfide (CuxS) thin films. The configuration of the microchannel allows the flow pattern to be confined uniformly across the channel width and length, thereby resulting in a uniform deposited thin film covering the whole surface of the substrate. A parametric study of the deposition of CuxS thin films was performed, including the effects of deposition time (2–10 min), flow rate (2–6 ml/min) and reaction temperature (60–80 °C). It was observed that the basic characteristics of CuxS films, such as morphology, film thickness, film composition and optical band gap, were highly affected by all deposition parameters. We were able to attain smooth, dense and adherent CuxS film with homogeneous grains at a high growth rate of 1.8 μm/h, by optimizing the controllable parameters. The optimized condition was at temperature of 80 °C, flow rate of 6 ml/min and deposition time of 4 min. The results showed that the film formation by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the substrate is promoted over homogeneous reaction in the solution phase, which is strongly due to the incorporation of the optimal channel design in a micro-scale structure together with the controlled deposition parameters. This method can overcome the issue of the deposition in limited area and can be scaled for large-area substrates with good uniformity of CuxS films.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

A CeO2 morphology-dependent Au-CeO2 interaction was observed. Au/CeO2-R in this present work performed the outstanding activity at lower temperature than ever since other works were reported. The Au catalyst supported on rod-shaped CeO2 exhibited the highest CO conversion level of 97.9% at 30 °C, followed by that on polyhedral- (94.0%), cube- (74.0%) and octahedral- (27.7%) shaped CeO2. The catalytic activities were strongly affected by the CeO2 crystal-planes and Au active species. The rod-shaped CeO2 enclosed by (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes might interact strongly with Au species, generating the most accessible active sites to absorb/desorb and activate the CO and oxygen molecules. The octahedral-shaped CeO2 enclosed by the (1 1 1) plane had the lowest catalytic activity since the (1 1 1) plane is the most stable and irreducible of the CeO2 (1 1 1), (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) planes, accounting for its decreased catalytic activity.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

collisions, Relative efficiency, Particle identification methods, Pattern recognition, cluster finding, calibration and fitting methods, Performance of High Energy Physics Detectors","Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The b jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV).","physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

However, CYP3A5 is also expressed in the kidney tissue and may contribute to local tacrolimus clearance in the kidney allograft. We aimed to evaluate the association between the allograft CYP3A5 genotype and transplant outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, comparing 2 groups of donor and recipient CYP3A5 genotypes, the expressor (∗1/∗1 and ∗1/∗3) and the non-expressor (∗3/∗3). The primary outcomes were allograft complications including calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity and acute rejection episode. Results: Of the 50 enrolled patients, 21 donors were expressors and 29 donors were the non-expressors. Tacrolimus trough concentrations were similar between the 2 genotypes. The incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity was higher in recipients with non-expressor donor genotype compared with the expressor donor genotype (72.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.006). CNI nephrotoxicity incidence was not different when recipient's genotypes were compared. Multivariate analysis from Cox-regression showed a hazard ratio of 3.18 (p = 0.026) for CNI nephrotoxicity in the non-expressor compared with the expressor donor. The recipient CYP3A5 genotypes did not significantly contribute to CNI nephrotoxicity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the lowest CNI nephrotoxicity-free survival in recipients with the expressor genotype who received allograft from the non-expressor donors (p = 0.005). Conclusion: In conclusion, our results suggest that donor CYP3A5 non-expressor genotype (∗3/∗3) is a risk for CNI nephrotoxicity.",medical,Nephrology

The generalized stress field of the crack for two basic loading cases, viz. uniformly distributed self-equilibrated crack-face loading and a pair of crack-face self-equilibrated unit normal point forces and unit point electrical charges, are employed together with the asymptotic near-front expansion to establish fundamental solutions for the generalized T-stress. Such fundamental solutions are explicit and involve only elementary functions, and are then utilized to form an explicit integral formula for computing the generalized T-stress of a penny-shaped crack under general crack-face loading. The exact integration of the integral formula is also established for specific loading conditions, whereas its evaluation via an efficient quadrature for general loading conditions is also addressed. A selected set of numerical results is presented to verify the proposed quadrature and significant and useful findings are also reported.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Binding sites for Pd and Ag atoms toward the TiO 2 surface atoms are three atoms (Ti 5C and two O 2C atoms) and two O 2C atoms of the TiO 2 (1 0 1) surface, respectively. Due to adsorptions of H 2 and hydrogen–containing (H 2 O, NH 3 , and CH 4 ) gases on the Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 , adsorption abilities on the Pd/TiO 2 and Ag/TiO 2 are in decreasing orders: NH 3 > H 2 O > H 2 > CH 4 and NH 3 > H 2 O > CH 4 > H 2 , respectively.

We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants. In addition, we introduce a novel spectral vector error diffusion algorithm based on combining color contoning and halftoning, which simultaneously solves the layout discretization and color quantization problems, accurately and efficiently. Our workflow outperforms the state-of-the-art models for spectral prediction and layout optimization.

In this work, methyl palmitate (palmitic acid methyl ester) having a melting point around 30℃, was used as a model solid non-particulate (waxy) soil. A total surfactant concentration of 0.35 wt% of the selected formulation (4:0.65 weight ratio of C12,13-4PO-SO4Na:SMDNS) with 5.3 wt% NaCl was able to form a middle phase microemulsion at a high temperature (40℃),which provided the highest oil removal level with the lowest oil redeposition and the lowest IFT, and was much higher than that with a commercial detergent or de-ionized water. Most of the detached oil, whether in liquid or solid state, was in an unsolubilized form. Hence, the dispersion stability of the detached oil droplets or solidified oil particles that resulted from the surfactant adsorption played an important role in the oil redeposition. For an oily detergency, the lower the system IFT, the higher the oil removal whereas for a waxy (non-particulate) soil detergency, the lower the contact angle, the higher the solidified oil removal. For a liquefied oil, the detergency mechanism was roll up and emulsification with dispersion stability, while that for the waxy soil (solid oil) was the detachment by wettability with dispersion stability.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

In this work, high-performance H2S gas sensors are developed based on nickel-doped calcium copper titanate (Ni-doped CCTO) thin films synthesized by a sol-gel method. From gas-sensing measurements, the response of Ni-doped CCTO sensing films increased substantially with increasing Ni doping level from 1.5 to 7.3 wt%, revealing a catalytic effect of Ni on the surface reactions with adsorbed H2S molecules. In particular, 7.3 wt% Ni-doped CCTO sensors offered a high response of 120 for 10 ppm of H2S at the optimal operating temperature of 250 °C, an order of magnitude higher than that of undoped one. In addition, the response time dropped significantly from ∼80 s to ∼4 s while the recovery time slightly improved as the Ni doping content increased from 0 to 7.3 wt%. Moreover, the Ni-doped CCTO sensors exhibited good reproducibility and high H2S selectivity against ethanol, H2, NO2 and NH3. Therefore, the Ni-doped CCTO sensors are highly promising for sensitive and selective detections of H2S.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Catalytic hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters over Pd supported on Zr-SBA-15 with various Zr loading levels for enhanced oxidative stability,"Thunyaratchatanon C., Luengnaruemitchai A., Chollacoop N., Chen S.-Y., Yoshimura Y.",2018-10-01,"Catalytic hydrogenation, Catalytic performance, Fatty acid methyl ester, Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Pd catalyst, Zr-SBA-15, Biodiesel, Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Pd catalyst, XPS, Zr-SBA-15","Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil (SO)-derived biodiesel, as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), over mesoporous palladium (Pd)/SBA-15 materials was examined in a semi-batch reactor. The amount of Pd/SBA-15 catalyst was varied from 0.5–1% by weight (wt%) of the SO feedstock. The selectivity of saturated FAMEs (C18:0), which contribute to an excellent oxidative stability but undesirable cold flow properties, over the Pd/SBA-15 catalyst at different wt% was poor after a 4-h reaction period. To improve the catalytic performance, zirconium (Zr) species were incorporated in the SBA-15, resulting in Zr-SBA-15 with tunable acidity and pore properties. Partial hydrogenation of SO-FAME over 0.75 wt% Pd/xZr-SBA-15 catalysts (where x is the Zr/silicon (Si) molar ratio and ranged from 0.01 to 0.11) was performed for 2 h. The catalytic performance and the selectivity towards trans-monounsaturated FAMEs (trans-C18:1), in terms of the turnover frequency (TOF) and trans-C18:1/cis-C18:1 ratio, respectively, were considered at 10% and 80% conversion levels of diunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2). The incorporation of Zr into SBA-15 resulted in an enhanced TOF due to the greater adsorption of both H2 and the basic double bonds of FAME molecules on the electron-deficient catalyst surfaces. The TOF for the Pd/xZr-SBA-15 catalysts increased as the Zr/Si molar ratio increased up to 0.07, and then slightly dropped at higher Zr/Si molar ratios, presumably due to the hindrance of adsorbed-reacted FAME molecules with strong adsorption and the worsening of physical properties, i.e. pore width (DP). The selectivity towards trans-C18:1 was directly correlated with the Zr/Si molar ratio. Since the strong adsorption of FAME molecules took place on the catalyst surface, the high level of trans-C18:1 was consequently generated. The oxidative stability of the partially hydrogenated biodiesels was improved by more than four-fold compared to that of the starting SO-FAMEs.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

There are biodegradable beads available, but their effect on skin desquamation has not been evaluated yet. This study aimed to understand the skin renewal time, moisturizing effect and user's satisfaction of gel scrubs containing different exfoliating beads. Methods: Gel scrubs, containing polyethylene, mannan or wax beads, were used in this study. The stratum corneum turnover time (SCTT) and skin hydration were evaluated by dansyl chloride staining technique and Corneometer®, respectively. The self-assessment was also performed after a 3-week home use trial. Results: The SCTTs of three different gel scrubs were not significantly different. A numerical increase in the skin hydration level was found in all groups. Satisfaction scores for the appearance and usability attributes were similar, but scores for improvement in the skin hydration and skin smoothness were higher in the gel scrubs with mannan or wax beads. Conclusion: All three gel scrubs provided a similar effect on the SCTT and skin hydration, but gel scrubs with mannan or wax beads were more favorable. Thus, these two biodegradable exfoliating beads may be good substitutes in scrubbing products.","genergyal, dermatology and venergyeology, fluidex; related topics, medical",Dermatology

We previously demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused hypomethylation of LINE-1 elements in bladder cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of LINE-1-encoded protein (ORF1p) and oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in human bladder cancer tissues, as well as induction of ORF1p expression by ROS in bladder cancer cell lines. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six cancerous and 15 non-cancerous adjacent tissues were immunohistochemically stained for ORF1p and 4-HNE. ORF1p expression and cell migration were determined in bladder cancer cells exposed to H2O2. Results: ORF1p and 4-HNE expression was higher in cancerous than non-cancerous tissues. Elevated ORF1p expression was associated with increased 4-HNE expression and with advanced tumors. H2O2 provoked oxidative stress and up-regulated ORF1p expression in VM-CUB-1 compared to the untreated control, and to a lesser degree in TCCSUP. H2O2 exposure enhanced cell migration in UM-UC-3, TCCSUP and VM-CUB-1. Conclusion: Elevated ORF1p expression is associated with tumor progression.

Two commercial SDC nanopowders; SDC-I and SDC-F, are comparatively studied their morphology, crystal structure, specific surface area and pore volume in order to distinguish the effect of above features on the adsorption capability for metal-ion removal. The spherical SDC-F nanopowder is more effective for removal those three metals than SDC-I nanopowders having a cluster plate-like structure. Among those three metal ions, Pb(II) shows the highest sorption amount on the SDC-F surface. The adsorption parameters for Pb(II) on SDC-F are optimized via variable pH values, metal-ion concentrations, adsorbent dosages, temperatures and contact times. Adsorption capacity of Pb(II) on SDC-F nanopowder is maximum at pH = 5.6. Higher removal ability is found at lower metal-ion concentration but higher adsorbent dosage, temperature and contact time. Kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption of Pb(II) on SDC-F nanopowder follows the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity of SDC-F for Pb(II) ions calculated by Langmuir isotherm is 23 mg g−1. Adsorption of Pb(II) on SDC-F is confined by the agglomeration of spherical nanoparticles. The outcome of this study shows that the SDC-F nanoparticles is possible candidate for removal of Pb(II) ions from wastewater.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Here, we found shorter femoral and tibial lengths in 7-month, but not 13-month, Goto-Kakizaki (GK) T2DM rats as compared to wild-type rats. Bone µCT analysis showed long-lasting impairment of both cortical and trabecular bones in GK rats. Although insulin treatment effectively improved hyperglycemia, it was not able to rescue trabecular BMD and cortical thickness in young adult GK rats. In conclusion, insulin treatment and alleviation of hyperglycemia did not increase BMD of osteopenic GK rats.

The CDK inhibitor purvalanol A induces neutrophil apoptosis and increases the turnover rate of Mcl-1: potential role of p38-MAPK in regulation of Mcl-1 turnover,"Phoomvuthisarn P., Cross A., Glennon-Alty L., Wright H.L., Edwards S.W.",2018-05-01,"Apoptosis, Cells, Cultured, Gene Expression Regulation, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Monocytes, Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein, Naphthalenes, Neutrophils, p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Purines, Pyrazoles, Signal Transduction, apoptosis, cell activation, neutrophils, protein kinases/phophatases","Human neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells that do not replicate and yet express a number of enzymes, notably cell cycle-dependent kinases (CDKs), that are associated normally with control of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. In neutrophils, CDKs appear to function mainly to regulate apoptosis, although the mechanisms by which they regulate this process are largely unknown. Here we show that the CDK2 inhibitor, purvalanol A, induces a rapid decrease in myeloid cell leukaemia factor-1 (Mcl-1) levels in human neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but only induces apoptosis in neutrophils which are dependent upon expression on this protein for survival. This rapid decrease in cellular Mcl-1 protein levels was due to a purvalanol A-induced decrease in stability, with the half-life of the protein decreasing from approximately 2 h in control cells to just over 1 h after addition of the CDK2 inhibitor: it also blocked the granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent stabilization of Mcl-1. Purvanalol A blocked GM-CSF-stimulated activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, and stimulated an additive activation of protein kinase B (Akt) with GM-CSF. Purvalanol A alone stimulated a rapid and sustained activation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the pan p38-MAPK inhibitor, BIRB796, partly blocked the purvalanol A-induced apoptosis and Mcl-1 loss. These novel effects of purvalanol A may result, at least in part, from blocking GM-CSF-mediated Erk activation. In addition, we propose that purvalanol A-induced activation of p38-MAPK is, at least in part, responsible for its rapid effects on Mcl-1 turnover and acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The SBA-15 support was incorporated on a zirconium (Zr) and bimetal of zirconium and lanthanum (Zr-La) prepared by sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods. The catalysts were characterized by means of N2 physisorption, SEM/ EDX, and NH3-TPD. The experimental results demonstrated that the Zr-La/SBA-15-HT exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Ethanol conversion and ethylene selectivity were found to increase with increased reaction temperature. The best catalytic results were achieved for Zr-La/SBA-15-HT indicating values of ethanol conversion and ethylene yield of ca. 84% and 80%, respectively at 400℃. The most important parameter influencing their catalytic properties appears to be the interaction between metal and support depending on different methods.

Meanwhile, the performance of these SBA-15 supported catalysts in ethanol dehydration is also related with the alteration of surface acidity caused by the introduction of Zr and Zr-La.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Single observation adaptive search for continuous simulation optimization,"Kiatsupaibul S., Smith R.L., Zabinsky Z.B.",2018-11-01,"Accumulated errors, Adaptive search, Continuous simulation, Estimation errors, Numerical experiments, Regularity condition, Simulation optimization, Strong law of large numbers, Adaptive search, Martingale processes, Simulation optimization","Optimizing the performance of complex systems modeled by stochastic computer simulations is a challenging task, partly because of the lack of structural properties (e.g., convexity). This challenge is magnified by the presence of random error whereby an adaptive algorithm searching for better designs can at times mistakenly accept an inferior design. In contrast to performing multiple simulations at a design point to estimate the performance of the design, we propose a framework for adaptive search algorithms that executes a single simulation for each design point encountered. Here the estimation errors are reduced by averaging the performances from previously evaluated designs drawn from a shrinking ball around the current design point. We show under mild regularity conditions for continuous design spaces that the accumulated errors, although dependent, form a martingale process, and hence, by the strong law of large numbers for martingales, the average errors converge to zero as the algorithm proceeds. This class of algorithms is shown to converge to a global optimum with probability one. By employing a shrinking ball approach with single observations, an adaptive search algorithm can simultaneously improve the estimates of performance while exploring new and potentially better design points. Numerical experiments offer empirical support for this paradigm of single observation simulation optimization.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Computer Science Applications, Management Science and Operations Research"

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has received attention as a pre-dementia stage. Objectives: To delineate the CERAD-NP features of MCI and their clinical utility to externally validate MCI diagnosis. Methods: The study included 60 patients with MCI, diagnosed using the Clinical Dementia Rating, and 63 normal controls. Data were analysed employing receiver operating characteristic analysis, Linear Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network models, and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). Results: MCI patients were best discriminated from normal controls using a combination of Wordlist Recall, Wordlist Memory, and Verbal Fluency Test. Machine learning showed that the CERAD features learned from MCI patients and controls were not strongly predictive of the diagnosis (maximal cross-validation 77.2%), whilst t-SNE showed that there is a considerable overlap between MCI and controls. Conclusions: The most important features of the CERAD-NP differentiating MCI from normal controls indicate impairments in episodic and semantic memory and recall. While these features significantly discriminate MCI patients from normal controls, the tests are not predictive of MCI.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, medical, neuroscience","Geriatrics and Gerontology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Oral fluid samples used for PRRSV acclimatization program and sow performance monitoring in endemic PRRS-positive farms,"Woonwong Y., Kedkovid R., Arunorat J., Sirisereewan C., Nedumpun T., Poonsuk K., Panyasing Y., Poolperm P., Boonsoongnern A., Thanawongnuwech R.",2018-02-01,"Acclimatization, Animals, Antibodies, Viral, Antibody Formation, Farms, Female, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, RNA, Viral, Saliva, Swine, Swine Diseases, Acclimatization, Gilts, Monitoring, Oral fluid, PRRSV, Reproductive performance","An effective gilt acclimatization program is one of the most important management strategies for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. Recently, oral fluid samples have been used as alternative diagnostic samples for various swine diseases. This study utilized oral fluids for PRRSV monitoring during the gilt acclimatization period in PRRSV endemic farms. The study was performed in two selected commercial breeding herds (farm A and farm B). PRRSV RNA and PRRSV-specific antibodies were monitored using oral fluid and serum samples. Sow performance parameters related to PRRSV infection were recorded and assessed. After PRRSV exposure during acclimatization, viral RNA was demonstrated in oral fluids from 1 to 10 weeks post-exposure (WPE). PRRSV RNA was detected in serum at 1 and 4 WPE in farm A and at 1, 4, 8, and 12 WPE in farm B. Prolonged viremia of gilts from farm B was possibly due to re-infection (within the herd) and later, reproductive problems were found in the breeding herd. The correlation of PRRSV RNA concentration in oral fluids and serum was evident. The S/P ratio values of PRRSV antibodies in oral fluid samples were higher and had similar patterns of antibody responses to the serum samples. The results suggest that the use of oral fluid samples for PRRSV monitoring during gilt acclimatization in endemic farms is effective, convenient, practical, and economical and would be most beneficial when used with other parameters.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

The pathogen exhibits an intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, which is exacerbated by the absence of a vaccine. This prompts a quest for novel drug targets, to tackle the alarming threat to human health caused by multiple-drug resistant Y. enterocolitica. Subtractive proteomics have revealed that Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate synthase enzyme is a safe target for novel inhibitors, as it is involved in the pathogen's essential Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate pathway. Structure based virtual screening has led to the identification of a natural drug-like compound, 2-acetyl-3-(2-heptanamidoethyl)-1H-indol-6-yl heptanoate that demonstrated a high affinity to the enzyme active site in docking studies. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in aqueous solution confirm that the compound remains stable in the enzyme's active site throughout the simulation. ASN18 was identified as playing a significant role in mediating strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the compound and the enzyme active site. Binding free energy calculations using the Molecular Mechanics – Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA) and WaterSwap methods also predict that the compound binds to the enzyme with high affinity. The data from the present work is encouraging and will aid in the discovery of novel antibiotics against this deadly pathogen.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The dynamic adsorption of four representative EDCs, namely estriol (E3), 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) in a microfiltration system was investigated using the Thomas’ model. The product of the equilibrium constant and the total adsorption capacity of the membrane, Ka, for E3, E2, EE2, and 4-NP were 4.91, 9.78, 15.6, and 826, respectively, strongly correlating with the compound octanol–water partition coefficient (KOW). Adsorption appeared to be enhanced when organic fouling formed on the surface of membrane, indicating the role of an additional adsorption column for EDCs acted by a fouling layer in microfiltration. Results of a comparison between the Ka values for clean membrane and fouled membrane illustrated that the significant contribution made by fouling layers may be attributed to the foulant layer's hydrophobicity (in the case of calcium humate layer) and thickness (in the case of calcium alginate layer). This study provided a novel perspective to quantitatively analyze the dynamic adsorption behavior of trace pollutants in membrane process.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Methods: Membranes were prepared from PCL and PCL-incorporated hydroxyapatite (PCL/HA). The membranes’ surface roughness, surface wettability, and mechanical properties were examined. An indirect affinity immobilization technique was used to coat the membranes with Jagged1. Membrane cytotoxicity was evaluated using LIVE/DEAD and MTT assays. The morphology of the cells on the membranes was observed using scanning electron microscopy. hPDL alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymatic activity and mineral deposition were examined using an ALP assay and Alizarin Red S staining, respectively. Notch target gene mRNA expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The PCL/HA membranes exhibited a significantly reduced surface contact angle, decreased maximum tensile strain, and ultimate tensile stress. However, the surface roughness parameters were significantly increased. The PCL and PCL/HA membranes were not cytotoxic to hPDL in vitro. hPDLs attached and spread on both membrane types. Further, indirect affinity immobilized Jagged1 on the membranes upregulated hPDL Notch target gene expression.

All the catalysts exhibited high specific surface area (∼ 1100 m2 g−1) with a closely perfect spherical shape. The presence of surface/sub-surface tungstate W5+ species, crystalline bulk WO3, and tetrahedral tungsten oxide species on the prepared catalysts was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profile analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Without in situ reduction by the reactants/products, tungstate W5+ species was found on the top surface of the as-prepared W–Si(Alt) whereas for the Si1–W2, W/SSP, and W1–Si2, the W5+ appeared only on the sub-surface of the catalysts after 5 and 15 s Ar+ etching. The abundance of surface W5+ species is suggested to facilitate the establishment of the active tungsten carbenes and was correlated well to the catalytic activity in propene metathesis. The surface W5+-activity relationship of the WO3-based metathesis catalysts is useful especially when the catalyst activity did not depend solely on the amount of active tetrahedral coordinated tungsten oxides.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Debate exists as to the most effective topical therapy in CRS. Methods: The objective was to determine if corticosteroid delivered via a nasal irrigation or via a simple nasal spray would be more effective in controlling the symptoms and signs of CRS. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial over 12 months was performed between 3 tertiary rhinologic clinics. After sinus surgery, all patients performed a nasal irrigation followed by a nasal spray once a day for 12 months. Groups were defined by corticosteroid (2 mg mometasone) delivered by either spray or irrigation. The primary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms: visual analogue score (VAS) and 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), a global rating of sinonasal function. Secondary outcomes were also recorded from radiology (Lund-Mackay score [LMS]) and endoscopic (Modified Lund-Kennedy score [mLKS]) assessments. Results: A total of 44 patients were randomized (age 50.3 ± 13.0 years; 40.9% female). Overall, patients improved significantly from either intervention. However, the corticosteroid nasal irrigation group had greater improvement in nasal blockage (−69.91 ± 29.37 vs −36.12 ± 42.94; p = 0.029), a greater improvement on LMS (−12.07 ± 4.43 vs −7.39 ± 6.94; p = 0.031) and less inflammation on mLKS at 12 months (7.33 ± 11.55 vs 21.78 ± 23.37; p = 0.018).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a type 2 PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac™ PRRS, lineage 7) against a Thai HP-PRRSV (10PL01, lineage 8). Three-week-old PRRSV-free pigs were randomly assigned into three groups. Vaccinated challenged group (group 1, n = 16) was immunized with PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine at 3 weeks old. The unvaccinated challenged group (group 2, n = 16) was injected with PBS at 3 weeks old, and unvaccinated unchallenged group (group 3, n = 10) was served as a negative control. At 9 weeks old, all groups, except the negative control group, were challenged with the Thai HP-PRRSV. All pigs were monitored daily during 10 days post-infection (dpi) and were necropsied at 10 and 17 dpi. The results revealed that vaccinated challenged pigs showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean rectal temperatures, clinical respiratory scores, lung lesion scores, and levels of virus load in serum and lung tissue compared with the unvaccinated challenged pigs. Moreover, vaccinated challenged pigs exhibited PRRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies at the end of the experiment. Our findings indicated that the studied type 2 PRRSV vaccine provided partial protection against the Thai HP-PRRSV infection based on the body temperature, levels of viremia, and the severity of lung lesions. These results demonstrated that partial protection of PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine might be useful for controlling HP-PRRSV infection in the endemic area.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; animal vaccines, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

Nineteen patients with medically-intractable TLE (10 left TLE, 9 right TLE) and 15 healthy controls were enrolled. Group analyses were conducted pre- and post-ATL of a novelty complex scene-encoding paradigm comparing areas of blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activations on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). None of the pre-operative patient characteristics we studied predicted the extent of pre- to post-operative memory loss. On fMRI, extra-temporal activations were detected pre-operatively in both LTLE and RTLE, particularly in the frontal lobe. Greater activations also were noted in the contralateral hippocampus and parahippocampus in both groups. Performing within-subject comparisons, post-op relative to pre-op, pronounced ipsilateral activations were identified in the left parahippocampal gyrus in LTLE, versus the right middle temporal gyrus in RTLE patients. Memory function was impaired pre-operatively but declined after ATL resection in both RTLE and LTLE patients. Post-operative fMRI results indicate possible functional adaptations to ATL loss, primarily occurring within the left parahippocampal gyrus versus right middle temporal gyrus in LTLE versus RTLE patients, respectively.","medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity in genes potentially linked to drug resistance in P. vivax parasites isolated from four different border regions of Thailand; Thai-Myanmar (Tak, Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces), and Thai-Cambodian borders (Chanthaburi Province). Isolates were collected from 345 P. vivax patients in 2008 and 2014, and parasite DNA extracted and subjected to nucleotide sequencing at five putative drug-resistance loci (Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1, Pvcrt-o and Pvk12). The prevalence of mutations in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were markedly different between the Thai-Myanmar and Thai-Cambodian border areas and also varied between sampling times. All isolates carried the Pvdhfr (58R and 117N/T) mutation, however, whereas the quadruple mutant allele (I57R58M61T117) was the most prevalent (69.6%) in the Thai-Myanmar border region, the double mutant allele (F57R58T61N117) was at fixation on the Thai-Cambodian border (100%). The most prevalent genotypes of Pvdhps and Pvmdr1 were the double mutant (S382G383K512G553) (65.1%) and single mutant (M958Y976F1076) (46.5%) alleles, respectively on the Thai-Myanmar border while the single Pvdhps mutant (S382G383K512A553) (52.7%) and the triple Pvmdr1 mutant (M958F976L1076) (81%) alleles were dominant on the Thai-Cambodian border. No mutations were observed in the Pvcrt-o gene in either region.

Therefore, the shaft crack detection system using Acoustic Emission (AE) was developed in this study in order to prevent machine breakdown and subsequent damages. A test rig was designed and used for an endurance test. A notched shaft under radial bending fatigue was tested until its failure. An AE sensor mounted on a sleeve was monitored in real time to detect stress waves in terms of AE signal from crack initiation. The AE signal was amplified and transmitted to a personal computer via a data acquisition card. AE signal features were extracted to indicate the crack initiation and propagation. Using AE technique proposed in this study can successfully indicate shaft cracking at the early stage before its failure.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Computational Mechanics"

Objectives: To compare pituitary height and morphology at MRI between patients with IGHD and controls. Materials and methods: This retrospective study was conducted in pediatric patients, 3 years–15 years old, who had had brain MRI with non-contrast-enhanced midsagittal T1-weighted images. These images were measured for pituitary height and morphology of the pituitary gland including shape, stalk and posterior pituitary bright spot was evaluated. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were included, with 49 and 70 patients assigned to the study and control groups, respectively. Mean pituitary height was significantly less in the IGHD group than in the control group (3.81 mm±1.38 vs. 4.92 mm±1.13, retrospectively; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference in the pituitary height between groups in the prepubertal (8–10 years) and pubertal (11–13 years) periods (P=0.039 and P=0.006, respectively) and a trend toward significance in the postpubertal period (P=0.053). There was a significant difference in pituitary shape between IGHD and controls when combining grades III, IV and V (P=0.007). Other abnormal MRI findings of the pituitary stalk and posterior bright spot were significantly more often observed in the IGHD group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Pituitary height was significantly smaller in patients with IGHD than in controls during prepuberty and puberty. Abnormal concave superior contour, hypoplastic stalk and absent/ectopic posterior bright spot were observed significantly more often among patients with IGHD.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
Who Decides: Me or We?

Research suggests that desired family involvement (FI) in medical decision making may depend on cultural values. Unfortunately, the field lacks cross-cultural studies that test this assumption. As a result, providers may be guided by incomplete information or cultural biases rather than patient preferences. Methods. Researchers developed 6 culturally relevant disease scenarios varying from low to high medical seriousness. Quota samples of approximately 290 middle-aged urban residents in Australia, China, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Thailand, and the USA completed an online survey that examined desired levels of FI and identified individual difference predictors in each country. All reliability coefficients were acceptable. Regression models met standard assumptions. Results. The strongest finding across all 7 countries was that those who desired higher self-involvement (SI) in medical decision making also wanted lower FI. On the other hand, respondents who valued relational-interdependence tended to want their families involved – a key finding in 5 of 7 countries. In addition, in 4 of 7 countries, respondents who valued social hierarchy desired higher FI. Other antecedents were less consistent. Conclusion. These results suggest that it is important for health providers to avoid East–West cultural stereotypes. There are meaningful numbers of patients in all 7 countries who want to be individually involved and those individuals tend to prefer lower FI. On the other hand, more interdependent patients are likely to want families involved in many of the countries studied. Thus, individual differences within culture appear to be important in predicting whether a patient desires FI. For this reason, avoiding culture-based assumptions about desired FI during medical decision making is central to providing more effective patient centered care.",medical,Health Policy

The development and application of a suitable, effective, non-surgical approach for animal sterilization would have an enormous advantage over the current surgical method. The main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel nanomedicine-based chemosterilant for non-surgical castration of male companion animals. In this study, we first sought to investigate the testicular toxicity of different apoptosis-inducing agents. We next synthesized and characterized nano-sized particles which encapsulated the most potent testicular toxicants and evaluated in vitro sterilant properties. Our result showed that doxorubicin exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against mouse spermatogenic cells. We therefore synthesized and characterized doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion. The negatively charged particle of doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion exhibited the anti-proliferative activity towards spermatogetic cells. Apoptosis studies revealed activation of Caspases 3 and 7 as well as annexin V expression. In addition, doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Cell death was observed following treatment of isolated and cultured rat seminiferous tubules with doxorubicin-encapsulated nanoemulsion. In conclusion, nanoemulsion can be a potential carrier for prolonged release and to enhance activity of doxorubicin that may have utility in non-surgical castration of male animals.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

While the vast majority is non-melanoma skin cancers, melanomas are mostly responsible for mortality. Solar UVB radiation is mutagenic and carcinogenic. It is primarily responsible for both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers via excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate changes in inflammation and immunity, and have been implicated in all three stages of skin cancer development. Due to their regulatory role in numerous functions of cells, signaling pathways are targets for chemoprevention. The current standards in melanoma therapy are targeted and combination therapies, which, albeit prolong survival responses, are still prone to development of drug resistance. To this extent, drugs of natural origin continue to spark great interest. Thailand has a rich biodiversity of indigenous flora, which have traditionally been used to treat a variety of pathologies. The active components in plant extracts that have medicinal properties, termed ‘bioactive compounds,’ are efficient chemopreventive agents due to their antioxidant, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and carcinogen detoxification properties. Thai plants and their bioactive compounds have shown protective effects on UV light-induced skin cancer in different experimental models. This warrants further in vivo investigations and translation to clinical studies to determine efficacy and safety, for use as lead compounds in targeted/combination therapy or adjuvant therapy with existing regimes. Coupled with a strategy for prevention, this offers a promising outlook for protection against photocarcinogenesis.","physics, Health Professions, biochemistryistry, medical","Radiation, Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

However, the full advantage of OEE as a measure to simultaneously facilitate reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and to sustain the existing profitability has not been utilized. This study aimed to investigate the use of OEE to improve the manufacturing process of corrugated paper production using two indicators including CO2 emission and profitability. The research showed a model of measuring OEE, CO2 emission and Profitability. The obtained results indicated that impact 1 and impact 2 could maintain the same profitability (9%) but OEE and CFP from impact 1 (37% and 26%, respectively) were higher than those from impact 2 (12% and 8%, respectively). The overall results revealed that when improving OEE, CO2 emission per product (1m2) could be significantly reduced while profitability could be increased in the production of corrugated paper.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

The knowledge of host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens is essential for the implementation of efficient strategies to prevent disease outbreaks. Like other invertebrates, shrimp rely on the innate immune system to defend themselves against a range of microbes by recognizing and destroying them through cellular and humoral immune responses. Detection of microbial pathogens triggers the signal transduction pathways including the NF-κB signaling, Toll and Imd pathways, resulting in the activation of genes involved in host defense responses. In this review, we update the discovery of components of the Toll and Imd pathways in shrimp and their participation in the regulation of shrimp antimicrobial peptide (AMP) synthesis. We also focus on a recent progress on the two most powerful and the best-studied shrimp humoral responses: AMPs and melanization. Shrimp AMPs are mainly cationic peptides with sequence diversity which endues them the broad range of activities against microorganisms. Melanization, regulated by the prophenoloxidase activating cascade, also plays a crucial role in killing and sequestration of invading pathogens. The progress and emerging research on mechanisms and functional characterization of components of these two indispensable humoral responses in shrimp immunity are summarized and discussed. Interestingly, the pattern recognition protein (PRP) crosstalk is evidenced between the proPO activating cascade and the AMP synthesis pathways in shrimp, which enables the innate immune system to build up efficient immune responses.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

The levels of Zn, Co, Mn, Fe, and Cr in yolks were found significantly higher than in albumen, whereas the levels of Cd and Cu contaminations in egg albumen were significantly higher than in yolks. The mean level of Pb contamination in whole eggs was 4.06 ± 2.70 mg kg−1 dry weight. This level was higher than the Thai agricultural standard no. 6703-2005 for duck eggs set at 0.1 ppm for the magnitude of 40.6 times. In addition, 98% (196/200) of duck egg samples had Pb levels higher than the standard limit. However, the calculation of daily intakes of Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination in the current study of duck eggs shows that these metals were lower than the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization provisional tolerated daily intake. These levels may, however, present a health risk resulting from a long-term exposure. It can be concluded that consumers may be at risk of Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination if they consume contaminated duck eggs. In addition, long-term monitoring of the health risks of heavy metals contamination should be conducted concerning the duck egg production system in Thailand.","medical, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical), Inorganic Chemistry"

In the presence of the DNA target, the ASD sensor showed a higher signal response when compared to the ASU sensor. The ASD sensor was then applied to simultaneously detect two high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences. The target DNA was detected in the range of 0.5–100 nM, and the limits of detection (LODs) of 150 and 153 pM (3SDblank/slope) were obtained for HPV types 16 and 18, respectively. This developed sensor was successfully applied to detect a PCR-amplified sample derived from HPV type 16 (SiHa) and 18 (HeLa) positive human cancer cell lines.

To achieve the rational design of such strains, we previously conducted an untargeted metabolomics analysis of Bacillus subtilis under 1-butanol stress and uncovered a novel type of microbial responses as the alterations in the glycerolipid and phospholipid composition. However, the current knowledge about the relevance of these changes on 1-butanol tolerance remains quite limited. Here, we constructed the B. subtilis mutants with disruption in the pssA, ugtP (U), mprF (M), yfnI, and yfnI/mprF genes in the membrane lipid biosynthetic pathways. The 1-butanol tolerance test indicated markedly increased and decreased 1-butanol resistance in M and U compared to the wild-type strain, respectively, and slight effects in other strains under high stress level. Further examination of the lipid contents of these strains in the presence of 1-butanol by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry demonstrated an elevated ratio of neutral and anionic to cationic lipids in direct relation with an improved 1-butanol tolerance. Last, cell morphological studies showed the shortening of only the U cells, compared to the wild-type. All strains including U were capable of elongating by 14–24% under 1-butanol stress. Together, the studies indicated the involvement of membrane lipid biosynthetic genes, which regulated glycerolipid and phospholipid composition, on 1-butanol tolerance and allowed for the procurement of M with enhanced 1-butanol tolerance trait, highlighting the usefulness of the overall approaches on discovery of novel biological insights and engineering of microorganisms with desired resistance characteristics.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial biotechnology; biofuels, alcohol and solvents, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Because AID is essential for immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, AID-/- mice produce only germ line IgM, while sIgM-/- mice secrete IgG but no IgM and DKO mice produce no secreted immunoglobulin. After intracerebral infection with the TE strain of SINV, most mice recovered. Development of neurologic disease occurred slightly later in sIgM-/- mice, but disease severity, weight loss, and survival were similar between the groups. AID-/- mice produced high levels of SINV-specific IgM, while sIgM-/- mice produced no IgM and high levels of IgG2a compared to WT mice. All mice cleared infectious virus from the spinal cord, but DKO mice failed to clear infectious virus from brain and had higher levels of viral RNA in the CNS late after infection. The numbers of infected cells and the amount of cell death in brain were comparable.

Among these species of Bacopa, B. monnieri is the only medicinal species, used for the treatment of cognitive impairment and improvement of cognitive abilities because of its bioactive constituents, bacoside A and B. However, because of the similar characteristics of these species, it is difficult to differentiate among related species, resulting in confusion during identification. For this reason, and to ensure therapeutic quality for consumers, authentication is important. In this study, the three abovementioned species of Bacopa were evaluated using barcoding coupled with high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) analysis based on primers designed for the trnL-F sequences of the three species. The melting profiles of the trnL-F amplicons of B. caroliniana and B. floribunda were clearly different from the melting profile of the trnL-F amplicon from B. monnieri; thus, the species could be discriminated by Bar-HRM analysis. Bar-HRM was then used to authenticate commercial products in various forms. The melting curves of the six commercial samples indicated that all the tested products contained genuine B. monnieri species.

The aim of this narrative review is to review the phenomenological similarities and dissimilarities and the shared pathways between GAD and mood disorders. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for articles published in English from 1980 to present. GAD and mood disorders, either MDD or BD, show some phenomenological overlaps and a high degree of comorbidity, especially between GAD and MDD. Both GAD and mood disorders are also frequently comorbid with other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and medical conditions, including car-dio-vascular disorder (CVD). Mood disorders have a worse prognosis when GAD is present. GAD and mood disorders are associated with female sex and may partly share genetic variants of risk. Moreover, both GAD and mood disorders frequently share similar environmental risks factors including Early Life Time Trauma (ELT) and Psychological Stressors in Adulthood (PSA). Increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation coupled to lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses are evident in GAD, MDD and type I bipolar patients. Patients with comorbid GAD and MDD show significantly higher nitro-oxidative biomarkers as compared with patients presenting with either GAD or MDD as well as patients with BD with or without co-occurring GAD. Activated immune-inflammatory processes characterized by increased levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines are other shared pathways that underpin GAD and mood disorders. Moreover, these pathways may explain comorbidities with medical disorders including CVD. Aberrations in HPA-axis, GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, NMDA and mu opioid-receptors and neuroimaging fields have yielded more inconsistent findings.

"Effect of transition metal dopants (M= Nb, La, Zr, and Y) on the M-TiO2 supported V2O5 catalysts in the selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur","Phatyenchuen S., Pongthawornsakun B., Panpranot J., Praserthdam P.",2018-10-01,"Catalyst surfaces, Degree of interaction, Elemental sulfur, Low temperatures, Selective oxidation, Selective oxidation of H2S, Transition metal dopants, Vanadium oxides, Dopants, Hydrogen sulfide, Oxygen vacancies, Selective oxidation, Vanadium oxides","P-25 TiO2 was modified by a small amount addition of different transition metal dopants (Nb, La, Zr, and Y) and employed as the supports for preparation of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the selective H2S oxidation at low temperature (130 °C). The H2S removal capability was ranged in the order: V2O5/Y-TiO2 > V2O5/Zr-TiO2 V2O5/TiO2 > V2O5/La-TiO2 > V2O5/Nb-TiO2, which corresponded well to the chemically adsorbed oxygen on oxygen vacancies at catalyst surface (or surface oxygen) as revealed by XPS results. The Y addition could promote the oxygen vacancies formation because of the Ti4+ substitution by less valence Y3+ cations, leading to the improvement of H2S conversion. Whereas the modification by dopants, which have the extra valence cations or larger ionic radius (i.e., Nb or La) suppressed the oxygen vacancies formation, thus leading to lower activity. Despite the stronger interaction between V and Zr-TiO2, the amount of surface oxygen and H2S conversion of the V2O5/Zr-TiO2 were less than the V2O5/Y-TiO2, suggesting that although the formation of oxygen vacancies depended on the interaction between V and M-TiO2, the effect of Ti4+ substitution by transition metal dopant was more pronounced than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. The H2S removal capability corresponded well to the oxygen vacancies being formed more than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. From this study, the V2O5/Y-TiO2 showed the highest H2S conversion at ∼77% with low SO2 formation (less than 10 ppm).","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

"Two regulators, PA3898 and PA2100, modulate the pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug resistance MexAB-OprM and EmrAB efflux pumps and biofilm formation","Heacock-Kang Y., Sun Z., Zarzycki-Siek J., Poonsuk K., McMillan I.A., Chuanchuen R., Hoang T.T.",2018-12-01,"Animals, Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins, Bacterial Proteins, Binding Sites, Biofilms, Drosophila melanogaster, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Male, Membrane Proteins, Membrane Transport Proteins, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Mutation, Phenazines, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas Infections, Repressor Proteins, EmrAB, MexAB-OprM, PA2100, PA3898, Phenazine, Pseudomonas aeruginosa","It is generally believed that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm matrix itself acts as a molecular sieve or sink that contributes to significant levels of drug resistance, but it is becoming more apparent that multidrug efflux pumps induced during biofilm growth significantly enhance resistance levels. We present here a novel transcriptional regulator, PA3898, which controls biofilm formation and multidrug efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa. A mutant of this regulator significantly reduced the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce biofilm in vitro and affected its in vivo fitness and pathogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and BALB/c mouse lung infection models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PA3898 modulates essential virulence genes/pathways, including multidrug efflux pumps and phenazine biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified its DNA binding sequences and confirmed that PA3898 directly interacts with promoter regions of four genes/operons, two of which are mexAB-oprM and phz2. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a regulatory partner of PA3898 as PA2100, and both are required for binding to DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. PA3898 and PA2100 were given the names MdrR1 and MdrR2, respectively, as novel repressors of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux operon and activators for another multidrug efflux pump, EmrAB. The interaction between MdrR1 and MdrR2 at the promoter regions of their regulons was further characterized via localized surface plasmon resonance and DNA footprinting. These regulators directly repress the mexAB-oprM operon, independent of its well-established MexR regulator. Mutants of mdrR1 and mdrR2 caused increased resistance to multiple antibiotics in P. aeruginosa, validating the significance of these newly discovered regulators.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The goal of this study was to investigate whether mechanical vibration combined with compressive force regulates cyclooxygenase (COX)-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells via the COX pathway. Methods: The primary cultured hPDL cells were exposed to mechanical vibration, compressive force or a combination of both mechanical vibration and compressive force at 24, 48, and 72 hours. The COX-2, IL-6, IL-8, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegrin (OPG) mRNA expressions were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 protein expressions were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To demonstrate whether the expression of PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 was in the COX-dependent pathway, the hPDL cells were treated with indomethacin. To determine whether PGE2 stimulated the hPDL cells to express IL-6 and IL-8, exogenous PGE2 was added to the culture media. Results: The combination of mechanical vibration and compressive force synergistically upregulated RANKL/OPG, COX-2/PGE2, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA, and protein expression. The indomethacin significantly attenuated the increases of PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 expression in cells stimulated with compressive force or mechanical vibration combined with compressive force. In addition, exogenous PGE2 increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein expressions in hPDL cells. Conclusion: Mechanical vibration may enhance alveolar bone resorption at the compression side during orthodontic tooth movement via a mechanism involving the cyclooxygenase pathway.",dentistry,Periodontics

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Clitoria ternatea flower extract (CTE) on postprandial plasma glycemia response and antioxidant status in healthy men. Methods: In a randomized, crossover study, 15 healthy men (ages 22.53 ± 0.30 years; with body mass index of 21.57 ± 0.54 kg/m2) consumed five beverages: (1) 50 g sucrose in 400 mL water; (2) 1 g CTE in 400 mL of water; (3) 2 g CTE in 400 mL of water; (4) 50 g sucrose and 1 g CTE in 400 mL of water; and (5) 50 g sucrose and 2 g CTE in 400 mL of water. Incremental postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, antioxidant capacities and lipid peroxidation were measured during 3 h of administration. Results: After 30 min ingestion, the postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels were suppressed when consuming sucrose plus 1 g and 2 g CTE. In addition, consumption of CTE alone did not alter plasma glucose and insulin concentration in the fasting state. The significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and protein thiol) and the decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) level were observed in the subjects who received 1 g and 2 g CTE. Furthermore, consumption of CTE protected sucrose-induced reduction in ORAC and TEAC and increase in plasma MDA. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an acute ingestion of CTE increases plasma antioxidant capacity without hypoglycemia in the fasting state. It also improves postprandial glucose, insulin and antioxidant status when consumed with sucrose. Trial registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20170609003. Registered 09 September 2017.

The definitive cure for thalassemia is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is limited due to lack of HLA-matched donors and the risk of post-transplant complications. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers prospects for autologous cell-based therapy which could avoid the immunological problems. We now report genetic correction of the beta hemoglobin (HBB) gene in iPSCs derived from a patient with a double heterozygote for hemoglobin E and β-thalassemia (HbE/β-thalassemia), the most common thalassemia syndrome in Thailand and Southeast Asia. Methods: We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the hemoglobin E mutation from one allele of the HBB gene by homology-directed repair with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide template. DNA sequences of the corrected iPSCs were validated by Sanger sequencing. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor and erythroid cells to confirm their multilineage differentiation potential and hemoglobin expression. Results: The hemoglobin E mutation of HbE/β-thalassemia iPSCs was seamlessly corrected by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells under feeder-free and OP9 coculture systems. These progenitor cells were further expanded in erythroid liquid culture system and developed into erythroid cells that expressed mature HBB gene and HBB protein. Conclusions: Our study provides a strategy to correct hemoglobin E mutation in one step and these corrected iPSCs can be differentiated into hematopoietic stem cells to be used for autologous transplantation in patients with HbE/β-thalassemia in the future.","medical, biochemistryistry","Medicine (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous), Cell Biology"

Choleraesuis is a highly invasive zoonotic pathogen that causes a serious systemic infection in humans. The emergence and increase of resistance to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin among S. Choleraesuis has become a serious therapeutic problem. The present study demonstrated high frequency of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella Choleraesuis among 414 nontyphoidal Salmonella isolates from bacteremic patients in Thailand. High rates of ceftriaxone (58.3%) and ciprofloxacin (19.6%) resistances were observed in S. Choleraesuis isolates. The dissemination of the self-transferable blaCTX-M-14-carrying IncFIIs, IncFII, and IncI1 plasmids and blaCMY-2-carrying IncA/C plasmid along with the clonal spread of blaCMY-2-harbouring S. Choleraesuis isolates contributed to the high frequency of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs; third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) during 2005–2007. We reported the first occurrence of ceftazidime-hydrolysing CTX-M-55 in S. Choleraesuis isolates which dramatically increased and became the most abundant CTX-M variant among ESC-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates during 2012–2016. The spread of clone pulsotype B3 was due to the dissemination of IncA/C plasmids carrying both blaCTX-M-55 and qnrS1 among ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Choleraesuis isolates harbouring D87G in GyrA. These isolates were apparently responsible for the high rates of co-resistance to ESCs and ciprofloxacin (51.3%) during 2012–2016. This study emphasizes the importance to have an action plan to control the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in S. Choleraesuis since this poses a threat to global health due to travel and trade in animal food products.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Fifty-five healthy medium-sized male dogs were divided into four groups: young (1 - 3 years old, n = 14), adult (>3 - 6 years old, n = 12), old (>6 - 9 years old, n = 14) and senile (>9 years old, n = 15). After routine castration, testes, epididymides (head, body and tail) and vas deferens were collected. Spermatozoa were flushed from epididymal tails and their motility, morphology and DNA integrity were examined. Localization of AR was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the positive immunostaining cells were evaluated using image analysis software (NuclearQuant, 3DHISTECH). We found significantly lower percentages of epididymal sperm motility, sperm vigour and viability in adult, old and senile dogs in comparison with young dogs (p < 0.05). Animal's age negatively correlated with epididymal sperm motility, sperm vigour and viability. The primary, secondary, major and minor epididymal sperm defects were significantly higher in senile dogs compared to young dogs. There were positive correlations between age and epididymal sperm defects (p < 0.01). The percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA did not differ between age groups. Testicular AR was expressed in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells, except for germ cells. Expression of AR was found in all epithelium, lamina propria and smooth muscle cells of the epididymis and vas deferens. Expression levels of AR in testis, epididymis and vas deferens did not differ between age groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the present study clearly demonstrated that senescence in dogs was associated with decreased epididymal sperm quality. An age-related increase in the incidence of poor epididymal sperm quality may promote subfertility, especially in senile dogs.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Utilization of LithoVue™, a disposable flexible digital ureteroscope, may address some of these concerns. To identify its economic impact on clinical care, we performed a micro-cost comparison between flexible reusable fiberoptic ureteroscopes (URF-P6™) and LithoVue. Patients and Methods: For this prospective, single-center micro-costing study, all consecutive ureteroscopies performed during 1 week each in July and August 2016 utilized either URF-P6 or LithoVue ureteroscopes respectively. Workflow data were collected, including intraoperative events, postoperative reprocessing cycle timing, consumables usage, and ureteroscope cost data. Results: Intraoperative data analysis showed mean total operating room time for URF-P6 and LithoVue cases were 93.4 ± 32.3 and 73.6 ± 17.4 minutes, respectively (p = 0.093). Mean cost of operating room usage per case was calculated at 1618.72 ± 441.39 for URF-P6 and 1348.64 ± 237.40 for LithoVue based on institutional cost rates exclusive of disposables. Postoperative data analysis revealed costs of 107.27 for labor and consumables during reprocessing for URF-P6 cases. The costs of ureteroscope repair and capital acquisition for each URF-P6 case were 957.71 and 116.02, respectively. The total ureteroscope cost per case for URF-P6 and LithoVue were 2799.72 and 2852.29, respectively. Conclusions: Micro-cost analysis revealed that the cost of LithoVue acquisition is higher per case compared to reusable fiberoptic ureteroscopes, but savings are realized in labor, consumables, and repair. When accounting for these factors, the total cost per case utilizing these two ureteroscopes were comparable.","Health Professionsth policy, Economicsomics and management, medical",Urology

Herein, we evaluate the safety of transbronchial cryobiopsy in hospitalized patients, comparing adverse events to outpatient procedures. Methods and measurements: This is a single center, retrospective chart review of all TBLC performed for suspected ILD between November 2013 and March 2017. Biopsies were performed by a board certified interventional pulmonologist or interventional pulmonology fellow using a two-scope technique. Results: One hundred fifty-nine cryobiopsies were performed for the diagnosis of ILD. Rates of adverse events are as follows: pneumothorax 11%, persistent air leak 1.3%, moderate-severe bleeding 3.8%, ICU transfer within 48 h 3.1%, and all cause 30-day mortality 1.9%. No deaths were attributed to the procedure. Comparing adverse events between hospitalized patients and outpatients, rates of pneumothorax were 24% vs 9.9%, persistent air leak 5.9% vs 0.7%, ICU transfer 12% vs 2.1%, and 30-day mortality 5.9% vs 1.4%. However, no differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: Practitioners should recognize that while cryobiopsies are a high-yield, safe, and cost-effective alternative to surgical lung biopsy, not all procedures carry the same risk profiles. Hospitalized patients may have a greater propensity for pneumothorax, persistent air leak, transfer to the ICU, and 30-day mortality.",medical,Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine

However, prioritization of the influences of these characteristics is still poorly understood. This study evaluated the variability in the flood peak with the spatial distribution of rainfall at Sukhothai (city) in the Yom River basin, Thailand, and investigated the influence of the basin characteristics on the flood peak. For each of the 2-, 5- and 10-y rainfalls with durations of 24, 48 and 72 h, 1000 simulated rainfall events with various spatial distributions were generated according to the observed data by using a Monte Carlo analysis and Cholesky randomization. The floods from these rainfalls were then simulated, and the peak discharges were evaluated. The flood peaks from 24-h rainfalls were usually small but highly variable and could be extremely large when the rainfalls were concentrated over the mountainous region. The flood peaks from 48 to 72-h rainfalls were consistently large and correlated with the rainfalls over the joint area between the mountainous region and plain area. The basin characteristics that influenced the response of the flood peak to the spatial distribution of the rainfall appeared to depend on the rainfall duration and magnitude. For short-duration rainfalls, the response was mainly influenced by the surface storage when the rainfall was small and by the terrain steepness when the rainfall was large. For long-duration rainfalls, the response was mainly influenced by the soil percolation rate.","runoff, streamflow and basins, environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all)"

Over 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), emphasizing the need for better understanding of ER and PR signaling. ER and PR are traditionally viewed as transcription factors that directly bind DNA to regulate gene networks. In addition to nuclear signaling, ER and PR mediate hormone-induced, rapid extranuclear signaling at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm which triggers downstream signaling to regulate rapid or extended cellular responses. Specialized membrane and cytoplasmic proteins may also initiate hormone-induced extranuclear signaling. Rapid extranuclear signaling converges with its nuclear counterpart to amplify ER/PR transcription and specify gene regulatory networks.

Pattern of methamphetamine use and the time lag to methamphetamine dependence,"Yimsaard P., Maes M.M., Verachai V., Kalayasiri R.",2018-01-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Alcoholism, Amphetamine-Related Disorders, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Logistic Models, Male, Methamphetamine, Sex Factors, Thailand, Time Factors, Tobacco Use Disorder, Young Adult, alcohol, cannabis, inhalants, methamphetamine, nicotine, pattern of use","Objectives: Use of methamphetamine (MA) commonly co-occurs with the use of other substances. The present study aims to examine substance initiation patterns of other substances, including alcohol, nicotine, inhalants, and cannabis (OTH), in MA users and its consequence on the time lag of MA dependence. Methods: Sociodemographic, environmental, and clinical data were obtained from MA users at a Thai substance treatment center. The Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism was employed to diagnose drug dependence. Results: Of 991 MA users, 52.6% were males, and the average age was 26.8±7.1 years. The mean age of first MA use (18 years) was greater than the mean age of first use of alcohol (17 years), nicotine (16 years), and inhalants (15 years) (P<0.001), but was comparable with the mean age at the first use of cannabis (P>0.05). Family history of MA use and nicotine dependence were associated with early MA onset. Participants who used MA as their first drug (MA>OTH) were more likely to be female and less likely to smoke intensely and to be exposed to severe traumatic events than those who used MA later than other substances (OTH>MA). The time lag from age at onset of MA use to MA dependence was shorter in OTH>MA than in MA>OTH (3 vs 5 years; χ 2 =5.7, P=0.02, log-rank test). Conclusions: A higher proportion of women was observed in MA>OTH than in OTH>MA. The use of other substances before MA increases the individual's vulnerability in shortening the interval between age at onset of MA use and MA dependence in a substance treatment cohort.",medical,"Psychiatry and Mental Health, Pharmacology (medical)"
Preparation and properties of gelatin nanofibers containing liopeptide biosurfactant by electrospinning technique as the prototype of wound covering and healing materials,"Barnthip N., Pinyakong O.",2018-09-01,"Anti-microbial properties, Bio surfactant, Biomedical applications, Covering material, Electrospinning techniques, Electrospun nanofibers, gelatin, Surface activities, electrospinning, gelatin, lipopeptide biosurfactant, nanofibers, wound healing and covering materials","Gelatin nanofibers containing lipopeptide biosurfactant which had high surface activities and antimicrobial potential were fabricated by electrospinning technique to study their potentiality for biomedical applications. Operating voltage and concentration (w/w) of lipopeptide biosurfactant in 20% (w/v) gelatin solution were considered as the experimental variables at fixed flow rate, fabricating time, and distance between the needle tip and fiber collector. The diameter trend of the electrospun nanofibers increased with the increase of the operating voltage and the biosurfactant ratio. The contact angle between the nanofiber surface and water droplet was greater when compared with that of gelatin nanofiber without the biosurfactant. The percentage of the biosurfactant would affect the porosity of the obtained nanofiber mat. The most suitable gelatin nanofiber for wound healing and covering application under this study was obtained from 25% (w/w) lipopeptide biosurfactant in gelatin solution at 6 kV operating voltage. These nanofibers also showed reasonably antimicrobial property against E. coli and S. aureus. The novelty found in this study is that the percentage of water uptake which is one of the most important factors for wound healing and covering materials of the obtained electrospun nanofibers is much better than that of the commercially one used nowadays.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

Because coke formation and carburizing cause a high temperature degradation of the alloy, the protective layers, i.e. Al2O3 and Cr2O3, are suggested to overcome such issues and prolong lifetime of the reactor. For a pack cementation, the heating rate is a process parameter in which influences on microstructure and performance of the aluminium-diffused layer. In this study, the heating rates are 5°C·min-1 and 30°C·min-1 in the high activity pack-aluminizing process at 700 to 900°C. Microstructure of the aluminized alloy consists of thin porous oxide film and homogeneous nickel-aluminide intermetallic layer. As the heating rate increases, the packing aluminium powder was found to be consumed with a shorter period of aluminizing time. This may result in the formation of porous oxide on the outermost layer which is consistent to the x-ray diffractions.","heat exchange, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) portend negative neurovascular and cognitive outcomes in the general population and are associated with cognitive impairment in persons with haemophilia (PWH). Prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH have not been directly compared to persons without coagulopathy. Aim: To examine prevalence, patterns, and risk factors for CMBs in PWH vs normal controls. Methods: Adults with haemophilia A or B and haemostatically normal controls were recruited. Subjects were excluded if taking an antithrombotic agent other than low-dose aspirin (<100 mg). All subjects underwent T2*MRI of the brain; scans were reviewed independently by two neuroradiologists blinded to subject group to determine the presence of CMBs. Results: We recruited 31 PWH and 32 controls. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were more prevalent in PWH; smoking was more common among controls. Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were similar between groups. Prevalence of CMBs was 35% in PWH and 25% in controls (P =.42). Among PWH, advanced age, history of HCV infection, and CV risk factors were associated with CMBs. Multiple and large (>5 mm) CMBs were seen only in PWH. Conclusions: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are common in adults with haemophilia, but not clearly more prevalent than in haemostatically normal controls. In PWH, older age, HCV infection, CV risk factors, and the presence of an inhibitor were associated with CMBs. Large CMBs and multiple CMBs may be more prevalent in PWH than in the general population. The clinical impact of CMBs in PWH requires further study.",medical,"Hematology, Genetics (clinical)"

Re-estimating software effort using prior phase efforts and data mining techniques,"Jodpimai P., Sophatsathit P., Lursinsap C.",2018-09-01,"Data transformation, Estimating software, Learning, Outlier Detection, Prior phase effort, Data transformation, Feature selection, Learning, Outlier detection, Prior phase effort, Re-estimating software effort","Software effort estimation has played an important role in software project management. An accurate estimation helps reduce cost overrun and the eventual project failure. Unfortunately, many existing estimation techniques rely on the total project effort which is often determined from the project life cycle. As the project moves on, the course of action deviates from what originally has planned, despite close monitoring and control. This leads to re-estimating software effort so as to improve project operating costs and budgeting. Recent research endeavors attempt to explore phase level estimation that uses known information from prior development phases to predict effort of the next phase by using different learning techniques. This study aims to investigate the influence of preprocessing in prior phases on learning techniques to re-estimate the effort of next phase. The proposed re-estimation approach preprocesses prior phase effort by means of statistical techniques to select a set of input features for learning which in turn are exploited to generate the estimation models. These models are then used to re-estimate next phase effort by using four processing steps, namely data transformation, outlier detection, feature selection, and learning. An empirical study is conducted on 440 estimation models being generated from combinations of techniques on 5 data transformation, 5 outlier detection, 5 feature selection, and 5 learning techniques. The experimental results show that suitable preprocessing is significantly useful for building proper learning techniques to boosting re-estimation accuracy. However, there is no one learning technique that can outperform other techniques over all phases. The proposed re-estimation approach yields more accurate estimation than proportion-based estimation approach. It is envisioned that the proposed re-estimation approach can facilitate researchers and project managers on re-estimating software effort so as to finish the project on time and within the allotted budget.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Software

Selected nanofiber was then used to study effect of stabilization time and stabilization temperature on fiber morphology, change in chemical structure and aromatization index (AI) using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. SEM images showed drastic morphological change of stabilized fibers compared to the as spun precursor. AI value increased as stabilization time and temperature increased and reaching maximum value of 98%. This indicated high cyclization of the aromatic ring in fiber structure.

Few studies have investigated risk factors for parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependence and death in SBS. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for PN-dependence and long-term mortality in SBS. Methods and Study Design: This retrospective study reviewed and evaluated children and adults who were diagnosed with SBS at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from October 2005 to January 2015. Age, causes of SBS, length of remnant bowel, type of anastomosis, types of nutrition support, SBS-associated complications, PN-dependence rate, duration of PN-dependence, mortality rate, and causes of death were evaluated. Results: Twenty-two adults and 19 children were reviewed. The median follow-up time was 48 months. At the end of follow-up, PNdependence rate was 51.2%. The residual colon ≥50% group had a significantly lower PN-dependence rate, with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14-0.93; p=0.03). The most frequent cause of death was infection, with the highest percentage of mortality occurring within the first 2 years after surgery. The mortality rate was 53.8% and the residual colon ≥50% group had a significantly lower mortality rate, with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.14- 0.88; p=0.03). Conclusions: PN-dependence and death occurred in about half of all patients. Residual colon ≥50% was significantly associated with lower death rate and PN-dependence. The crucial role of colon in continuity as a protective factor should be investigated further in prospective studies.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

Both designs have the same two-layer stacked configuration consisting of either a single-slot or a double-slot radiator and a metasurface superstrate. In contrast to existing phase-gradient metasurfaces with varying unit elements for beam steering, our proposed metasurface is formed by uniform square rings. At operating frequencies, each square ring acts as an individual resonating element. By exciting the elements in sequence with different phase delays through the slot radiator, the generated antenna beam can be steered. In the first design, the position of the single-slot radiator is shifted to achieve the beam steering functionality; while for the second antenna, to avoid mechanically moving the feeding slot, a double-slot-feeding structure is proposed with two slots excited with varying phase differences. Simulation and experimental results show that beam steering angles of-35° to 35° can be achieved for the single-slot-feeding design and beam steering angles of-30° to 30° are realizable for the double-slot-feeding configuration. Comparing with conventional phased array antennas, our proposed designs have compact size with moderate to high antenna gain.","computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Different parts of the plant have been traditionally used for various medicinal purposes. However, there is very little scientific evidence reporting its therapeutic benefits for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and neuroprotective properties of S. asper leaf extracts with the primary objective of enhancing therapeutic applications and facilitating activity-guided isolation of the active chemical constituents. Methods: The leaves of S. asper were extracted in ethanol and subsequently fractionated into neutral, acid and base fractions. The phytochemical constituents of each fraction were analyzed using GC-MS. The antibacterial activity was evaluated using a broth microdilution method. The antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. The neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced toxicity was tested on hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell line by evaluating the cell viability using MTT assay. The AChE inhibitory activity was screened by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) bioautographic method. Results: The partition of the S. asper ethanolic leaf extract yielded the highest mass of phytochemical constitutions in the neutral fraction and the lowest in the basic fraction. Amongst the three fractions, the acidic fraction showed the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. The antioxidant activities of three fractions were found in the order of acidic > basic > neutral, whereas the decreasing order of neuroprotective activity was neutral > basic > acidic. TLC bioautography revealed one component in the neutral fraction exhibited anti-AChE activity. While in the acid fraction, two components showed inhibitory activity against AChE. GC-MS analysis of three fractions showed the presence of major phytochemical constituents including terpenoids, steroids, phenolics, fatty acids, and lipidic plant hormone. Conclusions: Our findings have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of three fractions extracted from S. asper leaves as a promising natural source for neuroprotective agents with additional actions of antibacterials and antioxidants, along with AChE inhibitors that will benefit in the development of new natural compounds in therapies against AD.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a brief human immunodeficiency virus (B-HIV) prevention program on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors, and reinfection rate among Thai men with STIs. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted. Participants were selected from men with STI symptoms. They were randomly assigned to a B-HIV prevention program or usual care, 100 each. The program consisted of 3 modules. Key messages for HIV prevention were sent weekly through Line. Outcomes were HIV and STI knowledge, perceived benefits of condom use, risk reduction self-efficacy, risk reduction behaviors (condom use, the number of sexual partners, and condomless sex), and STI reinfection rate. Independent t-test and binary logistic regression were performed. Results: The B-HIV prevention program significantly increased HIV and STI knowledge and resulted in perception of greater benefits from condoms and greater risk reduction self-efficacy. Program participants used condoms more frequently with many types of partners, especially with casual partners and sex workers. The intervention group practiced condomless sex less frequently than the control group. The program did not improve participants’ condom use with lovers/steady partners and did not decrease the number of sexual partners and STI reinfection rate at 3-month follow-up.

The optimum condition to prepare the polymer gel is: the gamma ray dose of 40kGy, the AN:MAA ratio of 80:20, and the crosslink agent concentration of 8g/L. The polymer gel can be reused for at least 8 times without significant performance decrease. The kinetic of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 250% in about 30min. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with only 300 and 840ppb of added uranium for 4 weeks, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 6.96 and 9.64mg/g, respectively. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with 30 and 2140ppm of added uranium for 1 week, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 334 and 409mg/g, respectively. This high-efficiency amidoxime polymer gel offers a possibility of being utilized as a seawater uranium recovery agent on an industrial scale. Suitable elution conditions to minimize mass loss as well as suitable locations with clear seawater and no algae growth will need to be identified. Moreover, the research outcome presents a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ions released into seawater following a nuclear accident.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In catchments where flow data are not recorded or of poor quality, hydrological indices could be an alternative for predicting flow in ungauged catchments. This study demonstrates the methodology for predicting flow in ungauged catchments through the case study of 37 sub-catchments of the upper Ping catchment in northwest Thailand from 2006-2014. The regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between three flow indices including runoff coefficient, base flow index, and 95th percentile of flow, and catchment properties. The prediction interval of the regression relationship was used to condition rainfall-runoff model parameters. The model performance was tested by NSE∗ and reliability. The 95th percentile of flow was found to be the most informative index to regionalize flow followed by RC. The BFI had least contribution to the prediction of flow with poor NSE∗ and large uncertainty. The 95th percentile of flow and RC generally worked well for small sub-catchments.","water engineeringneering, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Blood, tissues, urine and faeces were collected after dosing to determine drug and metabolite levels using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. 3. Our study demonstrated that plasma levels of madecassoside, and to a lesser extent asiaticoside, were higher after administration of ECa 233 than the corresponding values for the pure compounds. There was a bidirectional interconversion between asiaticoside and madecassoside consistent with the increased exposure of madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233. 4. Both madecassoside and asiaticoside appeared to be widely distributed in several organs and metabolized extensively; following intravenous administration of either compound, approximately 80–90% of the dose was recovered as madecassic acid and asiatic acid in the faeces.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, environmental","Biochemistry, Toxicology, Pharmacology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Value of serum zinc in diagnosing and assessing severity of liver disease in children with wilson disease,"Sintusek P., Kyrana E., Dhawan A.",2018-01-01,"Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Hepatolenticular Degeneration, Humans, Infant, London, Male, Reproducibility of Results, Retrospective Studies, Sensitivity and Specificity, Severity of Illness Index, Zinc, ATP7B, Liver copper, Penicillamine challenge test, Zinc","Objectives: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inborn error of copper metabolism with diverse manifestations. There has been no study of zinc (Zn), the copper's antagonist, in WD diagnosis and severity so far. Our aims were to evaluate serum Zn in WD and its correlation with the disease severity score (revised WD index). Although the ATP7B mutation analysis is highly accurate for WD diagnosis, it may not be readily available in a resource-limiting setting. We proposed a disease diagnostic score (Proposed WD diagnostic score) which incorporates serum Zn. Methods: Medical records of WD and non-WD children seen at King's College Hospital from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed for the selected parameters using the Proposed WD diagnostic score. Available serum Zn data in WD children before disease diagnosis and the calculated severity score were statistically analyzed. Diagnostic values of the Proposed WD diagnostic score were evaluated. Results: Serum Zn level was significantly lower in 8 WD-acute liver failure (ALF) (5.8 [4.1-8.3] μmol/L) compared to 18 WD-non-ALF (13.5 [6.1-22.2] μmol/L) and 9 ALF from indeterminate cause (9.8 [7.0-12.1] μmol/L) (P < 0.001). Serum Zn significantly correlated with the revised WD index (r = -0.554, P = 0.004). The Proposed WD diagnostic score that included serum Zn level as 1 of the parameters had sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Serum Zn is a novel parameter for diagnosis and correlates with severity of WD. The Proposed WD diagnostic score is useful while awaiting ATP7B mutation analysis.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Gastroenterology"

The aim of the study is to focus on factors which affect adsorption process of heavy metals on geopolymer materials. The raw fly ash was mixed with sodium hydroxide solution and sodium silicate solution. After that geopolymer was cured at 80oC for 24 hr. The sample was ground and washed until pH=7. The obtained geopolymer particles were dried at 60oC. The raw materials and geopolymer were characterized. The XRD results showed a highly amorphous structure in obtained geopolymer. The major components of waste coal fly ash and synthesized geopolymer were SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and CaO. The BET surface area of fly ash and geopolymer particles were 0.83 m2/g and 85.01 m2/g, respectively. The adsorption conditions (initial concentration from 10-120 mg/L, temperature at 25-45oC, pH of cadmium ions solution from 1-5, 0.02-0.14 g. of geopolymer and contact time for 5-180 min) were studied. From removal efficiency results, synthesized geopolymer had high removal capacity for cadmium ions (Cd2+). At pH 5 of solution, the highest Cd2+ removal capacity was obtained. In addition, the removal efficiency increases with an increasing geopolymer dosage, contact time and a decreasing of Cd2+ initial concentration. Moreover, both Langmuir and Freundlich models were investigated for studying adsorption isotherm. The result showed Langmuir model is more suitable for geopolymer adsorption of cadmium ion in aqueous solution than Freundlich model.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The design pattern consisted of a non-delayed channel, a wax-delayed channel, a test zone and a control zone. This system was easily fabricated on a nitrocellulose membrane using a wax-printing method and then baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 min. The four barriers of the wax-delayed channel could delay the flow time for 11 s compared to the flow time of the non-delayed channel. To use the device under optimal conditions, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was detected at a limit of detection of 1 ng mL−1 and assessed with the naked eye within 10 min. A colorimetric intensity was also measured using a smart phone and computer software at a linear range of 0.1–100 ng mL−1 with a good correlation. Furthermore, the proposed device was successfully applied to detect AFP in human serum. Therefore, the wax-printing demonstrates a user-friendly, easy and quick method for the fabrication of the device, which could be used as a one-step, portable, disposable, low-cost, simple, instrument-free and point-of-care device for the automated ELISA.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Changes in physicochemical (L* a* b* color values, pH and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and sensory (color, odor and overall acceptability) characteristics of the packaged sausages were monitored during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Reflectance spectra covering a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm of the samples were acquired using HSI. The relationships between the quality attributes and the spectroscopic reflectance were investigated using canonical correlation analysis. Among all quality attributes, L* color value, TBA, TVC, LAB, odor and overall acceptability appeared to be highly associated with the reflectance. To facilitate the HSI for rapid image acquisition and data processing, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was employed for selection of optimal wavelengths. The selected wavelengths were then assembled into multispectral data and used as input variables to optimize the PLSR and artificial neural network models for the prediction of quality attributes of the sausage samples. The HSI technique can be used for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of the product's quality and shelf life.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

However, the non-conjugated AuNP has a higher rate of cellular uptake than the conjugated ones. Spherical AuNP in a proper size (20-30 nm) is non-toxic to mice and shows anti-inflammatory properties. We tested if the administration of AuNP, as an adjuvant to antibiotics, could attenuate bacterial sepsis in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse model with antibiotic (imipenem/cilastatin). Results: Indeed, AuNP administration at the time of CLP improved the survival, blood bacterial burdens, kidney function, liver injury and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10). AuNP also decreased M1 macrophages (CD86 + ve in F4/80 + ve cells) and increased M2 macrophages (CD206 + ve in F4/80 + ve cells) in the spleens of sepsis mice. The weak antibiotic effect of AuNP was demonstrated as the reduction of E. coli colony after 4 h incubation. In addition, AuNP altered cytokine production of bone-marrow-derived macrophages including reduced TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β but increased IL-10 at 6 and 24 h. Moreover, AuNP induced macrophage polarization toward anti-inflammatory responses (M2) as presented by increased Arg1 (Arginase 1) and PPARγ with decreased Nos2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNos) and Nur77 at 3 h after incubation in vitro. Conclusions: The adjuvant therapy of AuNP, with a proper antibiotic, attenuated CLP-induced bacterial sepsis in mice, at least in part, through the antibiotic effect and the induction of macrophage function toward the anti-inflammatory responses.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"
Why should neuroscientists worry about iron?

It is a major driver of cell death in neurodegenerative neurological diseases. Moreover, cascades underpinning ferroptosis could be active drivers of neuropathology in major psychiatric disorders. Oxidative and nitrosative stress can adversely affect mechanisms and proteins governing cellular iron homeostasis, such as the iron regulatory protein/iron response element system, and can ultimately be a source of abnormally high levels of iron and a source of lethal levels of lipid membrane peroxidation. Furthermore, neuroinflammation leads to the upregulation of divalent metal transporter1 on the surface of astrocytes, microglia and neurones, making them highly sensitive to iron overload in the presence of high levels of non-transferrin-bound iron, thereby affording such levels a dominant role in respect of the induction of iron-mediated neuropathology. Mechanisms governing systemic and cellular iron homeostasis, and the related roles of ferritin and mitochondria are detailed, as are mechanisms explaining the negative regulation of ferroptosis by glutathione, glutathione peroxidase 4, the cysteine/glutamate antiporter system, heat shock protein 27 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. The potential role of DJ-1 inactivation in the precipitation of ferroptosis and the assessment of lipid peroxidation are described. Finally, a rational approach to therapy is considered, with a discussion on the roles of coenzyme Q10, iron chelation therapy, in the form of deferiprone, deferoxamine (desferrioxamine) and deferasirox, and N-acetylcysteine.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; other degenergyative diseases, neuroscience",Behavioral Neuroscience

However, silicate-based glass fibers have low alkali resistance especially in cement matrix composite. In this work, we studied the improvement of alkali resistance by addition of zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4) in original basalt glass composition. The batch of basalt glass with additional ZrSiO4 contents of 0.00, 2.50, 5.00, 7.50 and 10.00 wt% were melted at 1500 °C. The liquidus temperature (TL) is important in for the fiber glass manufacturing. It need to formulate glass composition which requires a lower melting temperature and is crystallization resistant. TL as a function of composition is usually determined experimentally. In this study, glassy phase was determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tc) and TL were analyzed by Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA). The results found that the addition of ZrSiO4 in a basalt glass batch increased Tg while Tc of each sample was closed to original basalt fiber. Moreover, the alkali resistance of these glasses increased with an increasing of ZrSiO4 content. However, excessive ZrSiO4 contents (7.50 and 10.00 wt%) resulted in crystallization of ZrO2 which separated from glassy phase.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: The 24-h urinary metabolic profile was studied for 28 calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis patients (NL) and 46 of their descendants (ND), as well as 40 non-stone-forming volunteers (V) and 34 of their descendants (VD). Results: There was no difference between age, gender, and serum creatinine between NL vs. V (parental groups) and ND vs. VD (descendant groups). High urinary oxalate in nephrolithiasis and urinary calcium in their descendants was detected. In addition, an elevated urinary excretion rate of calcium, phosphate, protein, and albumin, along with low citrate excretion and high urinary supersaturation was observed in both the nephrolithiasis patients and their descendants. Approximate 17.8–24.4% of the nephrolithiasis descendants had a urinary supersaturation higher than the nephrolithiasis level, but none was found in VD group. The level of urinary supersaturation index was correlated with urinary protein and albumin excretion in nephrolithiasis family.

The hypothalamus hosts many key neuropeptide systems that have been postulated to play a role in this pathophysiology. Such neuropeptides include but are not exclusive too orexins, oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein, which will be the focus of this review. Each of these peptides has its own unique physiological role and as such many preclinical studies have been conducted targeting these peptide systems with evidence supporting their role in migraine pathophysiology. Preclinical studies have also begun to explore potential therapeutic compounds targeting these systems with some success in all cases. Clinical efficacy of dual orexin receptor antagonists and intranasal oxytocin have been tested; however, both have yet to demonstrate clinical effect. Despite this, there were limitations in these cases and strong arguments can be made for the further development of intranasal oxytocin for migraine prophylaxis. Regarding neuropeptide Y, work has yet to begun in a clinical setting, and clinical trials for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating protein are just beginning to be established with much optimism. Regardless, it is becoming increasingly clear the prominent role that the hypothalamus and its peptide systems have in migraine pathophysiology.

The optimum drug loading was 2.5% by weight corresponded to lipid fraction in formulation. Increasing of the drug entrapment was achieved by blending small amount of phospholipid in solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) dispersions. All AmB lipid dispersions were less aggregated species and hemolytic response than Fungizone® indicating that lipid nanoparticles could reduce its toxicity. The sustained release profiles of AmB formulations depended on its aggregated form and entrapment efficiency. Too high AmB loaded (5% w/w) showed a biphasic drug release profile probably due to some amounts of drug deposited on the nanosphere surface including in continuous phase which promptly released. For in vitro antifungal testing, all AmB lipid formulations were equal and more effective than both AmB itself and Fungizone®. These observations suggested that AmB loaded SLNs, nanostructured lipid carriers and modified SLNs by blending lecithin could enhance AmB solubility, prolong release characteristics, reduce toxicity and improve antifungal activity.","pharmacology, chemistry","Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

A biological-like memory allocation scheme using simulation,"Lergchinnaboot G., Sophatsathit P.",2018-02-07,"FIFO queue, First-in first-out queues, Global clocks, Low overhead, Memory management, Power consumed, Simulation, Technological transfer, Biological-like architecture, FIFO queue, Memory allocation, Simulation","This research proposes a novel memory allocation scheme to efficiently handle memory management. The scheme employs biological behavioral principles of the life forms. At the principal construct lives the cells having limited resources, yet passively operates with little overhead. The proposed scheme imitates this unicellular characterization to execute one task at a time using First-In-First-Out queue. Execution is regulated by a global clock that permits one active task at any given time in memory. Consequently, low overhead memory allocation can be achieved without the need for elaborate scheduling and other supporting algorithms. The most anticipatory benefit is simplicity that permits straightforward technological transfer of the proposed scheme to hardware. The contributions are to systematically mitigate the memory wall and reduce power consumed by memory management activities.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Signal Processing, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems"

Most of the tools apply Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) to visualize the activities and their dependencies among various project activities but these tools do not provide semantic representation. Thus, it still requires an implicit knowledge of project managers to analyze and manage scheduling tasks. Ontology could be used to represent the structure of a domain by means of defining concepts and properties that relate them. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for building PDM ontology using OWL and construct SWRL reasoning to infer new knowledge from existing one.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Control and Optimization, Information Systems and Management"

Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of KMT2D (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. Here, we report seven unrelated Thai patients with Kabuki syndrome having congenital absence of teeth, malocclusion, high-arched palate, micrognathia, and deviated tooth shape and size. Exome sequencing successfully identified that six patients were heterozygous for mutations in KMT2D, and one in KDM6A. Six were novel mutations, of which five were in KMT2D and one in KDM6A. They were truncating mutations including four frameshift deletions and two nonsense mutations. The predicted non-functional KMT2D and KDM6A proteins are expected to cause disease by haploinsufficiency. Our study expands oro-dental, medical, and mutational spectra associated with Kabuki syndrome. We also demonstrate for the first time that KMT2D and KDM6A are expressed in the dental epithelium of human tooth germs.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics; gene mutations, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Developmental Biology, Cell Biology"

The unit-cell and crystal-structure parameters relative to temperature in theses carbonates were determined. All the carbonates in this study display obvious anisotropic thermal expansion: the values of the thermal expansion coefficients along the c-axis (a0(c)) are much larger than those along the a-axis (a0(a)). The a cell parameter of otavite increases slightly from 123 to 223 K and subsequently contracts at higher temperature. Negative thermal expansion along the a-axis is also observed in calcite. In contrast to those of magnesite and smithsonite, the O1–O2 bond distances of otavite and calcite do not expand with increasing temperature, which may explain their negative thermal expansion along the a-axis. Moreover, the values of a0(V) and a0(a) for the calcite-structure carbonates (MgCO3, ZnCO3, MnCO3, CdCO3, and CaCO3) are shown to exhibit an inverse correlation with the cation radius. However, no obvious relationship is noted between the a0(c) values and the size of the cations. Structural mechanisms for the systematic thermal behaviour of the five carbonates are also discussed.","fluidex; related topics, experimental mineralogy, earth sciences",Geochemistry and Petrology

Objective: To explore Thai nephrology nurses’ perceptions about discussing sexual health issues with patients receiving dialysis. Material and Methods: A phenomenological approach was applied and data were collected using semi-structured individual interviews. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 participants from four Southern regional hospitals in Thailand between April and June 2016. Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method. Findings: Participants were aged between 27 and 53 years: mean 42.95 (±7.62 SD). Nineteen were female and sixteen were married. Five themes emerged: (1) improving knowledge in order to enhance confidence before discussing sexuality with patients; (2) gaining patients’ trust before discussing sexuality; (3) finding an appropriate time to discuss sexuality; (4) organising a suitable setting in which to discuss sexuality and (5) feelings of appreciation for helping patients and their partners overcome their sexual health issues. Conclusion: These findings provide an understanding of Thai nurses’ perceptions about the challenges in communicating with patients experiencing ESKD regarding sexual health problems and concerns. The findings suggest that sexual health education and training would enhance the confidence of Thai nephrology nurses in initiating sexuality-related discussions with their patients.","medical, Nursing","Nephrology, Advanced and Specialized Nursing"

The functional roles of the conserved histidine at position 461 in the active site of AM from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgAM) was investigated. H461 A/S/D/R/W were constructed, their catalytic properties were compared to the wild-type (WT). A significant decrease in transglucosylation activities was observed, especially in H461A mutant, while hydrolysis activity was barely affected. The transglucosylation factor of the H461A-CgAM was decreased by 8.6 folds. WT preferred maltotriose (G3) as substrate for disproportionation reaction, but all H461 mutants showed higher preference for maltose (G2). Using G3 substrate, kcat/Km values of H461 mutated CgAMs were 40–64 folds lower, while the Km values were twice higher than those of WT. All mutants could not produce large-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD) product. The heat capacity profile indicated that WT had higher thermal stability than H461A. The X-ray structure of WT showed two H-bonds between H461 and heptasaccharide analog at subsite +1, while no such bonding was observed from the model structure of H461A. The importance of H461 on substrate binding with CgAM was evidenced.

The Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Depression and Bipolar Disorder,"Maes M., Carvalho A.F.",2018-12-01,"Animals, Biomarkers, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Humans, Immune System, Inflammation, Receptors, Immunologic, Bipolar disorder, Cytokines, Inflammation, Major depression, Neuroimmune, Oxidative and nitrosative stress","Here, we review a novel concept namely the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS) as applied to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). There is evidence that a substantial subset of individuals with MDD and BD exhibit an activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), as indicated by an increased production of macrophagic M1 and T helper (Th)-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling, positive acute phase proteins (APPs), and complement factors. These immune aberrations appear to be evident during the course of major affective episodes of either depressive or (hypo) manic polarity. Here, we review (a) the current state of the art of CIRS functions in both mood disorders and (b) the possible role of CIRS-related biomarkers for the understanding of affective disorders within the framework of precision psychiatry that could also provide novel drug targets for both MDD and BD. CIRS-related abnormalities in mood disorders include elevated Th-2 and T regulatory (Treg) activities with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, classical IL-6 signaling, increased levels of sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor–α- receptors, and positive APPs, including haptoglobin, hemopexin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. It is concluded that CIRS is involved in MDD and BD by regulating the primary immune-inflammatory response, thereby contributing to spontaneous and antidepressant-promoted recovery from the acute phase of illness. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are observed in the remitted phases of both disorders indicating that there is no return to the original homeostasis after an acute episode, while later episodes of mood disorders are characterized by sensitized IRS and CIRS responses. New z-unit weighted composite biomarker scores are proposed, which reflect different aspects of IRS versus CIRS activation and may be used to estimate different IRS/CIRS activity ratios in mood and other neuroimmune disorders.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Mice deficient in Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcγRIIB) exhibit spontaneous SLE and its restoration rescues the disease. To determine whether deleting FcγRIIB affects cortical bone mass and mechanical properties, we analyzed cortical bone phenotype of FcγRIIB knockouts at different ages. FACS analysis revealed that 6-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice had increased B220lowCD138+ cells, markers of plasma cells, indicating active SLE disease. In contrast, 3-month-old FcγRIIB−/− mice did not develop the active SLE disease. µCT analysis indicated that FcγRIIB deletion did not affect cortical bone in 3-month-old mutants. However, 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females had osteopenic cortical bone and the severity of bone loss increased with disease duration. FcγRIIB deletion decreased cross-sectional area, cortical area, and marrow area in 6-month-old males. Cortical area and cortical thickness were decreased in 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males. Lack of FcγRIIB decreased cortical thickness without affecting cortical area in females. However, deletion of a single FcγRIIB allele was insufficient to induce cortical bone loss. The bending strength was decreased in 6- and 10-month-old FcγRIIB-deficient males compared to WT controls. A microindentation analysis demonstrated significantly decreased hardness in both 10-month-old FcγRIIB−/− males and females. Our data indicate that FcγRIIB contributes to the regulation of cortical bone homeostasis subsequent to SLE development and that deletion of FcγRIIB in mice leads to SLE-like disease associated with cortical bone loss and decreased bending strength and hardness.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Endocrinology"

Bidirectional amplifiers are the key component to extend coverage area as well as increase a number of users in Passive Optical Networks (PON). According to 10-Gigabit-capable PON or XG-PON standard, the downstream and upstream wavelengths are 1577 nm and 1270 nm respectively. Thus, our bidirectional amplifier consists of an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) and a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) for downstream and upstream wavelength transmissions respectively. The operating wavelengths of EDFA and SOA are measured to be from 1570 nm to 1588 nm and 1263 nm to 1280 nm respectively. To measure gain, the input wavelengths of EDFA and SOA were fixed at 1577 nm and 1271 nm respectively, while their input powers were reduced by a variable optical attenuator. The small signal gain of EDFA is 22.5 dB at 0.15 Ampere pump current, whereas the small signal gain of SOA is 7.06 dB at 0.325 Ampere pump current. To measure PDL, which is a difference in output powers at various State of Polarization (SoP) of input signal, a polarization controller was inserted before amplifier to alter input SoP. The measured PDL of EDFA is insignificant with less than 0.1 dB. In contrast, the measured PDL of SOA is as large as 33 dB, indicating its strong polarization dependence. The total power consumptions were measured to be 1.5675 Watt.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, computer science, Mathematics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Unfortunately, in limited-resource countries, chemo-radiotherapy is the only option of curative-intent treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low-dose whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as a consolidation on disease control and long-term neurocognitive functions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center study enrolling PCNSL patients from 2011 to May 2016 to evaluate the real-life treatment outcome and neurotoxicity from treatment especially radiotherapy. Results: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed immunocompetent PCNSL patients were treated with a high-dose methotrexate-based regimen with or without WBRT. The median age was 56 (range 16–78) years old. After chemotherapy, the overall response and complete response (CR) rates were 59.5% and 43.2%, respectively. All 6 partial response (PR) patients and 6 of 16 CR patients underwent radiotherapy. In 22 patients who achieved CR, the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients without WBRT was significantly inferior to the WBRT group with the hazard ratio of 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.14–19.82, p = 0.03). The 3-year PFS were 35% and 78.75%, respectively, but there was no difference in overall survival. The serial Montreal Cognitive Assessment evaluations (20–72 months post chemotherapy) of 10 long-term CR patients revealed one dementia among three patients without WBRT and five mild cognitive impairments in seven patients with WBRT. Except for the dementia case, all the other patients can perform daily activities without assistance. Conclusion: The low-dose WBRT consolidation is associated with lower PCNSL relapses with only mild neurocognitive toxicity.",medical,Hematology
Downstream components of the calmodulin signaling pathway in the rice salt stress response revealed by transcriptome profiling and target identification,"Yuenyong W., Chinpongpanich A., Comai L., Chadchawan S., Buaboocha T.",2018-12-05,"Calmodulin, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Oryza, Plants, Genetically Modified, Salt Stress, Salt Tolerance, Signal Transduction, Calmodulin, CaM, Rice, Salt stress, Transcriptome","Background: Calmodulin (CaM) is an important calcium sensor protein that transduces Ca2+ signals in plant stress signaling pathways. A previous study has revealed that transgenic rice over-expressing the calmodulin gene OsCam1-1 (LOC_Os03g20370) is more tolerant to salt stress than wild type. To elucidate the role of OsCam1-1 in the salt stress response mechanism, downstream components of the OsCam1-1-mediated response were identified and investigated by transcriptome profiling and target identification. Results: Transcriptome profiling of transgenic 'Khao Dawk Mali 105' rice over-expressing OsCam1-1 and wild type rice showed that overexpression of OsCam1-1 widely affected the expression of genes involved in several cellular processes under salt stress, including signaling, hormone-mediated regulation, transcription, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glyoxylate cycle. Under salt stress, the photosynthesis rate in the transgenic rice was slightly lower than in wild type, while sucrose and starch contents were higher, suggesting that energy and carbon metabolism were affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression. Additionally, four known and six novel CaM-interacting proteins were identified by cDNA expression library screening with the recombinant OsCaM1. GO terms enriched in their associated proteins that matched those of the differentially expressed genes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression revealed various downstream cellular processes that could potentially be regulated by OsCaM1 through their actions. Conclusions: The diverse cellular processes affected by OsCam1-1 overexpression and possessed by the identified CaM1-interacting proteins corroborate the notion that CaM signal transduction pathways compose a complex network of downstream components involved in several cellular processes. These findings suggest that under salt stress, CaM activity elevates metabolic enzymes involved in central energy pathways, which promote or at least maintain the production of energy under the limitation of photosynthesis.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science

In addition, radiographic and CT images were compared to determine the more suitable method of limb deformity assessment. Methods: Sixty hindlimbs of Chihuahuas were divided into normal and grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 MPL groups. The pelvic limb angles in frontal and sagittal planes were evaluated on radiography and CT scan. Femoral and tibial torsion angles (FTA and TTA) were evaluated only by CTscan. All angles were compared among normal and MPL stifles and between radiography and CT scan. Results: Based on the CT scan, the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), anatomical caudal proximal femoral angle (aCdPFA), and TTA were related to the severity of MPL. The mLDFA and TTA were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in grade 4 MPL, while the aCdPFA was significantly decreased in grade 2, 3 and 4 MPL groups. There were significant differences of many angles between radiography and CT scan. Clinical Significance: The angles related to MPL in Chihuahuas are aLDFA, mLDFA, aCdPFA and TTA. Radiography had some limitations for evaluating pelvic limb angles. The caudocranial radiograph is recommended for the assessment of the distal femoral angles, while the craniocaudal radiograph is for the tibial angles.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Animal Science and Zoology, Veterinary (all)"

However, it remains unclear whether the sleep quality is related with AF. Aim: To evaluate the associations of sleep duration, insomnia and frequent awakening with AF. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases from inception through September 2017 to identify studies that evaluate the risk of AF in adults with short sleep duration, long sleep duration, insomnia and/or frequent awakening. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Ten observational studies (14 296 314 patients) were enrolled. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of AF in individuals with short sleep (<6 h) and long sleep (>8 h) were 1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.55, I2 = 66%) and 1.24 (95% CI 0.96–1.62, I2 = 58%), respectively. There was no association between increase in sleep duration and AF, with a pooled OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.84–1.12, I2 = 0%). However, there were significant associations of AF with insomnia and frequent awakening, with pooled ORs of 1.30 (95% CI 1.26–1.35, I2 = 3%) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.13–1.63, I2 = 55%), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest an absence in association between AF and sleep duration but reveal the potential association between AF and both insomnia and frequent nocturnal awakening. As such, the further studies on association of AF and sleep qualities are warranted.","genergyal, medical",Internal Medicine

This study assessed the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obese pregnant females with GDM and OSA. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted (April 2014-June 2016). Obese females at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and with diet-controlled GDM were screened for OSA. Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks nightly CPAP or be part of a waitlist control group. After 2 weeks, all patients were offered CPAP. The primary outcome was glucose metabolism, obtained from an oral meal tolerance test (MTT) at baseline and 2 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were collected. Results: Eighteen patients were randomized to CPAP and 18 to control groups. There were no significant changes between groups in fasting glucose, glucose response to MTT, and insulin sensitivity or secretion after 2 weeks. Those adherent to CPAP had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .016) compared to the control group. When a counterfactual instrumental variable approach was applied to deal with nonadherence, the CPAP group had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .002) and insulin sensitivity (P = .015). Lower rates of preterm delivery (P = .002), unplanned cesarean section (P = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (P < .001) were observed among those who used CPAP longer than 2 weeks. Conclusions: Two weeks of CPAP in females with GDM and OSA did not result in improved glucose levels, but insulin secretion improved in those adherent to CPAP. Continued CPAP use was possibly associated with improved pregnancy outcomes.","medical, neuroscience","Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Further, the physical properties of the mixing solutions such as viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension and solubility with water were observed when the percent weights of the extractant increased. The principle of intermolecular attraction between the molecules in the mixing solutions was considered in order to explain the tendencies of results. Tie-line data were determined for ascertaining the solubility of extractant in the organic and aqueous phases. A thermodynamic NRTL model was also evaluated and its data compared with the experimental results. Consequently, good correlations were displayed by the root-mean square deviation (rmsd) at values about 2%. Finally, for understanding the solvation of solute and solvent, the molecular interaction behaviors of the molecules in the mixing solutions were examined by spectroscopic analyses.","Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Methods Fifty-six human permanent maxillary incisors were selected. Ten teeth received no treatment (intact teeth group). The root canals of 46 teeth were prepared to an internal diameter of 1.75 mm. Six teeth were used as simulated immature teeth group. The remaining teeth received MTA apexification and were divided into 4 groups: MTA, fiber post, composite resin, and gutta-percha groups. The root canals of each group were filled with each test material. All teeth were thermocycled and received cyclic loading before compression testing by an Instron universal testing machine. The load to fracture was recorded. Data were subjected to statistical analysis by using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey multiple comparison test. Results All teeth fractured at the cervical area of the root. The mean load to fracture of the intact tooth, MTA, fiber post, composite resin, gutta-percha, and the simulated immature tooth groups was 1988 N, 1921 N, 1691 N, 1623 N, 1476 N, and 962 N, respectively. Statistically, load to fracture of the simulated immature tooth group was significantly lower than in the intact tooth, MTA, fiber post, and composite resin groups but was not significantly different from the gutta-percha group. Conclusions Within the limit of this study, after MTA apexification, intraradicular reinforcement with MTA, fiber post, or composite resin increased the fracture resistance of simulated immature teeth.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Recently, deep learning techniques has shown many success results in various fields, especially, in text categorization. In our previous work called Shared Hidden Layer Neural Network (SHL-NN), it has shown that sharing information between levels can improve a performance of the model. However, this work is based on a sequence of unsupervised word embedding vectors, so the performance should be limited. In this paper, we propose a supervised document embedding specifically designed for hierarchical text categorization based on Autoencoder, which is trained from both words and labels. To enhance the embedding vectors, the document embedding strategies are invented to utilize the class hierarchy information in the training process. To transfer the prediction result from the parent classes, the shared information technique has been improved to be more flexible and efficient. The experiment was conducted on three standard benchmarks: WIPO-C, WIPO-D and Wiki comparing to two baselines: SHL-NN and a top-down based SVM framework with TF-IDF inputs called 'HR-SVM.' The results show that the proposed model outperforms all baselines in terms of F1 macro.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"

Performance of traditional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance method (CSMA/CA) on IEEE 802.11p is unable to satisfy for platooning needs due to unbounded delay especially under high channel load. Several researches about platooning are involved with medium access control (MAC) layer modification in a protocol stack and/or does not support variable number of vehicles and/or have a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose to use a vehicular desynchronization TDMA-based protocol over off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11p, while supporting vehicles joining and leaving a platoon and having no single point of failure. We recommend a range of parameters that are suitable for the platooning application.

On the basis of the data derived from our measurements, the underground temperature seemed to be consistent and lower than the average outside air temperature, over two years. The underground system consisted mainly of two 50-m-long drilling wells and pipes with a total length of 170 m. The well performance was not examined, but both soil and groundwater aquifer (Bangkok aquifer) at 25 to 50 m. could be utilized for the cooling operation. Moreover, the major controlling factors of electricity consumption were found to be the outside air temperatures and the underground water circulation temperatures. In addition, we considered the geology, underground temperature, and aquifer of Bangkok concluding that almost all Bangkok areas are suitable for GHP installation, except for those where the subsurface temperature is too high compared with the outside air temperature.","water engineeringneering, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The effects of the reaction temperature and time, amount of dichlorocarbene precursor, and the type and amount of phase transfer agent on the chlorine content were investigated. The highest chlorine content (30%) in DCBR was obtained using 0.062 mol chloroform and 0.003 mol cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at room temperature for 19 hours although 27.9% was obtained after 12 hours. The kinetics of this dichlorocarbene modification was best described by the pseudo–first order rate law with 2 rate constants. For practical applications, the DCBR with chlorine contents of 10%, 20%, or 30% were blended with natural rubber (NR) and then vulcanized using the sulfur-curing system. Although the polarity of DCBR was increased, a good compatibility between NR and DCBR still existed, resulting in improved mechanical properties. The oil resistance, flame retardant, and ozone resistance properties of the NR/DCBR blend vulcanizates were enhanced compared to those of a NR/butadiene rubber blend vulcanizate, which was related to the amount of chlorine incorporated into the DCBR.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics
Interrogation of ethnomedicinal plants for synthetic lethality effects in combination with deficiency in the DNA repair endonuclease RAD1 using a yeast cell-based assay,"Aung H.M., Huangteerakul C., Panvongsa W., Jensen A.N., Chairoungdua A., Sukrong S., Jensen L.T.",2018-09-15,"Bacopa, Caco-2 Cells, Cell Proliferation, Colubrina, DNA Repair Enzymes, Endonucleases, Humans, Medicine, Traditional, Plant Extracts, Plants, Medicinal, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Chemical genetics, Colorectal cancer, Ethnomedicinal plants, Synthetic lethality, Yeast","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plant materials used in this study were selected based on the ethnobotanical literature. Plants have either been utilized by Thai practitioners as alternative treatments for cancer or identified to exhibit anti-cancer properties. Aim of the study: To screen ethnomedicinal plants using a yeast cell-based assay for synthetic lethal interactions with cells deleted for RAD1, the yeast homologue of human ERCC4 (XPF) Materials and methods: Ethanolic extracts from thirty-two species of medicinal plants utilized in Thai traditional medicine were screened for synthetic lethal/sick interactions using a yeast cell-based assay. Cell growth was compared between the parental strain and rad1∆ yeast following exposure to select for specific toxicity of plant extracts. Candidate extracts were further examined for the mode of action using genetic and biochemical approaches. Results: Screening a library of ethanolic extracts from medicinal plants identified Bacopa monnieri and Colubrina asiatica as having synthetic lethal effects in the rad1∆ cells but not the parental strain. Synthetic lethal effects for B. monneiri extracts were more apparent and this plant was examined further. Genetic analysis indicates that pro-oxidant activities and defective excision repair pathways do not significantly contribute to enhanced sensitivity to B. monneiri extracts. Exposure to B. monneiri extracts resulted in nuclear fragmentation and elevated levels of ethidium bromide staining in rad1∆ yeast suggesting promotion of an apoptosis-like event. Growth inhibition also observed in the human Caco-2 cell line suggesting the effects of B. monnieri extracts on both yeast and human cells may be similar. Conclusions: B. monneiri extracts may have utility in treatment of colorectal cancers that exhibit deficiency in ERCC4 (XPF).",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"
Relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 levels in high-traffic area determined using path analysis and linear regression,"Sahanavin N., Prueksasit T., Tantrakarnapa K.",2018-07-01,"Covered roadside area, Open roadside area, Path analysis, PM10, PM2.5, Air Pollutants, Air Pollution, Environmental Monitoring, Linear Models, Particulate Matter, Regression Analysis, Covered roadside area, Open roadside area, Path analysis, PM10, PM2.5","The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between PM10 and PM2.5 levels as related to meteorological conditions and traffic flow using both a linear regression analysis and a path analysis. The Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected from Sukhumvit road, Bangkok, Thailand, at both open (104 samples) and covered (92 samples) areas along the road. Fifteen percent of all samples were separated before the statistical models were run and used for model validation. The results from the path analysis were more elaborate than those from the linear regression, thus indicating that meteorological conditions had a direct effect on the particulate levels and that the effects of traffic flow were more variable in open areas. The model also indicated that meteorological conditions had an indirect effect and that traffic flow had a direct effect on particulate levels in covered areas. The model validation results indicated that for open areas, the R2 values were not very different between the path analysis and the linear regression model, but that the path analysis was more accurate than the linear regression model at very low PM concentrations. At high PM concentrations, the path analysis model also had a better fit than did the linear regression, so the predictions from the path analysis model were more accurate than those from the linear regression.","aerosols, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

The neuroprotective approach is a promising strategy to slow disease progression in Parkinson's disease. A standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa233 has been previously reported to have pharmacological effects in the central nervous system. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of ECa233 in rotenone-induced parkinsonism rats. Methods: Rats were orally given either vehicle or ECa233 (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) for 20 consecutive days. Rotenone (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) was given to parkinsonism (PD) and ECa-treated rats from day 15 to 20. Locomotor activity was recorded on day 1, 14, 17 and 20. Tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunohistological staining was used to determine dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase protein expression were measured in brain tissue. Results: Rats receiving ECa233 30 mg/kg showed a significant increase in distances (p < 0.01) together with a higher number and intensity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum (p < 0.001) compared to PD rats. ECa233 (30 mg/kg) protected against mitochondrial complex I inhibition, decreased MDA levels (p < 0.05) and increased SOD (p < 0.01) and catalase (p < 0.05) expression. Conclusion: ECa233 can protect against rotenone-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal death. These effects are mediated through the protection of mitochondrial complex I activity, the effects of antioxidants and the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme expression.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

METHODS BALAD score and BALAD-2 class are derived from bilirubin, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP). Pre-transplant AFP, AFP-L3 and DCP were measured in 113 patients transplanted for HCC from 2000 to 2008. Hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence and death were calculated. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. C-statistics were used to compare biomarker-based to predictive models. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 38 patients recurred and 87 died. The HRs for recurrence in patients with elevated AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP defined by BALAD cut-off values were 2.42 (1.18-5.00), 1.86 (0.98-3.52), and 2.83 (1.42-5.61), respectively. For BALAD, the HRs for recurrence and death per unit increased score were 1.48 (1.15-1.91) and 1.59 (1.28-1.97). For BALAD-2, the HRs for recurrence and death per unit increased class were 1.45 (1.06-1.98) and 1.38 (1.09-1.76). For recurrence prediction, the combination of three biomarkers had the highest c-statistic of 0.66 vs. 0.64, 0.61, 0.53, and 0.53 for BALAD, BALAD-2, Milan, and UCSF, respectively. Similarly, for death prediction, the combination of three biomarkers had the highest c-statistic of 0.66 vs 0.65, 0.61, 0.52, and 0.50 for BALAD, BALAD-2, Milan, and UCSF. A new model combining biomarkers with tumor size at the time of transplant (S-LAD) demonstrated the highest predictive capability with c-statistics of 0.71 and 0.69 for recurrence and death. CONCLUSION BALAD and BALAD-2 are valid in transplant HCC patients, but less predictive than the three biomarkers in combination or the three biomarkers in combination with maximal tumor diameter (S-LAD).",medical,Gastroenterology

Visible light irradiation of the porphyrin-covered TiO2 NTs under cathodic polarization up to −0.3 V vs. Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) photocatalytically produces H2O2 in pH neutral electrolyte, at room temperature and without need of sacrificial electron donors. The formation of H2O2 upon irradiation is proven and quantified by direct colorimetric detection using 4-nitrophenyl boronic acid (p-NPBA) as a reactant. This simple approach for the attachment of a small molecular catalyst to TiO2 NTs may ultimately allow for the preparation of a low-cost H2O2 evolving cathode for efficient photoelectrochemical energy storage under ambient conditions.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Here, the full-length cDNA of transforming growth factor beta regulator 1-like (PmTbrg1-l) in the giant tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was determined. It was 1184 bp in length and contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 975 bp corresponding to a deduced polypeptide of 324 amino acids. Successful RNA interference (RNAi) carried out using juveniles injected with PmTbrg1-l dsRNA revealed reduced levels of PmTbrg1-l and myostatin (PmMstm) in hemocytes when compared to shrimp injected with saline solution and GFP dsRNA (P <.05). Associations between single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) patterns or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns and growth-related parameters (average body weight and total length) were examined. Juveniles with pattern III (corresponding to A/A918; N = 37) showed a trend for greater average body weight and total length than those with patterns II (G/G918; N = 42) and IV (A/G918; N = 75). The expression level of PmTbrg1-l in the hepatopancreas of females was significantly higher than that in males (P <.05) in two sample sets of three-month-old domesticated juveniles (N = 59 and 50; P <.05). Moreover, its expression level in large-size juveniles was significantly higher than that in medium-size and small-size juveniles in both groups of samples (P <.05). Results indicated that PmTbrg1-l is functionally related with growth of P. monodon.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Physiology, Molecular Biology"

Because the existing SOEC models are complicated, the aim of this study is to develop a user-friendly SOEC model in a flowsheet simulator (Aspen Plus). The developed model is used to perform a parametric analysis to investigate the effects of key process parameters, i.e., operating temperature, current density, steam concentration, sweep gas type and number of cells, on the SOEC performance. The simulation results show that the voltage and the overall overpotential decrease as the cell temperature increases, whereas the opposite trends are observed when the current density increases. From the energy and exergy analyses, the total energy demand slightly increases with cell temperature, whereas the electrical energy demand decreases. Based on an operating temperature of 1273 K when the SOEC uses oxygen as the sweep gas, the highest energy and exergetic efficiencies of 78.45% and 92.20% are achieved at a current density of 2500 A m−2 and at a steam concentration of 90% in a 500-cell stack.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

As a result of continuing advances in computer capability and artificial intelligence, distinguishing between human and computer becomes more difficult. With this reason, some spammers can break CAPTCHA and attack the system with an appropriate algorithm. To improve more reliability, biometric authentication can be used to enhance the system security by verifying the identity of a person based on physiological or behavioral characteristics. One of the promising methods for biometric authentication is the identification through unique eye movement characteristics. This paper proposes a new CAPTCHA based on eye movement characteristics, namely, EYE-CAPTCHA. The proposed method employs gaze detection and eye movement control. With this proposed system, the system can achieve more reliability for differentiating human and machine.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Signal Processing"

The material was used in the adsorption of silver ions, AgNPs and simultaneous adsorption of these silver species was also observed. The adsorption of silver ions occurred rapidly and followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model. The adsorption equilibrium of silver ions could be described with a Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 114.9 mg g−1. In the mixture of AgNPs and silver ions, the adsorption of AgNPs followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model and took place more slowly compared to silver ions due to their larger size. The MP-Silica exhibited a maximum adsorption capacity of 91.9 mg AgNPs g−1 in the mixture. The adsorption of silver species on MP-Silica occurred through chemisorption via the coordination of these species with thiol groups on the surface. The removal of silver species from wastewater samples and consumer products by MP-Silica was demonstrated.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

energies, Design specification, Gaseous detectors, Muon detector systems, Muon spectrometer, Performance parameters, Proton proton collisions, Reconstruction software, Muon spectrometers, Particle tracking detectors (Gaseous detectors)","The CMS muon detector system, muon reconstruction software, and high-level trigger underwent significant changes in 2013-2014 in preparation for running at higher LHC collision energy and instantaneous luminosity. The performance of the modified system is studied using proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energy s=13 TeV, collected at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The measured performance parameters, including spatial resolution, efficiency, and timing, are found to meet all design specifications and are well reproduced by simulation.

Long-term renal outcome in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation,"Rianthavorn P., Chacranon M.",2018-06-01,"Adolescent, Child, Female, Glomerulonephritis, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents, Kidney, Male, Retrospective Studies, Thailand, Children, Glomerulonephritis, Kidney failure, Outcome","Background: Information on long-term renal outcome of pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation is limited. A single center retrospective study was conducted to assess long-term renal survival and to determine whether the 2010 classification for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis can predict renal outcome in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation. Methods: Biopsy and clinical data of children, aged ≤ 18 years with ≥ 10 glomeruli and ≥ 10% crescentic glomeruli during January 1998 to December 2015, were reviewed. Biopsies were classified according to the 2010 classification into focal, crescentic, mixed, and sclerotic classes. The clinical endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Results: Of 72 children, 14 patients (19.4%) had positive ANCA. The biopsy indication was rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in 38 patients (52.8%) and 22 patients (30.6%) required dialysis at onset. Lupus nephritis was the most common diagnosis (43.1%), followed by IgA nephropathy/Henoch–Schoenlein purpura (HSP) (22.2%). ESRD occurred in 18 patients (25%) and the risk of ESRD differed among the histological classifications (p < 0.001). Dialysis at onset and sclerotic class was independent predictors of ESRD in an adjusted model. The risk of ESRD was four-fold higher in patients requiring dialysis at onset and 7.7-fold higher in sclerotic patients than in crescentic patients. Conclusions: The probability of ESRD was substantial in pediatric glomerulonephritis associated with crescent formation. The 2010 classification is useful for establishing long-term renal prognosis. Future research is required to validate whether histological classification could be a determinant in therapeutic guideline modification, since long-term renal prognosis is different in each class.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Nephrology, Physiology (medical)"

However, the major impediments that spike our accomplishment are the lack of universal biomarkers and cellular heterogeneity. To cope with these restrictions, we have tried to apply the concept of single cell analysis, which has hitherto been recommended throughout the world as an imperative solution pack for resolving such dilemmas. Accordingly, our first step was to utilize a predesigned spiral microchannel fabricated by our laboratory to perform size-based single cell separation using mast cell tumor (MCT) cells as a model. However, the impact of hydrodynamic shear stresses (HSS) on mechanical cell injury and viability in a spiral microchannel has not been fully investigated so far. Intuitively, our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has strongly revealed the formations of fluid shear stress (FSS) and extensional fluid stress (EFS) in the sorting system. The panel of biomedical assays has also disclosed cell degeneration and necrosis in the model. Therefore, we have herein reported the combinatorically detrimental effect of FSS and EFS on the viability of MCT cells after sorting in our spiral microchannel, with discussion on the possibly pathogenic mechanisms of HSS-induced cell injury in the study model.",engineering,"Control and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Its absorption capacities for various kinds of oil and non-polar liquids were 25–55 times higher than its dry weight and exhibited excellent selectivity for absorbing of oil which spilled on the surface of water or underwater with high separation efficiency. This superhydrophobic nanocellulose sponge can be easily recovered by simple squeezing and reused at least 10 cycles with remained high separation efficiency.

The plasticity of the toddler gut microbiota indicates that nutritional modulation beyond infancy could potentially impact its maturation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of consuming Young Child Formula (YCF) supplemented with short chain galactooligosaccharides and long chain fructooligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS, ratio 9:1) and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V on the development of the faecal microbiota in healthy toddlers. A cohort of 129 Thai children aged 1-3 years were included in a randomised controlled clinical study. The children were assigned to receive either YCF with 0.95 g/100 ml of scGOS/lcFOS and 1.8×10 7 cfu/g of B. breve M-16V (Active-YCF) or Control-YCF for 12 weeks. The composition and metabolic activity of the faecal microbiota, and the level of secretory immunoglobulin A were determined in the stool samples. The consumption of Active-YCF increased the proportion of Bifidobacterium (mean 27.3% at baseline to 33.3%, at week 12, P=0.012) with a difference in change from baseline at week 12 between the Active and Control of 7.48% (P=0.030). The consumption of Active-YCF was accompanied with a more acidic intestinal milieu compared to the Control-YCF. The pH value decreased statistically significantly in the Active-YCF group from a median of 7.05 at baseline to 6.79 at week 12 (P < 0.001). The consumption of Active-YCF was associated with a softer pudding-like stool consistency compared to the Control-YCF. At week 6 and week 12, the betweengroup difference in stool consistency was statistically significant (P=0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). A Young Child Formula supplemented with scGOS/lcFOS and B. breve M-16V positively influences the development of the faecal microbiota in healthy toddlers by supporting higher levels of Bifidobacterium.

Both cigarette smoking and HIV have been identified as independent risk factors for COPD. We used data from the strategic timing of antiretroviral treatment (START) Pulmonary Substudy to quantify the impact of smoking on rate of lung function decline in HIV.Methods:We included START Pulmonary Substudy participants who contributed at least 2 good quality spirometry measures during the study. Slope of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was estimated using a repeated-measures model adjusted for the treatment group (immediate vs deferred treatment arm of START), age, sex, race, baseline COPD, and region.Results:Of 1026 START Pulmonary Substudy participants, 915 (89%) were included in this analysis. Median follow-up time was 3.9 years. Smokers and nonsmokers were similar in baseline age (median 36 years), but smokers were more likely to be white, male, and from Europe/Israel/Australia. Smokers had faster average FEV1 decline compared with nonsmokers [-38.3 mL/yr vs -25.1 mL/yr; difference of -13.2 mL/yr (95% confidence interval: -23.6 to -2.7); P = 0.013], were more likely to meet criteria for rapid FEV1 decline [7.2%-11.7% more likely (P = 0.09-P = 0.002), depending on the definition of rapid decline], and had borderline, but not statistically significant, higher incident COPD during follow-up (9.7% vs 5.8%, P = 0.06).Conclusions:Compared to nonsmokers, HIV-positive smokers experience faster decline in lung function. These results underscore the need for a better understanding of how to best support smoking cessation among HIV-positive populations.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; sociologyal and behavioural aspects, medical","Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

This contribution presents our continuation study investigating into the molecular origins of this behavior. Infrared spectroscopy is utilized to investigate interfacial interactions of the systems while the conformation of PDA conjugated backbone is probed by Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction explores molecular packing within the nanocomposites. We have found that the increase of photopolymerization time induces the relaxation of PDA backbone into a newly observed state indicated by systematic growth of new vibrational modes of C[tbnd]C and C[dbnd]C bonds. This relaxation process results in the decrease of reversible blue-to-purple color-transition temperature. In contrast, the increase of backbone length with photopolymerization time causes an opposite trend of the irreversible purple-to-red color transition observed at relatively high temperature region. Differential scanning calorimetry detects two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the melting of alkyl side chains and rigid backbone. These melting temperatures vary with photopolymerization time consistent with the variation of color-transition temperature.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The bacterial consortium degraded a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture consisting of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene (50 mg L−1 each) by approximately 73%, 69%, 52%, and 48%, respectively, within 21 days. This consortium exhibited excellent adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions. It could degrade a mixture of four PAHs under a range of pH values (4.0–9.0), temperatures (25 °C–37 °C), and salinities (0–10 g L−1 with NaCl). In addition, this consortium degraded 20–30% of benzo[a]pyrene and perylene (10 mg L−1 each), high molecular weight PAHs, in the presence of other PAHs within 35 days, and degraded 40% of 2% (v/v) crude oil within 20 days. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that Pseudomonas and Methylophaga were the dominant genera of consortium SWO in almost all treatments, while Pseudidiomarina, Thalassospira and Alcanivorax were predominant under higher salt concentrations. Moreover, Pseudomonas and Alcanivorax were dominant in the crude oil-degradation treatment. Our results suggest that the consortium SWO maintained its biodegradation ability by altering the bacterial community profile upon encountering changes in the environmental conditions.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; water pollution; control, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The aim of this research was to preliminarily study the cytotoxicity of extracts of their roots, and the parts that possessed cytotoxic activity were separated on a chromatograph to identify their active compounds. Methods The extracts of both plants were screened for cytotoxicity on the SW620 cell line and the compounds isolated from the active extracts were further evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against five human cancer cell lines, including SW620, ChaGo-K-1, HepG2, KATO-III and BT-474 using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results Dichloromethane extracts of C. indicum and C. villosum were active against the SW620 cell line. Triterpenoids were mostly obtained from the extracts of these plants (0.28% and 1.02%, respectively) and exhibited varying degrees of cytotoxicity and specificity against the tested cell lines. Two triterpenoids, oleanolic acid 3-acetate and betulinic acid, displayed moderate to strong cytotoxicity toward all cancer cell lines, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.66–20.49 µmol/L, whereas 3β-hydroxy-D:B-friedo-olean-5-ene and taraxerol were cytotoxic to only the SW620 cell line (IC50 = 23.39 and 2.09 µmol/L, respectively). Triterpenoid, lupeol, showed potent cytotoxicity on both SW620 (IC50 = 1.99 µmol/L) and KATO-III cell lines (IC50 = 1.95 µmol/L), while a flavonoid, pectolinarigenin, displayed moderate cytotoxicity against these cells (IC50 = 13.05 and 24.31 µmol/L, respectively). Although the widely distributed steroid, stigmasterol, was effective against the SW620 cell line (IC50 = 2.79 µmol/L) and β-sitosterol was also active against SW620 (IC50 = 11.26 µmol/L), BT-474 (IC50 = 14.11 µmol/L) and HepG2 cancer cells (IC50 = 20.47 µmol/L), none of the characteristic 24β-ethylsteroids of either Clerodendrum species were shown to be cytotoxic. Conclusion This study is the first report on the presence of cytotoxic triterpenoids from the roots of these medicinal plants, which have been used in herbal formulas as an antipyretic.

Hence, retrieval the actual information covered by clouds is frequently necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel method to remove clouds by taking an advantage of HSI color space instead of directly removing clouds in RGB color space. The proposed method uses a concept of dark channel prior method to estimate the cloud appearance called the scattering light and perform a subtraction in only the intensity channel to avoid an effect to the original color and also enhance the intensity with gamma correction to recover some information accidentally removed from the previous step and restore obscure details distorted by clouds. Furthermore, since clouds involve in both intensity and saturation channel, we increase the saturation that was reduced as a result from clouds by using logarithm image transformation as well. From the results, the proposed method can remove clouds that are not extremely opaque and preserve the actual information such as color and texture due to the higher contrast gain in the experiments comparing to the results obtained from other single-image methods.","light and optics, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Signal Processing, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

The crystalline morphology and orientation during the blown film process of the low-density polyethylene film were investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Increasing the blow-up ratio increased the transverse direction molecular orientation and decreased the machine direction orientation. The resulting low-density polyethylene morphology was a regular lamellar stacking parallel to the machine direction. The film morphology strongly influenced the mechanical properties. Increasing the blow-up ratio from 1.7 to 2.8 decreased the machine direction tensile strength by 14% and increased the transverse direction tensile strength up to 27% for both the low-density polyethylene/1-butene and low-density polyethylene/1-octene co-monomers, while the machine direction tear strength increased up to 36% and the transverse direction decreased by 16%. Moreover, the first and second heating characteristics from differential scanning calorimeter showed the inherent crystallinity change with increasing blow-up ratio for both the low-density polyethylene/1-octene and the low-density polyethylene/1-butene copolymer.

Here, we report a delivery system using the combination of a magnetic field and the relatively biocompatible composite particles of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and SPIONs (SPION-PLGA particles) for protein delivery to bone-marrow derived primary dendritic cells (BM-DCs). SPIONs with the diameter of ∼10 nm were synthesized via thermal decomposition of iron(III) oleate. The SPIONs and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were encapsulated in PLGA particles of two different diameters, 300 and 500 nm. The obtained SPIONs-PLGA nanocomposites exhibited superparamagnetic character, showed low cytotoxicity and were well taken up in macrophage and BM-DCs under an external magnetic field. In addition, the nanocomposites were tested for immune induction in BM-DCs. This combined SPION-PLGA carrier and an external magnetic field can significantly enhance BM-DC maturation by upregulating MHC II, CD80 and CD86 expression. Immune response induction by this strategy is verified through a significant upregulation of the IL-12 and IFN-γ production. Moreover, no activation of BM-DCs to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was observed for all particles. We anticipate these findings to be a starting point for vaccine researches involving the combined magnetic field and SPION-PLGA composite particles.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Depression severity was assessed using the PHQ-9 questionnaire (patient assessed) and CGI-S scale (physician assessed); cognitive function was assessed with the PDQ-D questionnaire; work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) was assessed with the WPAI questionnaire. Results: At baseline, 89.9% of patients were moderately to severely depressed (PHQ-9 score ≥10). During the 3 month treatment period, mean ± SD PHQ-9 score decreased from 18.7 ± 5.7 to 5.0 ± 5.3, mean ± SD CGI-S score decreased from 4.4 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 1.1 and mean ± SD PDQ-D score decreased from 42.1 ± 18.8 to 13.4 ± 13.0. By Month 3, response and remission rates reached 80.8% and 59.0%, respectively. Work productivity loss decreased from 73.6% to 30.5%, while activity impairment decreased from 71.5% to 24.6%. Positive correlations were observed between PHQ-9, PDQ-D, and WPAI work productivity loss and activity impairment. By Month 3, 82.0% of patients were either not depressed or only mildly depressed (PHQ-9 score ≤9). Conclusion: In real-world clinical settings, vortioxetine was effective in reducing depression severity and improving cognitive function and work productivity in SEA patients with major depression.",medical,Medicine (all)

In the study reported here, the lingual biology of this rodent is described in detail, based on characteristic features of the tongue and lingual papillae as determined by light and scanning electron microscopy studies. The tongue was found to be elongated with a rounded apex and possessed a median groove and a well-developed intermolar prominence. Three types of the papillae were found on the dorsal lingual surface: filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. The most abundant papillae were the filiform papillae, the majority of which had a wide base and fork-like processes. Rounded fungiform papillae with one to four taste buds were randomly distributed among the filiform papillae, with a high density found at the anterior tongue, particularly the apex. Two oval vallate papillae were observed on the posterior part of the tongue, surrounded by a circumferential groove into which their numerous gustatory pores opened. The lingual radix had no papillae but contained mucus-secreting Weber’s salivary glands. Structural adaptations of the tongue to meet the functional demands of food ingestion and food manipulation in the oral cavity are also discussed.",medical,Anatomy
Towards a new classification of stable phase schizophrenia into major and simple neuro-cognitive psychosis: Results of unsupervised machine learning analysis,"Kanchanatawan B., Sriswasdi S., Thika S., Stoyanov D., Sirivichayakul S., Carvalho A.F., Geffard M., Maes M.",2018-08-01,"Adult, Behavioral Symptoms, Cognitive Reserve, Cytokines, Female, Humans, Inflammation, Male, Middle Aged, Neurocognitive Disorders, Neuroimmunomodulation, Patient Acuity, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychotic Disorders, Quality of Life, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, Tryptophan, Unsupervised Machine Learning, chronic fatigue, cytokines, depression, inflammation, neuroimmune, schizophrenia, tryptophan","Rationale: Deficit schizophrenia, as defined by the Schedule for Deficit Syndrome, may represent a distinct diagnostic class defined by neurocognitive impairments coupled with changes in IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Adequate classifications should be based on supervised and unsupervised learning rather than on consensus criteria. Methods: This study used machine learning as means to provide a more accurate classification of patients with stable phase schizophrenia. Results: We found that using negative symptoms as discriminatory variables, schizophrenia patients may be divided into two distinct classes modelled by (A) impairments in IgA/IgM responses to noxious and generally more protective tryptophan catabolites, (B) impairments in episodic and semantic memory, paired associative learning and false memory creation, and (C) psychotic, excitation, hostility, mannerism, negative, and affective symptoms. The first cluster shows increased negative, psychotic, excitation, hostility, mannerism, depression and anxiety symptoms, and more neuroimmune and cognitive disorders and is therefore called “major neurocognitive psychosis” (MNP). The second cluster, called “simple neurocognitive psychosis” (SNP) is discriminated from normal controls by the same features although the impairments are less well developed than in MNP. The latter is additionally externally validated by lowered quality of life, body mass (reflecting a leptosome body type), and education (reflecting lower cognitive reserve). Conclusions: Previous distinctions including “type 1” (positive)/“type 2” (negative) and DSM-IV-TR (eg, paranoid) schizophrenia could not be validated using machine learning techniques. Previous names of the illness, including schizophrenia, are not very adequate because they do not describe the features of the illness, namely, interrelated neuroimmune, cognitive, and clinical features. Stable-phase schizophrenia consists of 2 relevant qualitatively distinct categories or nosological entities with SNP being a less well-developed phenotype, while MNP is the full blown phenotype or core illness. Major neurocognitive psychosis and SNP should be added to the DSM-5 and incorporated into the Research Domain Criteria project.",medical,"Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Self-management requires patients to have adequate health literacy, defined as the individual's ability to seek, understand, and utilize health information. Recently, the neck painspecific health behavior for office workers (NHBOW) questionnaire was developed based upon a conceptual framework of health literacy. The content in the NHBOW relates to the work and exercise behaviors of office workers. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of the NHBOW. Methods: At baseline, 342 healthy participants filled out a series of questionnaires, including the NHBOW. The incidence of neck pain was prospectively recorded every month over a 12- month period. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were calculated. Results: There were 103 (30.7%) incidents of non-specific neck pain among 335 office workers during the 12-month period, and seven participants were lost to follow-up. For the NHBOW, a cut-off score of less than or equal to 8 points (lower scores indicate poorer health behavior) had a sensitivity of 57.3% and a specificity of 96.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 88.1% and 83.6%, respectively. The AUC was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.706 to 0.832). Conclusion: The NHBOW was an acceptable screening tool for predicting nonspecific neck pain in office workers during the 1-year follow-up period, and can be used in occupational and primary care settings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The AMP and DETA concentrations were varied (1–2.5 kmol/m3 and 0.5–2 kmol/m3, respectively) while the total amine concentration was constant at 3 kmol/m3. The absorption experiment was conducted at 15 %v/v CO2 and 313 K while the desorption temperature was at 363 K. Experimental results revealed that the absorption rates, cyclic capacities and desorption rates of some AMP–DETA blends were higher than those of 5 kmol/m3 MEA. The absorption heat of the blends is comparable to that of MEA while the heat duty of some AMP–DETA blends are much lower than that of 5 kmol/m3 MEA. The optimal amine blend was confirmed to be 2 kmol/m3 AMP – 1 kmol/m3 DETA. A model similar to the power law kinetic model showed that CO2 composition in the feed gas affected the initial absorption rates as compared to AMP/DETA molar concentration ratio. The model predicted the initial absorption rate with a %AAD of 0.52%. These results provide good prospects for AMP–DETA blends towards CO2 capture.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

In Tris-HCl aqueous buffer solution, the derivative containing glycine exhibits selective fluorescence enhancement with Zn2+. The fluorescence turn-on signal at a longer wavelength is a result of the binding between N-8-aminoquinolinylglycinamide and Zn2+ which is promoted by the deprotonation of the amide proton. However, both Zn2+ and Cd2+ induce the turn-on signal in ethanol solution. X-ray crystallography of single crystals of both Zn2+ and Cd2+ complexes formed in ethanol reveals 1-D coordination polymer structures in which the metal ions are tethered with N and O of the amide groups. Simultaneous detection of Zn2+ and Cd2+ are possible by using paper chromatographic separation and the ligand as a visualizing agent. The fluorescence imaging of either Zn2+ or Cd2+ in plant tissue is demonstrated. The conjugation of the ligand with dimethylaminophenylacetylene effectively tunes the emission color of the ligand while retaining the sensing selectivity. Therefore, N-8-aminoquinolinylglycinamide is a simple yet effective binding probe for Zn2+ and Cd2+ with excellent fluorescence signal transduction.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, physics","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Chemistry (all), Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics"

Under an optimized growth condition by RF-magnetron sputtering technique, the AlSb films were grown at a sputtering power of 250 W and a pressure of 0.01 mbar in argon atmosphere and a precursor Al:Sb ratio of about 88:12. The undoped AlSb films were found to have a cubic crystal structure with (111) preferred orientation and a lattice constant of 5.9985 Å under compressive strain. For the doped AlSb samples with optimized doping contents, the AlSb:Si and AlSb:Cu films with higher compressive strain were found to have a smaller lattice constant of 5.9588 Å and 5.9667 Å respectively. Raman spectroscopy indicated strain states and lower crystalline quality induced by doping. The optical properties, analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry, showed that the undoped AlSb film was transparent to IR at around 850 nm, where the doped films were transparent to IR at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the electrical properties of the AlSb films, n-type AlSb:Cu and p-type AlSb:Si films were characterized by Hall-Effect measurements. To develop AlSb-based optoelectronic devices, a PIN diode structure was grown on Si substrate. The smooth interfaces between the AlSb layers and with Si substrate were confirmed by cross-sectional TEM micrographs. Finally, I-V measurements showed diode characteristics with a turn-on voltage of about + 1.5 V for forward bias and −0.5 V for reverse bias. In summary, the AlSb-based diode structure on Si substrate had been successfully fabricated by optimized sputtering deposition. This is promising for future development of the AlSb-based optoelectronic devices.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The excess glucose can be transformed to methylglyoxal (MG), a potential precursor of glycation. Glycation is a spontaneous non-enzymatic reaction that initially yields advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which ultimately triggers several severe complications. Therefore, the inhibition of AGEs formation is the imperative approach for alleviating diabetic complications. The aim of this research was to investigate the glycation and α-glucosidase inhibitory abilities of compounds isolated from fingerroot. The dichloromethane extract afforded three flavanones, two chalcones, two dihydrochalcones, and one kavalactone. Most of the isolated compounds showed higher inhibition effect against AGEs formation than aminoguanidine (AG). Subsequent evaluation in MG-trapping assay indicated that their trapping potency was relatively comparable to AG. Their structure-activity relationships (SAR) of MG-trapping activity were investigated using the comparison of the structures of flavonoids. In addition, pinocembrin displayed moderate α-glucosidase inhibition against both maltase and sucrose, with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.021 and 0.39 ± 0.020 mM, respectively.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

METHODS This study focused on children with chronic liver diseases who received primary hepatitis B immunization and had a complete dataset of anti-HBs before and after liver transplantation between May 2001 and June 2017. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for potential factors relating to HBV immunity loss. RESULTS In total, 50 children were recruited. The mean time from liver transplantation to anti-HBs testing was 2.53 ± 2.11 years. The mean anti-HBs levels before and after liver transplantation were 584.41 ± 415.45 and 58.56 ± 6.40 IU/L, respectively. The rate of nonimmunity (anti-HBs < 10 IU/L) in the participants was 46% (n = 26) at one year, 57% (n = 7) at two years and 82% (n = 17) at > three years following liver transplantation. The potential factors relating to HBV immunity loss after liver transplantation were identified as anti-HBs (P = 0.002), serum albumin (P = 0.04), total bilirubin (P = 0.001) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.003) before liver transplantation. A five-year-old boy with biliary cirrhosis received 4 doses of HBV vaccine with an anti-HBs titer of > 1000 IU/L and underwent liver transplantation; his anti-HBc-negative father was the donor. After liver transplantation, the boy had stenosis of the hepatic artery up to the inferior vena cava anastomosis and underwent venoplasty three times. He also received subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin for 5 mo and 20 transfusions of blood components. Three years and ten months after the liver transplantation, transaminitis was detected with positive tests for HBsAg, HBeAg, and anti-HBc (2169.61, 1706 and 8.45, respectively; cutoff value: < 1.00) and an HBV viral load of 33212320 IU/mL. CONCLUSION The present study showed that loss of hepatitis B immunity after liver transplantation is unexpectedly common. In our case report, despite high levels of anti- HBs prior to transplantation, infection occurred at a time when, unfortunately, the child had lost immunity to hepatitis B after liver transplantation.",medical,Gastroenterology

The sensor comprised of two CRP-specific antibodies: an unlabeled capture primary antibody (Anti-1°Ab) and an electrochemically detectable anthraquinone-labeled signaling secondary (AQ-2°Ab) antibody. The Anti-1°Ab was first covalently anchored onto an L-cysteine/gold-modified disposable SPGE (L-Cys/Au/SPGE) to create the anti-CRP surface. After binding of the CRP and the AQ-2°Ab, the electrochemical signal response was measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the presence of CRP, the sensor exhibited a significant increase in the AQ current at AQ-2°Ab compared to the negative control. The CRP concentration was detected in the range of 0.01–150 µg/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (10 SD/Slope) were 1.5 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively. This sensor exhibited very high sensitivity in determining CRP and was successfully applied to detect CRP in certified human serum with satisfactory results. The developed sensor is suitable as an alternative method for determination of CRP and the same principle may be further applied to determine other clinically important target molecules.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

The existing simplified effective length method could predict good results corresponding to test outcomes on TLCDs and LCVAs with small transition zones, but is found to yield larger discrepancy as larger transition zones are needed, often due to limited space constraints. The numerical panel method could be effectively employed to give more accurate results, but is not simple to formulate and needs to be re-modified for each new configuration. This paper proposes a new quasi-elliptic flow path estimation method to simulate control characteristics of TLCDs and LCVAs with relatively large transition boundary between the vertical columns and the horizontal cross-over duct, since liquid velocity's variation inside the large transition boundary cannot be assumed to occur at a single point. The simulation results are compared with experimental investigations conducted on a shake table, yielding satisfactorily better outcomes for large transition zones, as well as for small transition zones. This new formulation has been verified with a few other studies and has been found to be an excellent viable option with a respectable better, or at least comparable, accuracy level.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

The symphysis height and width were measured. The symphysis ratio was the ratio of symphysis height to symphysis width. Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationships between the variables at a 0.05 significance level.Results: The mandibular anterior teeth lingual and apical ABT positively correlated with symphysis width (p <0.05). Moreover, these thicknesses negatively correlated with the symphysis ratio (p <0.05). Symphysis widths and ratios showed higher correlation coefficients with total and buccal apical ABT, compared with lingual ABT. Buccal ABT at 3 and 6 mm apical to the CEJ was not significantly correlated with most symphysis dimensions. The mean thickness of the buccal alveolar bone at the upper root half was only 0.2-0.6 mm, which was very thin, when compared with other regions. Conclusion: For mandibular anterior teeth, the apical alveolar bone and lingual alveolar bone tended to be thicker in patients with a wide and short symphysis, compared to those with a narrow and long symphysis. Buccal alveolar bone was, in general, very thin and did not show a significant relationship with most symphysis dimensions.",dentistry,"Orthodontics, Oral Surgery"
A bibenzyl from Dendrobium ellipsophyllum induces apoptosis in human lung cancer cells,"Hlosrichok A., Sumkhemthong S., Sritularak B., Chanvorachote P., Chaotham C.",2018-06-01,"Apoptosis, Bibenzyls, Dendrobium, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Apoptosis, Bibenzyl, Dendrobium ellipsophyllum, Lung cancer, p53, Selective anticancer","Failure of current chemotherapeutic drugs leads to the recurrence of tumor pathology and mortality in lung cancer patients. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity and related mechanisms of 4,5,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxybibenzyl (TDB), a bibenzyl extracted from Dendrobium ellipsophyllum Tang and Wang, in human lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of TDB (0–300 µM) in different types of human lung cancer cells (H460, H292 and H23) and human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) was evaluated via MTT viability assay. Selective anticancer activity of TDB against human lung cancer cells was demonstrated with a high IC50 (approximately > 300 µM) in DPCs, while IC50 in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells was approximately 100 ± 5.18, 100 ± 8.73 and 188.89 ± 8.30 µM, respectively. After treatment with 50 µM of TDB for 24 h, flow cytometry analysis revealed the significant increase of early and late apoptosis with absence of necrosis cell death in human lung cancer cells. The up-regulation of p53, a tumor-suppressor protein, was elucidated in human lung cancer cells treated with 10–50 µM of TDB. Alteration to down-stream signaling of p53 including activation of pro-apoptosis protein (Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bax), reduction of anti-apoptosis (B cell lymphoma 2; Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1; Mcl-1) and suppression on protein kinase B (Akt) survival pathway were notified in TDB-treated lung cancer cells. The information obtained from this study strengthens the potential development of TDB as an anticancer compound with a favorable human safety profile and high efficacy.",biochemistryistry,Molecular Medicine

Each letter has distinctive visual features, making it perceivably different. No empirical work has yet examined which letters included in text-based CAPTCHA would have high correct response rates from users. The current study hopes to fill this gap. A user test on 6,389 iterations of the lowercase letters used in 1,844 CAPTCHA tests confirmed (1) users' correct response rates to the letters with the short feature had higher correct response rates than those without this feature, and (2) neither the ascending nor the descending feature had impact on the correct response rate. In addition to the theoretical insight into the use of letter perception literature in text-based CAPTCHA design, the findings do have implications for security practitioners.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization"

An unusual manifestation of calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome in kidney transplantation: A case report and literature review,"Udomkarnjananun S., Townamchai N., Virojanawat M., Avihingsanon Y., Praditpornsilpa K.",2018-04-14,"Anti-Infective Agents, Local, Back Pain, Calcineurin Inhibitors, Clotrimazole, Drug Interactions, Female, Humans, Kidney Transplantation, Tacrolimus, Young Adult, Back pain, Calcineurin, Kidney transplantation","Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are the mainstay immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation. Although they provide excellent allograft and patient outcomes, adverse effects are frequently encountered. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome (CIPS) is a rare adverse effect of CNI. Previous case reports with CIPS diagnosis involved incapacitating pain in the lower extremities. Case Report: In this article, we report the first case of CIPS with severe back pain as the presenting symptom, which was correlated with a high tacrolimus trough concentration due to a drug interaction with clotrimazole troche. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed bone marrow edema, which is consistent with previous case reports. The patient’s symptoms resolved within 3 weeks of the onset of pain. Treatments were symptomatic care and lowering the tacrolimus trough concentration. Pain was improved significantly with pregabalin but not with nifedipine. Conclusions: We reviewed the literature of kidney transplant cohorts with CIPS to ascertain prevalence, pain characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Apart from our case, all patients experienced lower extremities pain and were pain-free during the follow-up period, without any residual abnormalities. CIPS is a benign but adverse effect of CNI. Counselling patients about the disease’s natural history and supportive care remain the best treatment.",medical,Medicine (all)

Patients might suffer from a variety of the clinical symptoms of OH, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or problems with vision and fatigue. Objectives To determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and to identify any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and balance confidence in this patient population. Methods Symptomatic OH was defined as a systolic or diastolic BP fall of ≥ 20 or ≥ 10 mmHg respectively, within 3 min of standing and an Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) score of more than zero. Factors related to symptomatic OH were identified from a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Pearson's correlation test was used to reveal any relationships between the clinical symptoms of OH and a patient's confidence in their ability to balance, assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. Results 100 Thai PD patients were consecutively recruited into this study. The prevalence of symptomatic OH was 18%, asymptomatic OH was 4%, while 78% were patients without OH. Factors associated with symptomatic OH were age (OR, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.003–1.115, p = 0.038) and hypertension (OR, 95%CI: 6.16, 1.171–32.440, p = 0.032). A significant and negative correlation (r = − 0.229, p = 0.022) between OHQ composite scores and item 3 of the ABC scale (picking up slippers from floor), one of the movements in a vertical orientation, was found. Conclusion Elderly PD patients and with a co-morbidity of essential hypertension should be closely evaluated for the presence of symptomatic OH. In addition, they should be advised to change positions slowly, especially those in a vertical orientation.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; parkinson's disease, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

TEM images confirmed the formation of a core-shell morphology, in which the rubber core was fully covered by a silica shell. This improved the thermal stability of the composites. Coating with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 enhanced both the hydrophobicity and surface roughness of the mesh. The depth profile of the XPS spectra revealed the presence of fluoroalkylsilane on the superhydrophobic mesh and Ar gas ion etching confirmed migration of the fluoroalkylsilane, SiO 2 and carbon to the mesh surface. SEM and AFM results quantified the surface roughness of the coated mesh. Meshes coated with FAS-modified NR/SiO 2 exhibited superhydrophobic/superoleophilic properties. Surfaces coated with these encapsulated particles were successfully applied to oil/water separation. They exhibited a separation efficiency of up to 100% and were reusable across 30 cycles.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

As(III) removal was stimulated by an oxidation cooperated with adsorption process. K-OMS2 and Fe-BTC were separately synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). K-OMS2 showed characters of pure cryptomelane phase, nanorod structure, and a mixed-valent manganese framework with the coexistence of Mn(IV) and Mn(III). As(III) was successfully oxidized to As(V) by K-OMS2 in a temperature range of 303–333 K. An intermediate adsorption of As(V) was carried out with Fe-BTC in the same batch. A maximum adsorption capacity, described by Langmuir isotherm model, was observed at 76.34 mg/g. With an As(III) initial concentration of 5 mg/L, when K-OMS2 and Fe-BTC were simultaneously introduced into the solution, the As(III) removal process was completed within 60 min. Thus, it shortened the process time compared to the case where K-OMS2 was added first, followed by the addition of Fe-BTC.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Primers GC567F and 680R were initially evaluated for amplifying DNA and cDNA of ten references Vibrio species by PCR method. The GC-clamp PCR amplicons were separated according to their sequences by the DGGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 45–70% urea and formamide denaturants. Two pair of Vibrio species, which could not be differentiated on the gel, was Vibrio fluvialis - Vibrio furnissii and Vibrio parahaemolyticus - Vibrio harveyi. To determine the detection limit, in the community of 10 reference strains containing the same viable population, distinct DNA bands of 3 species; Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio mimicus and Vibrio alginolyticus were consistently observed by PCR-DGGE technique. In fact, 5 species; Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio mimicus, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio fluvialis consistently observed by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE. In the community containing different viable population increasing from 102 to 105 CFU/mL, PCR-DGGE analysis only detected the two most prevalent species, while RT-PCR-DGGE detected the five most prevalent species. Therefore, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE was also selected for detection of various Vibrio cell conditions, including viable cell (VC), injured cells from frozen cultures (IVC) and injured cells from frozen cultures with pre-enrichment (PIVC). It was found that cDNA band of all cell conditions gave the same migratory patterns, except that multiple cDNA bands of Plesiomonas shigelloides under IVC and PIVC conditions were found. When Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE was used for detecting Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the pathogen-spiked food samples, Vibrio parahaemolyticus could be detected in the spiked samples containing at least 102 CFU/g of this pathogen. The results obtained also corresponded to standard method (USFDA, 2004). In comparison with the detection of the Vibrio profiles in fourteen food samples using standard method, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR-DGGE resulted in 100%, 75% and 50% similarity in 3, 1 and 6 food samples, respectively.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

Commensal E. coli were used as a proxy for overall AMR on the farms. There was a high level of multidrug resistance in all three categories of farm, with isolates showing resistance to β-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline), and commonly possessing tetA, blaTEM, and plasmid replicons FIB and F. On the other hand, isolates with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype (ESBLP) and with resistance to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, tiamulin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were significantly more common among the PA farms (p < 0.05) than in the other two farm categories. In the PA farms, ESBLP E. coli commonly contained the blaCTX-M-1 group, blaCTX-M-9 group, or both gene groups, and were shown to transfer blaCTX-M genes in a conjugation experiment. E. coli containing N, FIC and A/C replicons were found only in PA farms. In summary, although E. coli isolates from all farms contained a core set of resistance to β-lactams and tetracyclines, the routine use of PA increased resistance rates to other important antimicrobials.","Immunology, pharmacology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Pharmacology, Microbiology (medical)"

Identification Method, Proton proton collisions, Large detector-systems performance, Particle identification methods, Performance of High Energy Physics Detectors","The algorithm developed by the CMS Collaboration to reconstruct and identify τ leptons produced in proton-proton collisions at s=7 and 8 TeV, via their decays to hadrons and a neutrino, has been significantly improved. The changes include a revised reconstruction of π0 candidates, and improvements in multivariate discriminants to separate τ leptons from jets and electrons. The algorithm is extended to reconstruct τ leptons in highly Lorentz-boosted pair production, and in the high-level trigger. The performance of the algorithm is studied using proton-proton collisions recorded during 2016 at s=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The performance is evaluated in terms of the efficiency for a genuine τ lepton to pass the identification criteria and of the probabilities for jets, electrons, and muons to be misidentified as τ leptons. The results are found to be very close to those expected from Monte Carlo simulation.","physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

Effects of bedroom environmental conditions on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea,"Lappharat S., Taneepanichskul N., Reutrakul S., Chirakalwasan N.",2018-04-15,"Adult, Aged, Air Pollution, Indoor, Female, Housing, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Particulate Matter, Polysomnography, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, Temperature, Bedroom environments, Obstructive sleep apnea, Particulate matter, Sleep quality","Study Objectives: Epidemiological associations have demonstrated the effects of long-term air pollution to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) through a physiological mechanism linking particulate matter exposure to OSA. This study aimed to determine the relationship between bedroom environmental conditions, OSA severity, and sleep quality. Methods: Sixty-three participants were enrolled for an overnight polysomnography; OSA was diagnosed between May to August 2016. Personal characteristics and sleep quality were obtained by a face-to-face interview. Bedroom environments, including data on particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), temperature, and relative humidity, were collected by personal air sampling and a HOBO tempt/RH data logger. Results: Sixty-eight percent of the participants experienced poor sleep. An elevation in 1-year mean PM10 concentration was significantly associated with an increase in apnea-hypopnea index (beta = 1.04, P =.021) and respiratory disturbance index (beta = 1.07, P =.013). An increase of bedroom temperature during sleep was significantly associated with poorer sleep quality (adjusted odds ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.01-2.10, P =.044). Associations between PM10 concentration and respiratory disturbance index were observed in the dry season (beta = 0.59, P =.040) but not in the wet season (beta = 0.39, P =.215). PM10 was not associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusions: Elevation of PM10 concentration is significantly associated with increased OSA severity. Our findings suggest that reduction in exposure to particulate matter and suitable bedroom environments may lessen the severity of OSA and promote good sleep.","medical, neuroscience","Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"
Improved fermentation performance to produce bioethanol from Gelidium amansii using Pichia stipitis adapted to galactose,"Sukwong P., Ra C.H., Sunwoo I.Y., Tantratian S., Jeong G.-T., Kim S.-K.",2018-07-01,"5 hydroxymethyl furfurals, Adaptation, Bio-ethanol production, Enzymatic saccharification, Ethanol production, Fermentation performance, Separate hydrolysis and fermentation, Thermal acid hydrolysis, Biomass, Ethanol, Galactose, Pichia, Rhodophyta, Activated carbon, Adaptation, Bioethanol production, HMF, Hyper thermal acid hydrolysis","This study employed a statistical method to obtain optimal hyper thermal acid hydrolysis conditions using Gelidium amansii (red seaweed) as a source of biomass. The optimal hyper thermal acid hydrolysis using G. amansii as biomass was determined as 12% (w/v) slurry content, 358.3 mM H2SO4, and temperature of 142.6 °C for 11 min. After hyper thermal acid hydrolysis, enzymatic saccharification was carried out. The total monosaccharide concentration was 45.1 g/L, 72.2% of the theoretical value of the total fermentable monosaccharides of 62.4 g/L based on 120 g dry weight/L in the G. amansii slurry. To increase ethanol production, 3.8 g/L 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in the hydrolysate was removed by treatment with 3.5% (w/v) activated carbon for 2 min and fermented with Pichia stipitis adapted to high galactose concentrations via separate hydrolysis and fermentation. With complete HMF removal and the use of P. stipitis adapted to high galactose concentrations, 22 g/L ethanol was produced (yield 0.50). Fermentation with total HMF removal and yeast adapted to high galactose concentrations increased the fermentation performance and decreased the fermentation time from 96 to 36 h compared to traditional fermentation.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology; energygy, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering"
Micromorphology of porosity related to electrical resistance of dental luting cements,"Sriyudthsak M., Kosaiyakanon Y., Luen F.P., Wattanasirmkit K., Srimaneepong V.",2018-01-01,"Dental luting cements, Electrical resistances, Glass ionomers, High porosity, Luting cements, Micro CT, Micromorphologies, Zinc phosphates, Dental luting cements, Electrical resistance, Micromorphology, Porosity, Solubility","The aim was to investigate the relation between micromorphology of porosity and electrical resistance of dental luting cements. Five dental luting cements were evaluated: zinc phosphate, glass ionomer, and three types of resin luting cements. Porosity of the specimen was analyzed by micro-CT and electrical resistance of cement was measured at voltage of 125 V up to 30 days and solubility of each specimen was calculated. It showed that the resin luting cements provided the highest electrical resistance regardless of amount of porosity. Zinc phosphate and glass ionomer had high porosity and the lowest resistance (14 and 3 kΩ, respectively). It was found that the electrical resistance of luting cement was not directly affected by the amount of porosity, but it seems to be related to pore connection. There is no correlation between electrical resistance and percentage of porosity but the morphology of porosity may have an influence on the electrical property of luting cement. Models of pore connection were proposed to explain the electrical resistance of luting cement.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Improving short text classification using fast semantic expansion on multichannel convolutional neural network,"Sotthisopha N., Vateekul P.",2018-08-20,"Clustering, Convolutional neural network, Embeddings, Short texts, Text classification, Clustering, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Short Texts, Text Classification, Word Embeddings","Nowadays, text classification is recognized as one of crucial tools for business users to gain more insights from customers. However, textual data from customers such as comments are usually short. Thus, there are two main issues in short text categorization: (1) insufficient contextual information and (2) noisy data due to misspellings. Recently, there is a prior attempt to propose a deep learning approach for short text categorization by expanding semantic using word embeddings clustering via an algorithm based on density peaks searching. Since the number of words in word embeddings is usually large, the clustering algorithm does not scale with the size of data set, thus demanding unacceptable computational cost. In this paper, we aim to propose a fast short-text categorization framework. Rather than using a CNN with k-max pooling layer, we propose to use a faster version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called 'multichannel CNN.' To speed up the semantic expansion process, we propose to employ mini batch K-Means++, which is considerably faster and scales well with the size of data set. Furthermore, we also introduce an additional preprocessing step to increase vocabulary coverage rate on word embeddings. We conducted experiments on four public data sets: Google Snippets, TREC, MR, and Subj. The results showed that the proposed framework does not only improve an accuracy on all data sets, but also reduces computational costs from several days to a few hours.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Control and Optimization, Information Systems and Management"
Second dimension column ensemble pressure tuning in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography,"Sharif K.M., Kulsing C., Junior A.I.D.S., Marriott P.J.",2018-02-09,"Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography, Coupled column, Differential pressures, Experimental parameters, Pressure tuning, Second-dimension column, Separation behaviour, Stationary phase materials, Alcohols, Alkanes, Chromatography, Gas, Kerosene, Pressure, Comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography, Coupled columns, Pressure tuning, Second dimension selectivity tuning","A pressure tunable (PT) coupled column ensemble has been implemented for the second dimension (2D) separation in comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography (GC×PTGC). This process requires two columns to be connected by a pressure junction, as a replacement for a single narrow bore, short column in 2D. Various 2D1 and 2D2 columns may be selected to provide complementary selectivity (polarity) compared to the 1D column. The tunable residence time arising from differential pressure drop in each 2D column results in a tunable fractional contribution of each column in the 2D separation. A sample mixture comprising different chemical classes, including alkanes and alcohols, is used to identify the feasibility and extent of selectivity tuning possible in GC×PTGC. The column length is also varied due to the imposed challenge of wraparound in the PT coupled column system as pressures are adjusted in the 2D separation. Different experimental parameters, stationary phase materials and column lengths have been applied to investigate and understand the separation behaviour of the 2D PT coupled column GC×GC system. Results are discussed considering analyte retention time, peak width, linear velocity and the contribution of each 2D column. A specific and unexpected example of GC×GC separation was demonstrated where the peak positions of polar and apolar compounds could almost swap their 2D retention position by application of PT. Kerosene was analysed as an example of complex sample analysis by GC×PTGC system. This process is shown to be a practical approach for altering different stationary phase selectivities in a single 2D arrangement in GC×GC.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The kiln was made of unfired clay bricks, which its properties including high refractoriness, low thermal shrinkage and durable are desired. Aluminum hydroxide is an interesting material for improving brick’s properties, providing high active alumina (gamma-alumina) content after decomposition, high melting point and also reasonable cost. The study evaluated the effect of an additive, Al(OH)3, on the fried properties of refractory clay brick. In this study, four difference proportions of Al(OH)3 to clay, including 0:100, 25:75, 49:51 and 76:24 were studied. The specimens of 5x5x5 cm3 were formed by hand molding, then were fired at 1200, 1300 and 1400 °C. The properties including refractoriness, volume shrinkage, strength, bulk density, water absorption, and slaking time were investigated. The samples of 25:75 ratio of Al(OH)3 to clay, which was fired at 1300oC exhibited high in refractoriness, low volume shrinkage of 5% and relatively low density of 1.69 g/cm3 as compared to those of 1400oC fired. Moreover, the moderate water adsorption of 15 % and useable compressive strength of 12.4 MPa was also observed. As a result, these properties suitable for using in firebox of dragon kiln of Ratchaburi province.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Despite this, studies on shrimp defense mechanisms protecting against AHPND are few. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes from white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei hepatopancreas upon VPAHPND infection at the early stages: 3 and 6 h post challenge and in the late stage at 48 h post challenge. Hemocyanin (HMC) is the most abundant gene identified as the up-regulated gene in the SSH library. Various hemocyanin subunits such as hemocyanin (HMC), hemocyanin subunit L1 (HMCL1), L2 (HMCL2), L3 (HMCL3), and L4 (HMCL4) were analyzed for their expression levels upon VPAHPND infection and in response to challenge with partially purified toxin of VPAHPND by qRT-PCR. Only HMC was highly up-regulated at 3 and 6 h post challenge in response to VPAHPND challenge. Two HMC subunits, HMCL3 and HMCL4, were up-regulated in the early phase of VPAHPND toxin injection. Furthermore, all subunits were down-regulated in the late phase of VPAHPND and toxin challenges. The native hemocyanin protein purified from shrimp hemolymph, identified as mixture of HMC and HMCL1, exhibited agglutination activity on VPAHPND. Injecting the purified native hemocyanin along with VPAHPND into shrimp decreased the number of bacteria in the hemolymph as compared to the VPAHPND challenged control. Moreover, pre-incubation of the purified native hemocyanin and VPAHPND toxin prior to injection into shrimp resulted in the decrease of cumulative mortality of shrimp when compared to the control. In addition, protein-protein interaction analysis carried out by ELISA technique indicated that hemocyanin exhibited VPAHPND toxin-neutralizing activity through direct interaction with PirA subunit with a dissociation constant of 6.83 × 10−6 M. Our results indicated that upon VPAHPND infection the expression of hemocyanin was induced and hemocyanin functions might involve agglutination of invading VPAHPND and also neutralization of VPAHPND secreted toxin via direct interacting with the PirA protein.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

The disposable devices show excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. The results demonstrated that the modified electrode on PADs had excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose with NaOH as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M). The oxidation potential of glucose was negatively shifted to 0.64 V vs. the screen-printed carbon pseudo-reference electrode. The paper-based sensor comprised a wide linear concentration range for glucose, from 0.01 to 1.3 mM and 1.3–5.0 mM for low and high concentration of glucose assay, respectively, with a detection limit of 0.67 µM (S/N = 3). Additionally, the PADs were applied to quantify glucose in honey, white wine and human serum.

The objectives of this study were to determine the bioaccessible concentration of As in rice grain sold in Bangkok and to evaluate the potential health risks associated with rice consumption. Polished (n = 32) and husked (n = 17) jasmine rice were collected from local markets. In vitro digestion was performed to determine the bioaccessible As concentrations, which were used for probabilistic health risk assessments in different age groups of the population. Approximately 43.0% and 44.4% of the total As in the grain of polished and husked rice, respectively, was in the form of bioaccessible As. Significantly higher bioaccessible As concentrations were found in husked rice than in polished rice (1.5–3.8 times greater). The concentrations of bioaccessible As in polished and husked rice were lower than the Codex standard for As in rice. The average daily dose of As via rice consumption is equivalent to the daily ingestion of 2 L of water containing approximately 3.2–7.2 μg L−1 of As. Approximately 0.2%–13.7% and 10.7%–55.3% of the population may experience non-carcinogenic effects from polished and husked rice consumption, respectively. Approximately 1%–11.6% of children and 74.1%–99.8% of adults were at risk of cancer. The maximum cancer probabilities were 3 children and 6 adults in 10,000 individuals.

The solution was then exposed to ethanol vapor for 1 day. The cellulose–VNR composites at 10–20 wt% VNR showed an excellent reinforcement, in terms of higher elastic and mechanical properties, even though the composite hydrogels retained a high amount of water (about 870–2400%). The nanosize morphology of the composite hydrogels indicated that the roughly aggregated VNR found in the cellulose medium formed with an interconnection layer between both the cellulose and VNR components, where the VNR was surrounded with fibrous cellulose medium.

Unlike previous PNA-based electrochemical PAD (ePAD) sensors where the capture element was placed directly on the electrode, acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper allowing regeneration by simple PAD replacement. As an example application, a sensor probe was designed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) detection. The ePAD DNA sensor was used to determine a synthetic 15-base oligonucleotide of MTB by measuring the fractional change in the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The R ct of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3-/4- before and after hybridization with the target DNA could be clearly distinguished. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to verify the EIS results, and showed an increase in peak potential splitting in a similar stepwise manner for each immobilization step. Under optimal conditions, a linear calibration curve in the range of 2–200 nM and the limit of detection 1.24 nM were measured. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch and non-complementary DNA targets due to the conformationally constrained structure of the acpcPNA. Moreover, the ePAD DNA sensor platform was successfully applied to detect PCR-amplified MTB DNA extracted from clinical samples. The proposed paper-based electrochemical DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative device for low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive and selective DNA sensor.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

Its extent can be assessed by measurements of reactive species (mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS)), oxidatively modified damage products, and levels of various antioxidants. We presented herein the methods for the measurement of protein carbonyl content and intracellular production of ROS. Protein carbonyl is the most commonly used indicator of protein oxidation because it is early formed and relatively stable under oxidative stress. Determination of protein carbonyl relies on the derivatization of carbonyl groups (aldehydes: R-CHO and ketones: R-CO-R) with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) under strongly acidic conditions to yield stable dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazones. Absorbance of the DNP hydrazones at 370–375 nm is proportional to the content of carbonyl groups. To report the protein carbonyl content, it is usually normalized by total proteins. Detection of intracellular ROS production is based on oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) by ROS to produce the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Fluorescent intensity measured at 480 nm excitation and 535 nm emission is directly proportional to the amount of ROS generated.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Genetics"

More robust evidence is needed to inform innovative and targeted interventions that bridge research gaps, inform policy, and improve outcomes for adolescents. A global research prioritization exercise was undertaken by WHO and CIPHER to focus efforts on priority research in the context of diminishing resources. Methods: The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methodology was adapted and used. Outcomes were reviewed by an expert group and 5 priority themes identified for testing, treatment, and service delivery, accounting for existing policies, published literature, and ongoing research. Results: A total of 986 research questions were submitted by 323 individuals from 67 countries. For HIV testing, priority themes included strategies and interventions to improve access, uptake, and linkage to care, and self-testing, particularly for key populations. For treatment, priorities included strategies to monitor and improve adherence, novel drug delivery systems, preventions and management of coinfections, optimal drug sequencing, and short- and long-term outcomes. For service delivery, priorities included service delivery models across the cascade, strategies to improve retention in care and sexual and reproductive health, support for pregnant ALHIV, and the provision of psychosocial support. Conclusions: This prioritized research agenda assists in focusing future research in ALHIV and will help to fill critical knowledge gaps. Key stakeholders, donors, program managers, and researchers should all support these priority questions and themes to collaboratively drive the adolescent HIV research agenda forward.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

Its major cause is insulin resistance. Patients with NAFLD can develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene silencing. Previous research reported that miR-29 family (a, b and c) and miR-122 have an important role in regulating insulin resistance related to NAFLD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate that miR-29 and miR-122 can be possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD. METHOD: Serum samples were collected from 58 NAFLD patients and 34 healthy controls. MiRNAs were extracted from serum by using microRNA purification kit followed by polyuridylation, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we analyzed the correlation between miR-29 and miR-122 and level of liver inflammation in NAFLD patients. RESULTS: We found that the serum miR-29a levels in NAFLD patients were significantly lower (P = 0.006) than the control group, while miR-29c levels were unchanged, and miR-29b levels were undetectable. However, we found that serum miR-122 levels in NAFLD patients were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those found in the control group. For miR-29a, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.679 (P = 0.0065) with 60.87% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity. For miR-122, the AUC was 0.831 (P < 0.0001) with 75.00% sensitivity and 82.35% specificity. Interestingly, the levels of serum miR- 122 were significantly different between patients without steatohepatitis (NAS < 4) and steatohepatitis (NAS ≥ 4), indicating that the levels of miR-122 were related to the severity of NAFLD. CONCLUSION: The levels of miR-29a and miR-122 might be beneficial and compelling as possible biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD.",medical,Medicine (all)

Light Chitosan with low molecular weight was used to provide bonding between CNFs and SiO2 from the RHA substrate. Mechanical properties namely, compressive strength and flexural properties of paste specimens were assessed to evaluate the efficiency of the applied method. Microstructural analysis was carried out using FTIR, XRD, TGA, and SEM to investigate the effects of the coating process on the hydration products and to explain the mechanical properties of specimens with the modified RHA. The results showed that 15% and 5% modified RHA increased the compressive strength and flexural strength of paste specimens at 28 days by 53% and 187%, respectively. Microstructural analysis showed that the coating process delayed the hydration, however, the physical crosslinking effect of carbon nanofibers enhanced the mechanical properties at all ages.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

Additional biomarkers of ABMR in kidney transplant recipients are needed. Methods: All 68 kidney transplanted-recipients enrolled in this study were negative for graft rejection as determined by surveillance-biopsy ELISA at day 7 post-transplantation. Allograft biopsy was then performed at 6 months post-transplantation for subclinical-ABMR detection. Recipients were stratified by pre-transplant DSA and BAFF at day 7 into four groups. Results: During the study period, 13.2% of the recipients demonstrated subclinical-ABMR at 6 months, without patient with clinical ABMR presentations. Overall mean BAFF at day 7 was 393 pg/mL (95% CI = 316–471 pg/mL). The optimal cut-off value for low vs. high BAFF level was 573 pg/mL, with sensitivity and specificity at 77.8% and 88.1%, respectively. Fifty percent of recipients with high BAFF at day 7 (14 patients) and only 3.7% of patients with low BAFF demonstrated ABMR (P < 0.05). Indeed, ABMR was more common in patients high BAFF level (hazard ratio = 7.30; 95% CI = 3.77–14.15). The prevalence of ABMR among negative pre-transplant DSA/low BAFF, positive DSA/low BAFF, negative DSA/high BAFF, and positive DSA/ high BAFF recipients were 4.4, 0, 37.5 and 66.7%, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Post-transplant ABMR can be predicted by perioperative serum BAFF level. Together with DSA testing, BAFF provides additional predictive value for ABMR.",medical,Nephrology

Vitamin D deficiency is common in postmenopausal women. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength in early postmenopausal women. The effects of vitamin D2 supplementation on muscle mass and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) were secondarily investigated. Methods: A 12-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in early postmenopausal women (45–60 years old) with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml). A total of 88 subjects were randomized into group I: vitamin D2 supplement 40 000 IU/week (n = 44), or group II: placebo (n = 44). Serum 25(OH)D level, muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle CSA were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after the supplementation. Results: After 12 weeks of supplementation, 70% of women in group I achieved a sufficient level of serum 25(OH)D (>30 ng/ml). There were significant differences in changes of serum 25(OH)D levels between the two groups (p < 0.05). Muscle strength and muscle CSA in group I increased significantly after 12 weeks (p = 0.015, 0.045, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the mean changes of muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle CSA between the two groups (p = 0.16, 0.89, 0.84, respectively).

Oxidative stress and subtle thyroid abnormalities may play a pathophysiological role in both disorders. Thus, the current study was performed to examine whether neuro-oxidative biomarkers and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels could predict HRQoL in BD and MDD. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 68 BD and 37 MDD patients and 66 healthy controls. The World Health Organization (WHO) QoL-BREF scale was used to assess 4 QoL subdomains. Peripheral blood malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products, paraoxonaxe/CMPAase activity, a composite index of nitro-oxidative stress, and basal TSH were measured. Results: In the total WHOQoL score, 17.3% of the variance was explained by increased advanced oxidation protein products and TSH levels and lowered CMPAase activity and male gender. Physical HRQoL (14.4%) was associated with increased MDA and TSH levels and lowered CMPAase activity. Social relations HRQoL (17.4%) was predicted by higher nitro-oxidative index and TSH values, while mental and environment HRQoL were independently predicted by CMPAase activity. Finally, 73.0% of the variance in total HRQoL was explained by severity of depressive symptoms, use of anticonvulsants, lower income, early lifetime emotional neglect, MDA levels, the presence of mood disorders, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: These data show that lowered HRQoL in major affective disorders could at least in part result from the effects of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, lowered antioxidant enzyme activities, and higher levels of TSH.",medical,"Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

As cities constantly evolve, keeping an up-To-date map of POIs is difficult. However, by observing digital footprints of people, including taxi pick-up and drop-off locations, we can detect hotspots of activities that indicate POI locations by using techniques such as point clustering. DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm for geographic data points. However, the effectiveness of the algorithm relies on determining appropriate parameters that match the distribution pattern of data points. That is hard because pick-up and drop-off locations are distributed differently in different areas. This paper proposes a method to automatically determine the parameters of DBSCAN according to point distribution in each dataset. The algorithm has been applied to pick-up and drop-off locations of taxis in Bangkok. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively discovered POIs in areas with different distribution patterns.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Artificial Intelligence"

High prevalence of fatal, disseminated HS has been described in Bernese Mountain Dogs (BMDs). Support for genetic predisposition to develop HS has been presented in several studies, but to date, causative genetic events have not been reported. In addition, no driver mutations have been identified in tumours. Recently, E76K gain-of-function mutation in SHP2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene has been described in human histiocytic malignancies. In our study, we identified the PTPN11E76K in HS of BMDs. Amplification of exon 3 of the PTPN11 gene followed by Sanger sequencing was used to detect the mutation and estimate the prevalence in HS from 30 BMDs, 13 Golden Retrievers and 10 other dog breeds. The overall prevalence of PTPN11E76K in HS of BMDs was 36.67% compared with 8.69% in other breeds. No mutation was identified in normal tissues from 10 BMDs with HS that carried the mutation and 12 control dogs with no neoplastic disease, including 6 BMDs. Increased immunoreactivity for AKT, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated AKT in a small subset of BMDs with PTPN11E76K suggests that a gain-of-function might be mediated by the ERK and AKT pathways. These data suggest PTPN11E76K as an important driver mutation of HS in BMDs. This information may not only aid in unravelling the tumourigenic events associated with HS in BMDs, but also help in identifying more promising therapeutic strategies.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Sampling these tissues provides important information about HIV pathogenesis. This period is associated with viral replication and immune activation that may affect procedure-related adverse events (AEs). We examined the safety and tolerability of inguinal lymph node (LN) biopsy in research participants with AHI in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: Between 2013 and 2016, 67 AHI participants in the RV254/ SEARCH010 study underwent at least one optional inguinal LN biopsy during AHI at the baseline visit and/or after antiretroviral therapy (median 48 weeks after antiretroviral therapy). Biopsy-related AEs were graded according to NIH Division of AIDS guidelines. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals to evaluate associations of demographic and HIV characteristics, procedure timing, and repetition with AE incidence. Results: Of the 67 participants, 97% were male with a median age of 26. Among 78 LN biopsies (39 at baseline and 39 at follow-up), 10 (12.8%) AEs were reported: 6 (7.7%) grade 1 and 4 (5.1%) grade 2. The AEs were biopsy-site discomfort (n = 8, 10.2%) and hematoma (n = 2, 2.6%). No factors were significantly associated with AE incidence. All biopsy-related AEs were transient and self-limited. Conclusions: Inguinal LN biopsies were safe and well tolerated in mostly Thai men with AHI. As LN biopsies become an integral part of HIV research, this study provides information to participants, researchers, and institutional review boards that these samples can be safely obtained.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; epidemiology, medical","Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

Most of these studies have concentrated on using prediction accuracy as a performance metric. Some of them have also performed trading simulations to evaluate financial performance. However, financial performance was not improved significantly because the loss function used in the training process focused primarily on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction. A new loss function was developed by adding a risk-reward function, which is derived by the trading simulation results. A new scoring metric called Sharpe-F1 score, which is a combination of Sharpe ratio and F1 score is used for model selection. We employ the best prediction model from our previous work, which consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) architectures and takes event embedding vectors, historical prices and a set of technical indicators as inputs. The robustness of our framework is evaluated on two datasets by varying the key parameters used in the proposed framework. The results show that financial performance can be improved by adding a risk-reward function into the loss function used in the training process.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Among the flavonoids tested, only four—khrinone (5), cajanin (9), (3RS)-3-hydroxy-8-methoxy vestitol (21), and (6aR,11aR)-3,8-dihydroxy-9-methoxy pterocarpan (27)—reacted with mushroom tyrosinase, with IC50 values of 54.0, 67.9, 67.8, and 16.7 µM, respectively, and only compound 27 showed inhibitory activity against murine tyrosinase. With cell-based assays, only compounds 9 and 27 effectively inhibited melanogenesis in B16-F10 melanoma cells (by 34% and 59%, respectively), at a concentration of 15 µM, without being significantly toxic to the cells. However, the crude extract of D. parviflora and some of the flavonoid constituents appeared to increase melanin production in B16-F10 cells, suggesting that there are flavonoids with both inhibitory and stimulatory melanogenesis in the crude extract. Studies on the correlation between the enzyme-based and cell-based assays showed that only the flavonoids with IC50 values below 50 µM against mushroom tyrosinase could inhibit the mammalian tyrosinase, and thus, reduce melanogenesis in B16-F10. Flavonoids with the IC50 values greater than 50 µM, on the other hand, could not inhibit the mammalian tyrosinase, and had either no effect or enhancement of melanogenesis. In conclusion, the tyrosinase enzyme from mushroom is not as selective as the one from mammalian source for the enzyme-based melanogenesis inhibitory screening, and the mammalian cell-based assay appears to be a more reliable model for screening than the enzyme-based one.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of psychiatric and substance use disorders among hospitalized ALD patients in the United States. Methods: We utilized a single-level clinical classification software to identify patients with ALD and psychiatric/substance use disorders from the 2011 National Inpatient Sample data. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these disorders among hospitalized patients with ALD (n = 74,972) compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol (n = 350,140) and those without underlying liver diseases (n = 1,447,063). Results: The prevalence of adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression was significantly higher among hospitalized patients with ALD when compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol (all with p-values <0.05). Younger age, female gender, and White race were the independent predictors of psychiatric/substance use disorders among hospitalized patients with ALD. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with ALD have significantly high prevalence of concomitant psychiatric and substance abuse disorders when compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol and those without underlying liver diseases.

Therefore, first of all, this paper proposes the demagnetization behavior of NdFeB PMs due to thermal effect. Then, these PMs are magnetized using a proposed simple magnetizing technique considering various demagnetization conditions.

Objective: To update the evidence-based recommendations and provide a practical treatment algorithm for management of TS by addressing 5 questions: 1) Is withdrawal of dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) an effective TS treatment? 2) Does switching from typical to atypical DRBAs reduce TS symptoms? 3) What is the efficacy of pharmacologic agents in treating TS? 4) Do patients with TS benefit from chemodenervation with botulinum toxin? 5) Do patients with TS benefit from surgical therapy? Methods: Systematic reviews were conducted by searching PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane for articles published between 2012 and 2017 to identify new evidence published after the 2013 AAN guidelines. Articles were classified according to an AAN 4-tiered evidence-rating scheme. To the extent possible, for each study we attempted to categorize results based on the description of the population enrolled (tardive dyskinesia [TD], tardive dystonia, tardive tremor, etc.). Recommendations were based on the evidence. Results and recommendations: New evidence was combined with the existing guideline evidence to inform our recommendations. Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine are established as effective treatments of TD (Level A) and must be recommended as treatment. Clonazepam and Ginkgo biloba probably improve TD (Level B) and should be considered as treatment. Amantadine and tetrabenazine might be considered as TD treatment (Level C). Pallidal deep brain stimulation possibly improves TD and might be considered as a treatment for intractable TD (Level C).

PLA and NR-ad-PCL were melt-blended using a co-rotating twin screw extruder. The morphology of PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends showed good adhesion as smooth boundary around rubber particles and PLA matrix. Only 5 wt% of rubber phase, NR-ad-PCL was more effective than NR to enhance toughness and mechanical properties of PLA. The contents of the NR-ad-PCL were varied from 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%. From thermal results, the incorporation of the NR-ad-PCL decreased the glass transition temperature and slightly increased degree of crystallinity of PLA. Mechanical properties of the PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends were investigated by dynamic mechanical analyser, pendulum impact tester and universal testing machine for tension and flexural properties. The increasing NR-ad-PCL contents led to decreasing Young’s and storage moduli but increasing loss modulus. Impact strength and elongation at break of the PLA/NR-ad-PCL blends increased with increasing NR-ad-PCL content up to 15 wt% where the maximum impact strength was about three times higher than that of pure PLA and the elongation at break increased to 79%.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, Materials Science","Environmental Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The enlarged right coronary artery provides retrograde collaterals to supply the left ventricle then preferentially directs into the lower pressure pulmonary artery system causing coronary steal phenomenon. Few patients who survive through adulthood without surgery must have abundant, well-formed functioning collaterals with adequate perfusion of the left ventricle. We present the oldest reported patient with ALCAPA to undergo corrective surgery. Case presentation: A 79-year-old woman presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination discovered a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent flow from color Doppler. Moreover, there was a severe mitral regurgitation from posterior mitral leaflet restriction associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation. Coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia suggesting adequate collateral circulation. Remarkably, there was a left coronary ostial stenosis, which served as a protective mechanism against myocardia ischemia by limiting the steal effect. The patient successfully underwent the ligation of anomalous artery at its origin in combination with bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusions: This case utilized multimodality imaging for delineating the course of abnormal vessels and helping to formulate therapeutic decision.",medical,"Surgery, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

The conformational response of the oCorA in its native phase appears to be less organized but differs considerably from that in its denatured phase where an abrupt increase of its radius of gyration occurs in a narrow temperature range. The inner segment (iCorA) retains its globular conformation in native phase while oCorA resorts to random-coil configurations with some coagulations on raising the temperature.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics, Statistics and Probability"

To investigate and explain the topological evolution of BRTN from 1999 to 2029, five network indicators were selected, including network diameter, gamma index, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. We found that, as the BRTN evolves, both diameter and gamma index seemingly rise indicating better spread and connectivity over time. Likewise, average degree centrality increases from 1.91 to 2.27, while both average closeness and betweenness centrality gradually decline; but with different intensity patterns. More specifically, stations with high closeness tend to be those in the central Bangkok area as they conveniently reach the rest of the network with fewer links; however, as betweenness gives more weights to stations that facilitate transportation, stations with high betweenness tend to be those joining central area to the suburbs.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics","Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, Strategy and Management, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management, Management Science and Operations Research, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Control and Optimization"

This is due to delays in diagnosis and a lack of effective monitoring tools. To overcome this drawback, serum beta-D-glucan (BG) and P. insidiosum-specific antibody (Pi-Ab) were examined as potential monitoring markers in vascular pythiosis. A prospective cohort study of vascular pythiosis patients was carried out from January 2010 to July 2016. Clinical information and blood samples were collected and evaluated by the BG and Pi-Ab assays. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare BG and Pi-Ab levels. The in vitro susceptibility test was performed with all P. insidiosum isolates from culture-positive cases. A total of 50 patients were enrolled: 45 survived and 5 died during follow-up. The survivors had a significantly shorter time to medical care (P 0.0001) and a significantly shorter waiting time to the first surgery (P 0.0001). There were no differences in BG levels among the groups at diagnosis (P 0.33); however, BG levels among survivors were significantly lower than those of the deceased group at 0.5 months (P 0.0001) and became undetectable after 3 months. Survivors were able to maintain an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) value (EV) of Pi-Ab above 8, whereas the EV among deceased patients was less than 4. In vitro susceptibility results revealed no synergistic effects between itraconazole and terbinafine. This study showed that BG and Pi-Ab are potentially valuable markers to monitor the disease after treatment initiation. An unchanged BG level at 2 weeks after surgery should prompt an evaluation for residual disease.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; antibodies and Immunologynoglobulins; Immunologynoglobulin, medical",Microbiology (medical)

We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify differences in metabolite profiles in low volumes of OA and RA synovial fluid (SF). SF was aspirated from knee joints of 10 OA and 14 RA patients. 100 μL SF was analyzed using a 700 MHz Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were analyzed by Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Metaboanalyst. 50 metabolites were annotated, including amino acids, saccharides, nucleotides and soluble lipids. Discriminant analysis identified group separation between OA and RA cohorts, with 32 metabolites significantly different between OA and RA SF (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were lower in RA compared to OA; these results concur with higher levels of inflammation, synovial proliferation and hypoxia found in RA compared to OA. Elevated taurine in OA may indicate increased subchondral bone sclerosis. We demonstrate that quantifiable differences in metabolite abundance can be measured in low volumes of SF by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which may be clinically useful to aid diagnosis and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis.","biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Chemistry (all)"

The waste razor clam shells were crushed, ground, and calcined at 900°C in a furnace for 2 h to derive calcium oxide (CaO) particles. Subsequently, the calcined shells were impregnated with BaCl2 by wet impregnation method and recalcined at 300°C for 2 h. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, and basic strength measurements. The effects of various parameters such as residence time, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, and catalyst bed length on the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) were determined. The BaCl2/CaO catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity and stability than CaO catalyst influenced by the basicity of the doped catalyst. The maximum fatty acid methyl ester yield was 98.7 % under optimum conditions (residence time 2.0 h, reaction temperature 60°C, methanol/oil molar ratio 12:1, and catalyst bed length 200 mm). After 6 consecutive reactions without any treatment, fatty acid methyl ester yield reduced to 83.1 %. The option of using waste razor clam shell for the production of transesterification catalysts could have economic benefits to the aquaculture and food industries.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Design: Randomized trial. Methods: The START parent study randomized participants to commence immediate versus deferred ART until CD4 + less than 350 cells/μl. The START Neurology substudy used eight neuropsychological tests, at baseline, months 4, 8, 12 and annually, to compare groups for changes in test performance. Test results were internally standardized to z-scores. The primary outcome was the average of the eight test z-scores (QNPZ-8). Mean changes in QNPZ-8 from baseline were compared by intent-to-treat using longitudinal mixed models. Changes from baseline to specific time points were compared using ANCOVA models. Results: The 592 participants had a median age of 34 years; median baseline CD4 + count was 629 cells/μl; the mean follow-up was 3.4 years. ART was used for 94 and 32% of accrued person-years in the immediate and deferred groups, respectively. There was no difference between the immediate and deferred ART groups in QNPZ-8 change through follow-up [-0.018 (95% CI -0.062 to 0.027, P = 0.44)], or at any visit.

However, unlike the left-to-right approach, there is still no work considering number representations for the right-to-left parallel calculation. By simplifying the implementation by Robert, we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation. Then, for any arbitrary amount of doubling time and addition time, we propose algorithms to generate representations which minimize the time in that model. As a result, we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like NAF is almost optimal. The parallel computation time obtained from any representation cannot be better than NAF by more than 1%.","applied Mathematicsematics, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture"

We use a data-driven method to both predict the spectrum of a printed ink stack and optimize for the stack layout that best matches a target spectrum. This bidirectional mapping is modeled using a pair of neural networks, which are optimized through a problem-specific multi-objective loss function. Our loss function helps find the best possible ink layout resulting in the balance between spectral reproduction and colorimetric accuracy under a multitude of illuminants.

Several existing mechanisms for enhancing were proposed in the traditional network not only at the application side as video clients but also at the network core as network routers. Although, these mechanisms can provide a good quality of service, they require a lot of maintenance cost. In addition, the static routing with the shortest-path fashion at the network gateways is not enough to provide a high quality of service for video/audio data transferring due to the affectation of background traffic. Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that allows a network operator to manage their network environment by programmable centralized control. This not only reduces the cost of maintenance but also increase the performance of networking. In this paper, we proposed an SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network. The framework used the Packet Pair technique to consider the characteristics of bandwidth and end-to-end delay between two video conference clients. A transferring path and network gateway inside-domain are set up based on this information without a requirement of a routing modification of outside-domains.

It encourages car companies to embed various types of sensors in their cars. The most common sensors that can be found are location sensor and acceleration sensor. The sensors generate a lot of useful data which could be applied for many future applications such as car tracking or emergency warning. One of the most interesting applications among others is analyzing the driver behavior. There are some previous works using this information to define types of drivers that are related to levels of accident risk. However, the driver behavior not only can separate the type of drivers but also can identify driving characteristic of an individual driver. The driver identification benefits a security application and it can eliminate the global car theft issue. Because the driver behavior cannot be repeated or copied like other anti-theft systems so this is an essential solution to stop increasing the number of stolen cars every year. In this paper, we propose a methodology to identify each driver and classify group of drivers using only accelerating behavior with machine learning technique. In order to identify an individual driver, the acceleration data have been transformed to a histogram in order to represent the accelerating behavior then we utilize a neural network model. We evaluate our methodology with data that have been collected from the acceleration sensors installed on 13 shuttle buses in our campus for more than 10 months. The results show the accuracy of the proposed methodology up to 88.3% for driver identification and up to 92% for driver classification.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Computer Networks and Communications"

In prostate carcinoma, aberrant promoter hypermethylation occurs earlier in the disease course and more consistently than recurrent somatic mutations. PAQR3, a tumor suppressor gene, was recently found to be downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines. We hypothesized that promoter methylation could be responsible for PAQR3 silencing in prostate cancer tissues. We aimed to investigate PAQR3 promoter methylation in prostate cancer by comparing it to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 154 human prostate tissue samples, including 92 cases with prostate cancer and 62 cases with BPH, were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Clinicopathological correlation between PAQR3 promoter methylation and prognostically relevant variables was studied by statistical analysis. Promoter methylation of PAQR3 was significantly more frequent in prostate carcinoma compared to BPH (73.9% vs. 25.8%, p < 0.01). The high prevalence of PAQR3 methylation in cancer foci was also confirmed with microdissection technique in 12 samples of prostate adenocarcinoma. PAQR3 hypermethylation was associated with perineural invasion (p = 0.03), an adverse clinicopathological feature of prostate cancer. We concluded that PAQR3 can be a promising methylation marker candidate for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Cell Biology"

Results: Overall, IVCM had average sensitivity and specificity of 69.7% ± 2.5% and 97.1% ± 4.2% for experienced observers and 59.0% ± 7.6% and 92.7% ± 10.4% for inexperienced observers, respectively. However, the sensitivity did not show any significant association with the duration of disease, size of ulcer, depth of involvement, culture results, or cyst morphology. Although interobserver agreement was good (κ = 0.60, P < 0.001) for the experienced observers, it was only at a moderate level (κ = 0.48, P < 0.001) for the inexperienced observers. Conclusions: IVCM has a moderate sensitivity and a high specificity for diagnosis of AK. Although clinical parameters do not affect this diagnostic accuracy, a higher sensitivity is seen when images are interpreted by experienced observers.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology
Regulation of periostin expression by Notch signaling in hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines,"Kongkavitoon P., Butta P., Sanpavat A., Bhattarakosol P., Tangtanatakul P., Wongprom B., Tangkijvanich P., Hirankarn N., Palaga T.",2018-11-30,"Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cell Line, Tumor, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HEK293 Cells, Hepatocytes, Humans, Liver, Liver Neoplasms, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Receptors, Notch, Signal Transduction, Transcriptome, Bile duct carcinoma, Extracellular matrix, Hepatocytes, Notch signaling, Periostin","Notch signaling is involved in both differentiation of hepatocyte progenitors and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism whereby Notch signaling regulates cellular transformation in hepatocytes is still controversial. This study investigated the impact of overexpressing truncated intracellular Notch1 (NICD1) on transcriptomic profiles of immortalized human hepatocytes. RNA sequencing and gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization and hyaluronan biosynthesis process gene sets are among those affected by Notch hyperactivation. The relationship between Notch signaling and periostin, an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed in HCC, were further studied. Modulating Notch signaling through NICD1 overexpression or treatment with a gamma secretase inhibitor resulted in increased or decreased periostin expression, respectively, in HCC and liver bile duct carcinoma cell lines. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database, mRNA levels of NOTCH1 and POSTN are positively correlated in tumor tissues but not in nontumor tissues. Two consensus RBPJ binding motifs were identified in the −3932/-3921 and + 2522/+2533 bp of POSTN regulatory regions, and NOTCH1 is associated with these binding sites in a liver bile duct carcinoma cell line. Taken together, these results indicate that Notch signaling directly regulates transcription of POSTN in hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines and may be a candidate for drug targeting in liver cancer.",biochemistryistry,"Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

Many applications, such as urban planning, change detection, and environmental monitoring, require the accurate segmentation; hence, most segmentation tasks are performed by humans. Currently, with the growth of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), there are many works aiming to find the best network architecture fitting for this task. However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices. The results show that the model that achieves the highest accuracy RGB bands of medium resolution aerial imagery is SegNet. The overall accuracy of the model increases when includes Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band. The results showed that our proposed method (our modified SegNet model, named RGB-IR-IDX-MSN method) outperforms all of the baselines in terms of mean F1 scores.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"

However, many Ti-based amorphous alloys contain toxic elements such as Al, Ni, V and Be. The presence of toxic elements within amorphous alloys is a concern when they are intended for use as a biomaterial. This problem has steered many researchers toward the development of Ti-based amorphous alloys without toxic elements. Our novel amorphous alloys were developed based on this principle. A series of Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu6+xCo23-xTa7 (x = 0, 4, 8) amorphous alloys were developed for biomedical application. A series of protocol tests were performed to check for biocompatibility and potential use of the novel alloys in humans. First, alloy ingots were alloyed by induction melting and then cast into copper molds. The cast rod was then used as the plasma cathode in a filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition chamber to coat the 25-nm amorphous alloy thin film on the cover glass slides. These coated cover glass slides were then examined for biocompatibility. Cell proliferation and cell differentiation were investigated using Methylthiazol Tetrazolium assay test and by alkaline phosphatase assay on osteoblast like cells (SaOS-2), respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed to evaluate the thin film surface characteristics. The thickness of thin film was analyzed using a Stylus profilometer. An adhesion scratch test was administered to evaluate the thin film adhesive strength and indirect hardness comparison. Electron Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry was performed to study the elemental composition. Lastly, a medical grade Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in parallel as a control material. Results indicated that all investigated Ti-based amorphous alloys were non-cytotoxic and were comparable to the Ti-6AL-4V. They also demonstrated an ability to support differentiation of osteoblast like cells. The adhesion and the hardness of the thin films on the substrates were superior to that of Ti-6Al-4V. The results suggested that the novel alloys in this study could be potentially utilized in biomedical applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

This study aimed to evaluate predictive factors for death from snake envenomation in Myanmar. Methods: A prospective study was performed among adult patients with snakebite admitted to tertiary hospitals in Yangon, Myanmar, from May 2015 to August 2016. Data including clinical variables and laboratory parameters, management, and outcomes were evaluated. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors predictive for death at the time of presentation to the hospital. Results: Of the 246 patients with snake envenomation recruited into the study, 225 (92%) survived and 21 (8%) died during hospitalization. The snake species responsible for a bite was identified in 74 (30%) of the patients; the majority of bites were from Russell's vipers (63 patients, 85%). The independent factors predictive for death included 1) duration from bite to arrival at the hospital >1 h (odds ratio [OR]: 9.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–75.2; P=0.04); 2) white blood cell counts >20 ×103 cells·μL-1 (OR: 8.9, 95% CI: 2.3–33.7; P=0.001); and 3) the presence of capillary leakage (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.2–11.2; P=0.02). A delay in antivenom administration >4 h increases risk of death (11/21 deaths). Conclusions: Patients who present with these independent predictive factors should be recognized and provided with early appropriate intervention to reduce the mortality rate among adults with snake envenomation in Myanmar.",medical,"Emergency Medicine, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In this paper, we present an improved deep convolutional encoder-decoder network (DCED) for segmenting road objects from aerial images. Several aspects of the proposed method are enhanced, incl. incorporation of ELU (exponential linear unit)—as opposed to ReLU (rectified linear unit) that typically outperforms ELU in most object classification cases; amplification of datasets by adding incrementally-rotated images with eight different angles in the training corpus (this eliminates the limitation that the number of training aerial images is usually limited), thus the number of training datasets is increased by eight times; and lastly, adoption of landscape metrics to further improve the overall quality of results by removing false road objects. The most recent DCED approach for object segmentation, namely SegNet, is used as one of the benchmarks in evaluating our method. The experiments were conducted on a well-known aerial imagery, Massachusetts roads dataset (Mass. Roads), which is publicly available. The results showed that our method outperforms all of the baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

To improve its properties further, CG was encapsulated into polysaccharide-based nanoparticles in this study. A chitosan/alginate nanoparticulate system was chosen for encapsulation of CG due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, mucoadhisiveness and good film formation. CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification and ionotropic gelification, with the conditions optimized using response surface methodology. A chitosan/alginate mass ratio of 0.04:1, CG concentration of 3 mg/mL and Pluronic®F127 concentration of 0.50% (w/v) were determined to be optimal for the nanoparticle preparation. FTIR and XRD confirmed encapsulation of CG into the chitosan/alginate nanoparticles. The CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed better stability under UV radiation and in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, compared to a CG dispersion in water. The nanoparticles showed slow cumulative release of CG in simulated gastrointestinal fluids without enzymes and in body fluid. A Weibull model of the best fit for all conditions suggested that the release pattern of CG from CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles was mainly controlled by Fickian diffusion and erosion of polymer materials. Finally, CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed higher in vitro cellular uptake in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells) and better anticancer activity against Caco-2, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells.

PCV3 titers in the serum and colostrum samples of 38 sows were determined using qPCR. Interestingly, this is the first report regarding the identification of PCV3 from the colostrum samples. In the studied farm, the prevalence of PCV3 in the colostrum samples was 44.74% (17/38). When sows were grouped based on the PCV3 titers in the serum into the “High-viremic” “Low-viremic” and “Non-viremic” sows, it was shown that the High-viremic sows showed significantly higher PCV3 colostrum prevalence (100%; 9/9) with the PCV3 titers ranging from 4.01 to 7.33 genomic copies/mL. The results indicated that PCV3 in the colostrum might be partly influenced by the viremic stage of the infection. However, the results also showed that approximately 41% of sows shedding PCV3 with low titers in the colostrum (7/17) were non-viremic sows. In conclusion, this study identified the presence of PCV3 in sow colostrum.

Both IVCs ascended on either side of the abdominal aorta. The left-sided IVC crossed anterior to the aorta at the level of the left renal vein. The union of both IVCs was at the level just above the right renal vein. The diameter of right-sided IVC, left-sided IVC and the common IVC were 16.73 mm, 21.57 mm and 28.75 mm, respectively. In the pelvic cavity, the right common iliac vein was formed by a union of right external and internal iliac veins while the formation of left common iliac vein was from the external iliac vein and two internal iliac veins. An interiliac vein ran from right internal iliac vein to left common iliac vein with an additional communicating vein running from the middle of this interiliac vein to the right common iliac vein. Another co-existence variation in this case was the origin of the CHA arising from the SMA with a suprapancreatic retroportal course. Clinical importance of double IVC are observed in retroperitoneal surgery, whole organ transplantation or radical nephrectomy, surgical ligation of the IVC or the placement of an IVC filter for thromboembolic disease.

The microemulsion biofuels along with neat diesel fuel, palm oil-diesel blends, and biodiesel-diesel blends were tested in a DI diesel engine at two engine loads without engine modification. The formulated microemulsion biofuels increased fuel consumption and gradually reduced the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and exhaust gas temperature; however, there was no significant difference in their carbon monoxide (CO) emissions when compared to those of diesel. Varying the carbon chain length of the cosurfactant demonstrated that the octanol-microemulsion fuel emitted lower CO and NOx emissions than the butanol-and decanol-microemulsion fuels.

Breast milk offers an alternative source of MECs to replace mammary gland tissue. This study aimed to isolate and culture MECs from goat milk. Samples of fresh goat milk were collected from early and late-lactating Saanen goats. Samples were subjected to isolation, culture and characterization for putative MECs. The cells adhered to the culture dishes 1 day after isolation and displayed a monolayer pattern, epithelial-like cobblestone morphology, and formed alveoli-like structures that are typical of MECs. We identified the epithelial origin of the isolated cell by staining with antibodies against cytokeratin 8, 18 and alkaline phosphatase. Moreover, some of the isolated cells expressed the stem cell marker stage-specific embryonic antigen-4. The transcription of Capra hircus β-casein (CNS2) gene, a candidate gene for analysis of lactational function, was detected in MECs after induced differentiation. In addition, green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing cells could be generated from goat milk-derived MECs. This study demonstrated that goat MECs can be easily isolated from milk samples collected from early and late-lactating goats.

After 4 months of oral iron therapy resulting in an improved Hb level, her HbCS level was substantially increased to 8.7% on IEF suggesting homozygous HbCS. Subsequent DNA analysis using multiplex amplification refractory mutation system analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for HbCS and Hb Paksé. Conclusion: This case demonstrated that IDA can significantly reduce HbCS/Hb Paksé levels and probably mask the diagnosis of homozygous HbCS, homozygous Hb Paksé or the compound heterozygosity for both hemoglobinopathies by hemoblogin analysis. The test should be repeated after resolution of IDA, or molecular testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.","medical, biochemistryistry, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Hematology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Clinical Biochemistry, Medical Laboratory Technology, Biochemistry (medical), Microbiology (medical)"
Re-evaluation of pediatric 18F-FDG dosimetry: Cristy-Eckerman versus UF/NCI hybrid computational phantoms,"Khamwan K., O'Reilly S.E., Plyku D., Goodkind A., Josefsson A., Cao X., Fahey F.H., Treves S.T., Bolch W.E., Sgouros G.",2018-08-14,"Computational phantom, Electron transport simulations, Hybrid computational, Internal radiation dose, Monte Carlo calculation, Pharmacokinetic data, University of Florida, ^18F-FDG, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Fluorodeoxyglucose F18, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms, Organs at Risk, Phantoms, Imaging, Photons, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Exposure, Radiometry, Retrospective Studies, 18F-FDG, computational phantoms, Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD), Monte Carlo calculations, pediatric dosimetry","Because of the concerns associated with radiation exposure at a young age, there is an increased interest in pediatric absorbed dose estimates for imaging agents. Almost all reported pediatric absorbed dose estimates, however, have been determined using adult pharmacokinetic data with radionuclide S values that take into account the anatomical differences between adults and children based upon the older Cristy-Eckerman (C-E) stylized phantoms. In this work, we use pediatric model-derived pharmacokinetics to compare absorbed dose and effective dose estimates for 18F-FDG in pediatric patients using S values generated from two different geometries of computational phantoms. Time-integrated activity coefficients of 18F-FDG in brain, lungs, heart wall, kidneys and liver, retrospectively, calculated from 35 pediatric patients at the Boston's Children Hospital were used. The absorbed dose calculation was performed in accordance with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose method using S values generated from the University of Florida/National Cancer Institute (UF/NCI) hybrid phantoms, as well as those from C-E stylized computational phantoms. The effective dose was computed using tissue-weighting factors from ICRP Publication 60 and ICRP Publication 103 for the C-E and UF/NCI, respectively. Substantial differences in the absorbed dose estimates between UF/NCI hybrid pediatric phantoms and the C-E stylized phantoms were found for the lungs, ovaries, red bone marrow and urinary bladder wall. Large discrepancies in the calculated dose values were observed in the bone marrow; ranging between -26% to +199%. The effective doses computed by the UF/NCI hybrid phantom S values were slightly different than those seen using the C-E stylized phantoms with percent differences of -0.7%, 2.9% and 2.5% for a newborn, 1 year old and 5 year old, respectively. Differences in anatomical modeling features among computational phantoms used to perform Monte Carlo-based photon and electron transport simulations for 18F, and very likely for other radionuclides, impact internal organ dosimetry computations for pediatric nuclear medicine studies.","fluidex; related topics, Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Here we report the durability of this finding. Methods: MARCH, an international, multicentre, randomized, 96-week open-label switch study, enrolled HIV-1-infected adults with R5-tropic virus who were stable (> 24 weeks) and virologically suppressed [plasma viral load (pVL) < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL]. Participants were randomized to continue their current PI/r-based regimen (PI/r) or to switch to MVC plus two N(t)RTIs (MVC) (1:2 randomization). The primary endpoint was the difference in the proportion with pVL < 200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. The switch arm was defined as noninferior if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference was < −12% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety endpoints (the difference in the mean change from baseline or a comparison of proportions) were analysed as key secondary endpoints. Results: Eighty-two (PI/r) and 156 (MVC) participants were randomized and included in the ITT analysis; 71 (87%) and 130 (83%) were in follow-up and on therapy at week 96. At week 96, 89.0% and 90.4% in the PI/r and MVC arms, respectively, had pVL < 50 copies/mL (95% CI -6.6, 10.2). Moreover, in those switching away from PI/r, there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol (differences 0.31 mmol/L; P = 0.02) and triglycerides (difference 0.44 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Changes in CD4 T-cell count, renal function, and serious and nonserious adverse events were similar in the two arms. Conclusions: MVC as a switch for a PI/r is safe and effective at maintaining virological suppression while having significant lipid benefits over 96 weeks.",medical,"Health Policy, Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

The poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was added as a dispersed phase to improve the electrical and electromechanical properties of the pristine carrageenan hydrogels. The electromechanical properties of the carrageenan hydrogels were investigated under the effects of electric field strength, carrageenan type namely κ ι and λ operating temperature, and P3HT concentration. The electromechanical responses of the pristine carrageenans increased with increasing sulfated groups present; the λ-carragenan hydrogel provided the highest storage modulus sensitivity of 4.0 under applied electric field strength of 800 V/mm. With increasing temperature, the double-helical structure of the κ-carrageenan hydrogel changed into a random coil leading to the increase in the storage modulus response. On the other hand, the P3HT/κ-carrageenan hydrogel blend at 0.10%v/v P3HT provided the high storage modulus sensitivity of 2.20 at the electric field strength of 800 V/mm. The higher dielectrophoretic forces were due to the additional P3HT electronic polarization, but lower deflections relative to those of the pristine κ-carrageenan hydrogel. Both κ- and λ-carrageenans with the double helical structures are shown here as possible candidates to be fabricated as electroactive hydrogels for actuator or biomedical applications.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Methods To compare I&O biomarkers between MDD and BD we assessed serum levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS; a lipid peroxidation marker), soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), sIL-6R, IL-α, sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), tumor necrosis factor receptor 60 kDa/80 kDa (sTNFR60/R80) in 114 MDD and 133 BD patients, and 50 healthy controls. We computed z-unit weighted indices reflecting the 5 cytokine receptor levels (zCytR), cell-mediated immunity (zCMI) and I&O pathways (zCMI + TBARS). Results There are no significant differences in biomarkers between MDD and BD. BD/MDD with atypical features is characterized by increased sIL-6R and TBARS, whereas melancholia is associated with higher TBARS and lower sTNFR60 levels. Severity of illness, as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, is correlated with increased sIL-6R, sTNFR80, TBARS, zCytR and zCMI + TBARS. The number of episodes the year prior to blood sampling is positively associated with sTNFR80, TBARS, zCMI, zCMI + TBARS, while number of hospitalizations is positively associated with sIL-1RA. Prior suicidal attempts are associated with increased sIL-1RA, IL-1α, zCMI, TBARS and zCMI + TBARS, while TBARS is associated with current suicidal ideation. Conclusions There are no I&O biomarker differences between MDD and BD. Atypical depression is associated with increased IL-6 trans-signaling and lipid peroxidation. Severity of depression, number of episodes and suicidal attempts are associated with activated I&O pathways. Increased TBARS is the single best predictor of BD/MDD, atypical depression, melancholia and current suicidal ideation.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

The rhizome of Curcuma longa L. contains yellow pigments called curcuminoids which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the study was to compare the protective effects of curcuminoids, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and tetrahydrocurcumin on hemin-induced LDL oxidation (he-oxLDL). He-oxLDL showed the depletion of α-tocopherol, an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs), and alteration of the lipid composition in low-density lipoprotein. The levels of cholesteryl arachidonate, cholesteryl linoleate and the cholesteryl linoleate/cholesteryl oleate ratio were decreased. All test compounds showed antioxidant activity that protected against hemin-induced lipid peroxidation, based on the inhibition of TBARs formation, reduced depletion of α-tocopherol, decreased damage to lipids, and a reduced decrease in the cholesteryl linoleate/cholesteryl oleate ratio. A significant protective effect against he-oxLDL was found to be tetrahydrocurcumin ≥ curcumin ≥ curcuminoids > demethoxycurcumin ≥ bisdemethoxycurcumin ≥ α-tocopherol (p <.05). Practical applications: Curcuma longa L. has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine for treatment of conditions such as arthritis, ulcer, jaundice, wounds, and skin diseases. It has also been used as a food additive. The results from this study demonstrated that curcuminoids derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. are the potential substances for protecting hemin-induced LDL oxidation which may be developed as a functional food for the prevention of diseases related to low-density lipoprotein oxidation.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Food Science, Biophysics, Pharmacology, Cell Biology"

The effects of the electrolyte solution medium type (KCl and HNO3) and concentration (0.3 and 3.0 mM) as well as the plasma discharge time (1–4 h) with a Ti electrode were investigated. The 3.0 mM HNO3 solution provided the highest energy per second discharging into the plasma, resulting in both a high synthesis rate of black TiO2 and a high degree of defective structures, as monitored in terms of the Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio, which can shorten the band gap energy (Eg) of the obtained black TiO2. A long plasma discharge time (4 h) induced the formation of large particles of black TiO2, which appeared as a highly defective structure. Overall, the black TiO2 prepared by discharged plasma for 4 h in 3.0 mM HNO3 solution (BTN-304) provided the highest photocatalytic activity for glycerol conversion (58.49% at 24 h) and 4.85, 3.32, 2.11, 2.15, 39.15 and 26.61% yield of glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxypyruvic acid, glycolic acid, glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde, respectively.

However, the possibility of stopping dexamethasone premedication has been investigated in previous studies to reduce the steroid’s adverse events; however, either the result or the particular protocol was limited. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate the incidence of HSR after dexamethasone premedication discontinuation after lack of HSR in two previous weekly paclitaxel infusions. Method: Early breast cancer patients who received adjuvant weekly paclitaxel in a retrospective cohort from January 2012 through February 2016 at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were reviewed. All patients received a standard premedication protocol prior to the first and second paclitaxel infusion. Dexamethasone was omitted in later cycles in all patients who did not undergo infusion HSR. Patients who developed HSR during the first or second cycles of paclitaxel infusion were excluded. The incidence of HSR during the later cycle of paclitaxel administration and factors associated with this adverse reaction were collected. Results: Eighty-one of 85 patients who did not undergo infusion HSR after 2 cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration were retrospectively reviewed. The median age was 51 years (range 27–74 years). Only 16% of the patients had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, 57.8% were premenopausal, 67.9% had no comorbidity, none had a history of allergy or asthma, 65.4% received weekly paclitaxel as a single agent, and 34.6% received weekly paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab. Five of 81 patients reported grade I–II HSR (6.25%), which occurred mostly during the first 6 cycles (60%). Temporary discontinuation of paclitaxel infusion was observed in all HSR patients. No differences regarding age, BMI, menopausal status, and underlying disease between the HSR and no HSR groups were identified. Concerning the safety profile, peripheral neuropathy (gr I 60%, gr II 13.5%, and gr III 2.4%), myalgia (43.4%), and edema (10.5%) were commonly reported, whereas dyspepsia (5.3%) and insomnia (14.5%) were rarely described in withholding patients. Conclusion: Withholding dexamethasone premedication in non-experiencing HSR patients after two previous cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration was safe and did not impact the higher incidence of HSR. A discontinuing dexamethasone protocol should be recommended generally in these patients, especially those with a high risk for steroid-induced side effects.",medical,Oncology

We compared performance characteristics of algorithms used in a mobile clinic and a facility-based clinic for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Bangkok. Methods: Mobile clinic samples collected from 4 saunas and 2 spa venues were tested by Alere Determine™ HIV 1/2, followed by DoubleCheck Gold™ Ultra HIV 1/2 and SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0. All samples were re-tested at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRCAC) by Architect HIV Ag/Ab or Elecsys HIV combi PT, followed by Alere Determine™ HIV 1/2 and Serodia HIV 1/2. Non-reactive samples were tested by Aptima nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and reactive/inconclusive samples were tested by less-sensitive immunoassays (IA) and HIV-1 RNA to detect acute HIV infection (positive NAAT or non-reactive IA/positive HIV-1 RNA). Results: Of 233 MSM, 36 (15.5%) had HIV infection diagnosed using mobile clinic algorithm. Two additional acute HIV cases (1 positive NAAT and 1 reactive Architect with detectable HIV-1 RNA) were diagnosed using TRCAC algorithm. The mobile clinic algorithm had a sensitivity of 94.9% (95% CI: 82.7, 99.4) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 98.1, 100). Conclusion: Use of whole blood on rapid test kits demonstrated satisfactory performance and allowed same-day HIV test result through a mobile clinic model. For populations with high HIV incidence, careful history taking to define the window period is crucial and repeat testing must be encouraged if the testing algorithm does not include 4 th generation anti-HIV assay or NAAT.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Cultivars and harvest years had more impact on metabolite profile separation than cultivation areas. We identified cultivar-dependent metabolite markers related to durian fruit quality traits, such as nutritional value (pyridoxamine), odor (cysteine, leucine), and ripening process (aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid). Interestingly, durian fruit were found to contain high amounts of γ-glutamylcysteine (810.3 ± 257.5 mg/100 g dry weight) and glutathione (158.1 ± 80.4 mg/100 g dry weight), which act as antioxidants and taste enhancers. This metabolite information could be related to consumer preferences and exploited for durian fruit quality improvement.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"
Low-cost and disposable sensors for the simultaneous determination of coenzyme Q10 and α-lipoic acid using manganese (IV) oxide-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes,"Charoenkitamorn K., Chaiyo S., Chailapakul O., Siangproh W.",2018-04-03,"Coenzyme Q10, Electroactive surface areas, Lipoic acids, Modified electrode surfaces, Quantitative determinations, Screen-printed graphene electrodes, Simultaneous determinations, Square wave anodic stripping voltammetry, Electrochemical Techniques, Electrodes, Graphite, Manganese Compounds, Molecular Structure, Oxides, Printing, Thioctic Acid, Ubiquinone, Coenzyme Q10, Graphene, Lipoic acid, Manganese (IV) oxide, Screen-printed graphene electrode, Simultaneous determination","In this work, for the first time, manganese (IV) oxide-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes (MnO2/SPGEs) were developed for the simultaneous electrochemical detection of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and α-lipoic acid (ALA). This sensor exhibits attractive benefits such as simplicity, low production costs, and disposability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to characterize the electrochemical behavior of the analyte and investigate the capacitance and electroactive surface area of the unmodified and modified electrode surfaces. The electrochemical behavior of CoQ10 and ALA on MnO2/SPGEs was also discussed. Additionally, square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was used for the quantitative determination of CoQ10 and ALA. Under optimal conditions, the obtained signals are linear in the concentration range from 2.0 to 75.0 μg mL−1 for CoQ10 and 0.3–25.0 μg mL−1 for ALA. The low limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 0.56 μg mL−1 and 0.088 μg mL−1 for CoQ10 and ALA, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the utility and applicability of the MnO2/SPGE sensor through simultaneous measurements of CoQ10 and ALA in dietary supplements. The sensor provides high accuracy measurements, exhibiting its high potential for practical applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"
Mesostructured natural rubber/in situ formed silica nanocomposites: A simple way to prepare mesoporous silica with hydrophobic properties,"Nuntang S., Yousatit S., Chaowamalee S., Yokoi T., Tatsumi T., Ngamcharussrivichai C.",2018-01-01,"Chemical compositions, Hexagonal mesoporous silica, Hydrophobic properties, Mesoporous silica materials, Mesostructured nanocomposites, Silica nanocomposites, Sol gel preparations, Tetraethyl orthosilicates, Hexagonal mesoporous silica, Nanocomposites, Natural rubber, Sol-gel preparation","We report here a simple way to prepare mesoporous silica materials with hydrophobic properties, as natural rubber (NR)/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) nanocomposites, via an in situ sol-gel process using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and decylamine as a silica precursor and organic template, respectively. Effects of swelling the NR sheet in TEOS, prior to dissolution in tetrahydrofuran, on the mesostructure, chemical composition and hydrophobicity of the resulting nanocomposites were investigated. The NR/HMS prepared with the pre-swelling step had superior structural and textural properties to that prepared without the pre-swelling step. The presence of rubber phase entrapped in the mesostructured silica and genuinely mesostructured NR/silica nanocomposite framework was confirmed by osmium tetroxide staining coupled with transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated a good dispersion of NR molecules in the mesostructured nanocomposites, which was determined by the distribution of non-hydrolyzed ethoxy groups. The use of toluene extraction, followed by characterization of the resulting material, identified the weak nature of the NR-silica interaction. Dynamic light scattering indicated that the presence of TEOS in the pre-swollen NR matrix enhanced the diffusion of template molecules into the rubber phase, and the dispersion of NR molecules in the synthesis mixture. Finally, a plausible mechanism for the formation of NR/HMS nanocomposites via cooperative templating route, in which the remnant ethoxy groups acted as hydrophobic linkers between the rubber chains and the silica oligomers, was proposed.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

However, the role of surfactant adsorption affecting enzymatic hydrolysis has not been elaborated well. In this work, nonionic surfactants differing in their molecular structures, namely the polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), the secondary alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol 15-S-9), and the branched alcohol ethoxylate (Tergitol TMN-6), were studied for their effects on the enzymatic hydrolysis of palm fruit bunch (PFB). The PFB was pretreated with a 10% w/v sodium hydroxide solution and then hydrolyzed using the cellulase enzyme from Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 26921) at 50 °C and pH 5. The optimal conditions providing similar yields of reducing sugar required Tween 80 and Tergitol TMN-6 at 0.25% w/v, while Tergitol 15-S-9 was required at 0.1% w/v. All the surfactants improved the enzymatic conversion efficiency and reduced unproductive binding of the enzyme to lignin. In addition, the adsorption isotherm of cellulase was fit well by the Freundlich isotherm, while adsorption of the three nonionic surfactants agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption capacities of the three nonionic surfactants were consistent with their enhancement efficiencies in hydrolysis. The critical micelle concentration was observed as a key property of nonionic surfactant for adsorption capacity.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Molecular Biology"

Live C albicans or normal saline solution (NSS) was administered orally once, followed by 5 days of daily oral antibiotic-mixtures (ATB). Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was then performed to induce sepsis. Fecal Candida was detected by culture only in models with Candida administration. Oral Candida administration with/without ATB enhanced gut-pathogenic bacteria as determined by microbiome analysis. Despite negative candidemia, serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was higher in CLP with Candida preconditioning models than in CLP-controls (NSS-preconditioning) at 6 and/or 18 h post-CLP. Blood bacterial burdens were not increased with Candida administration. Additionally, CLP with high-dose Candida (10 6 colony forming units) induced higher levels of fecal Candida, serum BG, serum IL-6, and mortality than the lowest dose (100 colony forming units). Interestingly, fluconazole attenuated fecal Candida and improved survival in mice with live-Candida administration, but not in the CLP-controls. Heat-killed Candida preparations or their supernatants reduced bone marrow-derived macrophage killing activity in vitro but enhanced cytokine production. In conclusion, intestinal abundance of fungi and/or fungal-molecules was associated with increased bacterial sepsis severity, perhaps through cytokine storm induction and/or decreased macrophage killing activity. These observations suggest that further investigation of the potential role of intestinal fungal burdens in sepsis is warranted.",medical,"Emergency Medicine, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

The influence factors associated with building envelop materials (wall, insulation, window, window-to-wall ratio) were evaluated. The result showed that operation phase contributed a vast majority (>90%) of LCE and LCC. Only 4% emissions saving could be achieved if autoclaved aerated concrete block, cellulose insulation and triple glazing were implemented with WWR of 0.17. The finding suggested that reducing carbon emission should not only be prioritized through use of high energy efficient materials/technologies but should also integrate energy saving measures since energy demand in tropical country is quite high for cooling building. In addition, increasing a possibility and feasibility for supplying renewable energy should be further investigated importunately.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

However, most space complexity reduction techniques for binary field multiplier are applicable for only optimal normal basis or Gaussian normal basis of even type. There are 187 binary fields GF 2k for k from 2 to 1,000 that use odd-type Gaussian normal basis. This paper presents a method to reduce the space complexity of odd-type Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary field GF 2k. The idea is adapted from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis. The result shows that our space complexity reduction method can reduce the number of XOR gates used in the implementation comparing to previous works with a small trade-off in critical path delay.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Hardware and Architecture, Artificial Intelligence"

The objectives of the current study were to estimate and rank the relative effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients. Methods: Randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs for HBV and HIV co-infected patients were searched in health-related databases. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main outcome in this meta-analysis study was the success of treatment by antivirals as determined by virologic response. We performed pairwise and network meta-analysis of these trials and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: Seven randomized trials (329 participants) were included in this network meta-analysis study. A network geometry was formed with six treatment options including four antiviral drugs, adefovir (ADV), emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (LMV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), combination treatment of TDF plus LMV, and placebo. The weighted percentage contributions of each comparison distributed fairly equally in the entire network of evidence. An assumption of consistency required for network meta-analysis was not violated (the global Wald test for inconsistency: Chi2(4) = 3.63, p = 0.46). The results of estimates showed no differences between the treatment regimens in terms of viral response for treating HBV and HIV co-infected patients, which spanned both benefit and harm (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: OR: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.06-2.41). Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low in all comparisons (e.g. LMV vs TDF plus LMV: 218 fewer per 1000,121 more to 602 fewer, very low certainty). Therefore, we remained uncertain to the true ranking of the antiviral treatments in HBV/ HIV co-infected patients. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the evidence is insufficient to provide guidance to the relative effectiveness of currently available antiviral drugs with dual activity in treating co-infection of HBV/HIV. Well-designed, large clinical trials in this field to address other important outcomes from different epidemiological settings are recommended.",medical,Infectious Diseases

By monitoring Twitter streams, we are able to detect emerging topics and understand events around the world. There are some prior attempts that aim to online detect topics on Twitter. However, they can only detect bursty topics by using user-defined keywords a long with simple rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect emerging topics on Twitter streams. To detect emerging topics, a clustering technique has been applied to aggregate a set of keywords. Since an emerging topic occurs continuously, the emerging topics are merged with stateful technique to accumulate topics from different time intervals. To detect both high signal topics and small-medium signal topics, we use statistical features based on average, acceleration, and z-score. Moreover, we propose to include the stock indicator features: Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH). They are common features in trend (oversold and overbought) detection in stock analysis which is similar to our topic detection in twitter. To capture any event patterns, Random Forest (RF) has been proposed as a classifier to detect emerging keywords by utilizing the stated above five features. To evaluate the performance, we created and published a corpus by collecting Twitter data for 10 days with over 80 million tweets and then labeling possible topics in tota1161 events along with related keywords. The experiment was conducted on our collected data. The Fl-results show that our model outperforms all baselines: TwitterMonitor, SigniTrend, and TopicSketch, in terms of detected keywords and topics.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"

The purpose of this study was to establish whether there are ethnic differences and similarities in the stratum corneum (SC) functions of Thai and Chinese infants. Methods: Healthy infants 6 to 24 months of age (N = 60; 30 Thai, 30 Chinese) who resided in Bangkok, Thailand, were enrolled. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and SC hydration (capacitance) on the thigh, buttock, and upper arm were measured. Ceramide content was determined in the SC on the upper arm. Results: SC hydration was not remarkably different between the two ethnicities at any site measured, but TEWL was significantly higher in Chinese infants than in Thai infants at all sites. Hydration of the SC was not significantly correlated with age in either ethnicity. TEWL had significant but weak correlations with age on the thigh and upper arm in Thai infants. Ceramide content was significantly higher in Chinese SC than in Thai SC. No relationship between ceramide content and TEWL or hydration was observed in either ethnicity. Conclusion: The significant differences in TEWL and ceramide contents between Chinese and Thai infant skin could prove useful in designing skin care and diapering products that are best suited for each ethnicity.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologyne response disorders; chronic inflammation, delayed hypersensitivity, contact sensitivity; human studies, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Dermatology"

Interestingly, despite seemingly similar contralateral renal anatomy, a subset of cystinuric patients consistently form stones in only one kidney. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in unilateral vs bilateral cystine stone formers. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of cystinuric patients evaluated and treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1994 and 2015 and categorized patients as either unilateral or bilateral stone formers. Clinical presentation, baseline patient demographics, stone procedures, medical therapy regimens, and long-term renal function were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 42 cystine stone patients (22 female, 20 male) were included in the analysis. The median age at first presentation was 18.5 years and median age at study conclusion was 45.5 years. Two-thirds of patients (n = 28) had a history of bilateral stones, whereas one-third (n = 14) had unilateral stones. Medical therapy regimens were similar between groups. Despite an increased average number of lifetime surgeries (7.5 sessions for bilateral vs 3.7 sessions for unilateral, p < 0.05), there was no significant difference in medians of the most recent glomerular filtration rate when compared with unilateral stone formers (81.5 vs 95 mL/min, respectively; p = 0.28). Conclusions: The majority of cystinuric patients within our cohort form stones bilaterally during their lifetime, and require more surgical interventions than unilateral stone formers. Despite this, overall renal function is well preserved in unilateral and bilateral cystinuric stone formers treated with minimally invasive stone extraction procedures.",medical,Urology

For comparison, the catalytic behavior of cobalt (Co) catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes-silica fiber (CNTs-SF), silica fiber (SF) and porous silica (Q10) was also studied. The characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that the PCNFs-SF was like graphite stacked platelets. Both PCNFs-SF and CNTs-SF composite supports enhanced the dispersion of metallic cobalt to achieve smaller Co2O3 particle sizes and strengthen the metal-support interaction. Consequently, the Co/PCNFs-SF and Co/CNTs-SF composite catalysts afforded a higher ASR catalytic activity and selectivity towards hydrogen production than that of the Co/SF and Co/Q10 catalysts. The presence of the carbon nanostructure in the catalyst composites was also found to improve the long-term stability in ASR. The activity of the Co/PCNFs-SF and Co/CNTs-SF composite catalysts remained stable all times during a 12 h stability test. The strong interaction between metal and support together with the unique structure of PCNFs-SF and CNTs-SF composites could effectively suppress deactivation of the catalysts in ASR.",coastal engineering,"Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The polymers were blended using a single-screw extruder, a twin-screw extruder, and a twin-screw mixer. The onset of flow instability changed depending on the mixing method used, even though their linear viscoelastic properties were almost identical. The mixtures that were subjected to mixing methods with weak mixing capability exhibit sharkskin failure even at low shear stress and low values of the maximum draw ratio without rupture in the molten state. The results suggested that mechanically weak points were present, which led to cohesive failure at the strand surface following abrupt stretching at the die exit (i.e., sharkskin failure). In contrast, the mixture that was subjected to thorough mixing exhibited smooth surface at high shear stress and a large maximum draw ratio.","coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

Materials and methods: The radiation exposure frequency of CP subjects and non-CP controls with and without orthodontic treatment was compared for two-dimensional radiography (intra-oral, panoramic and cephalometric radiography), computed tomography (CT), and cone-beam CT (CBCT) using cumulative radiation dose as an estimate. From this dose estimate, the age- and gender-dependent risk for radiation-induced stochastic effects was calculated for each patient group. Results: CP patients received more radiographic examinations than non-CP controls, with the exception of intra-oral radiographs. The cumulative dose to CP patients was considerably higher (1963 μSv at the age of 20 years) than non-CP patients with (597 μSv) and without (383 μSv) orthodontic treatment, primarily due to the higher frequency of CT scanning. Accordingly, CP patients had a three to five times higher LAR than non-CP patients. Conclusions: This study suggests a significantly higher lifetime radiation exposure to CP patients than non-CP controls from dental radiographic procedures.

"Epos2012 has better specificity compared to idsa2012 for diagnosing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis*,#","Seresirikachorn K., Snidvongs K., Chitsuthipakorn W., Ruksakul W., Chusakul S., Kanjanaumporn J., Aeumjaturapat S.",2018-01-01,"Acute Disease, Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Rhinitis, Sensitivity and Specificity, Sinusitis, Accurac, Bacteria, Sensitivity, Sinusitis, Specificity","Background: Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a subtype of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). To prevent excessive antibiotic prescribing, clinical criteria for diagnosing ABRS are presented in two major international guidelines from European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS2012) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA2012). This study aims to assess accuracy of these criteria. Methodology: Patients with ARS were recruited. Clinical features were collected including discolored nasal discharge, facial pain, fever, double sickening, symptoms persisting longer than 10 days, and elevated serum C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS). Using middle meatal bacterial culture as a reference, accuracy of EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 criteria were analyzed. Results: Eighty-eight patients (age 43.2±14.5 years, 67% female) with ARS were recruited. Using the two criteria for diagnosing ABRS, EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 have sensitivity of 50% (95%CI: 38%-62%) versus 69% (95%CI: 57%-79%), specificity of 63% (95%CI: 43%-79%) versus 46% (95%CI: 28%-65%), and accuracy of 53% versus 63%, respectively. Conclusion: Both EPOS2012 and IDSA2012 had modest accuracy. EPOS2012 had less sensitivity but a better specificity compared to IDSA2012. This suggests that IDSA2012 diagnostic criteria may contribute to inappropriate use of antibiotics due to poorer specificity.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology
The effect of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on modulation of human leukocyte antigen DR in severe sepsis patients,"Srisawat N., Tungsanga S., Lumlertgul N., Komaenthammasophon C., Peerapornratana S., Thamrongsat N., Tiranathanagul K., Praditpornsilpa K., Eiam-Ong S., Tungsanga K., Kellum J.A.",2018-10-26,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Hemoperfusion, HLA-DR Antigens, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Organ Dysfunction Scores, Polymyxin B, Sepsis, Statistics, Nonparametric, Thailand, Immunoparalysis, Polymyxin B hemoperfusion, Severe sepsis/septic shock","Background: Recent randomized trials have not found that polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP) improves outcomes for patients with sepsis. However, it remains unclear whether the therapy could provide benefit for highly selected patients. Monocyte human leukocyte antigen (mHLA-DR) expression, a critical step in the immune response, is decreased during sepsis and leads to worsening sepsis outcomes. One recent study found that PMX-HP increased mHLA-DR expression while another found that the treatment removed HLA-DR-positive cells. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients with blood endotoxin activity assay (EAA) level ≥ 0.6. Patients in the PMX-HP group received a 2-h PMX-HP treatment plus standard treatment for 2 consecutive days. Patients in the non-PMX-HP group received only standard treatment. The primary outcome compared the groups on median change in mHLA-DR expression between day 3 and baseline. Secondary outcomes compared the groups on the mean or median change in CD11b expression, neutrophil chemotaxis, presepsin, cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (CVS SOFA) score, vasopressor dose, and EAA level between day 3 and baseline. We further compared the groups on mortality, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, dialysis dependence status, renal recovery, serum creatinine, vasopressor-free days, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE 28), measured on day 28. Results: Fifty-nine patients were randomized to PMX-HP (n = 29) and non-PMX-HP (n = 30) groups. At baseline, mHLA-DR expression, CD11b, neutrophil chemotaxis, and clinical parameters were comparable between groups. The median change in mHLA-DR expression between day 3 and baseline was higher in PMX-HP patients than in patients receiving standard therapy alone (P = 0.027). The mean change in CD11b between day 3 and baseline was significantly lower in the PMX-HP group than in the non-PMX-HP group (P = 0.002). There were no significant changes from baseline in neutrophil chemotaxis, presepsin, CVS SOFA scores, vasopressor doses, or EAA level between groups. On day 28 after enrollment, mortality, ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, dialysis dependence status, renal recovery, serum creatinine, vasopressor-free days, and MAKE 28 were comparable between groups. Conclusion: PMX-HP improved mHLA-DR expression in severe sepsis patients. Future studies should examine the potential benefit of PMX-HP in patients with low mHLA-DR expression.

Landfill approach is generally decided for handling most of municipal solid waste, resulting the impacts of environment especially land occupation and global warming. As commercial building plays an importance role not only for economic value but also for environmental aspects, a supermarket located in community mall was selected as a case study towards sustainable cities. This study was aimed to investigate the current MSW management system of supermarket in order to quantify its environmental performance and to propose suitable options for improving municipal solid waste management. The findings revealed that at the business-Asusual, 397 tCO2e was emitted annually from landfilling waste of a supermarket in Thailand. However, if waste management has improved by recycling plus bio-gasification approach, not only 374 tCO2e/year will not be emitted from landfilling, but 243 tCO2e/year also be reduced due to the activities in relevant to recycling and bio-gasification process. Moreover, applying such approach provides benefit in economic term about 18,321 USD a year. The results of this study could inspire another commercial buildings or others sector to adopting waste management practices together for creating a network of sustainable cities through suitable waste management system.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Natural regulatory IgM-mediated autoimmune responses directed against malondialdehyde regulate oxidative and nitrosative pathways and coupled with IgM responses to nitroso adducts attenuate depressive and physiosomatic symptoms at the end of term pregnancy,"Roomruangwong C., Barbosa D.S., de Farias C.C., Matsumoto A.K., Baltus T.H.L., Morelli N.R., Kanchanatawan B., Duleu S., Geffard M., Maes M.",2018-02-01,"Adult, Autoimmunity, Depression, DNA Adducts, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulin M, Inflammation, Malondialdehyde, Medically Unexplained Symptoms, Nitrosative Stress, Oxidative Stress, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Young Adult, depression, immune, inflammation, natural autoimmunity, perinatal","Aim: We aimed to delineate the effects of immunoglobulin (Ig)M-mediated autoimmune responses directed against malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitroso (SNO) adducts on nitro-oxidative stress and depressive and physiosomatic symptoms (DPSS) at the end of term. Methods: IgM responses to MDA, NO (nitroso) adducts formed by nitrosylation, and NO2 tyrosine formed by nitration were measured as well as hydroperoxides (ferrous oxidation xylenol orange), advanced protein oxidation products (AOPP), and NO metabolite (NOx) levels in women at the end of term pregnancy and in normal controls. Results: IgM responses to MDA were significantly and inversely associated with AOPP, ferrous oxidation xylenol orange, and NOx and DPSS. IgM responses to NO adducts were significantly and inversely associated with DPSS and positively with NOx levels. There were significant associations between IgM responses to MDA, NO adducts, and NO2 tyrosine. The DPSS score was predicted by AOPP and a lifetime history of premenstrual syndrome (both positively) and IgM responses to NO adducts (inversely). Furthermore, 71.8% of the variance in the index of nitro-oxidative stress was explained by lowered IgM responses to MDA, antioxidant levels (zinc, total radical trapping parameter), and inflammatory mediators. Conclusion: Lowered levels of IgM responses to MDA during pregnancy are accompanied by a reduced regulation of nitro-oxidative processes thereby explaining increased oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers in association with DPSS. IgM responses to NO adducts, which reflect nitrosylation as a consequence of increased NO production, regulate DPSS symptoms at the end of term and are a trait marker of major depression. IgM responses to MDA are a key part of the compensatory anti-inflammatory responses system.","neuroscience, medical","Neuroscience (all), Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Rice straw contains high potassium and other components which may lower ash melting point causing bed agglomeration. This study focused on the effect of alumina and silica ratio of bed materials in fluidized bed gasifier. The ratio of alumina bed was 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0. The experiments were performed at 700, 800 and 900°C with equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.2. Rice straw size 425-850 μm was used as raw materials. The result showed that the high ratio of alumina deceased bed agglomeration at 700°C. However, similar alumina ratio increased bed agglomeration at 800 and 900°C. In addition, the effect of temperature on defluidization time was significant. As the operating temperature increased, the defluidization time decreased. Although the ratio of the bed material was different but the result of defluidization time show a similar trend. As a result, high operating temperature may not suitable for fluidized bed gasification with this particular biomass. The SEM/EDS analyzed showed that potassium, calcium and silicate are major element in a linkage between bed particles. As a result, 75% of alumina bed ratio at 700°C was sufficient to avoid bed agglomeration during fluidized bed gasification of rice straw. In conclusion, specific ratio of alumina and silica can prevent agglomeration in fluidized bed gasification of rice straw when operating temperature lower than apparent eutectic melting point of involved alkalis from rice straw. The result from this investigation may lead to options on mitigating the problem of bed agglomeration in fluidized bed gasifier of rice straw.","process equipment, energy","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

We present the optimization to the search problem under a group containing row symmetry subgroups mainly relies on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instances can be reduced to minimal assignment problems.

Excluding the most heavily obscured sources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z ≃ 2.5 star-forming galaxies in the mass range 9.25 ≤ log(M*/M⊙) ≤ 10.75 are fully consistent with the IRX-β relation expected for a relatively grey attenuation curve, similar to the commonly adopted Calzetti law. Based on a large, mass-complete sample of 2 ≤ z ≤ 3 star-forming galaxies drawn frommultiple surveys, we proceed to derive a new empirical relationship between β and stellar mass, making it possible to predict UV attenuation (A1600) and IRX as a function of stellar mass, for any assumed attenuation law. Once again, we find that z ≃ 2.5 star-forming galaxies follow A1600-M* and IRX-M* relations consistent with a relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that star-forming galaxies at this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve. In fact, we use a simple simulation to demonstrate that previous determinations of the IRX-β relation may have been biased towards low values of IRX at red values of β, mimicking the signature expected for an SMC-like dust law. We show that this provides a plausible mechanism for reconciling apparently contradictory results in the literature and that, based on typical measurement uncertainties, stellar mass provides a cleaner prediction of UV attenuation than β. Although the situation at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2 < z < 3 star-forming galaxies with log(M*/M⊙) ≥ 9.75, both the IRX-β and IRX-M* relations are well described by a Calzetti-like attenuation law.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Hydrogen is regarded as the right energy carrier to meet future conditions, and hence, developing hydrogen economy is intensively investigated for its great electrocatalytic property. However, it is blocked as an electrocatalyst due to its poor conductivity and electrochemical activity. Therefore, to conquer such shortcomings, changing the nanostructure and increasing active sites are studied.

They offer a place where social media users can post information, express opinions, and share interests. However, some information and opinions may cause a negative impact on the person mentioned in the post and that person can become a target of defamation. In Thailand, although defaming someone on social media is illegal, most social media users are not aware of it. To raise awareness of this issue, this paper proposes the classification of defamatory text in Thai language. Several approaches to text classification are used to analyze textual comments to political news and articles on Facebook, including word n-grams, character ngrams, specific terms, grammatical dependency structure, and sentiment polarity. The experiment is conducted using two machine learning methods with several combination of the approaches. The result shows that SVM performed better than Naïve Bayes, and word n-grams and character n-grams are more efficient than other approaches with F score of 0.64 and accuracy of 0.74. In addition, dependency structure, specific terms, and sentiment polarity perform quite well with precision of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.66, but with lower recall rate of 0.35.

Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations.

Recently, aberrant CD20 expression has been described in a small series of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). We aimed to evaluate CD20 immunoexpression and to perform clinicopathologic correlation in a large set of thyroid tumors, including a cohort of high-grade thyroid cancer. A total of 625 cases of thyroid tumor comprised tissue microarrays of 538 PTCs and 47 follicular adenomas, and whole-slide sections of 40 aggressive thyroid carcinomas (10 radioiodine-refractory PTCs and 8 poorly differentiated, 5 anaplastic, and 17 medullary thyroid carcinomas) were immunostained with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. BRAFV600E mutation was tested by direct sequencing in 478 cancers. Our study found that a small subset of PTCs (<10%, mainly of classic variant) exhibited aberrant membranous expression of CD20. These tumors displayed less aggressive histological features and had a lower prevalence of BRAFV600E mutation. We also discovered that CD20 expression was maintained in 6%-20% of aggressive thyroid cancers but not observed in follicular adenomas. All CD20-positive tumor cells were negative for CD79a and PAX5. Aberrant expression of CD20 by thyroid cancer cells may present a diagnostic pitfall in cytologic evaluation of thyroid and cervical masses.

We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface density of star formation in z ∼ 2 galaxies and study the different physical properties between galaxies within and above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. Methods. We use ALMA images at 870 µm with 0.2 arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. Results. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of ∼150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these “starbursts hidden in the main sequence” also exist below 1011 M. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Then, Al2O3 nanoparticles were employed to improve cure, mechanical, and thermal properties of maleated natural rubber (MNR) nanocomposites. The MNR nanocomposite with 2 phr nano Al2O3 exhibited excellent value of cure rate index and exceptionally high value of mechanical properties like modulus and tensile strength in comparison to unfilled MNR compound. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that nano Al2O3 was able to improve the thermal stability of MNR composites to some extent. Additionally, the present study revealed that the interfacial interaction between MNR and nano Al2O3 was far better than that between NR and nano Al2O3 as confirmed from crosslinking degree measurement and morphological analysis. The present article offers a fresh approach to prepare high performance nano Al2O3-based MNR compounds for future industrial application. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Electrochemical performance assessment of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell with YSZ-based and SDC-based electrolytes,"Saebea D., Authayanun S., Patcharavorachot Y., Chatrattanawet N., Arpornwichanop A.",2018-01-01,"Electrochemical performance, Low temperature solid oxide fuel cells, Low temperatures, Over potential, Performance analysis, Samaria doped cerias (SDC), Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), Yttria-stabilized zirconias (YSZ), Low temperature, Overpotentials, Performance analysis, SDC-based electrolyte, SOFC, YSZ-based electrolyte","In this work, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) based on different electrolytes, i.e., the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and the samaria-doped ceria (SDC), were investigated to study their performances at low-temperature operation. The predicted performance of both SOFCs was validated with the experimental results. The verified models were implemented to study the impact of operating conditions, i.e., cell temperature, pressure, thicknesses of cathode, anode, and electrolyte, on their performances. The decrease in the operating temperature from intermediate range (800–900 °C) to low range (550–650 °C) has a considerable effect on the performance of the YSZ-based SOFC as conventional type, which dropped from 0.67–1.40 W/cm2 to 0.027–0.13 W/cm2. Under the low operating temperature range, the performance of SDC-based SOFC was superior to that of the YSZ-based SOFC, due to the lower ohmic loss. Nevertheless, the SDC-based SOFC has higher concentration overpotentials than the YSZ-based SOFC. The concentration overpotentials of the SDC-based SOFC can be reduced by the thinner anode and cathode thicknesses. In addition, the SDC-based SOFC at low operating temperature with the pressurized operation could significantly improve its power density, about 20% at 2 bar, which was close to that of YSZ-based SOFC at intermediate temperature of 800 °C.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

(2) To compare the genotoxic differences between GIC and two modified cements. Methods: TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC were prepared by adding 10% w/w of TiO2NPs and TiO2MPs to the GIC powder and hand-mixed followed the manufacturer instruction. Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) was used as a culture medium for HGFs and eluate preparation. Eluates from all groups were collected for XTT cell viability assay to obtain EC50 values. γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) of HGFs. Results: EC50 values were from 38% to 60% and eluate concentrations at 20% and 5% were selected for γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay. At both concentrations, HGFs exposed to eluates from all cements groups had fewer mean foci per cell and higher percentage of free foci cells than H2O2 (p < 0.05). At 20% concentration, cells exposed to eluates from both TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC groups had fewer mean foci per cell and higher percentage of free foci cell than GIC and culture medium (p < 0.05). Significance: Neither GIC nor 10% TiO2-modified GICs had a genotoxic effect on HGFs. Both TiO2NPsGIC and TiO2MPsGIC demonstrated less genotoxic effect than GIC. When comparing between the two modified cements, there was no genotoxic difference between the modified cements from different particle sizes (nanoparticle and micro-particle) of TiO2.","Materials Science, dentistry, engineering","Materials Science (all), Dentistry (all), Mechanics of Materials"
Using a Distributed Roadside Unit for the Data Dissemination Protocol in VANET with the Named Data Architecture,"Tiennoy S., Saivichit C.",2018-05-23,"Data dissemination protocols, Intelligent transport systems, Intermittent connections, Multihop wireless network, Named data networkings, Named Data Networks (NDN), Roadside units, TCP/IP implementation, intelligent transport system (ITS), named data network (NDN), vehicle to roadside unit (V2R), Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)","Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has recently become one of the highly active research areas for wireless networking. Since VANET is a multi-hop wireless network with very high mobility and intermittent connection lifetime, it is important to effectively handle the data dissemination issue in this rapidly changing environment. However, the existing TCP/IP implementation may not fit into such a highly dynamic environment because the nodes in the network must often perform rerouting due to their inconsistency of connectivity. In addition, the drivers in the vehicles may want to acquire some data, but they do not know the address/location of such data storage. Hence, the named data networking (NDN) approach may be more desirable here. The NDN architecture is proposed for the future Internet, which focuses on the delivering mechanism based on the message contents instead of relying on the host addresses of the data. In this paper, a new protocol named roadside unit (RSU) assisted of named data network (RA-NDN) is presented. The RSU can operate as a standalone node [standalone RSU (SA-RSU)]. One benefit of deploying SA-RSUs is the improved network connectivity. This study uses the NS3 and SUMO software packages for the network simulator and traffic simulator software, respectively, to verify the performance of the RA-NDN protocol. To reduce the latency under various vehicular densities, vehicular transmission ranges, and number of requesters, the proposed approach is compared with vehicular NDN via a real-world data set in the urban area of Sathorn road in Bangkok, Thailand. The simulation results show that the RA-NDN protocol improves the performance of ad hoc communications with the increase in data received ratio and throughput and the decrease in total dissemination time and traffic load.","computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The duck feed, soil, and rice samples were lower than the standard limit for aflatoxins at 20 ng g−1. The highest levels of aflatoxin were detected in the liver, intestine, and egg yolk; these were 3.04, 1.73, and 4.56 ng g−1 respectively, while the average levels were 1.6 ± 0.73, 1.31 ± 0.23, and 1.87 ± 0.99 ng g−1, respectively. Interestingly, aflatoxin was not detected in any of the egg white albumin samples (90/90 samples), whereas aflatoxin contamination was predominantly found in the yolk. Additionally, the means and standard deviations of Pb and Cd found in the duck eggs were 118.61 ± 22.25 and 13.84 ± 9.06 ng g−1 respectively.

The maximum levels of Pb and Cd in the duck liver tissues were 606.16 and 22,946.20 ng g−1, which was higher than those in the eggs. Pb contamination in the water from rice paddy fields after grazing was significantly higher than that in water samples taken before grazing. This is the first report of Pb and Cd contamination in blood, egg, and liver samples of free grazing ducks in Thailand.","medical, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical), Inorganic Chemistry"
Basic fibroblast growth factor regulates phosphate/pyrophosphate regulatory genes in stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth,"Nowwarote N., Sukarawan W., Pavasant P., Foster B.L., Osathanon T.",2018-12-10,"Alkaline Phosphatase, Calcification, Physiologic, Cell Separation, Diphosphates, Fibroblast Growth Factor 2, Gene Expression Regulation, Humans, Odontogenesis, Osteogenesis, Phosphate Transport Proteins, Phosphates, Stem Cells, Tooth Exfoliation, Tooth, Deciduous, Basic fibroblast growth factor, Phosphate, Pyrophosphate, Stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth","Background: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulates maintenance of stemness and modulation of osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization in stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs). Mineralization in the bones and teeth is in part controlled by pericellular levels of inorganic phosphate (P i ), a component of hydroxyapatite, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PP i ), an inhibitor of mineralization. The progressive ankylosis protein (gene ANKH; protein ANKH) and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1/ENPP1) increase PP i and inhibit mineralization, while tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALPL; TNAP) is a critical pro-mineralization enzyme that hydrolyzes PP i . We hypothesized that regulation by bFGF of mineralization in SHEDs occurs by modulation of P i /PP i -associated genes. Methods: Cells were isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth and characterized for mesenchymal stem cell characteristics. Cells were treated with bFGF, and the osteogenic differentiation ability was determined. The mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The mineralization was examined using alizarin red S staining. Results: Cells isolated from primary teeth expressed mesenchymal stem cell markers, CD44, CD90, and CD105, and were able to differentiate into osteo/odontogenic and adipogenic lineages. Addition of 10 ng/ml bFGF to SHEDs during in vitro osteo/odontogenic differentiation decreased ALPL mRNA expression and ALP enzyme activity, increased ANKH mRNA, and decreased both P i /PP i ratio and mineral deposition. Effects of bFGF on ALPL and ANKH expression were detected within 24 h. Addition of 20 mM fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402 revealed the necessity of FGFR-mediated signaling, and inclusion of 1 μg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) implicated the necessity of protein synthesis for effects on ALPL and ANKH. Addition of exogenous 10 μm PP i inhibited mineralization and increased ANKH, collagen type 1a1 (COL1A1), and osteopontin (SPP1) mRNA, while addition of exogenous P i increased mineralization and osterix (OSX), ANKH, SPP1, and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) mRNA. The effects of PP i and P i on mineralization could be replicated by short-term 3- and 7-day treatments, suggesting signaling effects in addition to physicochemical regulation of mineral deposition. Conclusion: This study reveals for the first time the effects of bFGF on P i /PP i regulators in SHEDs and implicates these factors in how bFGF directs osteo/odontogenic differentiation and mineralization by these cells.","medical, biochemistryistry","Medicine (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous), Cell Biology"

Herein, we demonstrate Cu(II)-based supramolecular approach for unraveling the formation process of pathogenic αSyn fibrils and its application in a neurotoxic mechanism study. The conformation of αSyn monomer was strained by macrochelation with Cu(II), thereby disrupting the fibril elongation while promoting its nucleation. This non-canonical process formed shortened, β-sheet enriched αSyn fibrils (<0.2 μm) that were rapidly transmitted and accumulated to neuronal cells, causing neuronal cell death, in sharp contrast to typical αSyn fibrils (ca. 1 μm). Our approach provided the supramolecular basis for the formation of pathogenic fibrils through physiological factors, such as brain Cu(II).","genergyal, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

We draw on cognitive appraisal theory to suggest that individual's appraisals of and responses to negative acts at work will moderate the impact of said acts on wellbeing and performance outcomes. In a large study (N = 3,217) in Southeast Asia, we examine moderators in the form of (a) the extent to which individuals identify themselves as being bullied and (b) the coping strategies that individuals use to deal with negative acts. We find that these factors do moderate the impact of experiencing negative acts, in particular work-related negative acts. When individuals are subject to work-related negative acts but do not see themselves as being bullied they report higher levels of performance than those who do identify themselves as being bullied. Problemfocused coping was found to be effective for those sometimes targeted, but for persistent targets was detrimental to wellbeing.

Preferences toward organ donation are vital to raise the organ donation rate. Notably, the area people live in can address the social influence on individual preference toward organ donation. Research Questions: This article studies the impact of the neighbor effect on organ donation decisions, addressing the social influence of urbanization on preferences. How neighborhoodspecific variables, population density, and socioeconomic status drive the neighbor effect is investigated. The pursuit of organ donor traits is to be answered. Design: The study uses organ donation interview survey data and neighborhood-specific data from Thailand to estimate a series of logistic regression models. Results: Individuals residing in urban areas exhibit a greater likelihood to sign the donor card than those in rural areas. The neighborhood socioeconomic status is the key driver. An individual is more willing to be an organ donor when having neighbors with higher socioeconomic statuses. Results also reveal positive influences of males and education on the organ donation rate. Discussion: This article documents the “neighbor effect” on the organ donation decision via living area type, offering an alternative exposition in raising the organ donation rate. In shifting the society norm toward organ donation consent, policy-makers should acknowledge the benefit of urbanization on organ donation decision derived from resourceful urban areas. Moreover, raising education levels does improve not only citizens’ well-being but also their tendency to exhibit an altruistic act toward others.",medical,Transplantation

Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (IV STS) can prevent and delay the vascular calcification progression in uremic states; however, the STS effect on AS has not been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the STS efficacy on vascular calcification and AS in HD patients. Methods: Fifty HD patients with abnormal AS, as measured via the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI ≥8), were prospectively randomized to open-label 12.5 g IV STS during the last HD hour twice weekly for 6 months (n = 24) or the usual care (control group; n = 26). Patients and treating physicians were not blinded. The CAVI, coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, hemodynamics, and biochemical parameters were measured at the baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Results: All the baseline parameters were comparable. The IV STS significantly reduced the CAVI when compared to the control group (mean CAVI difference = -0.53; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.06; p = 0.03). A significant CAVI improvement was seen in those patients without diabetes mellitus. The natural logarithm of the CAC volume score was significantly increased in the control group. The high sensitivity C-reactive protein level was slightly lowered in the IV STS group (not significant). Conclusion: The intradialytic STS treatment significantly reduced the AS, as measured by the CAVI, and stabilized the vascular calcification in the HD patients. STS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for delaying and treating the structural and functional vascular wall abnormalities in HD patients.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; kidney, biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Nephrology, Urology, Physiology (medical)"

Unfortunately, in the case of fine TiO2 power, filtration of the powder after water treatment process is difficult. In this research, coating or immobilizing the TiO2 powder on substrates using as the materials for removing the color of lignin is interesting. The objectives of this research are to prepare the floating porous cylindrical tube substrates composed of zeolite NaA and ball clay, and then to determine the efficiency of lignin degradation. Zeolite NaA powder, Suratthani ball clay and organic binder solution were mixed before extruding and cutting to be 1.5 cm diameter cylindrical tube with 2.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in thickness. After that, the dried tubes were fired at 650 - 800 °C for 2 hours and were then coated with TiO2-P25 suspension before re-firing at 600 °C for 1 hour in an electrical furnace. The fired uncoated tubes were characterized in terms of phase composition, porosity and radial crush strength. From the XRD pattern of the tubes fired at 800 °C showed that the zeolite NaA phase was disappeared. On the other hand, the zeolite NaA phase was found in the samples fired at another lower temperature. For the coated tubes, polyurethane foam was filled into the hollow to make the tubes can be floated on the surface of water. After that, the photocatalyst degradation property by determining the decreasing of concentration of lignin solution under tungsten lamp irradiation of the floated tubes were tested.","process equipment, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In general, the iIL phases provide comparable retention times to their corresponding conventional columns, with only minor selectivity differences. The average tailing factors and peak widths were noticeably improved (reduced) for IL60i and IL76i, while they were slightly improved for IL111i. Inert IL phase columns were coupled with conventional IL columns in comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC × GC) with a solid-state modulator which offers variable modulation temperature (TM), programmable TM during analysis and trapping stationary phase material during the trap/release (modulation) process, independent of oven T and column sets. Although IL phases are classified as polar, relative polarity of the two phases comprising individual GC × GC column sets permits combination of less-polar IL/polar IL and polar IL/less-polar IL column sets; it was observed that a polar/less-polar column set provided better separation of FAME. A higher first dimension (1D) phase polarity combined with a lower 2D phase polarity, for instance 1D IL111i with 2D IL59 gave the best result; the greater difference in 1D/2D phase polarity results in increasing occupancy of peak area in the 2D space. The IL111i/IL59 column set was selected for analysis of fatty acids in fat and oil products (butter, margarine, fish oil and canola oil). Compared with the conventional IL111, IL111i showed reduced column bleed which makes this more suited to GC × GC analysis of FAME. The proposed method offers a fast profiling approach with good repeatability of analysis of FAME.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry"

Due to its non-biodegradability and persistence, recycling processes have become one of the sustainable solutions for preventing environmental deterioration. Plastic wastes, including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were collected from industrial sector and used as additional ingredients to improve concrete properties. Prior to concrete processing, an increase in wettability of plastic fibers using nonionic surfactant, Dehydol LS-12, was investigated. At the optimal concentration of 10 times of the critical micelle concentration (CMC), an interfacial tension and a contact angle were reduced to 31-32 mN/m and 65°-68°, respectively. Properties of concrete were determined and compared to those of the mortar samples. Porosity was found to increase with higher volume fraction of plastic fibers, whereas decreases in workability, bulk density, thermal conductivity, splitting tensile strength, and compressive strength were encountered. The lowest thermal conductivity was recorded for concrete samples prepared with 30% by volume of LDPE fibers, and the rest in descending order were HDPE, PP, and PET, respectively. Furthermore, the maximal inclusions of plastic fibers were 5% for HDPE and LDPE, 10% for PP, and 50% for PET so as to satisfy the precast concrete wall requirements.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

OCTA is the non-invasive in vivo imaging of the vasculature located within the retina and optic nerve head area. The principle of OCTA is to use the variations in OCT signals caused by moving particles as the contrast mechanism for imaging of flow. Several algorithms which aim to maximize the contrast signal and minimize the noise have been developed including the phase-based techniques, intensity-based techniques (e.g., split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA)), and complex-based techniques (e.g., optical microangiography (OMAG)). With its reliable technique, high image resolution, and current availability, OCTA has been widely used in the assessment of posterior segment diseases including glaucoma in which ocular perfusion dysfunction has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism.Conclusion: OCTA may enhance our knowledge of glaucoma pathogenesis and offer an improvement in our ability to detect glaucomatous change.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Early Life Trauma Predicts Affective Phenomenology and the Effects are Partly Mediated by Staging Coupled with Lowered Lipid-Associated Antioxidant Defences,"Maes M., Congio A., Moraes J.B., Bonifacio K.L., Barbosa D.S., Vargas H.O., Morris G., Puri B.K., Michelin A.P., Nunes S.O.V.",2018-01-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Biomarkers, Case-Control Studies, Child, Child Abuse, Female, Humans, Male, Memory, Middle Aged, Mood Disorders, Oxidative Stress, Psychological Trauma, bipolar disorder, depression, immune, inflammation, nitrosative stress, oxidative","Early life trauma (ELT) may drive mood disorder phenomenology, nitro-oxidative pathways and impairments in semantic memory. There are no data regarding the impact of ELT on affective phenomenology and whether these pathways are mediated by staging or lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defences. This study examined healthy controls (n=54) and patients with affective disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders (n=118). ELT was assessed using the Child Trauma Questionnaire. In addition, we measured affective phenomenology and assayed advanced oxidation protein products; malondialdehyde, paraoxonase 1 (CMPAase) activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. ELT was associated into with increased risk for mood and comorbid anxiety disorders and a more severe phenomenology, including staging characteristics, depression and anxiety severity, suicidal behaviours, type of treatments, disabilities, body mass index, smoking behaviour and hsCRP, as well as lowered health-related quality of life, antioxidant defences and semantic memory. The number of mood episodes and CMPAase/HDL-cholesterol levels could be reliably combined into a new vulnerability staging-biomarker index, which mediates in part the effects of ELT on affective phenomenology and oxidative stress. Moreover, the effects of female sex on mood disorders and affective phenomenology are mediated by ELT. The cumulative effects of different ELT drive many aspects of affective phenomenology either directly or indirectly through effects of staging and/or lipid-associated antioxidant defences. The results show that children, especially girls, with ELT are at great risk to develop mood disorders and more severe phenotypes of affective disorders.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class. To overcome this problem, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was adopted and also combined with chi-square based feature selection technique. Varieties of feature sizes based on various classifier algorithms were compared. In the appropriate feature size, SMOTE could improve the classification performance in terms of recall and F1 score.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

In this study, the physicochemical properties of starches isolated from seed kernels of three Thai mango cultivars (Namdokmai, Kaew, and Chokanan), mainly used in the industry, were characterized and compared with those of other commercial starches namely tapioca, corn, low-, and high-amylose rice. MSK starches possessed a smooth-oval shape granule with average diameter of 12.90–13.20 µm. They were higher in lipid (0.53–0.55%) and amylose (31.50–33.12%) than other starches. Amylopectin and amylose of MSK starches had a relatively low molecular weight. Amylopectin of MSK starches had higher proportion of B1 and B2 chains but lower proportion of A chain than those of other starches. These chemical properties contributed to changes in value of following properties of MSK starches: higher crystallinity (40.20–41.30%), higher gelatinization temperature (78.13–82.39 °C) and enthalpy (17.32–19.45 J/g), higher pasting temperature (81.6–84.4 °C) and peak viscosity (356.2–423.8 rapid viscoanalyzer units). Amylopectin of MSK starches also retrograded to a higher extent than that of other starches. Based on their physicochemical properties, MSK starches; especially Kaew cultivar, could be a potential source of resistant starch; particularly of RS2.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering, engineering","Food Science, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The mouse astrocyte cells (C8-D1A) were treated with APAP at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h, 16 and 28 days. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-kB were determined using western blot analysis. Furthermore, the expression and localization of phosphorylation of NF-kB were detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis. The ultrastructure of C8-D1A cells was as well monitored. The results revealed that acute APAP treatment (24 h) had no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pNF-kB. This treatment did not alter the ultrastructure of C8-D1A cells when compared with those in the control cells. However, the results obtained from the study on chronic APAP-treated cells (16 and 28 days) showed the different effect of APAP treatment. The results obtained from western blot analysis showed the increment of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β and TNF-α) expressions and the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway. Nuclear translocation of pNF-kB and alteration of several cell structures were well observed in the C8-D1A cells with chronic APAP treatment. The results obtained from this study suggest that chronic APAP treatment can induce an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) in astrocytes. This alteration implies the involvement of the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

This area of inquiry has not been fully investigated in the literature. Background: Employee turnover, particularly of professionals, becomes a very challenging issue. It continually affects organizations in terms of resourcing and developmental costs, manpower instability, day-to-day operations, perception of quality care and efficiency. Therefore, employees' working attitude and behaviour have drawn increasing attention for further research to determine which factors keep them with their employer. Design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with self-report questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected from 1,966 nurses from sixteen private general hospitals in Thailand during February–June 2016. Hypotheses were tested and analysed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modelling and a bootstrapping procedure. Results: The results revealed the direct relationship between leader-member exchange quality and job embeddedness. Organizational identification played an intermediary role that partially mediated the relationship between leader-member exchange quality on job embeddedness. Analysis also provided support for the mediating effect of organizational identification and turnover intention through job embeddedness. Conclusion: This study extends the job embeddedness theory and gains understanding of the antecedent factors that directly and indirectly cause employees to become embedded and lead to predict turnover intention. The findings are pertinent, as few studies have investigated such relationships. The implications provide insights into how organizations can better retain their workforce.",Nursing,Nursing (all)

The devices are composed of 30-layer stacks of InAs quantum dot by using strain compensation method. The lateral size and height of QD are 30 nm and 4 nm, respectively. Our QD SOAs have emission wavelengths within 1.5 μm-band. We applied RTA process to improve the characteristics of internal quantum efficiency (i) and optical loss (αi) of ridge laser diode for QD SOAs. In this case, the operating temperatures of RTA process were set at 600°C, 620°C, 640°C and 660°C for 30 seconds each. In addition, the devices are cleaved to form a cavity length at 0.06 cm, 0.08 cm, 0.10 cm, 0.12 cm and 0.14 cm. According to the L-I characteristic result of ridge laser diode structure for QD SOAs at 640°C, the best minimum threshold current (Ith) is 47.93 mA. Moreover, according to the plot between 1 ηd-1 (external quantum efficiency) and cavity length, we can optimize the internal quantum efficiency and optical loss for a ridge laser diode structure to be 66.39% and 9.87 cm-1 respectively at 640°C RTA's temperature. Finally, The RTA process helps to achieve 1.4 times higher in internal quantum efficiency as well as a minimal increase in internal optical loss comparing to without RTA.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, computer science, Mathematics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Monohydric alcohols having carbon chain length from C1 to C4 and polyhydric alcohols with the number of mono- to tri- hydroxyl groups were used as the enhancers which are effective for rapid gelation. The addition of monohydric alcohol distinctively reduced the gelation time, comparing to the polyhydric alcohol. The gelation process is directly dependent on the polarity of alcohol and hydrophobicity. The alcohol mediated gelation imparts strong viscoelastic property and enhanced compressive modulus of resulting hydrogels. This is due to the effective formation of self-assembled beta sheet network of the silk fibroin chains facilitates the gelation process.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Hence the aim of present study is to determine metabolic derangement that occurred in subjects suffering from hepatitis B patients. Methods: The fasting blood samples were collected from hepatitis B patients (n = 50) attended in Taluka hospital TandoAdam, Sindh with age and gender matched controls (n = 50). Serum lipid profile and fatty acid (FA) composition were analyzed by micro-lab and gas chromatography. Results: The hepatitis B patients have significantly lower level (p < 0.01) of lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triacylglyceride (TAG), high density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and total lipid (TL) in comparison to controls, indicating hypolipidemia in patients. The result of total FA composition of HBV patients in comparison to controls reveal that myristic, palmitic, docosahexaenoic acids were significantly (p < 0.05) higher, while linoleic, eicosatrienoic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic acids were lower in HBV patients in comparison to controls. The elongase, Δ5 and Δ6-desaturase enzymes activities were found lower, while Δ9-desaturase activity was higher in hepatitis B patients as compared to controls, which indicates the impaired lipid metabolism. Conclusion: The serum saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) were increased while polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was reduced in both total and free form in hepatitis B patients due to altered activities of enzyme desaturases with impaired PUFA metabolism and non-enzymatic oxidation.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

The implication of the proPO system in antiviral response and the suppression of host proPO activation by the viral protein have previously been demonstrated in shrimp. However, the molecular mechanism of viral-host interactions in the proPO cascade remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the viral protein, namely, WSSV164, which was initially identified from the forward suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library of the PmproPO1/2 co-silenced black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon that was challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, WSSV164 was found to interact with the PmproPO2 protein. The subsequent validation assay by co-immunoprecipitation revealed that WSSV164 directly bound to both PmproPO1 and PmproPO2. The gene silencing experiment was carried out to explore the role of WSSV164 in the control of the proPO pathway in shrimp, and the results showed that suppression of WSSV164 can restore PO activity in WSSV-infected shrimp hemolymph. The recombinant proteins of PmproPO1 and PmproPO2 were produced in Sf-9 cells and were shown to be successfully activated by exogenous trypsin and endogenous serine proteinases from shrimp hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS), yielding PO activity in vitro. Moreover, the activated PO activity in shrimp HLS was dose-dependently reduced by the recombinant WSSV164 protein, suggesting that WSSV164 may interfere with the activation of the proPO system in shrimp. Taken together, these results suggest an alternative infection route of WSSV through the encoded viral protein WSSV164 that binds to the PmproPO1 and PmproPO2 proteins, interfering with the activation of the melanization cascade in shrimp.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

The Thai Department of Livestock Development (DLD) established a nationwide surveillance system for brucellosis in goats and sheep in 1997. Using data from this surveillance system, we describe the seroprevalence of brucellosis from 2013 to 2015 in small ruminants and the spatial distribution of the disease throughout Thailand. Surveillance data collected included the number of animals and herds tested, the province of the animal and herd and the laboratory results. Seroprevalence was estimated at both the animal and herd levels. During the 3-year period, 443,561 goats and sheep were tested for brucellosis by the DLD throughout Thailand using the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for Brucella. Among the 3 years, 2013 had the highest proportion of herds that tested positive for brucellosis at 13.80% (95% CI, 12.52, 15.16). Overall, this study found that brucellosis seroprevalence in small ruminants is decreasing throughout Thailand. However, there is variability in the spread of the disease with provinces in the eastern and western regions of Thailand having higher proportions of animals and herds testing positive. Overall provinces in the south had the lowest proportion of animals and herds testing positive for brucellosis. Periodic review of surveillance data documents the impact of the current brucellosis control programme and supports a targeted response in higher prevalence regions when there are limited financial resources for control measures.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

An increasing electromechanical window is a predictive marker of ventricular fibrillation in anesthetized rabbit with ischemic heart,"Limprasutr V., Pirintr P., Kijtawornrat A., Hamlin R.L.",2018-01-01,"Anesthesia, Animals, Biomarkers, Coronary Vessels, Disease Models, Animal, Electrocardiography, Female, Ligation, Male, Myocardial Ischemia, Predictive Value of Tests, Rabbits, Sensitivity and Specificity, Ventricular Fibrillation, Electromechanical window, LAD ligation, Rabbits, STVQT, Ventricular fibrillation","The QTc interval is widely used in Safety Pharmacological studies to predict arrhythmia risk, and the electromechanical window (EMW) and short-term variability of QT intervals (STVQT) have been studied as new biomarkers for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (TdP). However, the use of EMW and STVQT to predict ventricular fibrillation (VF) has not been elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate EMW and STVQT to predict VF in anesthetized rabbit model of VF. VF was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending and a descending branch of the left circumflex coronary arteries in a sample population of rabbits (n=18). VF was developed 55.6% (10/18). In rabbit with VF, the EMW was significantly higher than in rabbits without VF (96.3 ± 15.6 ms and 49.5 ± 5.6 ms, respectively, P<0.05). STVQT had significantly increased before the onset of VF in rabbits that experienced VF, but not in rabbits that did not experience VF (11.7 ± 1.8 ms and 3.7 ± 0.4 ms, respectively, P<0.05). The EMW and STVQT had better predictive power for VF with higher sensitivity and specificity than the QTc measure. The result suggested that the increasing of EMW, as well as the elevation of STVQT, can potentially be used as biomarkers for predicting of VF.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science","Animal Science and Zoology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Changes in firmness, weight loss, a*/b* color, lycopene content, total soluble solid, ascorbic acid, and concentration of ethylene and carbon dioxide of the tomatoes packaged in CT film, CS film, and control (without CT or CS films) were monitored during storage at 20 °C. Classification of fruit quality as a function of different packaging treatments was visualized using linear discriminant analysis. Tomatoes packaged in the CT film evolved lower quality changes than those in the CS film and control. The results suggested that the CT film exhibited ethylene photodegradation activity when exposed to UV light and consequently delayed the ripening process and changes in the quality of the tomatoes.","plant science; development; reproductive development (spermatophytes); ripening and post-harvest physicsiology, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"
Predictive values and specificity of electroencephalographic findings in autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis,"Limotai C., Denlertchaikul C., Saraya A.W., Jirasakuldej S.",2018-07-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis, Antibodies, Cross-Sectional Studies, Electroencephalography, Encephalitis, Female, Hashimoto Disease, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Predictive Value of Tests, Reference Standards, Sensitivity and Specificity, Young Adult, Autoimmune encephalitis, EEG, Predictive values, Specificity","Objective: Early diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) to not delay treatment is challenging but needed in practice. Most previous evidences of electroencephalographic (EEG) findings in AE were derived from descriptive studies. Given paucity of evidence of specific EEG findings to help with early diagnosis of AE, this study aimed to ascertain specific EEG findings and assess their predictive values in diagnosis of AE. Methods: We included all cases with AE in our institution from January 2013 to June 2017. Cases were matched with controls by age and level of consciousness (1:2 ratio). Potential confounders for EEG findings collected as baseline characteristics were compared. Two epileptologists independently reviewed EEGs. Standardized terminology, definitions, and scoring system of EEG findings were employed. Logistic regression analysis was performed, and diagnostic performance of significant EEG features was assessed. Results: Twenty cases and 40 controls were included in this study. Poorly sustained posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) was significantly associated with AE (p = 0.007) and even more predictive in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) encephalitis. Inter-rater agreement (kappa) was 0.714. None of the cases had normal EEG nor Grand Total EEG (GTE) score < 4 (negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%). Specificity of well sustained PDR to exclude the diagnosis of anti-NMDA encephalitis was high (91.67%). Conclusions: Simple EEG assessment can be used to help exclude AE. When AE is suspected, careful assessment of the sustainment of the PDR is warranted. The NPV of GTE score < 4 and specificity of well sustained PDR can be simply used to differentiate many conditions from AE.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Behavioral Neuroscience"

The synthesis is based on surface chemical modification of cellulose microcrystals (CMCs) by 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, respectively. The adsorption and sensing of U-ICMs and CMCs in response to diverse metal ions (Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+) are qualitatively and quantitatively elucidated by UV-vis spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The U-ICMs exhibit high performance for most metal species adsorption including Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cd2+, while CMCs favor Fe3+ adsorption. Comparing the adsorption performance of CMCs and U-ICMs, the presence of urethane-linked imidazole on CMCs leads to an improvement of adsorption capacity of more than 3 times (for Zn2+) up to 23 times (for Ni2+). At the same time, the adsorption of metals on U-ICMs promotes an enrichment of metal colors that can be clearly observed by the naked eye and UV-vis spectroscopic data. XPS and X-ray absorption near-edge structure are investigated to prove how those metal ions transform after exposure to the unmodified and modified CMCs surface. The findings highlight the potential use of U-ICMs together with CMCs as sustainable bioadsorbents and sensing materials for metal separation and water purification.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

In general, LbL assembly occurs via physical or chemical interaction between each deposited layer. Here, the stabilization of the proton donor and acceptor polymers by cross-linking those two layers together was applied as a concept. The challenge was the molecular design of the proton donor and accepter polymer species to each have compatible cross-linkable functional groups as well as proton transfer species in the molecules. Poly(acrylic acid) decorated with different amounts of thiol groups (PAA-M) was synthesized, while benzimidazole decorated branching polyethyleneimine was functionalized with maleimide groups (BIm-PEI-MI). The cross-linkable proton donor and acceptor were alternately LbL deposited on a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) surface. The LbL membrane with an optimum crosslink level showed a proton conductivity of up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure SPEEK membrane even at a temperature as high as 170 °C.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This level of accuracy might be sufficient for general GNSS usersand their applications. However, in case of air transportation sector, this sector usually requires higher standards interms of precision, accuracy, integrity and reliability. It is crucial to obtain higher positioning performance, whichthe current single GNSS constellation could not fulfill the standards as defined by the International Civil AviationOrganization (ICAO). In addition, Thailand is located at a low-latitude region where there is higher ionized particledensity in the atmosphere. This affects the signal from navigation satellite and induce the localizing error. In orderto improve the performance and correct the errors due to these effects, the GNSS augmentation systems, i.e. AircraftBased Augmentation Systems (ABAS), Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) and Satellite BasedAugmentation Systems (SBAS) have been introduced and implemented specially for the aviation activities.

In this study, a thermal stress has been applied to TMR devices between 150-250°C, and the resistance, amplitude, and asymmetry parameters, both before and after the thermal stress, were measured using a quasi-static test (QST). The results reveal a temperature dependence of the TMR device performance. The microstructure of the annealed devices was further studied using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis, revealing structural defects that are related to the QST parametric changes.

Chitosan-grafted pNIPAM (CS-g-pN) nanogels were prepared by a sonication method. The loading of curcumin into the CS-g-pN nanogels was achieved using an incubation method. Size, morphology of nanogels, amounts of curcumin loaded to the nanogels and cellular uptake were investigated by DLS, TEM, fluorescent spectroscopy and confocal microscopy techniques, respectively. A CellTiter-Blue® cell viability assay was performed in NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells to assess the safety while MTT assay was carried out in MDA-231, Caco-2, HepG2, and HT-29 cells for determining cytotoxic effects. Results showed that CS-g-pN with 3–60% degree of modification were simply assembled into spherical nanogel particles with submicron sizes, in which curcumin was encapsulated. The thermoresponsive behavior of each CS-g-pN nanogel formulation differed due to the grafted pNIPAM length and density. The CS-g-pN nanogel formulations were non-toxic towards NIH-3T3 and HeLa cells. Each curcumin-loaded CS-g-pN nanogel formulation could be up taken into NIH-3T3 cell lines and showed the dose-dependent cytotoxicity against tested cell lines. Successful development of this curcumin-loaded nanogel will lead to advanced materials that can be functionalized and optimized for targeted therapy and controlled delivery of small molecules and/or biomolecules for biomedical applications.","chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Its diagnosis is challenging due to clinical and histopathological similarities with the fungal microbes that cause mucormycosis and entomophthoramycosis. In addition, the proper identification of P. insidiosum in the clinical laboratory is difficult. We have developed a rapid and accurate, species-specific identification method using a thermophilic helicase DNA amplification (tHDA) technique, to differentiate this pathogen from closely related pathogenic fungi. Sixty-seven fungal isolates, including 39 of P. insidiosum, were evaluated. A 91 base-pair (bp) DNA fragment was consistently amplified using a COX2 primer. The limiting concentrations of the one- and two-step tHDA protocols were 100 picograms (1.74 × 102 copies) and 100 femtograms (1.74 × 101 copies), respectively. The CviKI-1 enzyme in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with the 91 bp amplicons accurately separated P. insidiosum from other fungal species. The data suggest that this tHDA-RFLP assay is a rapid and accurate test for the identification of P. insidiosum.

To extend this approach to breast cancer, we generated CAR T cells directed against mucin1 (MUC1), an aberrantly glycosylated neoantigen that is overexpressed by malignant cells and whose expression has been correlated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, to protect our tumor-targeted cells from the elevated levels of immune-inhibitory cytokines present in the tumor milieu, we co-expressed an inverted cytokine receptor linking the IL4 receptor exodomain with the IL7 receptor endodomain (4/7ICR) in order to transform the suppressive IL4 signal into one that would enhance the anti-tumor effects of our CAR T cells at the tumor site. Methods: First (1G - CD3ζ) and second generation (2G - 41BB.CD3ζ) MUC1-specific CARs were constructed using the HMFG2 scFv. Following retroviral transduction transgenic expression of the CAR±ICR was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro CAR/ICR T cell function was measured by assessing cell proliferation and short- and long-term cytotoxic activity using MUC1+ MDA MB 468 cells as targets. In vivo anti-tumor activity was assessed using IL4-producing MDA MB 468 tumor-bearing mice using calipers to assess tumor volume and bioluminescence imaging to track T cells. Results: In the IL4-rich tumor milieu, 1G CAR.MUC1 T cells failed to expand or kill MUC1+ tumors and while co-expression of the 4/7ICR promoted T cell expansion, in the absence of co-stimulatory signals the outgrowing cells exhibited an exhausted phenotype characterized by PD-1 and TIM3 upregulation and failed to control tumor growth. However, by co-expressing 2G CAR.MUC1 (signal 1 - activation + signal 2 - co-stimulation) and 4/7ICR (signal 3 - cytokine), transgenic T cells selectively expanded at the tumor site and produced potent and durable tumor control in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of targeting breast cancer using transgenic T cells equipped to thrive in the suppressive tumor milieu and highlight the importance of providing transgenic T cells with signals that recapitulate physiologic TCR signaling - [activation (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2) and cytokine support (signal 3)] - to promote in vivo persistence and memory formation.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Oncology, Pharmacology, Cancer Research"

Island size and its uniformity as a function of patterned substrate parameters and growth conditions are investigated in an early stage of growth using fast kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the flat substrate, patterned substrates provide preferred sites for island formation at the beginning of growth and promote island size uniformity. A patterned substrate parameter enables us to modify island size in a considerable range. Island size uniformity is further enhanced by stress suppression at the island edges when lattice mismatch is increased. Island size, however, decreases as the growth temperature is increased due to the constraint of periodicity of patterned substrates imposed. An upper bound of a patterned substrate parameter before island size becomes less uniform seems to closely connect to island period and island edge spacing of the flat substrate.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

EFB has been known as a low-priced and abandoned residue from the palm oil milling process due to its low heating value and generation of toxic gases upon burning; therefore, valorization of EFB has been an important task for circular economy. In this study, a subsequent alkaline hot compressed water fractionation to separate hemicellulose and lignin from cellulose has been studied. The lignin separation by lignin precipitation and a filtration process followed by microwave-assisted lignin oxidative depolymerization to high value phenolic compounds was proposed. We systematically screened many catalysts as well as investigated reaction conditions (such as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, reaction time, etc.) to achieve the highest yield of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. It was found that the optimal conditions for depolymerization of pretreated EFB lignin were (i) NaOH solution with 2.5% (w/w) hydrogen peroxide, (ii) microwave (300 W) for 15 min, and (iii) bimetallic Cu(OH)2 and Fe2O3 catalysts. The highest percentage of the total phenolic compound concentration peak area is 91.78%, including 42.84% of syringol, 5.42% of vanillin, 8.71% of acetovanillone, 6.65% of syringaldehyde, and 28.16% of acetosyringone.

The furosemide stress test (FST) has been shown to predict the need for RRT and therefore could be used to exclude low-risk patients from enrollment in trials of RRT timing. We conducted this multicenter pilot study to determine whether FST could be used to screen patients at high risk for RRT and to determine the feasibility of incorporating FST into a trial of early initiation of RRT. Methods: FST was performed using intravenous furosemide (1 mg/kg in furosemide-naive patients or 1.5 mg/kg in previous furosemide users). FST-nonresponsive patients (urine output less than 200 mL in 2 h) were then randomized to early (initiation within 6 h) or standard (initiation by urgent indication) RRT. Results: FST was completed in all patients (100%). Only 6/44 (13.6%) FST-responsive patients ultimately received RRT while 47/60 (78.3%) nonresponders randomized to standard RRT either received RRT or died (P < 0.001). Among 118 FST-nonresponsive patients, 98.3% in the early RRT arm and 75% in the standard RRT arm received RRT. The adherence to the protocol was 94.8% and 100% in the early and standard RRT group, respectively. We observed no differences in 28-day mortality (62.1 versus 58.3%, P = 0.68), 7-day fluid balance, or RRT dependence at day 28. However, hypophosphatemia occurred more frequently in the early RRT arm (P = 0.002). Conclusion: The furosemide stress test appears to be feasible and effective in identifying patients for randomization to different RRT initiation times. Our findings should guide implementation of large-scale randomized controlled trials for the timing of RRT initiation.","urology and nephrology, medical",Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

Data anonymization has emerged with the objective of reducing re-identification risk. However, when data anonymization is applied, the data utility may decrease. Therefore, it is necessary to trade-off between privacy risks and the data utility. Our objectives in this research are to evaluate the effects of data classification with anonymized data and to evaluate the performance of various privacy models and ensemble classification algorithms. The measurement metrics in this experiment are accuracy, re-identification risk and suppressed records. Our experimental results show that there is no significant difference between the accuracy of classification using original data and the accuracy of classification using anonymized data. In addition, the average accuracy of each algorithm is not significantly different.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Cepharanthine exhibits a potent anticancer activity in p53-mutated colorectal cancer cells through upregulation of p21Waf1/Cip1,"Rattanawong A., Payon V., Limpanasittikul W., Boonkrai C., Mutirangura A., Wonganan P.",2018-01-01,"Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic, Benzylisoquinolines, Cell Cycle Checkpoints, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Cell Survival, Colorectal Neoplasms, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HT29 Cells, Humans, Mutation, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Up-Regulation, Apoptosis, Cell cycle arrest, Cepharanthine, Colorectal cancer, P2Waf1/Cip1, P53","Cepharanthine (CEP), a biscoclurine alkaloid isolated from Stephania cepharantha Hayata, has demonstrated anticancer activity in several different types of cancer cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both men and women. Mutated p53 in CRC was reported to be associated with resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents including, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Many studies reported that mutation of p53 induced chemoresistance through several mechanisms, including induction of drug efflux, disruption of cell cycle regulation, evasion of apoptosis and upregulation of DNA repair. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of CEP in p53 mutant versus p53 wild-Type colorectal cancer cells and determine its underlying mechanisms of action. Our results showed that CEP induced colorectal cancer cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Remarkably, CEP was more effective in controlling the growth of the p53 mutant colorectal cancer cell lines, HT-29 and SW-620, than the p53 wild-Type colorectal cancer cell lines, COLO-205 and HCT-116. Further studies on the underlying mechanisms revealed that CEP could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both HT-29 and COLO-205 cells. Treatment with CEP dramatically increased p21 Waf1/Cip1expression levels of the p53 mutant cell line HT-29 and to a lesser extent, the p53 wild-Type cell line COLO-205. In addition, cyclin A and Bcl-2 expression levels of both cell lines were significantly downregulated following treatment with CEP. CEP also induced ROS formation in colorectal cancer cells. Taken together, we concluded that CEP effectively induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which may be mediated through upregulation of p21Waf1/Cip1, downregulation of cyclin A and Bcl-2 and induction of ROS production in colorectal cancer cells. These findings suggested that CEP could potentially be a novel anticancer agent for p53 mutant colorectal cancer cells which are often resistant to current chemotherapeutic agents.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

The effects of electrode composition, electrolyte concentration and the scan rate (10–250 mV/s) were investigated at a temperature of 27 °C. An optimum mass ratio of 70/30 (Ag2O/CNT) led to a maximum current density of 83 mA cm−2 at −0.43 V (VS Ag/AgCl). At scan rates between 10 and 250 mV/s, a negative shift with a displacement of around 1.032 V was observed – indicating the presence of irreversible reduction reactions. The observed irreversibility suggested that the reaction mechanism can be described by both diffusion and adsorption phenomena. The standard heterogeneous rate constant (ko) and the formal redox potential (Eo) were found to be 1.51 × 10−4 cm/s and 1.218 V, respectively. The EIS results confirmed the formation of the inductive loops at reduction potentials – a consequence of the adsorption of the generated species. A reduction in charge transfer resistance and a continual drop in the potential from −0.1 down to −1.4 V was also observed. This was accompanied by H2 evolution and bicarbonate production. The calculated pKa value of 10.20 upon the completion of the bicarbonate reduction reactions, confirmed the conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate ions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this present work, we search for the potential FAS inhibitors of TE domain from the ZINC database based on similarity search using three natural compounds as templates, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction energy of each screened ligand compared to the reference compound, which is methyl γ-linolenylfluorophosphonate (MGLFP). Based on this computational technique, rosmarinic acid and its eight analogs were observed as a new series of potential FAS inhibitors, which showed a stronger binding affinity than MGLFP. Afterward, nine docked complexes were studied by molecular dynamics simulations for investigating protein–ligand interactions and binding free energies using MM-PB(GB)SA, MM-3DRISM-KH, and QM/MM-GBSA methods. The binding free energy calculation indicated that the ZINC85948835 (R34) displayed the strongest binding efficiency against the TE domain of FAS. There are eight residues (S2308, I2250, E2251, Y2347, Y2351, F2370, L2427, and E2431) mainly contributed for the R34 binding. Moreover, R34 could directly form hydrogen bonds with S2308, which is one of the catalytic triad of TE domain. Therefore, our finding suggested that R34 could be a potential candidate as a novel FAS-TE inhibitor for further drug design.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Molecular Biology"

The EDX analysis and surface area measurement confirmed that ZN-EtOH catalyst had better active center distribution than that of ZN-THF. Thus, the ZN-EtOH catalyst could retard the effect of hydrogen and show higher activity with increased hydrogen pressures. However, catalytic activity was lower with high hydrogen pressure. Moreover, polymerization time also has an influence on activity. Both catalysts showed the similar result where an increase in polymerization time can improve yield of polymer, but it decreased activity. In addition, it is seen that the increase in hydrogen pressure leads to decrease the melting temperature for polyethylenes, but it increases the crystallinity.","coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

The liver lobules are treated as porous media in hexagonal shapes connected as a lattice where the flux of ascitic fluid is measured at its border. The influence of size of sinusoids, interstitial space, and fenestrated wall on ascites volume is investigated. Sinusoidal obstruction has the most effect on ascites production compared to the others. Moreover, since each liver disease has different character of pore obstruction, we investigated the effect of location of sinusoidal obstruction on ascites production. The generalized occlusion has more effect on ascites than pericentral and periportal occlusion, respectively, which is correlated to clinical findings in each hepatic disease. The measured flux of ascitic fluid is found linearly related to hepatic wedge pressure (Pw) and free hepatic pressure (Pf). From these results we conclude that increasing of either Pw or Pf can increase production of ascitic fluid.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Nocturnal hypokinesia is symptomatic from the mid-stage of the disease, affecting up to 70% of PD patients, and contributes to poor sleep quality, and increased carer burden. Here we explore four areas of nocturnal hypokinesia that are relevant to clinical practice, namely: manifestations and definition; clinical assessment and objective monitoring; etiologies and contributing factors; and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. In addition, we provide an operational definition of what constitutes nocturnal hypokinesia and outline different methods of assessment, ranging from clinical interviews and rating scales to objective night-time monitoring with inertial sensors. Optimal management of nocturnal hypokinesia in PD begins with recognizing its manifestation by inquiring about cardinal symptoms and contributing factors from, not only patients, but also carers, followed by formal assessment, and the application of individualized evidence-based treatment. Night-time dopaminergic treatment is the primary therapy; however, careful clinical judgment is required to balance the benefits with the potential adverse events related to nocturnal dopaminergic stimulation. Future studies are needed to explore the practicality of home-based objective assessment of nocturnal hypokinesia, new therapeutic options not limited to dopaminergic medications, and non-pharmacologic approaches, including training on compensatory strategies and bedroom adaptations.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

The nonisothermal crystallization was investigated from differential scanning calorimetry, whereas the crystalline structure was studied by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and the morphology of spherulites was observed by Optical Microscopy. From these techniques, the crystallinity of PBS appeared to increase with the addition of zeolite and the crystals displayed a larger size. In the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics Avrami model was found to be applicable.

We provide an analysis of expected probability of the proposed algorithm taking into account the problem size, the number of satisfying items and the query complexity to show that the proposed modified Grover's search is optimal.","quantum theory, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Hardware and Architecture, Artificial Intelligence"

The varied HCl amounts have been added into the pre-polymer solution as a catalyst for the ring-opening polymerization. The reaction was traced by FTIR and DSC. In addition, the degradation behavior was studied by TGA and the textural properties were characterized by SEM and surface area analysis (AS1-MP). The nanoporous carbon obtained showed the highest char yield up to 48%. The interconnected structure from the SEM images of the nanoporous carbon exhibited significantly high surface area of 632 m2/g, high total pore volume up to 1.78 cm2/g, small average pore diameter and narrow pore size distribution detected by AS1-MP. After the activation process, the surface area has been drastically improved leading to the increasing of surface area and total pore volume up to 1119 m2/g and 1.93 cm2/g, respectively. In order to further study on the enhancement of surface area, NaCl, a water soluble compound, has been used as a template. As a result, the surface area has been improved up to 1516 m2/g.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Culture and its influences on dental education,"Chuenjitwongsa S., Bullock A., Oliver R.G.",2018-02-01,"Cultural Characteristics, Education, Dental, Learning, dental education, European cultures, learning styles","Introduction: Culture is an important factor influencing how students develop learning and how educators provide support to students. The aim of this paper is to explore a concept of national European cultures, and relationships between culture and educational practice with the intention of helping the dental profession gain a better understanding of effective teaching and learning in dentistry. Content: Culture represents the collective behaviours, values and beliefs of people in a society. How people react to education is partly explained by culture. Students utilise different culturally based strategies to develop learning. We apply Hofstede's model to explore European cultures and implications for dental education and educational practice. Most Western students possess assimilating learning styles enabling them to learn effectively in student-centred contexts while most Eastern students have accommodating learning styles and are more familiar with teacher-centred learning. Eastern students may need to adapt their approach to learning to better benefit from student-centred learning. Conclusion: Culture influences students’ learning and educational practice. Dental educators should be aware of such influences and provide support that acknowledges students’ different cultural backgrounds. Cultural competence is fundamental for effective teaching and learning in dentistry.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"

Recently, there have been many deep learning researches showing their success in many domains. However, there has been no comparative study for Thai NLP to suggest the most suitable technique for each task yet. In this paper, we aim to provide a performance comparison among various deep learning-based techniques on three NLP tasks, and study the effect on synthesized OOV words and the OOV handling algorithm with Levenshtein distance had been provided due to the fact that most existing works relied on a set of vocabularies in the trained model and not being fit for noisy text in the real use case. Our three experiments were conducted on BEST 2010 I2R, a standard Thai NLP corpus on F1 measurement, with the different percentage of noises having been synthesized. Firstly, for Tokenization, the result shows that Synthai, a jointed bidirectional LSTM, has the best performance. Additionally, for POS, bi-directional LSTM with CRF has obtained the best performance. For NER, variational bi-directional LSTM with CRF has outperformed other methods. Finally, the effect of noises reduces the performance of all algorithms on these foundation tasks and the result shows that our OOV handling technique could improve the performance on noisy data.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"

The simulation results revealed that mansonones are able to form inclusion complexes with βCDs. The guest molecules are not completely inserted into the host cavity, their preferably positions are nearby the secondary rim with the oxane ring dipping into the hydrophobic inner cavity. The encapsulation process leads to a higher rigidity of the βCDs enhancing the intramolecular hydrogen bond formation ability and decreasing the chance of glucopyranose rotation. According to the MM-PBSA binding free energy calculation, all considered inclusion complexes are stable and the binding energies are mainly caused by van der Waals interactions. Moreover, the free energy calculations showed significant differences in the complexation energies for the stereoisomers, which could enable the separation of the isomers by analytical techniques for further pharmaceutical applications.","genergyal, mixing and separation, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

The variation in the crosslink density, solvent uptake and morphological properties was also analyzed to explain the properties of NR/MCC composites. Significant improvement in the maximum rheometric torque, modulus and tensile strength was observed for NR composite containing 5 phr (parts per hundred of rubber) MCC along with 10 phr MNR in comparison to NR composite containing only 5 phr MCC. The tensile strength increased by 62.52% for NR/MCC composite in presence of 10 phr MNR as compatibilizer in comparison to NR-gum. Thermogravimetric analysis showed the enhancement in thermal stability of NR/MCC composite due to addition of MNR.

Chloride induced precipitation with NH4OH was used to prepare AgCl as a sacrificial template. Exploiting the microfluidic platform, effects of reactant concentrations on the morphology of AgCl templates were studied by simply adjusting the input flow rates. The AgCl templates were subsequently reduced into Ag0 or np-AgMSs using chemical reduction. The synthesized np-AgMSs were tested as on-chip SERS substrates using p-aminothiophenol as an analyte. It was found that the np-AgMSs with multipod structures (tripod and tetrapod) provided the highest SERS signal compared to other structures. Finally, the multipod np-AgMSs were successfully used as on-chip SERS substrates for determination of thiocyanate in human saliva. Linearity of the proposed approach was found to be in the range of 1-20 μM with R2 = 0.9887. The LOD and LOQ were 0.1 and 1.5 μM, respectively. Accuracy of the system was investigated from % recovery of spiked thiocyanate standard solutions and found to be in the range of 90-110%. In addition, reproducible Raman signals of thiocyanate were achieved with relative standard deviations of less than 9% for both intraday and interday SERS measurements.

Purpose: To describe the peri-implant tissue around 3 abutment materials; titanium, zirconia, and gold alloy, over an 8-week healing period. Materials and Methods: Fifteen edentulous sites were treated with implants. Eight weeks later, peri-implant tissue was harvested and processed using a nonseparation resin embedded technique. The tissue attachment characteristics were assessed at clinical stages using the gingival index (GI) score, surgical stage (surgical score), and histological stage (histological attachment percentage). Additionally, the inflammatory responses were evaluated using inflammatory extent and inflammatory cellularity grades. Nonparametrical statistics were used to describe the GI and surgical scores, and analytical statistics were used to analyze the histological attachment percentages as well as the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades amongst the 3 groups. Results: There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for GI score (P =.071) and surgical score (P =.262). Titanium and zirconia exhibited nearly similar mean histological attachment percentages while gold alloy had a significantly lower percentage (P =.004). For the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades, the odds of being one grade higher for gold alloy abutment was 5.18 and 17.8 times that of titanium abutment, respectively. However, for the zirconia abutment, the odds were 0.87 and 7.5 times higher than the titanium group. Conclusions: The tissue around the gold alloy abutments resulted in worse attachment conditions compared with the titanium and zirconia abutments. Inflammation tended to be higher in the tissue around the gold alloy abutments than the titanium and zirconia abutments.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"
Simplified two-group two-fluid model for three-dimensional two-phase flow Computational Fluid Dynamics for vertical upward flow,"Hibiki T., Schlegel J.P., Ozaki T., Miwa S., Rassame S.",2018-09-01,"Boiling and condensations, Computational resources, Interfacial area concentrations, Interfacial area transport equation, Interfacial forces, Nuclear reactor systems, Two fluid model, Vertical upward flows, CFD, Interfacial area transport equation, Interfacial force, Two-fluid model, V & V","Recent progress in nuclear thermal-hydraulics simulations has been largely focused on coupling with other computational packages, improved closure models for subcooled boiling and for bubbly flows, and the development of higher-fidelity simulation capabilities (Kulesza et al., 2016). While high-fidelity 3D simulation is important for model validation, scientific understanding, and some design calculations, it can be prohibitively expensive for system design applications or applications involving large geometries. Thus, there is also a need for practical, simplified approaches for those applications. The two-fluid model strikes a balance between detail and computational resources, but requires the accurate specification of several key constitutive models. These include (1) interfacial forces, (2) interfacial area concentration, (3) two-phase turbulence, and (4) wall and bulk boiling and condensation. In many modern CFD packages, uncertainties in the local interfacial area concentration can have strong effects on the ability to predict the other key parameters. This paper demonstrates that the drag force in 3D CFD can be formulated in much the same way as in 1D system analysis codes and that this approach can be used to formulate a model for interfacial area concentration. The method is also applied to two-group approaches to consider the difference in transport properties for different bubble size classes. This approach may open a method to calculate the interfacial forces without the need for interfacial area transport equations. This reduces the number of differential equations and avoids the modeling challenges associated with bubble breakup and coalescence kernels and the need to specify the inlet interfacial area concentration a priori. The new method is expected to decouple the effects of interfacial area uncertainty and calibrated coefficients, and should provide reasonable local bubble diameters for both group-1 and group-2 bubbles. The approaches proposed in this study are applicable to two-phase flow simulations in rather simple geometries such as upward two-phase flow in vertical channels. In view of many applications for upward two-phase flow in vertical channels, including nuclear reactor systems, the proposed methods are considered useful.","energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"
Enhanced CO2 capturing over ultra-microporous carbon with nitrogen-active species prepared using one-step carbonization of polybenzoxazine for a sustainable environment,"Manmuanpom N., Thubsuang U., Dubas S.T., Wongkasemjit S., Chaisuwan T.",2018-10-01,"Adsorption, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, Porosity, Activated carbon, CO2 adsorption, Nitrogen functionality, Polybenzoxazine, Porous carbon","Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon has been a promising material for CO2 capture in the recent decades. To enhance the performance of CO2 adsorption, both an N-active site and the textural properties are crucial determinants. Herein, ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species was prepared using two synthesis procedures: 1) one-step carbonization of a polybenzoxazine (PBZ) precursor at 800 °C, and 2) the CO2 activation process at 900 °C. The activated porous carbon had the higher specific surface area (943 m2/g) and a total pore volume (0.51 cm3/g) compared to un-activated porous carbon (335 m2/g and 0.19 cm3/g, respectively). In addition, the presence of N-active species such as pyridine-N, secondary-N, pyridone-N, and oxide-N in the carbon structures could be clearly observed in the high-resolution XPS spectra. The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed at 30 and 50 °C under a wide range of pressures (1–7 bar). The maximum amount of CO2 uptake was ca. 3.59 mmol/g for the activated porous carbon operated at 30 °C and a CO2 pressure of 7 bar, which was due to the high specific surface area and the large micropore volume. Specifically, carbon with a 3D interconnected pore structure, derived from the sol-gel process of the PBZ precursor, exhibited good structural stability and consequently led to better absorption capability under the high atmospheric pressure of CO2. The enhanced CO2 adsorption capability for the as-prepared porous carbon was based on two mechanisms: physisorption as a result of textural properties and chemisorption as a result of the acid-base interaction between the basic N functionality and the acidic CO2 gas. All results suggested that ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species prepared from polybenzoxazine is a promising adsorbent for CO2 capture and storage, which can be used at a wide range of pressures and in many applications e.g. flue gas adsorption and natural gas production.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental management, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Very few long-term survival reports of high-efficiency OL-HDF are available and the data are heterogeneous and incomplete. Objectives: The present historical cohort study was conducted to determine the long-term survival and outcome of high-efficiency OL-HDF-treated patients. Methods: Sixty-six high-efficiency OL-HDF treated patients at a center in SEA were included in the study. The prescription included blood and dialysis fluid flow rates of 400 and 800 mL/min, respectively. The post- or pre-dilution substitution fluid of 100 or 200 mL/min, respectively, was prescribed. Results: Of 66 HDF patients, whose age was 57.4 ± 14.0 years, there were 38 (58%) females. The majority of comorbidity was diabetes (36%). There were 33 (50%) incident HDF cases that were prescribed OL-HDF at the dialysis initiation and 33 (50%) prevalent HDF cases that were switched from HD to OL-HDF. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate were 95.1, 83.4, 77.7, and 61.8% respectively. The mean survival time was 8.99 ± 0.64 years. There were 15 transplantations and 15 deaths during this study periods. The 2 major causes of death were cardiovascular (33.3%) and infectious diseases (20%). Serum ferritin was the only parameter that correlated with mortality (HR 1.004, p = 0.005). There was comparable survival between incident and prevalent HDF cases. The survival after transplantation of a sub-group of patients who received kidney transplantation (KT) was not different from that of the overall HDF patients (p = 0.93). Conclusions: High-efficiency OL-HDF could provide an excellent long-term survival nearly comparable to the KT sub-group.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Nephrology, Urology, Physiology (medical)"

Methods: A 1-year prospective cohort study of 669 healthy office workers was conducted. At baseline, a self-administered questionnaire and standardized physical examination were employed to gather biopsychosocial data. Follow-up data were collected every month for the incidence of LBP. A regression model was built to analyze factors predicting the onset of LBP. Path analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect associations between identified risk factors and LBP. Results: The onset of LBP was predicted by history of LBP, frequency of rest breaks, and psychological demand, measured by the Job Content Questionnaire. All 3 factors directly related to LBP; history of LBP was the strongest effector on the onset of LBP. History of LBP and frequency of rest breaks had indirect effects on LBP that were mediated through psychological demand, and frequency of rest breaks was the most influential effector on psychological demand.

Recently, health hazards caused by P. candollei-derived products have arisen in Japan, and demands for analytical methods to standardize the P. candollei have been increasing. Previously, we have focused on quantifying the unique P. candollei-derived isoflavonoid kwakhurin (Kwa) and developed an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against Kwa. However, MAb preparation requires the use of costly culture medium and sophisticated techniques. Objective and Method: In this study, we produced a recombinant antigen-binding fragment (Fab) against Kwa, as an alternative to MAb, for use in icELISA for quantitative analysis of Kwa. The VH-CH1 and VL-CL proteins were individually expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain and were then refolded to form active anti-Kwa Fab. Results and Conclusion: Characterization of anti-Kwa Fab revealed that it possessed high specificity (cross-reactivities with other Kwa-related compounds, <0.03%) and high sensitivity (limit of detection, 8.16 ng/mL). Additionally, validation analyses indicated that icELISA using anti-Kwa Fab is highly precise, accurate, and sufficiently reliable for use in quantitative analysis of Kwa. Consequently, an icELISA incorporating anti-Kwa Fab was developed for the analysis of P. candollei-derived products, to assure consumer safety.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Science"

Methods: Oral biopsy records from paediatric patients (<16 years of age) were retrieved from the pathology archives at Chulalongkorn University Hospital over a period of 15 years. Lesions were categorised as inflammatory/reactive, tumour/tumour-like or cystic. Results: Two-hundred and thirty biopsies were identified. Most lesions were inflammatory/reactive (62%), followed by tumour/tumour-like (35%) and cystic (3%). The largest proportion of lesions was found in the 12–16 years’ age group. Mucocele was the most common lesion (38%), followed by hemangioma (8.3%), irritation fibroma (6%) and nevus (6%). The predominance of mucocele is similar to that in reports from other countries. The proportion of malignant tumours (5%) was higher than in other studies (<1–2%). In contrast, odontogenic cysts and odontogenic tumours were rare (3% and <1%, respectively), compared with published studies (7–35% and 2–21%, respectively). Conclusions: This study from a medical institution shows a somewhat different spectrum of paediatric oral pathology compared with that reported from dental institutions. While some of the lesions may not be treated by dentists, they still need to be aware of these lesions because affected patients can still present initially to a dentist.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
Scaling Network Traffic Logger with Microservice Architecture,"Phain C., Limpiyakom Y.",2018-11-01,"Large organizations, Microservices, Modular structures, Monolithic architecture, Network traffic, Performance evaluations, Query time, Scaling model, information security, microservices, network logging, scalability","Over the past few years, many large organizations evolve their technology stack to Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture. Although the traditional monolithic architecture is still a good choice for many applications, it does have limitations in scalability. A change made to a small part of the application also requires the entire monolith to be rebuilt and deployed. This makes it harder to maintain a good modular structure over time. This paper thus presents a design of network traffic logger using the microservice architecture. Based on the scaling model, scale cube, each service can be individually scaled, with the result being that the application is scaled more efficiently. The preliminary study was carried out for performance evaluation. The results show that the microservice-based logger yields less query times on Radius log retrieval, compared to the monolithic.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Control and Optimization"

The structural diversity of SVMPs contributes to the broad spectrum of biological activities. The aim of the study was to investigate the SVMP transcript profile to gain better insights into the characteristic clinical manifestations of the Myanmar Russell's viper (MRV) bites that distinguish it from the RVs of other habitats. Next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mRNA from MRV venom glands (2 males and 1 female) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform and then de novo assembled using Trinity software. A total of 59 SVMP contigs were annotated through a Blastn search against the serpent nucleotide database from NCBI. Among them, disintegrins were the most abundant transcripts (75%) followed by the P-III class SVMPs (25%). The P-II SVMPs were scarce (0.002%), while no P-I SVMPs were detectable in the transcriptome. For detailed structural analysis, contigs were conceptually translated and compared with amino acid sequences from other RVs and other vipers using Clustal Omega. The RTS-disintegrin (jerdostatin homolog) was the most abundant among transcripts corresponding to 5 disintegrin isoforms. From 10 isoforms of SVMPs, RVV-X, and Vipera lebetina apoptosis-inducing protease (VLAIP) homolog, hereby termed Daboia siamensis AIP (DSAIP), were found to be highly expressed. Venom protein analysis using SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry revealed that the disintegrin was scarce, while the latter two SVMPs were abundant. These two proteins can contribute to severe clinical manifestations caused by MRV envenomation.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, pharmacology",Toxicology

Presently, known anomaly detection algorithms hardly detect these assemblages without appropriate setting. This paper proposes the new anomalous assemblage detection algorithm called CND which computes a score for an instance using a nearest neighbor distance. The algorithm computes the index k which is equal to the floor function of C percent times the total number of instances and uses the kth-nearest neighbor distance for representing an anomalous score. Moreover, a medcouple from a skew distribution is used to compute the upper threshold for detecting outliers. The algorithm is tested on two collections of datasets which are synthetic datasets and benchmark datasets from Multimedia Analysis and Data Mining website to evaluate the performance comparing with WOF and LOF. The performance of CND is similar to LOF, but it is better than the performance of WOF on the synthetic dataset based on precision' recall and F1-measure.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

The life-cycle reliability of an RC bridge pier under seismic and airborne chloride hazards is compared to that of a bridge girder under traffic and airborne chloride hazards. When conducting a life-cycle reliability assessment of existing RC bridges, observational data from inspections can provide the corrosion level in reinforcement steel. Random variables related with the prediction of time-variant steel weight loss can be updated based on the inspection results using Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation (SMCS). This paper presents a novel procedure for identifying the hazards that most threaten the structural safety of existing RC bridges, as well as the structural components with the lowest reliability when these bridges are exposed to multiple hazards. The proposed approach, using inspection results associated with steel weight loss, provides a rational reliability assessment framework that allows comparison between the life-cycle reliabilities of bridge components under multiple hazards, helping the prioritisation of maintenance actions. The effect of the number of inspection locations on the updated reliability is considered by incorporating the spatial steel corrosion distribution. An illustrative example is provided of applying the proposed life-cyle reliability assessment to a hypothetical RC bridge under multiple hazards.","engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering"

The colorimetric assay is based on the formation of formazan via the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) by oxalate decarboxylase and formate dehydrogenase on the paper device. After the sample was spotted on the device, MTT changed color from yellow to purple, and the purple color intensity correlated with the oxalate concentration. The quantitative detection of oxalate ranged from 10 - 1000 μM, with a linear equation, y = 0.0086x + 34.978, and a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) = 0.9994. The detection limit was 10 μM by the naked eye. The recoveries of oxalate spiked in artificial urine samples evaluated by our cPADs were in the range of 81 - 92%. This simple cPAD for rapid and sensitive oxalate determination should be useful for diagnostic urinary oxalate measurements for point-of-care monitoring.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Based on phylogenetic analysis using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase II (COX2) gene, intergenic spacer (IGS) region and exo-1,3-β-glucanase gene (exo1), P. insidiosum is classified into clade A TH, B TH, and C TH related to geographic distribution. At present, polymerase chain reaction in any of these specific regions with DNA sequencing is the only technique to provide clade diagnosis. In this study, P. insidiosum-specific primers targeting COX2 gene were designed and used in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with subsequent high-resolution melting (HRM) to provide rapid identification as well as clade classification for P. insidiosum. Based on the qPCR-HRM method, 15 P. insidiosum isolates could be differentiated from 28 related organisms with 100% specificity and 1 pg limit of detection. This technique was, in addition, directly tested on clinical samples from proved human pythiosis cases: nine corneal scrapes and six arterial clots. The qPCR-HRM results of all nine corneal samples were a 100% match with the results from the conventional PCR at clade level. However, the qPCR-HRM results of arterial clot samples were only matched with the nucleotide sequencing results from the conventional PCR at species level. In conclusion, the qPCR-HRM is a simple one closed tube, inexpensive and user-friendly method to identify P. insidiosum into clade level.",medical,Infectious Diseases
Improvement of product selectivity in bicarbonate reduction into formic acid on a tin-based catalyst by integrating nano-diamond particles,"Hosseini S., kheawhom S., Masoudi Soltani S., Aroua M.K., Moghaddas H., Yusoff R.",2018-05-01,"Bicarbonate (HCO3-), Composite electrode, Electrochemical impedance, Electrochemical reductions, Electrode/electrolyte interfaces, Nano-diamond particles, Oxidation and reduction, Product selectivities, Bicarbonate (HCO3-), Composite electrode, Electrochemical reduction, Formic acid, Nano-diamond, Tin","In this study, the efficiency of electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate into formic acid was improved by using a composite electrode made up of tin (Sn), nanodiamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT). In the absence of ND, a compositional ratio of 10/90 (Sn/CNT) demonstrated the highest current density. However, by adding ND in a compositional ratio of 10/90/100 (Sn/CNT/ND) the highest efficiency towards formate/formic acid was achieved. It was observed that the presence of ND enhanced the selectivity of product for formic acid. The effects of bicarbonate concentration and scan rate have also been studied to understand the reduction mechanism. The peak potential shifted towards larger negative values of applied potential with an increase in the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V/s, confirming the irreversible nature of the reduction process. The linear relationship between the current and the square root of the scan rate (with a slope value of 0.519) suggested that the reaction process is fully diffusion-controlled. Formic acid was produced using both electrodes; however, the electrode containing nano-diamond successfully improved the process yield for formic acid. Electrochemical impedance study revealed a significant difference between Warburg coefficient for oxidation and reduction processes with values of 29.63 × 1012 and 67.4 Ω.

Methods: A systematic review was carried out in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from inception through January 2018 to identify: (i) studies that reported the incidence and/or prevalence of erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients; or (ii) studies that assessed the association between atrial fibrillation and erectile dysfunction. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model. Results: Five observational studies (27 841 patients) were enrolled. The pooled estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients was 57% (95% confidence interval 50–64, I2 = 0). A study showed an incidence of newly diagnosed erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients of 0.96% during the mean follow-up duration of 4.67 ± 3.20 years. There was a significant association of atrial fibrillation with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.44–2.23, I2 = 0%). The data on the risk of atrial fibrillation development in patients with erectile dysfunction were limited. A study showed the comparable risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with erectile dysfunction (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.67–1.5), when compared with those without erectile dysfunction. Conclusions: The present study suggests a significant association between erectile dysfunction and atrial fibrillation. The overall estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction among atrial fibrillation patients is 57%. However, despite limited data, the current evidence suggests a low incidence of new erectile dysfunction in atrial fibrillation patients.","genergyal, medical",Urology

The results showed that the proposed phoneme duplication methods made the system compatible with melisma, where short vowels and final consonants constructed a favorable waveform closer to actual singing voice. It also provides higher naturalness as perceived through MOS evaluation. Finally, in order to improve naturalness in the synthesized singing voice, an experiment with HMM state numbers was conducted. The outcome demonstrated that the naturalness increased as the state numbers grew to a certain point.","speech, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Automotive Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Control and Optimization"

However, the effect of mechanical force-induced ATP efflux on WNT/β-catenin signaling remains unclarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intermittent compressive force (ICF) and ICF-induced extracellular ATP on osteoblast differentiation via WNT/β-catenin signaling in human mandibular-derived osteoblast precursors (hMOBPs). The hMOBPs were subjected to ICF (1.5 g/cm2, 0.3 Hz) for 20 h. To investigate the role of ATP, Apyrase (0.5 units/mL), an enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP, was added 30 min before ICF was applied. The extracellular ATP levels were measured immediately after ICF was removed. The mRNA expression of osteogenic related genes, including WNT was evaluated via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. In vitro mineralization was determined by Alizarin Red S staining. The localization of β-catenin was detected using immunofluorescence staining and lentiviral-TOP-dGFP reporter assay. The results demonstrated that ICF increased ATP efflux and in vitro mineralization by hMOBPs. In addition, OSX, ALP, and WNT3A mRNA expression and β-catenin nuclear translocation increased when ICF was applied. The upregulation of these genes was reduced by Apyrase, suggesting the role of ICF-induced ATP on osteoblast differentiation. Notably, ICF altered the mRNA expression of purinergic 2X receptors (P2XRs). A P2X1R antagonist (NF449) downregulated ICF-induced WNT3A, OSX, and ALP mRNA expression. Moreover, when 25 μM α, β-meATP, a P2X1R agonist, was added, WNT3A, and OSX expression increased. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ICF-induced ATP enhanced hMOBP differentiation. This enhancement was associated with WNT/β-catenin signaling and P2X1R activation.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

Shared abnormalities include peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, increased intestinal barrier permeability with bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation, neuroendocrine abnormalities and microglial pathology. Patients with MS and MDD also display a wide range of neuroimaging abnormalities and patients with MS who display symptoms of depression present with different neuroimaging profiles compared with MS patients who are depression-free. The precise details of such pathology are markedly different however. The recruitment of activated encephalitogenic Th17 T cells and subsequent bidirectional interaction leading to classically activated microglia is now considered to lie at the core of MS-specific pathology. The presence of activated microglia is common to both illnesses although the pattern of such action throughout the brain appears to be different. Upregulation of miRNAs also appears to be involved in microglial neurotoxicity and indeed T cell pathology in MS but does not appear to play a major role in MDD.

The aim of this study was therefore to estimate the prevalence of ZnT8A in Thai juvenile-onset T1DM and to evaluate its diagnostic value relative to glutamic acid decarboxylase and insulinoma-2 antigen antibodies (GADA and IA2A). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, patients with T1DM diagnosed before age 15 years, and disease duration <10 years were enrolled. Serum ZnT8A, GADA, and IA2A were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: The subjects consisted of 81 youths (30 boys, 51 girls) aged 12.3 ± 4.5 years with T1DM. The median diabetes duration was 3 years (range, 0–10 years). The prevalence of ZnT8A, GADA, and IA2A was 54.3%, 75.3%, and 45.7%, respectively. ZnT8A were detected in 16% of T1DM patients negative for both GADA and IA2A. A combination of ZnT8A, GADA and IA2A could detect 80.2% of patients with T1DM. Combined use of ZnT8A and GADA identified 100% of antibody-positive patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of ZnT8A in Thai juvenile-onset T1DM appears to be higher than in previous studies from Asia.

With very low CO2 and CO concentrations in the reformate gas, the unconsumed fuel at the anode outlet stream of HT-PEMFC is possibly recirculated to the sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor to improve the performance and overall system efficiency without an increase in the problematic CO poisoning. The effects of CaO/C ratio, fuel utilization, and anode split ratio are analysed. With the anode recirculation, the operation at higher fuel utilization and anode split ratio improves the hydrogen efficiency and the system efficiency. The environmental impacts of the biomass gasification integrated with the SE-WGS and HT-PEMFCs are analysed and compared to the different decentralized HT-PEMFC systems fuelled by biomass using life cycle assessment methodology. The CaO production process is found to be the main cause of global warming impact and damage to human health and ecosystem quality, and no negative effect on resource depletion is observed for all studied power generation systems fuelled by biomass. The implementation of CO2 capture into the decentralized HT-PEMFC systems to enhance the hydrogen purity and efficiency significantly increases the environmental impact of the systems. Compared to the Thai Mixed Electricity Grid, better global warming impact of power generation from all studied HT-PEMFC systems is observed due to the environmental benefit obtained from the electricity produced from biomass.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The estimated number of new cancer cases in 2011 was 112 392. Our review provides baseline data on the current epidemiological situation with head and neck (HN) cancer in Thailand based on reports of the National Cancer Registry and findings from local and international publications. Collectively, HN cancer approaches age-standardized rate (ASR) incidence of 15.7 and 10.7 per 100 000 males and females, respectively, and is ranked among the top five dominant cancers in Thailand. The leading HN malignancies in men are oral (ASR incidence 4.6 per 100 000), nasopharyngeal (ASR 2.8) and laryngeal (ASR 2.7) cancers, while the most common cancers in women are thyroid (ASR 5.1) and oral (ASR 3.2) carcinomas. Some local habits (betel quid chewing, traditional cigarette smoking and alcohol intake) are associated with the high incidence of oral cancer in Northeast Thailand. Despite important prognostic significance, the role of human papillomavirus infection in various HN cancers from Thailand has been scarcely addressed. There is a growing incidence of thyroid cancer over the last two decades. The Thai population overall, compared to worldwide rates of HN malignancies, has a lower incidence of laryngeal and thyroid cancers but higher incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer.",medical,Oncology
Extended release versus immediate release tacrolimus in kidney transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Saengram W., Vadcharavivad S., Poolsup N., Chancharoenthana W.",2018-10-01,"Delayed-Action Preparations, Drug Administration Schedule, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Graft Rejection, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents, Kidney Transplantation, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Renal Elimination, Tacrolimus, eGFR, Extended release, Kidney transplantation, Meta-analysis, Renal function, Tacrolimus","Purpose: To compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months together with other outcomes among adult kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received extended release, once daily tacrolimus (ER-Tac) compared to those who received the immediate release, twice daily tacrolimus (IR-Tac) administration. Methods: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, we systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared clinical outcomes between ER-Tac versus IR-Tac in KTRs. The systematic searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL without language restriction. The trials registered and reference lists were also searched and reviewed. Data were extracted for eGFR, serum creatinine (Scr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), biopsy-proven acute rejection rate (BPAR), graft survival, and overall patient survival at different times over 24 months after kidney transplant (KT). A meta-analysis was performed to integrate the results from eligible studies. Results: From 1145 articles screened, 11 RCTs were included. The pooled results of included RCTs showed no significant difference of eGFR at 12 months between ER-Tac and IR-Tac groups (four trials, n = 1738; mean difference − 0.77 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI: − 2.41 to 0.87; p = 0.56; I2 = 0%). Comparing between the two tacrolimus formulations, there were no significant differences of eGFR, CrCl, Scr, BPAR, graft survival, and patient survival at different times over 4 years after transplantation. Conclusions: Based upon currently available evidences in KTRs, the impact on kidney allograft function appears to be comparable between ER-Tac and IR-Tac.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"
Influences of climatic parameters on piglet preweaning mortality in Thailand,"Nuntapaitoon M., Tummaruk P.",2018-04-01,"Animal Husbandry, Animals, Female, Hot Temperature, Humidity, Lactation, Linear Models, Mortality, Parity, Postpartum Period, Pregnancy, Swine, Temperature, Thailand, Tropical Climate, Lactation, Parity, Pig, Season, Tropic","The objective of the present study was to determine the influences of temperature, humidity, and temperature–humidity index (THI) on piglet preweaning mortality in a conventional open-housing system commercial swine herd in Thailand. The analyzed data included 11,157 litters from 3574 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows. The daily temperature, humidity, and THI data were collected from a meteorological station near the herd. The associations between temperature, humidity, and THI for periods before and after farrowings and piglet preweaning mortality were analyzed. Piglet preweaning mortality (log transformation) and the proportion of litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% were analyzed by using general linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models (GLIMMIX), respectively. On average, the piglet preweaning mortality and the proportion of litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% were 14.5% (14.2 to 14.8% CI) and 26.4% (25.5 to 27.2% CI), respectively. Piglet preweaning mortality was positively correlated with the mean temperature (r = 0.028, P = 0.003), humidity (r = 0.038, P < 0.001), and THI (r = 0.036, P < 0.001) during 0–7 days postpartum. In primiparous sows, piglet preweaning mortality increased from 12.1 to 18.5% (+ 6.4%, P < 0.001) when the mean temperature during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 25.0 to ≥ 29 °C. However, the influence of the temperature during 0–7 days postpartum was insignificant in multiparous sows (P = 0.569, P = 0.593, and P = 0.539 in sows parity numbers 2, 3–5, and 6–9, respectively). Likewise, piglet preweaning mortality increased from 10.7 to 16.7% (+ 6.0%, P = 0.012) when humidity during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 60 to ≥ 80% in primiparous sows but it was insignificant in sows parity numbers 3–5 (P = 0.095) and 6–9 (P = 0.219). Moreover, the proportion of the litters with piglet preweaning mortality greater than 20% in primiparous sows increased from 18.3 to 32.4% (+ 14.1%, P = 0.017) when the THI during 0–7 days postpartum increased from < 73 to ≥ 81. In conclusion, the negative influences of temperature, humidity, and THI on piglet preweaning mortality were more evident in primiparous than multiparous sows. These findings implied that strategies to reduce temperature for postpartum sows in the open-housing system in Thailand are inadequate, and the proper management of postpartum primiparous sows should be emphasized.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"
Synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles over Pd-loaded TiO2 prepared by a single-step sol–gel process for deoxygenation of triglycerides,"Hengsawad T., Jindarat T., Resasco D.E., Jongpatiwut S.",2018-09-25,"Catalytic performance, Deoxygenations, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Incipientwetness impregnation, Pd/TiO2, Photochemical deposition, Renewable diesels, SMSI, Deoxygenation, Oxygen vacancies, Pd/TiO2, Renewable diesel, SMSI","Renewable diesel has gained attention in recent years due to its superior fuel properties compared to the conventional biodiesel. The uses of Pd supported TiO2 (Pd/TiO2) and Pd supported activated carbon (Pd/C) catalysts for the deoxygenation of triglycerides to renewable diesel were investigated. Two different types of titania supports, i.e. mesoporous titania synthesized by a surfactant-assisted templating sol–gel method (SG-TiO2) and commercial P25-TiO2 (P25-TiO2), were used to investigate the effect of TiO2 crystal structure on the catalytic activity. The prepared catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The liquid products obtained from the deoxygenation of triglycerides in beef fat over the prepared catalysts at 325 °C, 500 psig, and H2/triglyceride molar ratio of 30 were in the diesel fuel specification range (C15-18). The main liquid products were n-heptadecane (n-C17) and n-pentadecane (n-C15), resulting from the decarboxylation or decarbonylation pathways. It was found that the Pd/P25-TiO2 catalyst exhibited a higher catalytic performance compared to the Pd/C catalyst. The formation of defects (oxygen vacancies and Ti3+) on TiO2, Pd dispersion and inducement of SMSI effect play an important role in the catalytic activity and the diesel yield on Pd/SG-TiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the Pd incorporation methods, i.e. incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), photochemical deposition (PCD) and single-step sol–gel (SSSG), were also investigated. The Pd/TiO2 prepared by SSSG method exhibited the highest conversion of beef fat and selectivity to the diesel fuel (C15-18) which could be due to its well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles with relatively small size, high defects on TiO2 support and strong SMSI behavior.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

We therefore attempt to clarify the uncertainty. Using the Tobii eye tracker to record fixation activities of 312 participants while filling in online forms with three label alignment formats (i.e., left, top, and infield) confirmed that the participants noticed the left-aligned label fastest as compared to the other alignment formats. Nonetheless, based on the fixation analysis, the top or the infield alignments still outrank the left one. In addition to extending insight into the label alignments on online forms, practitioners may apply the findings so visitors to the forms could work efficiently.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Automotive Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Control and Optimization"

The addition of graphene aims at improving the mechanical and thermal properties of PLA. The functional groups of graphene were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical property testing was performed using a universal testing machine. The thermal properties were measured through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As a result, the Young's modulus and the thermal properties of PLA composites increased as the amount of graphene in the composites increased due to improved dispersion of graphene in PLA matrix.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Body position changes disturb joint orientation around the chest wall and results in performance modifications of respiratory muscles and movement surrounding the rib cage and the abdomen. Body position is a priority treatment for preserving and promoting chest wall motion. The objective of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis to provide insight into which body position most effectively improves chest wall motion. METHODS: Medical literature databases were systemically searched up to January 31, 2018. Methodological quality was evaluated by using a checklist for measuring quality. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of body positions on chest wall motion. The quality of evidence was judged by using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. RESULTS: Six studies (5 high-and 1 low-quality) were identified. Our results showed that the sitting position provided greater improvement in chest-wall diameter changes and volume related to rib-cage function versus other body positions (very low to moderate evidence). The supine position demonstrated greater enhancement of chest-wall–diameter changes and volume in the part of the abdomen than the other body positions with very low to moderate evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicated that the sitting position improved the rib-cage compartment of the chest wall, whereas the supine position resulted in the superior enhancement in the part of the abdomen relative to other body positions. These changes in the body position could have some effect on the movements of the rib cage and abdomen and the variations in lung volumes, which need to be interpreted with caution when considering implemen tation in the clinical setting.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

Design: A multicenter, observational prospective cohort of HIV patients with normal kidney functions who received standard antiretroviral therapy. Methods: CKD was diagnosed based on the KDIGO 2012 criteria, using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration based estimated glomerular filtration rate with and without urine protein. The cumulative probability of CKD incidence was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: Of 5552 patients, 96 patients with pre-existing CKD and 26 patients with incomplete data were excluded, and 5430 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 39.87 years, 41.52% were women, and 49.45% were homosexual. They were followed up for 49.41 months on average, with 229 incident cases (4.22%) being identified during 22-035 person-years at risk. Overall CKD incidence rate was 10.39 per 1000 person-years. Average time to CKD was 26.4 months (95% confidence interval: 24.44-28.83). The adjusted relative hazard significantly increased by 8.6% and 10.3% for each additional year of patient age and each additional log 10 copies/ml of HIV viral load, respectively. Patients with diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia had significantly higher adjusted relative hazard (3.37 and 1.41; P-<-0.001 and P-=-0.014), respectively. Conclusion: CKD incidence among the Thai HIV-infected patients was lower than in white and non-Southeast Asian populations. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, age, and HIV viral load were the significant risk factors.

Searches for footprints of positive selection, in the form of rapid amino acid substitutions, and the identification of species-specific genes have proved to be powerful approaches to identifying the genes involved in host specialization in plant-pathogenic fungi. We used an evolutionary comparative genomic approach to identify genes underlying host adaptation in the ant-infecting genus Ophiocordyceps, which manipulates ant behaviour. A comparison of the predicted genes in the genomes of species from three species complexes—O. unilateralis, O. australis and O. subramanianii—revealed an enrichment in pathogenesis-associated functions, including heat-labile enterotoxins, among species-specific genes. Furthermore, these genes were overrepresented among those displaying significant footprints of positive selection. Other categories of genes suspected to be important for virulence and pathogenicity in entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., chitinases, lipases, proteases, core secondary metabolism genes) were much less represented, although a few candidate genes were found to evolve under positive selection. An analysis including orthologs from other entomopathogenic fungi in a broader context showed that positive selection on enterotoxins was specific to the ant-infecting genus Ophiocordyceps. Together with previous studies reporting the overexpression of an enterotoxin during behavioural manipulation in diseased ants, our findings suggest that heat-labile enterotoxins are important effectors in host adaptation and co-evolution in the Ophiocordyceps entomopathogenic fungi.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Genetics"

Methods Participants presenting for voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were enrolled during AHI in Bangkok, Thailand. ARS was defined by ≥3 qualifying signs/symptoms. HIV burden, immunophenotypes, and biomarkers were stratified by ARS diagnosis at enrollment and after up to 96 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results From 212382 samples screened, 430 participants were enrolled during AHI, including 335 (78%) with ARS. Median age was 26 years and 416 (97%) were men. Sixty (14%) underwent sigmoid biopsy and 105 (24%) underwent lumbar puncture during AHI. Common symptoms included fever (93%), fatigue (79%), pharyngitis (67%), and headache (64%). Compared to those without ARS, participants with ARS were in later Fiebig stages with higher HIV RNA in blood, colon, and cerebrospinal fluid; higher total HIV DNA in blood; CD4 depletion in blood and colon; and elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein, and D-dimer (all P <.05). Subgroup analyses of Fiebig I/II participants (95 with ARS, 69 without) demonstrated similar findings. After 96 weeks of ART, TNF-α and interleukin 6 were elevated in the ARS group (P <.05) but other biomarkers equilibrated. Conclusions ARS was associated with high viral burden, CD4 depletion, and immune activation across multiple body compartments during AHI and prior to ART.

However, the recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and there was lack of clinical trial evidence. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of apixaban in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD. Methods: Databases were searched through November 2017. Studies that reported incidence or odd ratios of bleeding complications or thromboembolic events in the use of apixaban in patients with CKD stage 4–5 or ESRD on dialysis were included. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Five studies were included into the analysis consisting of 43,850 patients in observational cohort studies. The majority of patients (87%) used apixaban for atrial fibrillation. The pooled estimated incidence of any bleeding complications on apixaban was 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.0%–23.0%).

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide accounting for approximately 1 in 5 of all cancer-related deaths. The most important causes of death in such a cancer involves the treatment failure as well as the spreading of cancer cells to distant sites which the cancer stem cell (CSC) within the tumor is accepted as a key driver. CSC is a rare special population of cancer cells exhibiting high tumorigenic properties together with self-renewal and differentiation capability. CSC is not only linked with high tumor-initiating activity, but is also implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance, metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and recurrence. Thereafter, novel therapeutic strategies targeting these CSCs are considered in order to improve long-term clinical outcome. Here, we provide sufficient data regarding the biology of CSC in lung cancer, known CSC markers and cellular signals, and promising compounds targeting the stem cell signals in lung cancer that may benefit the development of novel anti-cancer treatment.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

Recent Findings: Although tissue eosinophilia is the most commonly used criterion for ECRS, various cut-off points are suggested. Surrogate markers have been extensively studied. Sixty-six cohorts with study criteria were included with a total of 8557 patients. Raw data from 11 studies 544 patients were re-analyzed using number of tissue eosinophils. At lower cut-off values of ≥ 5 and ≥ 10 cells/HPF, most patients of Asian and Western/European ancestry were classified as ECRS without difference. In contrast, at cut-off points of ≥ 70 and ≥ 120 cells/HPF, the majority of both groups became reclassified as nECRS. Summary: After applying one consistent criteria to existing data, differences across ancestry and geographic populations in endotypes of CRS were no longer evident.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine"

Randomized control trial of benzydamine HCl versus sodium bicarbonate for prophylaxis of concurrent chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis,"Chitapanarux I., Tungkasamit T., Petsuksiri J., Kannarunimit D., Katanyoo K., Chakkabat C., Setakornnukul J., Wongsrita S., Jirawatwarakul N., Lertbusayanukul C., Sripan P., Traisathit P.",2018-03-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzydamine, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Radiation Injuries, Sodium Bicarbonate, Stomatitis, Young Adult, Benzydamine HCl, Concurrent chemoradiation, Mucositis, Sodium bicarbonate","Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of benzydamine HCl with sodium bicarbonate in the prevention of concurrent chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. Methods: Sixty locally advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either benzydamine HCl or sodium bicarbonate from the first day of treatment to 2 weeks after the completion of treatment. The total score for mucositis, based on the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS), was used for the assessment, conducted weekly during the treatment period and at the fourth week of the follow-up. Pain score, all prescribed medications, and tube feeding needs were also recorded and compared. Results: The median of total OMAS score was statistically significant lower in patients who received benzydamine HCl during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) than in those who received sodium bicarbonate, (p value < 0.001). There was no difference in median pain score, (p value = 0.52). Nineteen percent of patients in sodium bicarbonate arm needed oral antifungal agents whereas none in the benzydamine HCl arm required such medications, (p value = 0.06). Tube feeding needs and the compliance of CCRT were not different between the two study arms. Conclusions: For patients undergoing high-dose radiotherapy concurrently with platinum-based chemotherapy, using benzydamine HCl mouthwash as a preventive approach was superior to basic oral care using sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in terms of reducing the severity of oral mucositis and encouraging trend for the less need of oral antifungal drugs.",medical,Oncology

As cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is currently difficult to detect and most cases of such cancer present with late-stage disease at the time of initial diagnosis, we employed proteomic analysis of the bile to identify potential candidate biomarkers for Opisthorchis viverrini (OV)-associated CCA. Materials and Methods: Proteins in pooled bile samples from patients with CCA and OV infection, with CCA without OV infection, with OV infection but no CCA, and with neither OV infection nor CCA were separated by 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in-gel trypsin digestion and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: According to our analysis, three proteins, namely aristaless-like homeobox1 isoform X1 (ALX1), major histocompatibility complex polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), and uncharacterized protein C14orf105 isoform X12 were found to be potential markers for OV infection, as they were predominantly found in all OV-infected groups. Although these proteins were detected in both OV-infected patients with and without CCA, their abundance was 2.90-, 7.06-and 3.65-fold higher, respectively, in those with CCA. In patients with CCA, potential novel biomarkers wre immunoglobulin heavy chain, translocated in liposarcoma (TLS), visual system homeobox 2 (VSX2) and an unnamed protein product. Conclusion: We provided novel information regarding potential biomarkers for OV infection and CCA. These two protein profiles could benefit diagnosis as well as monitoring of CCA.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology"

In this study, we aimed to compare MS, AS, MA, and AA for their neurite outgrowth activities and mechanisms in Neuro-2a cells. Immunofluorescent cell staining showed MS and AS significantly increased the percentage of neurite-bearing cells (%NBC) and the neurite length with higher potency than MA and AA. The triterpenoid glycosides induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, while their aglycones activated only transient signaling of ERK1/2. Suppression of ERK1/2 activation significantly abolished not only cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation but also the increment of %NBC and neurite length in MS- and AS-treated cells. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not produce similar blockage of CREB activation and neurite outgrowth in MA- and AA-treated cells. On the other hand, inactivation of protein kinase B (Akt) resulted in a suppression of neurite lengthening in all studied triterpenoids. This is the first study discerning the different signaling pathways of neurite outgrowth activity induced by C. asiatica triterpenoid glycosides and aglycones. Neurite outgrowth activity of the glycosides MS and AS was found to involve the activation of sustained ERK phosphorylation leading to CREB activation, while ERK activation was not associated with MA- and AA-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, Akt activation was evident to be more involved in neurite elongation process.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

NR latex was crosslinked at various crosslinking ratios under the UV curing method. Ibuprofen (Ibu) was the model drug and was used as the dopant for poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) acting as the drug encapsulating host. For the pristine Ibu-loaded NR patch, the amount of Ibu permeation increased with decreasing crosslink density and increasing electrical potential. For the Ibu-doped PPV/NR patch, the amount of Ibu release−permeation also increased with increasing electrical potential and was higher than that of the pristine NR matrices. Without an applied electric field, the drug remained attached to the PPV during an initial period of 6 h. Under an applied electric field, the oxidation state of the conductive polymer was altered, the iontophoretic effect, pore formation in the NR matrix, expansion of the pore size in hair follicles and PPV chain expansion combined to increase the Ibu release−permeation amount. Thus, the flexible PPV/NR transdermal drug delivery patch was demonstrated to be effective in drug release−permeation based on the strength of the electrical potential, the crosslinking density and the presence of PPV as the encapsulation host. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.","chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

We chose Thai because it has several ""nonaligned"" vowels that are written prior to the consonant but phonologically follow it in speech (e.g., <ε:fn> is spoken as /fε:n/) whereas other ""aligned"" vowels are written and spoken in a corresponding order, as occurs in English (e.g., <fa:k> is spoken as /fa:k/). We employed the forced choice decision paradigm of Adelman, Marquis, and Sabatos-DeVito (2010) to examine letter identification across letter positions in 3-and 4-letter Thai legal nonword pairs. Results showed an advantage of the initial letter position for the aligned legal nonwords, as occurs in Roman script (e.g., Scaltritti & Balota, 2013). However, for the nonaligned legal nonwords, an advantage of second letter position was found which is in line with the characteristics of these types of stimuli: the critical initial consonant occurs in the second letter position. These results highlight the importance of the initial phonological letter in Thai, which is crucial for mapping orthography to phonology and for lexical access. In conclusion, these results illustrate that initial letter advantage can be shaped by the characteristics of the orthography.","arts, psychology, sociology","Language and Linguistics, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics and Language"

The three main plasmonic structures that providing this phenomenon are nanohole arrays, diffraction gratings, and nanoslit arrays. This extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon is produced as a result of surface plasmon excitations. The shifting in TSPR responses upon changing of dielectric environment at the surface of a metallic film was observed. After TSPR was discovered from metallic nanohole arrays in 1998, the number of papers about this topic rapidly increased. In the 20 years since, TSPR has been utilized to improve the detection limits, sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range of biosensing devices, resulting in them having greater potential for commercialization. This review gives a broad overview of the TSPR phenomenon, the development of this technique, and the typical experimental setups used to acquire TSPR signals; it also describes how they are applied in the field of research into biosensors.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

The purpose is to target model drug particles to the posterior region of the suprachoroidal space (SCS) of the eye controlled via pushing by hydrogel swelling. METHODS. A particle formulation containing 1% hyaluronic acid (HA) with fluorescent polymer particles and a hydrogel formulation containing 4% HA were introduced in a single syringe as two layers without mixing, and injected sequentially into the SCS of the rabbit eye ex vivo and in vivo using a microneedle. Distribution of particles in the eye was determined by microscopy. RESULTS. During injection, the particle formulation was pushed toward the middle of the SCS by the viscous hydrogel formulation, but less than 12% of particles reached the posterior SCS. After injection, the particle formulation was pushed further toward the macula and optic nerve in the posterior SCS by hydrogel swelling and spreading. Heating the eye to 37°C, or injecting in vivo decreased viscosity and mechanical strength of the hydrogel, thereby allowing it to swell and flow further in the SCS. A high salt concentration (9% NaCl) in the hydrogel formulation further increased hydrogel swelling due to osmotic flow into the hydrogel. In this way, up to 76% of particles were delivered to the posterior SCS from an injection made near the limbus. CONCLUSIONS. This study shows that model drug particles can be targeted to the posterior SCS by HA hydrogel swelling and pushing without particle functionalization or administering external driving forces.","neuroscienceoscience; techniques; drug delivery, medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

No information is available on DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks, which are commonly raised and widespread in several Asian countries. To determine the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, retrospective serum samples collected from 1,000 free-grazing ducks during 2008–2015 were tested for DTMUV infection. Our result showed that 91 (9.10%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and DTMUV seropositive ducks have been detected in Thailand since 2008. To further investigate the seroprevalence and geographic distribution of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand, a cross-sectional serological survey of DTMUV was conducted in 2016. Of 1,200 free-grazing ducks in the 60 flocks from 20 provinces located in the major free-grazing duck raising areas of Thailand, 365 (30.42%) were positive for DTMUV neutralizing antibodies and 56 flocks (93.33%) had at least one DTMUV seropositive duck. Additionally, DTMUV seropositive ducks were observed in all provinces tested. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks since 2008 and widespread DTMUV infection in free-grazing ducks in Thailand with a relatively high seroprevalence. These findings suggest the potential role of free-grazing ducks in the dissemination of DTMUV and highlight the necessity of systemic DTMUV surveillance in free-grazing ducks in addition to farm ducks for early detection, prevention, and control of this emerging disease.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Methods: Data on 925 sixth grade children in Sakaeo province, Thailand, were collected through oral examinations for dental caries and oral hygiene, social capital questionnaires, OHRQoL interviews using the Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index, parental self-administered questionnaires and school documents. A hierarchical conceptual framework was developed, and independent variables were hierarchically entered into multiple logistic models for CS OHRQoL and linear regression models for school performance. Results: After adjusting for SDES and social capital, children with high DMFT or DT scores were significantly threefold more likely to have CS impacts attributed to dental caries. However, poor oral hygiene was not significantly associated with CS impacts attributed to gingival disease. High DMFT scores were significantly associated with lower school performance, whereas high Simplified Oral Hygiene Index scores were not. The final model showed that CS impacts attributed to dental caries and school absence accounted for the association between DMFT score and school performance. Conclusions: Dental caries was associated with CS impacts on OHRQoL, and exerted its effect on school performance through the CS impacts and school absence. There was no association between oral hygiene and CS impacts on OHRQoL or school performance.","dentistry, medical","Dentistry (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infection has been increasing in the past decades. Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein (PvMSP) gene encodes a malaria vaccine candidate antigen. Its polymorphic nature leads to antigenic variation, the barrier for vaccine development, drug resistance, and potential for multiple-clone infections within the malaria patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of PvMSP1 and PvMSP3 gene in P. vivax populations in Thailand. A total of 100 P. vivax isolates collected from the western (Kanchanaburi and Tak Provinces) and southern (Ranong Provinces) regions along the Thai-Myanmar border were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Analysis of the F1, F2, and F3 regions of PvMSP1 revealed 5, 2, and 3 allelic variants, respectively. Three major types of PvMSP3-α and two major types of PvMSP3-β were identified based on the PCR product sizes. After digestion with restriction enzymes, 29, 25, 26, and 18 patterns were distinguished by RFLP for PvMSP1 (F2, Alu I), PvMSP1 (F2, Mnl I), PvMSP3-α, and PvMSP3-β, respectively. Combination of each family variant (PvMSP1 and PvMSP3) resulted in high genetic polymorphism of P. vivax population. Additionally, using PvMSP1 polymorphic marker revealed a significant association between multiple-genotype infections and P. vivax parasitemia. The results strongly supported that P. vivax populations in the endemic areas along the Thai-Myanmar border are highly diverse.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (all), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

It was 1553 bp in length containing an ORF of 1365 bp corresponding to a polypeptide of 454 amino acids. The level of PmBys1 mRNA in ovaries was greater than that in other tissues of females and in testes of males in both juveniles and wild broodstock (P <.05). In non-ablated wild female broodstock, PmBys1 mRNA significantly and progressively increased in ovaries from stage I of development, peaking at stage IV (P <.05). Its level in stages I-IV of eyestalk-ablated broodstock was greater than that in non-ablated broodstock (P <.05). Injection of exogenous serotonin (50 μg/g body weight) into 18-month-old shrimp resulted in a significantly increase of ovarian PmBys1 mRNA at 6–48 h post injection (hpi) (P <.05). PmBys1 protein (52 kDa) was found in ovarian stages I-V of non-ablated wild broodstock and II-IV of ablated wild broodstock, respectively. Along with the 52 kDa band, immunoreactive bands of 50 and 43 kDa were also observed in ovarian stages II-IV of both non-ablated and ablated broodstock and in ovaries of post-spawning broodstock. The 43 KDa band was not observed in ovarian stage I of wild female broodstock or in premature juveniles. PmBys1 protein was localized in the ooplasm of previtellogenic oocytes, nucleo-cytoplasmic compartments of vitellogenic oocytes and cortical rods of mature oocytes in wild broodstock. The results implied a possible role for PmBys1 during ovarian development in P. monodon.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Physiology, Molecular Biology"

The increasing multi-drug resistance pattern shown by the pathogen and lack of licensed vaccines make treatment of infections caused by P. stuartii challenging. As vaccinology data against the pathogen is scarce, an in silico proteome based Reverse Vaccinology (RV) protocol, in combination with subtractive proteomics is introduced in this work to screen potential vaccine candidates against P. stuartii. The analysis identified three potential vaccine candidates for designing broad-spectrum and strain-specific peptide vaccines: FimD4, FimD6, and FimD8. These proteins are essential for pathogen survival, localized in the outer membrane, virulent, and antigenic in nature. Immunoproteomic tools mapped surface exposed and non-allergenic 9mer B-cell derived T-cell antigenic epitopes for the proteins. The epitopes also show stable and rich interactions with the most predominant HLA allele (DRB1*0101) in the human population. Metabolic pathway annotation of the proteins indicated that fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher protein (FimD6) is the most suitable candidate for vaccine design, due to its involvement in several significant pathways. These pathways include: the bacterial secretion system, two-component system, β-lactam resistance, and cationic antimicrobial peptide pathways. The predicted epitopes may provide a basis for designing a peptide-based vaccine against P. stuartii.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

We aimed to develop a predictive model in Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) class C cirrhotics hospitalized with infection for optimizing treatment and improving outcomes. Clinical information was retrospectively abstracted from 244 patients at Tianjin Third Central Hospital, China (cohort 1). Factors associated with mortality were determined using logistic regression. The model for predicting 90-day mortality was then constructed by decision tree analysis. The model was further validated in 91 patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (cohort 2) and 82 patients at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Korea (cohort 3). The predictive performance of the model was compared with that of the CTP, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-Na, Chronic Liver Failure–Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and the North American consortium for the Study of End-stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) models. The 3-month mortality was 58%, 58%, and 54% in cohort 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The common methods used are fluorescent enzyme assay and immunoblotting assay. Objective: We aim to evaluate performance of the two sIgE determination systems, immunoblotting assay (Euroline) and fluorescent enzyme assay (ImmunoCAP) in comparison with SPT. Methods: Two hundred and two participants with allergic diseases were enrolled. Sensitization to common allergens was identified using skin prick test and serum specific IgE assays with Euroline and ImmunoCAP. Both systems provide the result in the same unit and the same cut-off value (0.35 kUA/L). The specific IgE levels of 4 aeroallergens, 6 food allergens and 3 food allergen components were analyzed to evaluate the performance of both sIgE assays with SPT. Results: When compared with the result of SPT, ImmunoCAP has 63.9-93.2% agreement and Euroline has 68.4-86.2% agreement for allergen detection. Both sIgE assays have significant correlation in measuring sIgE of almost all allergens (r = 0.626-0.901, p < 0.001) except for dog. For food allergen components, both sIgE tests have outstanding correlation and agreement (r = 0.816-0.952, p < 0.001; agreement = 87.0-92.9%, respectively). The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated slight discrepancy of both sIgE assays. Conclusions: Both sIgE determination systems demonstrate fair to good performance when compared to SPT depending on type of allergens.

The sorption isotherms of Cd2+ on colloids and sand at pH values of 3, 6, and 8 were characterized by batch experiments. Cd2+ sorption by colloids and sand fit well with the Freundlich model. In the column experiments, increasing the pH increased the retardation factors and KF values of Cd2+ both with and without the presence of the colloids. The amount of Cd2+ sorbed onto the montmorillonite KSF colloids in the column effluent increased from 0.29 to 0.97 mg as the pH increased. The colloid increased Cd2+ mobility and acted as a carrier at a high solution pH. The increasing level of Cd2+ sorbed on colloids as the pH increased resulted in a long tailing of the breakthrough curve (BTC) of the total Cd, indicating that the total Cd was controlled by rate-limited reactions. These findings indicate that when the solution pH was greater than the point of zero charge (PZC) of the colloids (pH > 6), the system tended to follow a nonequilibrium two-site (TSM) model rather than an equilibrium (CDeq) model. This implies that the PZC of the colloids in the groundwater system is the main factor in predicting facilitated Cd2+ transport.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Methods: The cases of patients with proven vascular pythiosis at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand from January 2006 to December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Thirteen patients were analyzed, eight of whom had underlying thalassemias. Of the remaining five patients, one had aplastic anemia, one had myelodysplasia, one had acute leukemia, one had cirrhosis, and one had alcoholism. Neutropenic patients showed a rapid clinical deterioration. Atypical presentations including carotid arteritis, aneurysm, brain abscess, and stroke occurred in the non-thalassemic patients. Serology yielded positive results in all cases, with a rapid turnaround time. Serology has the advantage of providing a presurgical diagnosis, which allows prompt surgery and clinical cure to be achieved. Pathology revealed a neutrophilic response in the acute phase and a later shift to granuloma. Immunotherapy in combination with itraconazole and terbinafine was given. The amputation rate was 77%, and disease-free surgical margins were achieved in five cases (38%). The mortality rate was 31%.

The advanced constitutive equations should be developed based on “physics” behind phenomena and should consider scaling parameters which enable their application beyond test conditions used for a code validation. Two-phase flow simulations in a rod bundle is important in various industrial apparatuses such as heat exchangers and nuclear reactors.

The assessment is often carried out in a two-step approach where immunohistochemical expression of HER2 protein is first evaluated by conventional microscopy and equivocal cases are further analyzed by in-situ hybridization techniques to assess gene amplification status. In this study we compared conventional manual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression with digital image analysis (DIA) and consensus manual assessment by a panel of three pathologists. Methods: From our archive we retrieved sections of 109 invasive breast carcinomas stained for HER2 with corresponding HER2 score from the original pathology report. The glass slides were assessed by three pathologists to reach a consensus score. Next, the slides were scanned into whole slide images and DIA was performed using Aperio Imagescope. The scoring results were then compared with gene amplification status evaluated by dual in-situ hybridization (DISH). Results: Comparing manual assessment with consensus assessment and DIA, good agreement was obtained with weighted kappa coefficients of 0.79 (manual vs. consensus) and 0.67 (manual vs. DIA). When compared with gene status assessment by DISH, agreement analysis yielded weighted kappa coefficients of 0.52 (manual vs. DISH), 0.58 (consensus vs. DISH) and 0.78 (DIA vs. DISH). There were no false negatives by any of the three methods and false positives ranging from 0.9 to 2.8%. The proportion of equivocal cases by each method was 44% (manual), 33.3% (consensus) and 14.7% (DIA). Application of DIA reduced the number of equivocal cases by 67% without increasing the proportion of false negatives. Conclusion: We conclude that DIA is an accurate method to reduce the number of HER2 equivocal cases without affecting the sensitivity of the HER2 assessment.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Cell Biology"

In Thailand, data regarding the prevalence of non-AIDS comorbidities and factors associated with metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients have not been well-documented. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 and included 874 HIV-infected patients. Results: The age of patients was 45(8) years represented as mean (standard deviation [SD]). The current CD4 count was 502(247) cells/mm3. In all, 388 (44%) of the included patients had at least 1non-AIDS comorbidity. The most frequently documented comorbidities were hyperlipidemia in 271 (70%) patients. Using multivariate analysis, older age(odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.19), male sex (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.14-2.11), high current CD4 count(OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 1.00-1.00), and taking abacavir (ABC)-containing(OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.16-5.78)and didanosine (ddI)-containing antiretroviral regimens (OR = 4.16, 95%CI = 1.09-15.84)were associated with the presence of metabolic complications (all Ps<.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of comorbidities is substantially high. Clinical monitoring and effective management of these comorbidities and metabolic complications are recommended, especially in HIV-infected patients who present with these associated factors.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Dermatology, Infectious Diseases"
Optimization and mechanisms of As(III) removal from aqueous solution using Fe-MCM-41 immobilized on GAC,"Wantala K., Keawbuddee C., Sthiannopkao S., Chanpiwat P.",2018-04-01,"Adsorption capacities, Box-Behnken design, Boxbehnken design (BBD), Initial concentration, Interference effects, Rate-controlling steps, Removal efficiencies, Response surface methodology, Adsorbent loading, Adsorption isotherm, Arsenic, Box-Behnken design, Fe-MCM-41/GAC, Physisorption","Groundwater contaminated with high arsenic (As) concentration has become a global problem of health concerns for many decades. Therefore, a removal of As is an urgent action needed for countries where the groundwater is a main source of drinking water. The objectives of this work were to study i) the removal mechanisms and effects of solution pH, adsorbent loading, and initial concentration on As adsorption by Fe-MCM-41/GAC and ii) the interference effects of anions and cations on the adsorption process. The Box-Behnken Design (BBD) based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied for the batch experimental designs. Comparing to GAC, higher adsorption rate and capacity were found in the Fe-MCM-41/GAC. The experimental results which fit well to Freundlich isotherm confirmed a multi-layer adsorption on adsorbent surface. The maximum adsorption capacity of Fe-MCM-41/GAC was 133 μg g-1. The sorption energy of As(III) ranging from 0.0415 to 0.0451 kJ mol-1 indicating that As(III) adsorption process on Fe-MCM-41/GAC is a physisorption. The adsorption was a rate controlling step for As(III) removal. The increases in solution pH and initial As(III) concentration caused a reduction in the removal efficiency. While, higher adsorbent loading resulted in an increase in removal efficiency. For the interference effects, 25% and 50% reduction in the removal efficiencies were found when NO3- and SO42-, respectively, were increased from 500 to 1000 μg L-1. In contrast, 40% and 10% increases in removal efficiencies were found when Fe3+ and Mn2+, respectively, were increased to 1000 μg L-1.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this study, the diagnostic characteristics of 10 CSFV assays were evaluated using individual serum (n = 601) and/or oral fluid (n = 1417) samples collected from −14 to 28 days post inoculation (DPI). Serum samples were assayed by virus isolation (VI), 2 commercial antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), virus neutralization (VN), and 3 antibody ELISAs. Both serum and oral fluid samples were tested with 3 commercial real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. One or more serum samples was positive by VI from DPIs 3 to 21 and by antigen-capture ELISAs from DPIs 6 to 17. VN-positive serum samples were observed at DPIs ≥ 7 and by antibody ELISAs at DPIs ≥ 10. CSFV RNA was detected in serum samples from DPIs 2 to 28 and in oral fluid samples from DPIs 4 to 28. Significant differences in assay performance were detected, but most importantly, no single combination of sample and assay was able to dependably identify CSFV-inoculated pigs throughout the 4-week course of the study. The results show that effective surveillance for CSFV, especially low virulence strains, will require the use of PCR-based assays for the detection of early infections (<14 days) and antibody-based assays, thereafter.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Veterinary (all)"

IL-33 expression is strongly upregulated in the nucleus of keratinocytes and serum of patients with psoriasis. However, the role of IL-33 in psoriasis is unclear, and IL-33 expression in the lesional psoriatic skin after conventional systemic treatments has not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to compare IL-33 mRNA in patients’ lesional skin samples and IL-33 protein expression in patients’ serum before and after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB). IL-33 mRNA levels in lesional skin and IL-33 protein levels in serum were downregulated after treatment with MTX. Results revealed a significant decrease in IL-33 protein expression (P = 0.028). IL-33 expression increased after NB-UVB treatment. IL-33 production is associated with inflammatory skin in psoriasis, possibly through its cytokine function. However, high expression of IL-33 after NB-UVB treatment suggests the occurrence of unknown functions to alleviate psoriatic lesions without IL-33 involvement.",medical,Dermatology
Effectiveness of the Simultaneous Stretching of the Achilles Tendon and Plantar Fascia in Individuals With Plantar Fasciitis,"Engkananuwat P., Kanlayanaphotporn R., Purepong N.",2018-01-01,"Achilles Tendon, Ankle, Calcaneus, Fasciitis, Plantar, Foot, Heel, Humans, Muscle, Skeletal, Pain Measurement, Prospective Studies, Range of Motion, Articular, Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, plantar fasciitis, plantar heel pain, stretching","Background: Since the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon are anatomically connected, it is plausible that stretching of both structures simultaneously will result in a better outcome for plantar fasciitis. Methods: Fifty participants aged 40 to 60 years with a history of plantar fasciitis greater than 1 month were recruited. They were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 was instructed to stretch the Achilles tendon while group 2 simultaneously stretched the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia. Results: After 4 weeks of both stretching protocols, participants in group 2 demonstrated a significantly greater pressure pain threshold than participants in group 1 (P =.040) with post hoc analysis. No significant differences between groups were demonstrated in other variables (P >.05). Concerning within-group comparisons, both interventions resulted in significant reductions in pain at first step in the morning and average pain at the medial plantar calcaneal region over the past 24 hours, while there were increases in the pressure pain threshold, visual analog scale–foot and ankle score, and range of motion in ankle dorsiflexion (P <.001). More participants in group 2 described their symptoms as being much improved to being completely improved than those in group 1. Conclusion: The simultaneous stretching of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia for 4 weeks was a more effective intervention for plantar fasciitis.

Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Control and Optimization, Information Systems and Management"

DMSP is believed to be synthesized from methionine by a four-step reaction pathway in marine algae. The genes responsible for biosynthesis of DMSP remain unidentified. A diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 is an important component of marine ecosystems and contributes greatly to the world's primary production. In this study, through genome search, in vivo activity and functional studies of cDNA products, a gene encoding Thalassiosira methyltransferase (TpMMT) which catalyzes the key step of DMSP synthesis formation of 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutyrate (DMSHB) from 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate (MTHB), was identified. The amino acid sequence of TpMMT was homologous to the methyltransferase from Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1, but not the recently identified bacterium gene. High salinity and nitrogen limitation stresses caused the increase of DMSP content and TpMMT protein in Thalassiosira. In addition to TpMMT, the enzyme activities for the first three steps could be detected and enhanced under high salinity, suggesting the importance of four-step DMSP synthetic pathway in Thalassiosira.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"
CAMSAP3 maintains neuronal polarity through regulation of microtubule stability,"Pongrakhananon V., Saito H., Hiver S., Abe T., Shioi G., Meng W., Takeichi M.",2018-09-25,"Acetylation, Animals, Cell Polarity, Hippocampus, Mice, Mice, Knockout, Microtubule-Associated Proteins, Microtubules, Neurons, Tubulin, Axon, CAMSAP, Microtubule, Neuronal polarity, αTAT1","The molecular mechanisms that guide each neuron to become polarized, forming a single axon and multiple dendrites, remain unknown. Here we show that CAMSAP3 (calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3), a protein that regulates the minusend dynamics of microtubules, plays a key role in maintaining neuronal polarity. In mouse hippocampal neurons, CAMSAP3 was enriched in axons. Although axonal microtubules were generally acetylated, CAMSAP3 was preferentially localized along a lessacetylated fraction of the microtubules. CAMSAP3-mutated neurons often exhibited supernumerary axons, along with an increased number of neurites having nocodazole-resistant/acetylated microtubules compared with wild-type neurons. Analysis using cell lines showed that CAMSAP3 depletion promoted tubulin acetylation, and conversely, mild overexpression of CAMSAP3 inhibited it, suggesting that CAMSAP3 works to retain nonacetylated microtubules. In contrast, CAMSAP2, a protein related to CAMSAP3, was detected along all neurites, and its loss did not affect neuronal polarity, nor did it cause increased tubulin acetylation. Depletion of α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1), the key enzyme for tubulin acetylation, abolished CAMSAP3 loss-dependent multiple-axon formation. These observations suggest that CAMSAP3 sustains a nonacetylated pool of microtubules in axons, interfering with the action of αTAT1, and this process is important to maintain neuronal polarity.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

We investigated the differential gene modulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream mediators on the intestinal mucosa of neonatal pigs infected with PEDV S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains. Ten five-day-old piglets were inoculated orally with 10 ml of 104 TCDI50/ml of either PEDV non-S-INDEL or S-INDEL strains. PEDV S-INDEL infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by activating RIG-I.

The assay relied on an enzymatic transamination of AKG and D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine to form 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid and L-glutamic acid using D-phenylglycine aminotransferase. Since 4-hydroxybenzoylformic acid absorbed UV strongly at 334 nm, the initial rate of the reaction was determined by the increasing absorbance at this wavelength without the need for colorimetric probes or coupling reactions, and this information was used for the construction of a standard curve against AKG concentration. The method showed good linearity (r2 = 0.9994) over an AKG concentration range of 20–160 μM. The limits of detection and quantitation were 4.09 and 13.62 μM respectively. It was simple, inexpensive, accurate and precise, as well as repeatable, and was not interfered with by excipients in the samples. Regarding the environmental friendliness, the method was free from the use of organic solvents or hazardous reagents and required no chemical pre-treatment of samples. The proposed method gave assay results tested in real samples in agreement with the HPLC method and commercial assay kits, therefore being suitable for routine analysis of AKG in quality control laboratories.","protein biochemistryistryhemistry; genergyal enzymology; kinetics, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

The screen-printed graphene electrode was used as working electrode providing sensitivity for the sensor. The amperometric detection of AChE is based on the determination of thiocholine (TCh) produced from hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCh) by AChE. To detect TCh, the ATCh immobilized sheet was stacked onto the detection sheet using double adhesive tape, then samples of AChE were dropped on the back side of an ATCh immobilized sheet with only 1 min of incubation time. To avoid interference, glutathione (GSH), the potential of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied onto a graphene electrode and the current, which depends on AChE concentration, was measured. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) from the experiment of AChE determination was 0.1 U/mL with AChE concentration in range of 0.1–15 U/mL. The data correlated well with the data obtained using spectrophotometric method.

As potential wound dressings, the chitin and CCH gels were then evaluated for their water absorption, enzymatic degradation and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and biocompatibility with the L929 cell line. The chitin gel had a water absorption of approximately 231 ± 22% of its dry weight, which was higher in the CCH gels than that prepared from chitosan microbeads:chitin (w/w) in ther ratio of 0.1:1 which had the highest water absorption (308 ± 13% of its dry weight). Both the chitin and CCH hydrogels were gradually surface-degraded by lysozyme (1.4 g/mL), being reduced to 47.5 ± 7.5 and 55.3 ± 2.9% of their wet weight, respectively, after 7 days. The water adsorption, effective antibacterial activity and biocompatibility of the CCH gels suggest their potential for applications in medical fields as wound dressings for wound healing.","mixing and separation, chemistry",Chemistry (all)

Stand age of rubber plantations obtained at fine scales provides essential baseline data, informing the pace of industrial and smallholder agricultural activities in response to the changing global rubber markets, and local political and socioeconomic dynamics. In this study, we developed an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model using Landsat annual time series to estimate the age of rubber plantations in a 21,115 km2 tri-border region along the junction of China, Myanmar and Laos. We produced a rubber stand age map at 30 m resolution, with an accuracy of 87.00% for identifying rubber plantations and an average error of 1.53 years in age estimation. The integration of pixel- and object-based image analysis showed superior performance in building NDVI yearly time series that reduced spectral noises from background soil and vegetation in open-canopy, young rubber stands. The model parameters remained relatively stable during model sensitivity analysis, resulting in accurate age estimation robust to outliers. Compared to the typically weak statistical relationship between single-date spectral signatures and rubber tree age, Landsat image time series analysis coupled with tree growth modeling presents a viable alternative for fine-scale age estimation of rubber plantations.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, computer science, earth sciences","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Engineering (miscellaneous), Computer Science Applications, Computers in Earth Sciences"
Three-Stage Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (ASBR) for maximum methane production: Effects of COD loading rate and reactor volumetric ratio,"Jiraprasertwong A., Vichaitanapat K., Leethochawalit M., Chavadej S.",2018-06-01,"Anaerobic process, Anaerobic sequencing batch reactors, Chemical oxygen demand removals, Energy productions, Mesophilic temperature, Methane production, Microbial concentrations, Volumetric ratio, Hydrogen, Mesophilic temperature, Methane production, Reactor volumetric ratio, Three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR)","A three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system was developed as a new anaerobic process with an emphasis on methane production from ethanol wastewater. The three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system consisted of three bioreactors connected in series. It was operated at 37◦C with a fixed recycle ratio of 1:1 (final effluent flow rate to feed flow rate) and the washout sludge from the third bioreactor present in the final effluent was allowed to be recycled to the first bioreactor. The pH of the first bioreactor was controlled at 5.5, while the pH values of the other two bioreactors were not controlled. Under the optimum chemical oxygen demand loading rate of 18 kg/m3d (based on the feed chemical oxygen demand load and total volume of the three bioreactors) with a bioreactor volumetric ratio of 5:5:20, the system provided the highest gas production performance in terms of yields of both hydrogen and methane and the highest overall chemical oxygen demand removal. Interestingly, the three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system gave a much higher energy production rate and a higher optimum chemical oxygen demand loading rate than previously reported anaerobic systems since it was able to maintain very high microbial concentrations in all bioreactors with very high values of both alkalinity and solution pH, especially in the third bioreactor, resulting in sufficient levels of micronutrients for anaerobic digestion.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, process equipment, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Surface-Dependence of Adsorption and Its Influence on Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Reaction: A Case of Photocatalytic Degradation of Linuron on Zinc Oxide,"Meephon S., Rungrotmongkol T., Kaiyawet N., Puttamat S., Pavarajarn V.",2018-03-01,"Adsorption capacities, Degradation intermediates, Degradation pathways, Molecular simulations, Photo catalytic degradation, Photocatalytic degradation pathways, Photocatalytic reactions, Surface dependence, Adsorption, Degradation pathway, Photocatalysis, Surface dependence","Abstract: This work systematically investigates a discrepancy in photocatalytic degradation pathway observed even when same kind of photocatalyst is used. This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compound because the shifting in the pathway may result in intermediates having increased toxicity. Linuron, which is a toxic herbicide, is used as a model compound and zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a catalyst. Two forms of ZnO having different exposing surfaces, i.e., conventional particles and nanorods are considered. It is experimentally shown and confirmed by molecular simulation that the adsorption and subsequent degradation are surface dependent. The adsorption capacity of linuron on polar surfaces of ZnO is much higher than that on non-polar surface. More importantly, alignments of linuron molecule adsorbing on different surfaces are different, leading to formation of different degradation intermediates. The degradation takes place on both aliphatic and aromatic sides when linuron adsorbs on polar surfaces whereas only the aliphatic part is attacked by hydroxyl radicals on the non-polar mixed terminated surface. The results in this work indicate that the exposing surface of the photocatalyst is the key factor in determining the degradation pathway and it should be considered in the catalyst design.

Sulindac (Sul), an anionic drug, was loaded on the DPNR patch using silicone oil as a plasticizer. The in vitro release-permeation behavior of Sul from the Sul-loaded DPNR patch was studied by using a modified Franz diffusion cell at a pH of 7.4 and temperature of 37 °C. A cytotoxicity test of the DPNR with silicone oil (DPNR-Si) patch was performed, and the viability percentage was 90%. When external electrical potentials of 0–9 V were applied, the maximum amounts of Sul released and permeated from the Sul-loaded DPNR patch were 8.34, 10.16, 11.86, 19.84, 54.73, 70.89, 82.25, and 83.02% for electrical potentials of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 V, respectively. The release and permeation amount of Sul increased with the increasing electrical potential because of the electrorepulsive force, expanded pathway in pigskin, and pore formation in DPNR. Pore formation occurred under an applied electric field, as confirmed by optical micrographs. The porosity percentage increased with the increasing time and electrical potential due to the drug release and permeation and lack of plasticizer. The effect of storage time on the permeation characteristics was studied for 3 months. The release and permeation amount of Sul was 8.61 and 6.80 wt% for storage times of 1 and 3 months, respectively. Thus, the fabricated Sul-loaded DPNR patch is an electrically controllable TDD patch.

Although cryopreservation has been successfully to preserve mammalian gametes for decades, coral cryopreservation was attempted for the first time less than 15 years ago, and freezing protocols exist for only a handful of coral species. The present study developed a cryopreservation protocol for the sperm of the common Indo-Pacific reef-builder Acropora humilis. Colonies of reefs of Sattahip Bay, Chonburi Province, Thailand were collected from 3 m depth with a mesh net during a spawning event. Immediately after collection, the sperm were isolated and subjected to a two-step freezing method featuring DMSO, polyethylene glycol, or methanol as the cryoprotectant. Viability and motility were assessed via a bioluminescence technique and a “computer-assisted semen analysis, and it was found that a 15-min equilibration with 2 M DMSO followed by cooling at 41.7 °C was the optimum cryopreservation protocol for A. humilis sperm. The post-thaw sperm achieved 45% fertilization success, and 35% of the fertilized eggs developed into blastopore larvae. The present optimized protocol can therefore facilitate the preservation of sperm for future propagation efforts of this species and provide an experimental platform for optimizing cryopreservation protocols for gametes of other scleractinian coral species.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

The changes of FTIR spectra were monitored during the introduction of hydrogen at 40 °C and atmospheric pressure for 130 min. The degrees of Lewis acid transformation were varied by addition of non-reducible (SiO2 and Al2O3) and reducible (ZrO2, TiO2 and CeO2) oxides to the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts as the hybrid catalysts. According to the in situ DRIFTS, the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and the hydrogen temperature programmed desorption (H2-TPD) results, the introduction of hydrogen resulted in a decrease in the amount of ammonia adsorbed on Lewis acid sites, and an increase in the amount of ammonium ions on Bronsted acid sites with time on stream. It is proposed that ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred during the introduction of hydrogen in the presence of Pt particles when compared to the observation of only observed catalysts (without Pt particles). The addition of reducible oxides led to the high rate of Lewis acid transformation, which was higher than those of the non-reducible oxides. Weaker Lewis acid sites and higher amount of hydrogen spillover over the observed catalysts enhanced the rate of Lewis acid transformation in this study. However, the amount of Lewis acid sites at the initial stage did not play an important role in these transformations.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

The emergence of carbapenem resistance in non-baumannii Acinetobacter has increased in clinical settings worldwide. We investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis Thai isolates. Methodology. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex isolates were identified by gyrB mulitplex PCR. Carbapenem susceptibilities were studied by the agar dilution method and carbapenemase genes were detected by multiplex PCR. Reductions of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Overexpressions of efflux pumps were detected by using efflux pump inhibitors and RT-PCR. Results. Of the 346 Acb isolates, 22 and 19 were A. pittii and A. nosocomialis, respectively. The carbapenem resistance rates were 22.7% in A. pittii and 26.3% in A. nosocomialis. Three carbapenem-resistant A. pittii carried bla OXA-23 . One carbapenemresistant A. pittii harboured blaOXA-58, while another isolate co-harboured blaOXA-58 and blaIMP-14a. bla OXA-58 was also found in three carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii. Five carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis carried bla OXA-23 . Eighteen A. pittii isolates carried bla OXA-213-like . Reduced OMPs were found in carbapenem-resistant and -susceptible A. pittii carrying blaOXA-58, but were not detected in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis isolates. Overexpression of adeE was found in carbapenemresistant A. pittii. No efflux pump genes were present in carbapenem-resistant A. nosocomialis. Conclusion. The major mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in A. pittii and A. nosocomialis were the production of OXA-23 and OXA-58. Overexpression of adeE played a role in carbapenem resistance in A. pittii. Since blaOXA-58 was found in carbapenem-susceptible A. pittii, using carbapenems in the treatment of A. pittii infection should be considered.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"
Protein kinase a and high-osmolarity glycerol response pathways cooperatively control cell wall carbohydrate mobilization in aspergillus fumigatus,"de Assis L.J., Manfiolli A., Mattos E., Fabri J.H.T.M., Malavazi I., Jacobsen I.D., Brock M., Cramer R.A., Thammahong A., Hagiwara D., Ries L.N.A., Goldman G.H.",2018-11-01,"Aspergillus fumigatus, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Cell Wall, Cyclic AMP, Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases, Gene Regulatory Networks, Glycerol, Glycogen, Humans, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases, Signal Transduction, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cell wall, Glycogen, High-osmotic glycerol pathway, MpkC, Protein kinase A, SakA, Trehalose","Aspergillus fumigatus mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in maintaining the normal morphology of the cell wall and providing resistance against cell wall-damaging agents. Upon cell wall stress, cell wall-related sugars need to be synthesized from carbohydrate storage compounds. Here we show that this process is dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity and regulated by the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) MAPKs SakA and MpkC. These protein kinases are necessary for normal accumulation/degradation of trehalose and glycogen, and the lack of these genes reduces glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Alterations in glycogen synthesis were observed for the sakA and mpkC deletion mutants, which also displayed alterations in carbohydrate exposure on the cell wall. Carbohydrate mobilization is controlled by SakA interaction with PkaC1 and PkaR, suggesting a putative mechanism where the PkaR regulatory subunit leaves the complex and releases the SakA-PkaC1 complex for activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate mobilization. This work reveals the communication between the HOG and PKA pathways for carbohydrate mobilization for cell wall construction. IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic human pathogen causing allergic reactions or systemic infections such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, especially in immunocompromised patients. The fungal cell wall is the main component responsible for recognition by the immune system, due to the specific composition of polysaccharide carbohydrates exposed on the surface of the fungal cell wall called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Key enzymes in the fungal cell wall biosynthesis are a good target for fungal drug development. This report elucidates the cooperation between the HOG and PKA pathways in the mobilization of carbohydrates for fungal cell wall biosynthesis. We suggest that the reduced mobilization of simple sugars causes defects in the structure of the fungal cell wall. In summary, we propose that SakA is important for PKA activity, therefore regulating the availability and mobilization of monosaccharides for fungal cell wall biosynthesis during cell wall damage and the osmotic stress response.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology","Microbiology, Virology"

This study examined protozoal and bacterial infection in questing ticks in forest habitats in Chonburi Province, Thailand in 2015, using PCR and DNA sequencing techniques. A total of 12,184 ticks were morphologically identified to species and a subset of ticks were confirmed by PCR, targeting the tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Tick species collected included Haemaphysalis lagrangei (92.8%), H. wellingtoni (0.1%), and Rhipicephalus microplus (7.0%). In total, 419 tick pools [ELM(1] [ST2] were examined by PCR amplification of a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia and Theileria species, and the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae. Results revealed a tick infection rate for the tick pools of 57.0% (239/419) including four pathogens and one bacterial symbiont. The highest infection rate in H. lagrangei, H. wellingtoni, and R. microplus pools was recorded for Anaplasma spp. at 55.6% (233/419) including three Anaplasma species genotype groups Anaplasma spp. closely related to A. bovis, A. platys, and unidentified Anaplasma spp. Theileria spp. showed a lower infection rate in H. lagrangei at 4.3% (18/419) with three Theileria species genotypes closely related to T. cervi, T. capreoli, and unidentified Theileria spp. Only 0.2% (1/419) of H. lagrangei pools contained Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp., or Wolbachia spp. [ELM(3] [ST4] These findings provided information on tick species in wildlife habitats and detected protozoa and bacteria in the ticks.

This paper explores a more global outlook by aiming at finding a promising grasping plane (instead of individual points) to place the three contact points. The paper presents a heuristic method to find a plane through the object to place the three finger contact. The input of the method is the input mesh model of the object.

The study area has shallow acidic groundwater that is contaminated with As and heavy metals. The local people often consume this shallow groundwater; thus, they are exposed to As and heavy metals. Hair and fingernail samples were collected to characterize the differences between shallow groundwater drinking (SGWD) and tap water drinking (TWD) residents. The concentrations of As and the heavy metals Cd, Pb and Hg were significantly higher in the hair samples from the SGWD group than those from the TWD group, especially for As (0.020–0.571 vs. 0.024–0.359 µg/g) and Cd (0.009–0.575 vs. 0.013–0.230 µg/g). Similarly, the concentrations of As and the heavy metals in the fingernail samples collected from the SGWD group were larger than those of the TWD group, especially for As (0.039–2.440 µg/g vs. 0.049–0.806 µg/g). The χ2 statistic and binary logistic regression were used to find the associated factors and assess the associated probabilities. The regression results show that the factors associated with the concentrations of As and the heavy metals in the hair samples were drinking water source, rate of water consumption, gender, bathing water source, education, smoking and underlying disease, whereas the factors associated with the concentrations of these species in the fingernail samples were drinking water source, gender, occupation, work hours per day, alcohol consumption, and the use of pesticides.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; biomonitoring, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

However, the miRNA function in shrimp antiviral response is not clearly understood. This research aims to uncover the function of pmo-miR-315, a white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-responsive miRNAs identified from Penaeus monodon hemocytes during WSSV infection. The expression of the predicted pmo-miR-315 target mRNA, a novel PmPPAE gene called PmPPAE3, was negatively correlated with that of the pmo-miR-315. Furthermore, the luciferase assay indicated that the pmo-miR-315 directly interacted with the target site in PmPPAE3 suggesting the regulatory role of pmo-miR-315 on PmPPAE3 gene expression. Introducing the pmo-miR-315 into the WSSV-infected shrimp caused the reduction of the PmPPAE3 transcript level and, hence, the PO activity activated by the PmPPAE3 whereas the WSSV copy number in the shrimp hemocytes was increased. Taken together, our findings state a crucial role of pmo-miR-315 in attenuating proPO activation via PPAE3 gene suppression and facilitating the WSSV propagation in shrimp WSSV infection.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

We recruited patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit schizophrenia and healthy volunteers (n = 40). The combined use of TRYCAT and CERAD features strongly segregates deficit from nondeficit schizophrenia and healthy controls. Three out of the top five most important features in LRA, SVM and SIMCA agreed, namely two different NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratios and false memory recall. SIMCA shows that deficit schizophrenia is significantly separated from nondeficit schizophrenia and controls with as top 6 features IgA responses to picolinic acid, IgM responses to 3-OH-kynurenine and kynurenic acid, and impairments in Word List Memory and Verbal Fluency Tests and Mini-Mental State Examination. Nevertheless, nondeficit schizophrenia was not significantly separated from controls. The results show that schizophrenia is not a unitary disease with mere continuous differences in severity of illness between apparent subtypes. Deficit schizophrenia is a qualitatively distinct class defined by neuroimmune (autoimmune responses to TRYCATs) and neurocognitive (episodic and semantic memory) features coupled or not with clinical (negative) symptoms.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) and co-continuous composites, due to an interconnection on the macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This novel composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results showed that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of the Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxy resin, yield stiffer IPCs than either of the two individual materials alone. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to the brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The more isolated the living, the more important individual social capital may become. Standard factors proposed by the Andersen model of healthcare utilization serve as control variables. Data for 2526 households from the 2012 Bhutan Living Standards Survey, which contains a social capital module covering structural, cognitive and output dimensions of social capital, are used. The results from the logistic regression analysis show that individual social capital is positively related with the probability of seeking treatment when ill or injured. Informal social contacts and perceived help and support are most important in rural areas, whereas specific trust matters in urban areas. The explanatory power of the model using a subset of the data for urban areas only, however, is very low as most predisposing and enabling factors are insignificant, which is not surprising though in view of better access to health facilities in urban areas and the fact that healthcare is provided free of charge in Bhutan. Multinomial regression results further show that structural and output dimensions of social capital influence the likelihood of seeking care at secondary or tertiary care facilities relative to primary care facilities. Moreover, economic status and place of residence are significantly associated with healthcare utilization and choice of health facility. The findings with respect to social capital suggest that strategizing and organizing social capital may help improve healthcare utilization in Bhutan.","Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, sociology, arts","Health (social science), History and Philosophy of Science"

Methods: The study comprises 328 multiple-injury adult patients who underwent diagnostic CT during 2013. Each patient’s cumulative CT radiation exposure was calculated and the biological effects of ionizing radiation VII methodology was used to estimate the LAR of cancer incidence on the basis of sex and age at each exposure. Results: The average cumulative dose per patient was 19.4 mSv. One point five percent (5/328) of the patients received a cumulative effective dose ≥100 mSv and 63.7 % of patients received a cumulative effective dose ≤20 mSv. The average LAR of cancer incidence was 0.14 % or 1 in 714 patients. Only one patient had an LAR >1 %, a man <30 years of age. The group of major injuries [injury severity score (ISS) >15] had a statistically significantly greater accumulative effective dose and slightly greater LAR than the group of minor injuries (ISS ≤15). Conclusions: More than half of the multiple-injury trauma patients were classified as low risk cumulative effective dose (≤20 mSv) and almost all patients had a low LAR risk of cancer incidence from CT studies. Patients who were at the highest risk of cancer from CT scans were those aged under 30 years who had multiple or repeated scans, particularly in the trunk.",medical,"Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

Because the proposed method uses infrared light for illumination, the method can be used to detect a pulse wave on a human face without visible lighting. The corresponding two-band pixel values in the video signals can be separated into hemoglobin and shading components by application of a separation matrix in logarithmic space for the two pixel values. Because the shading component has been separated, the extracted hemoglobin component is then robust to fluctuations in the illumination. The pixel values in the region of interest were spatially averaged over all the pixels of each frame. These averaged values were then used to form the raw trace signal. Finally, the pulse wave and the corresponding pulse rate were obtained from the raw trace signal through several signal processing stages, including detrending, use of an adaptive bandpass filter, and peak detection. We evaluated the absolute error rate for the pulse rate between the estimated value and the ground truth obtained using an electrocardiogram. In the experiments, we found that the performance of the proposed method was greatly improved compared with that of conventional methods using single-band infrared video.","biochemistryistry, computer science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Artificial Intelligence"

The data was found to be a good fit with Antoine, August, Riedel and Wagner equation. Regression constants prove to be very useful in estimating psat at operating temperature. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding affected D2EHPA having lower psat in comparison with TBP. Thermodynamic properties of both molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization were obtained using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As temperature increased, molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization decreased showing a positive deviation from Trouton's rule. Using the relations of molar enthalpy and temperature, saturated liquid heat capacity was obtained. All data can be usefully employed for the design of a distillation column or evaporator for recycling of both extractants from organic wastewater.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Knowing the contribution of genetic factors, which significantly influence tacrolimus variability, is beneficial in the personalization of its starting dose. The significant impact of CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms on tacrolimus exposure has been reported. Conflicting results of the additional influence of POR*28 polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetic interindividual variability have been observed among different populations. The objective of this study was to explore the interaction between POR*28 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms and their main effects on tacrolimus trough concentration to dose ratios on day 7 after kidney transplantation. Methods: Two hundred sixteen adult kidney transplant recipients participated in this retrospective study. All participants received a twice daily tacrolimus regimen. Blood samples and data were collected on day 7 after transplantation. A 2-way analysis of covariance was performed. Tested covariates were age, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and prednisolone dose. Results: A 2 · 2 analysis of covariance revealed that the interaction between CYP3A5 polymorphisms (CYP3A5 expresser and CYP3A5 nonexpresser) and POR polymorphisms (POR*28 carrier and POR*28 noncarrier) was not significant (F(1, 209) = 2.473, P = 0.117, h 2 P = 0.012). The predicted main effect of CYP3A5 and POR polymorphisms was significant (F(1, 209) = 105.565, P, 0.001, h 2 P = 0.336 and F(1, 209) = 4.007, P = 0.047, h 2 P = 0.019, respectively).

Conclusions: After adjusting for the influences of hemoglobin, age, and prednisolone dose, significant impacts of the CYP3A5 and POR polymorphisms on tacrolimus exposure were found. The effect of POR*28 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms during the very early period after kidney transplantation is independent of each other.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

A complete Gurtin–Murdoch surface elasticity is employed to consider the influence of surface stresses. The indentation problem of a rigid frictionless punch with arbitrary axisymmetric profiles is formulated by employing the displacement Green’s functions, derived with the aid of Hankel integral transform technique. The problem is solved by assuming the contact pressure distribution in terms of a linear combination of admissible functions and undetermined coefficients. Those coefficients are then obtained by employing a collocation technique and an efficient numerical quadrature scheme. The accuracy of proposed solution technique is verified by comparing with existing solutions for rigid indentation on an elastic half-space. Selected numerical results for the indenters with flat-ended cylindrical and paraboloidal punch profiles are presented to portray the influence of surface energy effects on elastic fields of the finite layer. It is found that the presence of surface stresses renders the layer stiffer, and the size-dependent behavior of elastic fields is observed in the present solutions. In addition, the surface energy effects become more pronounced with smaller contact area; thus, the influence of surface energy cannot be ignored in the analysis of indentation problem especially when the indenter size is very small such as in the case of nanoindentation.","Mathematics, physics","Mathematics (all), Physics and Astronomy (all), Applied Mathematics"

Our objective was to determine whether HIIT and supramaximal high-intensity intermittent training (supra-HIIT) would improve vascular structure and function in obese preadolescent boys. Methods: Before the baseline testing, 48 obese preadolescent boys, aged 8-12 years, were randomly assigned into control (CON; n = 16), HIIT (8 × 2 minutes at 90% peak power output, n = 16), and supra-HIIT (8 × 20 seconds at 170% peak power output, n = 16) groups. Both exercise groups performed exercises on a cycle ergometer three times/week for 12 weeks. Results: After 12 weeks, both HIIT and supra-HIIT did not affect body mass, body fat percentage, and waist circumference. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) increased in both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups (p < 0.05). Both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups had higher resting metabolic rate than the control group (p < 0.05). A measure of arterial stiffness, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and carotid intima-media thickness decreased after 12 weeks of HIIT and supra-HIIT program (all p < 0.05). Flow-mediated dilation, a measure of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, increased in both HIIT and supra-HIIT groups (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: It is concluded that both HIIT and supra-HIIT have favorable effects on aerobic capacity, metabolic rate, vascular function and structure, and blood lipid profile in obese preadolescent boys. HIIT may be a time efficient and effective exercise for preventing future cardiovascular disease in obese children.","medical, Nursing","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The current study aims to examine superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase, lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and uric acid (UA) in participants with and without generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) co-occurring or not with BD, MDD, or tobacco use disorder. Z unit-weighted composite scores were computed as indices of nitro-oxidative stress driving lipid and protein oxidation. SOD1, LOOH, NOx, and uric acid were significantly higher and HDL and PON1 significantly lower in participants with GAD than in those without GAD. GAD was more adequately predicted by increased SOD + LOOH + NOx and lowered HDL + PON1 composite scores. Composite scores of nitro-oxidative stress coupled with aldehyde and AOPP production were significantly increased in participants with comorbid GAD + MDD as compared with all other study groups, namely MDD, GAD + BD, BD, GAD, and healthy controls. In conclusion, GAD is characterized by increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses, while increased uric acid levels in GAD may protect against aldehyde production and protein oxidation. This study suggests that increased nitro-oxidative stress and especially increased SOD1 activity, NO production, and lipid peroxidation as well as lowered HDL-cholesterol and PON1 activity could be novel drug targets for GAD especially when comorbid with MDD.","psychologyhiatry, neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

It produces cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that could damage mammalian cells and tissues. CDT is a tripartite protein toxin composed of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. We have previously indicated that CdtA is a lipoprotein and that the proteolytic processing of CdtA is important for biogenesis and secretion of CDT holotoxin. Here, we established an in vitro processing assay of CdtA and investigated the interactions of CdtA with other Cdt subunits. This assay demonstrated that incubation of membrane-bound CdtA (MCdtA), CdtB, and CdtC immediately generated a processed form of CdtA (CdtA'), which is recovered from the soluble fraction. In contrast, incubation of soluble membraneunbound CdtA with CdtB and CdtC did not yield any CdtA'. Furthermore, incubation of CdtC with MCdtA was enough to induce rapid processing of MCdtA, whereas CdtB alone was unable to induce the processing. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that CdtA' and CdtC formed a complex. Furthermore, subsequent addition of CdtB to this reaction mixture resulted in complete CDT holotoxin complex. The cytolethal distending activity assay demonstrated that CDT complex containing CdtA' showed far stronger cytotoxicity than that containing CdtA. Collectively, our data suggest that CDT holotoxin formation in vivo is a sequential event: interaction of MCdtA and CdtC induces proteolytic processing of MCdtA, and the released CdtA' forms a complex with CdtC. Subsequent binding of CdtB to the CdtA'/CdtC complex results in CDT holotoxin formation.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

It is therefore important to select the appropriate patients for this treatment. We investigated symptoms and demographic, manometric, and other factors associated with outcomes of biofeedback therapy in patients with DD. Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of 2 prospective studies of biofeedback therapy in 127 adult outpatients (18–75 years old, 120 female) with chronic constipation who failed to respond to treatment with dietary fiber or laxatives (>1 year) and were diagnosed with DD based on standard criteria. In each study, patients received 1-hour, biweekly office biofeedback therapy (6 sessions) or home biofeedback therapy with a device. A therapist used visual feedback, postural, and diaphragmatic breathing techniques to teach subjects to improve defecation. Treatment success was defined by a composite of normalization of dyssynergia pattern and increase of 20 mm in baseline bowel satisfaction score. Factors were compared between the treatment success and failure groups. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 77 (61%) had treatment success. Dyssynergia was corrected in 78% of patients and bowel satisfaction improved in 64% of patients. Baseline demographic features, constipation symptoms, manometric and sensory parameters, balloon expulsion time, and colonic transit results were similar between treatment failure and success groups. Patients with lower baseline bowel satisfaction score (P =.008) and patients who used digital maneuvers (P =.04) were more likely to have successful biofeedback therapy. Conclusions: Biofeedback therapy is successful in more than 60% of patients with DD. Patients who used digital maneuvers and patients with lower baseline levels of bowel satisfaction were more likely to have treatment success, whereas other factors were not associated with success.

Specifically, two major steps were employed. Initially, linear regression, polynomial regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied on the entire movie data to predict the movie revenue. Then, clustering techniques, such as by genre, using Expectation Maximization (EM) and using K-means were applied to divide data into groups before regression analyses are executed. To compare accuracy among different techniques, R-square and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used as a performance indicator. Our study shows that generally linear regression without clustering offers the model with the highest R-square, while linear regression with EM clustering yields the lowest RMSE.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Computational Mechanics"

The purification treatment involved using sodium hydroxide (2% w/v at 100°C for 1 h) on BC pulp to remove the bacterial protein and the resulting cultured medium film was characterized with respect to its physical properties. An acid treatment on the purified BC pulp was applied to disintegrate cellulose network before forming a film. The results showed that the sodium hydroxide treatment increased the film burst index and brightness. Heating the BC pulp to 70–100°C in 1.25–5.00% v/v sulfuric acid treatment for 30 min degraded the film’s mechanical properties. Also, a study of the addition and mixing of paper pulps or modified cationic starch to the BC was found to improve the film properties with respect to packaging properties. Inclusion of short fiber paper pulp by 30 wt.% created a good synergistic effect by improving the mechanical properties of film especially for tear strength. Moreover, cationic-modified cassava starch (2% w/w) improved the tensile and burst index as well as resistance to oxygen permeation of the BC film. The results indicate that the BC pulp could be used to improve mechanical properties and resistance to water vapor and oxygen permeation of the short fiber paper pulp film which is ideal for packaging materials.","Materials Science, physics","Ceramics and Composites, Condensed Matter Physics"

Considering the insertion of some markers affecting cellular proliferation into primary haemocytes in order to produce the black tiger shrimp cell line and the very low percent of transduced cells previously reported in penaeid shrimps, these paved us the way to set up suitable gene delivery protocols to increase percent of transduced cells in the shrimp as our primary aim. In this study, electroporation and lipofection were used to transfer construct plasmids (pLL3.7 plasmids containing CMV promoters and pGL-IE1-126(A)-EGFP plasmids carrying WSSV IE1 promoters) into primary haemocytes. As it was difficult to distinguish between cells expressing EGFP signal and auto-fluorescence of many dead cells occurred by electroporation during the first 72 h of experiment; so, only lipofection was managed to deliver plasmids into primary cells. Surprisingly, numbers of suspected proliferative cells were derived after electroporation with no insertion of immortalising markers. These cells survived in vitro for up to 45 days with high rate of cell viability, but the number of viable cells decreased throughout the experiment. In addition, these cells expressed genes and proteins closely related to hyaline cells determined using RT-PCR and western blot. For the lipofection experiment, no green fluorescence signal was detected in any primary cell introduced with these plasmids, suggesting that plasmids were not successfully inserted into cells. Also, a number of primary haemocytes had the apoptotic cell death characteristic within 5 days after lipofection. These possibly result from using inappropriate lipofection protocol and chemical substances. In summary, finding out suitable protocols to elevate the percent of transduced cells is still necessary. Additionally, continuous shrimp cell lines would be possibly established by transforming suspected proliferative cells derived from electroporation in this study.","genergyal, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

In this study, we enlarged sample size and developed a technique for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis—for EML2 (COBRA-EML2) technique was established and validated in various organ samples obtained from 108 autopsies. In addition, this technique was also tested for its reliability, minimal DNA concentration detected, and use in aged samples and in samples obtained from specific brain compartments and spinal cord. COBRA-EML2 displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing brain tissue from other tissues, showed high reliability, was capable of detecting minimal DNA concentration (0.015 ng/μl), could be used for identifying brain tissue in aged samples. In summary, COBRA-EML2 is a technique to identify brain tissue. This analysis is useful in criminal cases since it can identify the vital organ tissues from small samples acquired from criminal scenes. The results from this analysis can be counted as a medical and forensic marker supporting criminal investigations, and as one of the evidences in court rulings.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine
"Competence, competency-based education, and undergraduate dental education: a discussion paper","Chuenjitwongsa S., Oliver R.G., Bullock A.D.",2018-02-01,"Clinical Competence, Competency-Based Education, Education, Dental, competence, competency-based curriculum, undergraduate dental education","Introduction: The aim of undergraduate dental education is to provide competent dentists to serve societal needs and improve population oral healthcare. Competency-based education has influenced the development of dental education for decades but this term is problematic. This article explores components of competency-based undergraduate health professional education in order to help the dental profession have a better understanding of the context and purposes of undergraduate dental education. Methods: This is a discussion paper based on a wide reading of the literature on the education of health professionals with a specific focus on competency-based undergraduate education. Results and Discussion: Competence comprises an integration of knowledge, skills and attitudes indicating a capability to perform professional tasks safely and ethically. The process of becoming a competent practitioner is complex. Four characteristics of competency-based education are: curriculum components and content shaped by societal needs; focused on student-centred learning; learning achievement; and limited attention to time-based training and numerical targets. Alongside a competency-based approach, undergraduate dental education can be influenced by institutional features and external factors but these receive little consideration in the literature. Conclusion: Understanding competence, competency-based education, and institutional and external factors will help to improve educational quality, define roles and professional development for the dental educator, and inform further research.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"

In this multicenter study, adult patients with ITP who had been responding to corticosteroids were randomized with the 2 strata of newly diagnosed and relapsed ITP to prednisolone 7.5 mg/d or observation for 6 months. Relapses were defined by a platelet count below 30 × 109/L and/or clinical bleeding. There were 75 patients evaluable for the efficacy and 77 for safety. The recurrent ITP comprised 57.3%. During the median follow-up of 42 weeks, there were 20.5% (8/39) and 25% (9/36) of recurrences in the prednisolone and control groups (P =.643), with the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 (P =.549). The significant factor that could predict recurrences was relapsed ITP with the HR of 2.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-7.64, P =.037). Prednisolone showed a trend toward a benefit in the relapsed subgroup (P =.070). Adverse events were not different (P =.540) and mostly mild. In conclusion, prednisolone maintenance could not prolong relapse-free survival. Relapsed patients deserve further investigations for preventive measures.",medical,Hematology

Several single estimation methods have been introduced vying to be the best estimation method. However, it is difficult to decide which method offers the best estimation result. This study proposes an ensemble effort estimation from several single estimation methods which yield different estimations but comparably high accuracy. The proposed technique employs a correlation-based feature selection algorithm to choose methods out of twelve methods derived from combinations of four transformation and three learning techniques. The ensemble then uses a genetic algorithm to build a mathematical function to compute one combined estimation from those selected method estimations. Experiments are set up based on six benchmark data sets to evaluate estimation performance. The resulting measure of error metrics show that the proposed ensemble technique deploying only necessary estimation methods can yield more accurate estimation than the best method from the twelve methods.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Information Systems, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Although the inflammatory pattern of ECRS is essential to diagnosing this subtype, there is currently no consensus for diagnosis. Our aim in this study was to determine whether high tissue eosinophilia (HTE), measured as eosinophils per high-power field (eos/HPF), could be used to define ECRS based on likelihood of recurrence. Methods: Embase, Medline, and PubMed databases were searched for studies that reported HTE and recurrence in ECRS patients after surgical treatment. We used a random-effects bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for detecting ECRS at different HTE cut-off scores using risk of recurrence as the primary outcome. Results: We identified 11 articles (n = 3183) that reported HTE associated with recurrence. A cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF showed the highest sensitivity (0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.91), specificity (0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and DOR (232.7; 95% CI, 91.0-595.1).

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that using eos/HPF has good diagnostic accuracy and may be a useful tool for identifying ECRS patients. Based on the results of our meta-analysis, we recommend a cut-off value of >55 eos/HPF for predicting the likelihood of recurrence of ECRS.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Otorhinolaryngology"

The sample (N = 10,235) is restricted to adults 60 years and above, who are retired and answered the survey independently. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicate that different forms of preparation are positively associated with post-retirement well-being for men and women but socioeconomic resources are positively associated with all three well-being outcomes. Furthermore, for women, there are significant negative interaction effects of income and financial preparation on life satisfaction, as well as negative interaction effects of disability and caregiver preparation on self-rated health.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of individual reactivity to stress and 24-day desipramine (DES) administration on the metastatic colonization of adenocarcinoma MADB 106 cells in the lungs of Wistar rats. Wistar rats were subjected to stress procedure according to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression for two weeks and stress highly-sensitive (SHS) and stress non-reactive (SNR) rats were selected. SHS rats were more prone to cancer metastasis than SNR ones and chronic DES treatment further increased the number of lung metastases by 59% and 50% in comparison to vehicle-treated appropriate control rats. The increase in lung metastases was connected with DES-induced skew macrophage activity towards M2 functional phenotype in SHS and SNR rats. Moreover, during 24 h after DES injection in healthy rats, the decreased number of TCD8+ and B cells in SHS and SNR rats as well as NK cell cytotoxic activity in SNR rats could be attributed to the lowered capacity to defend against cancer metastasis observed in chronic DES treated and tumor injected rats.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

A conductive polymer, poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine), was successfully synthesized and embedded into the pristine pectin hydrogels as the drug encapsulation host. The in-vitro release of ibuprofen from the hydrogels was investigated by a modified Franz diffusion cell filled with a MES buffer solution, with pH of 5.5, at 37 °C, for a period of 48 h to investigate the effects of the crosslinking agent type, crosslinking mole ratio, mesh size, electric potential, and conductive polymer. The release behavior of ibuprofen from the pectin hydrogels was found to involve 4 modes of release: Fickian diffusion; Anomalous transport; Case-II transport; and Super case II transport. The diffusion coefficient was shown to be significantly improved by two factors: using a FeCl2 as the crosslinking agent and applied electric potential. For both crosslinking agents, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio. Under electric field of 5 V, the drug diffusion coefficients of the FeCl2 and citric acid hydrogels were enhanced by more than a factor of two due to the electro-repulsive interaction between ibuprofen and the negatively charged electrode. Moreover, the synthesized poly(3-methoxydiphenylamine) embedded in the pectin hydrogels as the drug encapsulation host was shown to enhance the diffusion coefficients and to reduce the overall release times.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

First, the SBA-15 supports were synthesized using the sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods with Zr and La modification. Then, VOx species (2 wt% of V) were deposited on different SBA-15 supports. Among all catalysts, the V-Zr-La/SBA-15-HT showed the highest catalytic activity having 80% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 38% at 400 °C in non-oxidative dehydrogenation, while 98% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40% were obtained for this catalyst at lower temperature (300 °C) in oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, two of the most powerful techniques used to elucidate the nature of VOx species dispersed on Zr-La/SBA -15 supports were X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. It is worth noting that isolated monomeric VOx species, particularly the V4+ species, as well as the amounts of weak basic sites essentially played important role in non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Thermodynamic analysis was performed using a flowsheet simulator. The equilibrium gas composition was calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy. An electrochemical model that includes three voltage losses (i.e., activation, ohmic, and concentration losses) was used to predict the performance of the SOFCs. The simulation results showed that the reformer in the external reforming SOFC should be operated at a temperature of 973 K, a pressure of 1 atm, and a steam-to-carbon molar ratio of 0.5. In performance analysis, the simulation results indicated that both approaches have the same optimal operating conditions, i.e. a temperature of 1173 K, a pressure of 3 atm, and a current density of 5000 A/m2. Under the same operating conditions, the internal reforming SOFC exhibited better electrical efficiency than that of the external reforming SOFC. Considering the CO2 and CO emissions, the exhaust gas obtained from the anode side of the internal reforming SOFC contained 7.4% CO2 and 37.9% CO, which are higher values than those for the external reforming SOFC (1.9% CO2 and 32.5% CO).","geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The presence of all of these characteristics is currently a challenging task for prosthesis design. This paper presents the design of a five-fingered prosthetic hand that has multiple grip patterns with the use of only one actuator in order to perform important tasks in daily life and which achieves significant grip force from the large size of the actuator. The prosthetic hand is capable of performing one neutral position and two grip patterns that are dominant in daily life tasks. Different move patterns are achieved through the use of multiple sets of rigid four-bar linkages which provide different motions to fingers and thumb when the mechanism is actuated to the opposite direction. This paper describes the design of the prosthesis, mechanism synthesis, and achieved performance. The prosthetic hand developed here, having one degree of freedom, is an improvement from conventional single-actuator hands, which can only perform open/close motion. Whereas achieved grip force (34.5 N) is higher than multiple-actuator hands in market. Thus, this design could be an alternative answer of improvement between conventional and multiple degree of freedom prosthetic hands.","biophysicsics, bioengineeringneering and medicalcal instrumentation, medical, neuroscience, engineering","Internal Medicine, Neuroscience (all), Biomedical Engineering"

Many ongoing and previous studies have experimented with various techniques to provide suggestions and alternatives to improve solid waste management in urbanized areas. There is a demand for the development of high-impact information and detailed planning approaches, which can lead to effective waste management. The goal of this research is to analyze how to apply various sets of performance indicators as a predetermined parameter to prioritize hot spots in waste generation and handling in the city. Due to limited resources in the public finance sectors of government agencies, tackling solid waste issues with the most effective efforts will help solve the problem more quickly and efficiently. The study examined how geospatial data can be used to assist with municipal solid waste management planning and monitoring. The study determined how to use a set of waste management indicators to better manage solid waste issues in the city of Bangkok. Hot spot areas are identified and mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). Results indicate that 85% of hot spot areas are located near the On Nuch transfer station, and ~ 70% of hot spot areas are located in the central and southern zones of Bangkok. Ultimately, the research analyzed information to develop a short-term recommendation that focuses on improving waste pickup schedules and routing and on providing a long-term recommendation for reducing waste generation rates and improving waste management technology in sub-district areas.

The on-site measurement data of wind speeds are adopted in the data fusion for wind speed distribution estimation and reproduction, combined with the simulation results of CFD. Next, a case study on wind resource assessment for a wind farm in complex terrain, located in Hebei Province, China was done. One year wind measurements with anemometers on three different sites were performed adopting the proposed approach. A cross-validation of the results of the proposed method against on-site wind speed measurement data indicates a good agreement. The results show that the approach proposed have reproduced a wind resource map with high resolution and the wind speed estimations for one spot within the wind farm are with a root-mean-square error of 0.399 m/s, which is qualified for wind farm planning in complex terrain.","engineering, physics","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Instrumentation"

We investigated the function of microRNA-302a-3p (miR-302a-3p) to regulate receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) expression in human mandibular osteoblast-like cells (HMOBs). HMOBs were incubated with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) to mimic inflammation, or with PGE 2 and interferon gamma (IFNγ) to mimic homeostasis. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiles related to RANKL expression were demonstrated by PCR array, and miR-302a-3p was identified. Using TargetScanHuman 7.0, a target of miR-302a-3p was predicted. To confirm its function, miR-302a-3p was overexpressed, or silenced, by transfection with miR-302a-3p mimic, or inhibitor, respectively. Level of miR-302a-3p and RANKL mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. Soluble RANKL (sRANKL), and membrane-bound RANKL (mRANKL) were measured by ELISA and by Western blot, respectively. When PGE 2 stimulated RANKL in HMOBs, miR-302a-3p was lower than baseline level. However, upregulation of miR-302a-3p is observed when IFNγ suppressed RANKL expression in PGE 2 -stimulated HMOBs. miR-302a-3p was predicted to target PRKACB mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit in cAMP/PKA pathway.

Atrial fibrillation following heart transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Chokesuwattanaskul R., Bathini T., Thongprayoon C., Preechawat S., O'Corragain O.A., Pachariyanon P., Ungprasert P., Cheungpasitporn W.",2018-11-01,"Anastomosis, Surgical, Atrial Fibrillation, Heart Transplantation, Humans, Incidence, Observational Studies as Topic, Postoperative Period, atrial fibrillation, cardiac, heart, meta-analysis, transplant, transplantation","Objective: Previous studies have suggested a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart transplant recipients. However, incidence trends of AF in heart transplant recipients remain unclear. The study's aims were (1) to investigate the pooled incidence/incidence trends of AF following heart transplantation and (2) to assess the mortality risk of heart transplant recipients with AF. Methods: A literature search for studies that reported the incidence of AF following heart transplantation was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Database from inception through March 2018. Pooled incidence and odds ratios (OR) with 95%CI were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: Eighteen studies (2 cohorts from clinical trials and 16 cohort studies) with 5393 heart transplant recipients were enrolled. The pooled estimated incidence of AF in heart transplant was 10.1% (95%CI: 7.6%-13.2%). Meta-analysis based on the type of anastomotic technique demonstrated a pooled estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation of 18.7% (95%CI: 10.3%-31.5%) and 11.1% (95%CI: 6.5%-18.4%) by biatrial and bicaval techniques, respectively. There was a significant association between AF following a heart transplant and increased mortality risk with a pooled OR of 2.86 (95%CI: 2.08-3.93). Meta-regression analyses showed no significant correlations between the year of study and incidence of AF (P = 0.47) or mortality risk of AF after heart transplantation (P = 0.99). Conclusions: The overall estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation is 10.1%. There is a significant association between AF and increased mortality after transplantation. Furthermore, incidence and mortality risk of AF following heart transplant does not seem to decrease over time.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical",Health Policy

The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) developed another equation for estimating GFR, derived from a population that included both participants without kidney disease and with CKD. But many ethnicities were inadequately represented. The International Society of Nephrology, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes committee promulgated clinical practice guidelines, which recommended the CKD-EPI equation. Investigators in Asia subsequently assessed the performance of these GFR estimating equations—the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation, the CKD-EPI equation (creatinine only), and the CKD-EPI equations (creatinine and cystatin C). In this review, we summarize the studies performed in Asia on validating or establishing new Asian ethnicity GFR estimating equations.

The basic of construction equipment, the slurry used during construction and construction time between barrette pile and bored pile construction are totally different. Therefore, their design parameters for pile capacity estimation should be different. In this research, pile load test was carried out on the fully-instrumented barrette piles. The test result can be separated into friction of each soil layer and end bearing. By considering stress-strain relationships, adhesion factor of clay layer, friction factor of sand layer and end bearing factor of sand layer can be calculated. These factors were found to be able to estimate ultimate pile capacity. Based on these factors, the estimated pile capacity was compared with another barrette pile tests. This estimation agreed well with the test results.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, engineering","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanics of Materials"

The studied amines includes ethanolamine (MEA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), diisopropylamine (DIPA) and aminoethylpiperazine (AEP). Regardless of amine type, in the absence of a bicarbonate solution, no reduction/oxidation peaks were observed. However, in the presence of bicarbonate, a single reduction peak along with simultaneous H2 evolution was clearly observed. The cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that only diisopropylamine (DIPA) had a significant catalytic effect toward bicarbonate reduction on the composite electrode. No peak was observed in the anodic direction of the reverse scans, suggesting the irreversible nature of the electrochemical process. The effect of scan rate revealed that the irreversible reduction mechanism is governed by both diffusion and adsorption pathways. In addition of carbonate ions, format ions also have been detected in liquid phase. In order to study the mechanism of bicarbonate reduction in the DIPA solution on Ag2O/CNT electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. The EIS results showed that the charge transfer resistance decreased when the potential decreased from -0.1 to -0.9 V then faded with a further rise in potential to up to -1.9 V. In addition, an inductive loop under certain conditions was observed in the complex plane due to the formation of adsorbed intermediates onto the electrode surface.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The Thai Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan revealed an increase in the elderly, while numbers of younger, working-age adults decreased. Thailand has become an aging society since 2015, which is significant in that senior adults have a higher risk of involvement in motor vehicle accidents and are more susceptible to injuries and fatalities. This study investigated the role of physical and cognitive function with regard to road traffic injury in senior drivers. Methods: A community survey was carried out among people aged 60 years and older in the villages representing four regions of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements were used to gather data including individual characteristics, medical history, risk behaviors, cognitive function and traffic injury within the last 12 months. Associations between risk factors and injury were assessed by the chi-square tests, and comparison of the cognitive function score between the injury and non-injury groups was identified using the independent t-test. Results: A total of 314 completed questionnaires were used for analysis. Ten percent of respondents had experienced a road traffic injury in the last 12 months. Analysis revealed that level of cognitive function, smoking behavior and been diagnosed with arthritis were associated with road traffic injury incidence in senior drivers (p-value < 0.05). Conclusion: Results revealed the potential need for strategies to increase road traffic safety in senior drivers. Special protection should be prioritized for the elderly with physical and cognitive impairment.","neuroscienceoscience; behavioural neuroscienceoscience; cognitive science, sociology, biochemistryistry, Nursing, medical","Health (social science), Aging, Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

Material and Methods: Biopsy records of the participating institutions were reviewed for oral cancer cases diagnosed from 2005 to 2014. Demographic data and site of the lesions were collected. Sites of the lesion were subdivided into lip, tongue, floor of the mouth, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, palate, buccal/labial mucosa, maxilla and mandible. Oral cancer was subdivided into 7 categories: epithelial tumors, salivary gland tumors, hematologic tumors, bone tumors, mesenchymal tumors, odontogenic tumors, and others. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using SPSS software version 17.0. Results: Of the 474,851 accessioned cases, 6,151 cases (1.30%) were diagnosed in the category of oral cancer. The mean age of the patients was 58.37±15.77 years. A total of 4,238 cases (68.90%) were diagnosed in males, whereas 1911 cases (31.07%) were diagnosed in females. The male-to-female ratio was 2.22:1. The sites of predilection for oral cancer were tongue, labial/buccal mucosa, gingiva, palate, and alveolar mucosa, respectively. The three most common oral cancer in the descending order of frequency were squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of oral cancer is not high compared to other entities, oral cancer pose significant mortality and morbidity in the patients, especially when discovered late in the course of the disease. This study highlights some anatomical locations where oral cancers are frequently encountered. As a result, clinicians should pay attention to not only teeth, but oral mucosa especially in the high prevalence area as well since early detection of precancerous lesions or cancers in the early stage increase the chance of patient being cured and greatly reduce the mortality and morbidity. This study also shows some differences between pediatric and elderly oral cancer patients as well as between Asian and non-Asian oral cancer patients.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"
Photosynthetic refixation varies along the stem and reduces CO2 efflux in mature boreal Pinus sylvestris trees,"Tarvainen L., Wallin G., Lim H., Linder S., Oren R., Lofvenius M.O., Rantfors M., Tor-Ngern P., Marshall J.",2018-04-01,"Carbon Dioxide, Photosynthesis, Pinus sylvestris, Plant Stems, CO2 recycling, Corticular photosynthesis, Forest carbon balance, Scots pine, Stem photosynthesis, Stem respiration","Trees are able to reduce their carbon (C) losses by refixing some of the CO2 diffusing out of their stems through corticular photosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that under ideal conditions the outflowing CO2 can be completely assimilated in metabolically active, young stem and branch tissues. Fewer studies have, however, been carried out on the older stem sections of large trees and, accordingly, the importance of refixation is still unclear under natural environmental conditions. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in refixation in ~90-year-old boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees by utilizing month-long continuous measurements of stem CO2 efflux (Ec) made at four heights along the bole. Refixation rates were found to vary considerably along the bole, leading to a 28% reduction in long-term Ec in the upper stem compared with a negligible reduction at breast height. This vertical pattern correlated with variation in light availability, bark chlorophyll content and bark type. Analysis of the vertical and diurnal patterns in Ec further suggested that the influence of sap flow on the observed daytime reduction in Ec was small. The areal rates of corticular photosynthesis were much lower than previous estimates of photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area from the same trees, implying that the impact of refixation on tree-scale C uptake was small. However, upscaling of refixation indicated that 23–27% of the potential Ec was refixed by the bole and the branches, thereby significantly reducing the woody tissue C losses. Thus, our results suggest that refixation needs to be considered when evaluating the aboveground C cycling of mature P. sylvestris stands and that breast-height estimates should not be extrapolated to the whole tree.","plant ecology; genergyal, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science"

The results show that capacitance during curing correlated with the time profile of torque from a moving die rheometer (MDR). The scorch time and optimum cure time obtained from MDR and RCMS were reported. The degree of cure and the cure rate from two methods were compared. Good correlations between the alternative methods were observed, supporting the potential of in situ RCMS during the vulcanization of natural rubber.","coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

Next, optimization technique was applied to determine the optimal new setting, which provided any targeted level of bending strength with the minimal total cost of sand and resin. The results showed that the experimental results obtained from the CCD experiments provided the regression model, which had less than 6% error from the actual bending strength value. With this proposed method the total cost of sand and resin was reduced by 28.6% on average and it also provided the bending strength on any required target level.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Formal verification is a complicated procedure involving model abstraction and model checking tools used for property checking. There are several existing transformation techniques that yield an abstract model, but the data perspective is not considered. These techniques are also inappropriate for the large-scale BPMN design model. An automated transformation can reduce the flaws, time consumption, and complexity of the large-scale BPMN design model. This paper proposes a transformation technique and provides a framework for transforming the BPMN design models into colored Petri nets (CPNs). Our techniques cover both the control-flow and data-flow perspectives. The partitioning technique of the BPMN design model is applied to reduce the complexity and leads to a CPN model that can support the hierarchical and compositional verification techniques that are suitable for the large-scale BPMN design models. The proposed transformation has been implemented as a transformation framework and is able to consistently transform the BPMN design models into CPN models.","computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Their molecular stabilities and antioxidant properties can be improved by cyclodextrin (CD) encapsulation. Here, we present a systematic investigation on the inclusion complexes of β-CD–TYR (1), β-CD–HTY (2) and β-CD–OLE (3) by combined single-crystal structure determination, DFT complete-geometry optimization and DPPH antioxidant assay. X-ray analysis and DFT calculation reveal the preference of inclusion geometry with deep protrusion of the aromatic ring moieties of TYR, HTY and OLE from the β-CD O6–H-side, and the common host-guest stabilization scheme via intermolecular O–H⋯O hydrogen bonding interactions. No polyphenol OH group is shielded in the β-CD cavity, in contrast to the structures of β-CD–tea catechins complexes. The established host-guest O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds help to elevate antioxidant capacities of the olive polyphenols upon β-CD encapsulation.

Moreover, the GLURP gene is also employed routinely as a genetic marker for malarial genotyping in epidemiological studies. While extensive size polymorphisms in GLURP are well recorded, the extent of the sequence diversity of this gene is rarely investigated. The present study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of GLURP in natural populations of P. falciparum. Results: The polymorphic C-terminal repetitive R2 region of GLURP sequences from 65 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand were generated and combined with the data from 103 worldwide isolates to generate a GLURP database. The collection was comprised of 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique GLURP subtypes, characterized by 18 types of amino acid repeat units (AAU). Of these, 28 GLURP subtypes, formed by 10 AAU types, were detected in P. falciparum in Thailand. Among them, 19 GLURP subtypes and 2 AAU types are described for the first time in the Thai parasite population. The AAU sequences were highly conserved, which is likely due to negative selection. Standard Fst analysis revealed the shared distributions of GLURP types among the P. falciparum populations, providing evidence of gene flow among the different demographic populations. Conclusions: Sequence diversity causing size variations in GLURP in Thai P. falciparum populations were detected, and caused by non-synonymous substitutions in repeat units and some insertion/deletion of aspartic acid or glutamic acid codons between repeat units. The P. falciparum population structure based on GLURP showed promising implications for the development of GLURP-based vaccines and for monitoring vaccine efficacy.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

The impeller torque was measured using a rotating platform and a data recording device, and the power draw for the motor driving the impeller was measured using a power meter. The effect of various impeller blade designs and material properties on the torque and power were investigated as a function of the impeller blade rotation rate. It was found that the torque exerted on a granular bed and the power consumption were a strong function of the impeller blade configuration, the position of the blades in a deep granular bed, the fill height of the glass beads, and the size and friction coefficient of the particles. It was observed that the time-averaged torque and power consumption for different particle sizes qualitatively scaled with particle diameter. A scale-up relationship for a deep granular bed was developed: the time-averaged torque and average adjusted power consumption scaled with square of the material fill height.","coastal engineering, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Mechanics of Materials"

These physiological and imaging tests play a key role in facilitating a precise diagnosis and in providing a better understanding of the pathophysiology and functional anatomy. In turn, this leads to better and more comprehensive management using medical, behavioral and surgical approaches. For example, patients presenting with difficult defecation May demonstrate dyssynergic defecation and will benefit from biofeedback therapy before considering surgical treatment of coexisting anomalies such as rectoceles or intussusception. Similarly, patients with significant rectal prolapse and pelvic floor dysfunction or patients with complex enteroceles and pelvic organ prolapse May benefit from combined behavioral and surgical approaches, including an open, laparoscopic, transabdominal or transanal, and/or robotic-assisted surgery. Here, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of selected common anorectal disorders.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

"Morphological and dose-dependent study on the effect of methyl, hexyl, and dodecyl rosmarinate on staphylococcus carnosus LTH1502: Use of the Weibull model","Suriyarak S., Schmidt H., Villeneuve P., Weiss J.",2018-04-01,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Cinnamates, Depsides, Models, Biological, Staphylococcus, Antimicrobials, Esterification, Rosmarinate, Staphylococcus carnosus, Weibull model","The mechanisms of three antimicrobial rosmarinates (methyl-RE1, hexyl-RE6, and dodecyl-RE12) were investigated against Staphylococcus carnosus LTH1502. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine the morphology of treated cells to gain information on potential changes in the site of action of compounds. The survival data obtained from antimicrobial activity assays were fitted to a nonlinear Weibull model to assess changes in inactivation behavior. Generally, esters became more effective with increasing length of the alkyl chain, resulting in a lower concentration for inhibition and inactivation. Weibull distribution parameters showed a downward concave inactivation pattern for RE1 above a critical concentration, indicative of a delayed log phase of the antimicrobial activity, with few cells being inactivated immediately after treatment and more cells being affected at later times. In contrast, esters having longer alkyl chains (RE6 and RE12) had an upward concave inactivation behavior, with more cells being inactivated immediately after addition of compounds. Cellular morphologies suggest that the antimicrobial mode of action of esters transitions from one that acts intracellularly (RE1) to one that predominately affects bacterial membrane (RE6 and RE12) due to changes in physicochemical properties of esters. Assessment that is based on the parameters of the Weibull model could, thus, be used to evaluate antimicrobial efficiency, in addition to MIC.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; food preservatives and anti-microbials, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

The effects of doses in a range of 0–250 kGy on swelling ratio, crosslink density, and thermal stability of UFRs were investigated. Smaller particle size of UFRs was obtained at higher dose. A decrease in the swelling ratio and an increase in crosslink density were well corresponded to crosslinking effect related with absorbed dose. The increase in dose was also found to improve thermal performance of URFs. The influence of irradiated UFRs on impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of polybenzoxazine composites was also evaluated. The highest impact resistance of the composites belonged to the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 200 kGy. While the significantly enhanced Tg of the composite was obtained by an addition of irradiated UFRs with higher doses, i.e. Tg = 173 °C for the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 250 kGy. As a consequence, the UFRs can be used to effectively modify thermal and mechanical properties, especially impact resistance of polybenzoxazine composites.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics",Radiation

Method: Bilateral, full-skin thickness wounds were created as an in vivo wound model in BALB/C diabetic nude mice. The mice were separated into five groups: control (CON); diabetes mellitus (DM, from a streptozotocin injection); DM treated with MSCs (DM+MSCs); DM treated with VitC (DM+VitC), and DM treated with MSCs and VitC (DM+MSCs+VitC). After wounding, daily oral-feeding of high dose VitC (1.5g/l) was administered, and a single dose of MSCs (1x10 6 cells) was given topically using matrix gel application to the wounded area. Results: At day seven, the lowest rate of wound healing, in terms of percentage of wound closure, appeared in the DM group, as compared with the CON and all other treatment groups (mean percentage of wound closure and standard deviation), CON=75.94±7.09%; DM=55.65±9.59%; DM+MSCs=78.57±6.46%; DM+VitC=77.52±3.31%; and DM+MSCs+VitC=84.61±2.87%, p≤0.05. At day 14 post-wounding, the combination of oral high dose VitC and MSCs accelerated wound healing (91.44±3.19%, p≤0.05). In addition, the highest capillary density in DM+MSCs+VitC was obtained at 14 days post-wounding (29.49±7.30%, p≤0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the possibility of using oral high dose VitC in adjunct to MSCs to increase angiogenesis and accelerate diabetic wound healing in an animal model.

Pineapple waste, one of the non-edible biomass sources from agricultural waste, can be used as an alternative source of sugar for ethanol production. However, the production of glucose from cellulose using conventional process would generally be retarded by lignin content. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the hydrothermal treatment followed by the enzymatic treatment on the cellulose conversion with the presence of different lignin contents and compare the result with conventional method. Also, the physical structures of solid residues from both techniques are analyzed and compared. The results show that the hydrothermal treatment at 185°C followed by the enzymatic treatment can convert pineapple waste to a higher amount of monosaccharide, which is composed of glucose and fructose. Furthermore, the combined treatments can provide up to 23.90 % higher for the glucose yield and 226.7 % higher for the fructose yield than that of the pure enzymatic treatment. Furthermore, the reduction in the lignin content from 20.43 % to 10.88 % by weight can substantially enhance the glucose yield up to 23.90 %. Moreover, the hydrothermal treatment process can decompose the lignin structure between each cellulose strand. Without this treatment, the lignin structure will not be broken down and retard the effectiveness of enzymatic treatment.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

In this study, photolysis was used to degrade GA from brine solutions simulating produced water. Photolysis of GA was performed under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. GA can be photolyzed by UV at all studied conditions with the efficiency ranging from 52 to 85% within one hour irradiation. Photolysis of GA followed pseudo-first order kinetics. A photolysis rate constant of GA at 0.1 mM in 200 g/L of salt at pH 7 was 0.0269 min−1 with a quantum yield of 0.0549 under 224 W illumination. The degradation rate of GA increased with increasing incident light intensity and decreasing pH. Increasing initial GA concentration resulted in decreasing degradation rate of GA. The degradation of GA was affected by salt concentration. At lower salt concentrations, notable retardation of GA photodegradation rate was observed while at higher salt concentrations GA photodegradation was improved compared to those without salt. OH was more dominant in sample without salt than sample with salt suggesting different photolytic mechanisms, indirect and direct photolysis, respectively. Oligomers were identified as the main photoproducts of GA photolysis.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, petroleum engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Vonoprazan is a newer agent that has been shown to be more potent than a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). However, it remains unclear whether vonoprazan is more effective than PPI in promoting healing of ulcers caused by ESD. Medline and Embase databases were searched through January 2018 for studies that compared the rate of complete healing of ulcers caused by ESD and post-ESD delayed bleeding in patients who received vonoprazan versus those who received PPI after ESD. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q-statistic and I 2. A total of six studies consisting of 461 patients were identified. The likelihood that ulcers caused by ESD were completely healed at 4-8 weeks after the procedure was significantly higher among patients who received vonoprazan compared with those who received PPI, with a pooled OR of 2.27 (95% CI=1.38-3.73; I 2 =0%). The risk of developing post-ESD delayed bleeding was also numerically lower among those who received vonoprazan, with a pooled OR of 0.79, although the result did not reach statistical significance (95% CI=0.18-3.49; I 2 =29%). This study found that patients who received vonoprazan after ESD had a significantly higher rate of completely healed ulcers compared with those who received PPI.","genergyal, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

BCNC production with these variable factors provided the distinctive characteristics of rodlike nanocrystals, which can be useful for various applications. For demonstration of the biomedical application as nucleic acid delivery systems, cationic BCNCs were developed by simple cationic surface modification by the physical adsorption of the obtained sulfuric-hydrolyzed BCNC with amines and amine-containing polymers, and the resulting cationic modified BCNCs were evaluated for their complexation ability with siRNA and cytotoxicity in HeLa cells. All unmodified and cationic-modified BCNC samples exhibited low toxicity at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, which assured their good biocompatibility, and the cationic-modified BCNCs with methacrylamide polymers were fully complexed with siRNA. Therefore, this research suggested that a BCNC with the desired properties can be produced by selecting the proper BC sources and acid conditions; also cationic functionalized BCNCs, which revealed their potential as nucleic acid nanocarriers, were easily prepared by simple cationic surface modification.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

To determine the sufficiency of labeled data, we apply a semi-supervised cluster technique to estimate the labeled data distribution over the training set. The results show that the accuracy obtained from the final classifiers in clusters without labeled data is markedly lower than that obtained from clusters with labeled data. The two methods we propose for improving the labeled dataset are active labeling and co-labeling, for ensuring the sufficiency of labeled data.

These findings suggest that administration of L. plantarum and L. lactis could modulate the immune system and increase shrimp resistance to VPAHPND infection presumably via upregulation of the two LvproPO transcripts.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

We describe the extractive foraging of caterpillars in wild northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina) at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. The study group, observed from May to December 2016 (n = 146 days), comprised 60–70 habituated individuals, including 3–4 adult males, 20–23 adult females, and 36–47 immatures. Four adult males and five adult females, observed from September to November 2016 for a total of 24 days, were selected for focal animal sampling. Northern pig-tailed macaques were observed eating at least two families (Erebidae and Limacodidae) and three genera (Macrobrochis sp., Phlossa sp. and Scopelodes sp.) of caterpillars. While the monkeys ate short and small caterpillars with stinging setae and non-setae caterpillars without processing, they performed extensive caterpillar-rubbing behavior on large and long caterpillars with stinging setae. Based on 61 extractive foraging bouts, we found that caterpillar rubbing was hierarchically organized into five stages and 12 elements. Five stages of behavior sequence started with picking the caterpillar up, transporting it to a substrate, rubbing it to remove stinging setae, ingesting it, and then cleaning hands and mouth. Only adult macaques were observed using a leaf to rub stinging caterpillars.","animal ecology; mammals; autecology and behaviour, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Animal Science and Zoology

Six and eleven adsorption configurations for propane and propylene molecules in the ZIF-8 pore, were respectively found. The adsorption energies based on the most stable configurations of propane (− 1.38 kcal/mol) and propylene (− 1.25 kcal/mol) in the ZIF-8 pore were obtained. Due to adsorption abilities of the ZIF-8 pore which can adsorb propane better than propylene, the ZIF-8 therefore differentiate diffusion flux of propane and propylene via hexagonal aperture. These results agree with ability of the ZIF-8 pore to separate propane/propylene mixture based on the principle of gas–solid partition. All the adsorption configurations of propane and propylene molecules and their adsorption energies are reported.

When modifying or reusing software that is written by someone else, software developers often have difficulties in trying to understand what the existing software does and how. Such an issue is commonly found in software-developing organizations. This paper discusses an approach taken by an IT organization in Thailand which attempts to enforce coding standards within its iOS development team in order to promote software understandability and maintainability. Among coding standards, naming conventions are important but are most often violated. This paper presents the development of a naming convention checking framework that consists of tools to automatically detect naming convention violations in Objective C programs. The framework facilitates iOS developers in modifying the programs so that they adhere to the naming conventions. An experiment showed that the developers’ understanding in the programs that had been modified, as suggested by the naming convention checking framework, did improve at a statistical significance level of 0.05. This approach can enhance program understandability and can be applied to other software-developing organizations.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

The indentation problem is formulated as a mixed-boundary value problem with the displacement boundary condition being imposed at the contact area. The unknown contact pressure under the indenter is then determined by employing a discretization technique with use of the displacement Green's functions. The required Green's functions are expressed in the form of the Hankel integral transform. The accuracy of the proposed solution scheme is verified by comparing with existing solutions. Selected numerical results on displacement and stress profiles in a layered elastic half-space are presented to demonstrate the influence of various parameters on elastic fields. It is found that the layered medium becomes stiffer and shows size-dependent behavior due to the presence of surface stresses.,"fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Evaluation of different pretreatments of Napier grass for enzymatic saccharification and ethanol production,"Tsai M.-H., Lee W.-C., Kuan W.-C., Sirisansaneeyakul S., Savarajara (Akaracharanya) A.",2018-12-01,"Alkaline pretreatment, Carbohydrate content, Dilute acid pretreatment, Enzymatic saccharification, Napier grass, Pre-Treatment, Pretreatment methods, Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, alkaline pretreatment, bioethanol, Napier grass, pretreatment, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation","Due to its fast-growing and high carbohydrate content, Napier grass has a great potential to be chosen as a raw material for renewable energy production. The Napier grass after different pretreatments was tested for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with dried yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and cellulase (CTec2) to produce ethanol. For alkaline pretreatment, the grass was incubated with 10% NaOH at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) at 90°C for 1 hour. For dilute acid pretreatment, the grass was soaked with 1% H2SO4 at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and incubated at 120°C for 1 hour. For the two-stage pretreatment, the resultant solid from dilute acid pretreatment was further treated with 2% NaOH (1:10 w/v) at 80°C for 6 hours. After enzymatic saccharification at 50°C and pH 5.0 for 96 hours using CTec2, yields of glucose from three pretreated Napier grass samples (10% water-insoluble solids, WIS) were 75.4 ± 2.9%, 55.4 ± 6.5%, and 76.4 ± 5.0%. Using 10% WIS of alkaline-pretreated Napier grass biomass as the substrate, the 72-hour SSF led to an ethanol yield of 86.6 ± 3.4%. On the basis of the dried biomass of Napier grass as the raw material, the ethanol yield could reach 0.143 ± 0.006 (g/g). Napier grass biomass could be effectively treated by alkaline, dilute acid, or two-stage pretreatment methods to remove non-cellulosic components to some extent. Alkaline pretreatment was found to be superior to dilute acid and two-stage pretreatment methods, based on ethanol yields obtained under similar SSF conditions.","engineering, energy","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy (all)"

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression through mRNA degradation or translational repression. MiRNAs have evolved to regulate many cellular processes including the viral infection response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the miRNA profiles of human cells infected with influenza B virus. METHODS: A549 cells were infected with influenza B viruses (MOI = 0.5). MiRNAs were extracted at 24 and 48 hours post-infection. MiRNAs were used to construct four DNA libraries: influenza Binfected and an uninfected control for both time points. Then high-throughput sequencing was performed using the Miseq platform (Illumina). Sequencing data were analyzed by Miseq reporter software. The miRNAs were categorized and counted based on the frequency of reads. All filtered contigs were aligned with data from miRbase. The relative expression of each miRNA between uninfected and influenza B-infected cells was calculated. RESULTS: There were 13 down-regulated miRNAs and 21 up-regulated miRNAs observed in influenza B infected cells at 24 hours post infection. At 48 hours post infection, 14 miRNAs were downregulated, whereas 8 miRNAs were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that miRNAs may play important roles in host gene regulation in response to viral infection.",medical,Medicine (all)

However, the PMU performance relies entirely on a supported communication network. The existing communication approaches do not guarantee the error-free channel for the PMU network. Meanwhile, the mean or median approaches are commonly used to impute the missing value. These methods, however, fail to recover some valuable frequency events. In this paper, we first proved the multiple linear regression features in many synchronized frequency data streams in the short-time window. Then, we proposed the Bagged Averaging of Multiple Linear Regression model, which handles and fulfills the missing values in synchronized frequency data measurement fast and efficiently. This technique was based on the ensemble learning by bootstrapping and averaging many multiple linear regressions to predict the missing values. Various experiments on the synchronized frequency measurement data from the Texas synchrophasor network have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recovering the missing frequency events. Our proposed approach guarantees the performance of real-time wide area monitoring system applications, such as frequency analysis or stability monitoring and trending.","computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces a new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) or co-continuous composites due to the interconnection on a macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This innovative composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results show that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxyresin, results in IPCs stiffer than either of the two individual materials bythemselves. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main parasite antigens employed by various commercial RDTs. It has been hypothesized that the poor detection of LDH-based RDTs is attributed in part to the sequence diversity of the gene. To test this, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of the P. falciparum ldh gene in Thailand and to construct the map of LDH sequence diversity in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Methods: The ldh gene was sequenced for 50 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand and compared with hundreds of sequences from P. falciparum populations worldwide. Several indices of molecular variation were calculated, including the proportion of polymorphic sites, the average nucleotide diversity index (π), and the haplotype diversity index (H). Tests of positive selection and neutrality tests were performed to determine signatures of natural selection on the gene. Mean genetic distance within and between species of Plasmodium ldh was analysed to infer evolutionary relationships. Results: Nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum ldh could be classified into 9 alleles, encoding 5 isoforms of LDH. L1a was the most common allelic type and was distributed in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum ldh sequences were highly conserved, with haplotype and nucleotide diversity values of 0.203 and 0.0004, respectively. The extremely low genetic diversity was maintained by purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. Phylogenetic analysis inferred the close genetic relationship of P. falciparum to malaria parasites of great apes, rather than to other human malaria parasites. Conclusions: This study revealed the global genetic variation of the ldh gene in P. falciparum, providing knowledge for improving detection of LDH-based RDTs and supporting the candidacy of LDH as a therapeutic drug target.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Each of the waste materials was used as a partial fine aggregate ranging from 0% to 20%, by weight. The cement mortar samples were cured at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. To investigate the properties of the cement mortars with different amounts of industrial wastes, the density, compressive strength, transverse strength and thermal conductivity of each mortar variation were measured. The results indicate that the compressive and transverse strengths of the cement mortars decreased as more industrial wastes was present in the mixtures. However, the fine aggregate substitutes improved thermal resistance, as indicated by the decreasing thermal conductivity values of the cement mortars. Thus, the use of these two industrial wastes in cement mortar could be a viable option for non-structural and non-load bearing construction applications because these substitutes have the ability to produce mortar with suitable mechanical and insulating properties.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: To test this possibility, we supplied pyruvate to the drinking water of the Trembler-J (TrJ) mouse and assessed efficacy based on histology, electrophysiology, and functional outcomes. Pyruvate outcomes were compared with untreated TrJ controls alone or adeno-associated virus mediated NT-3 gene therapy (AAV1.NT-3)/pyruvate combinatorial approach. Results: Pyruvate supplementation resulted increased myelinated fiber (MF) densities and myelin thickness in sciatic nerves. Combining pyruvate with proven efficacy from AAV1.tMCK.NT-3 gene therapy provided additional benefits showing improved compound muscle action potential amplitudes and nerve conduction velocities compared to pyruvate alone cohort. The end point motor performance of both the pyruvate and the combinatorial therapy cohorts was better than untreated TrJ controls. In a unilateral sciatic nerve crush paradigm, pyruvate supplementation improved myelin-based outcomes in both regenerating and the contralateral uncrushed nerves. Conclusions: This proof of principle study demonstrates that exogenous pyruvate alone or as adjunct therapy in TrJ may have clinical implications and is a candidate therapy for CMT neuropathies without known treatment.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience",Behavioral Neuroscience
"Depressive, anxiety and hypomanic symptoms in schizophrenia may be driven by tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning of IgA and IgM responses directed to TRYCATs","Kanchanatawan B., Sirivichayakul S., Carvalho A.F., Anderson G., Galecki P., Maes M.",2018-01-03,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anxiety Disorders, Case-Control Studies, Cyclothymic Disorder, Depression, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, Male, Middle Aged, Schizophrenia, Signal Transduction, Tryptophan, Young Adult, Anxiety, Depression, Immune, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, Inflammation, Kynurenine, Schizophrenia","The aim of this study was to delineate the associations between the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway and affective symptoms in schizophrenia. Towards this end we measured immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgM responses to relatively noxious TRYCATs, namely quinolinic (QA), xanthurenic (XA), picolinic (PA) acid and 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), and generally protective TRYCATs, namely anthranilic (AA) and kynurenic (KA) acid in 80 patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) and anxiety (HAMA), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) as well as the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale of Schizophrenia (PANSS) were measured. Depression, anxiety and hypomanic as well as negative and positive symptoms were associated with increased IgA responses to PA. Increased IgA responses to XA were associated with anxiety, hypomanic and negative symptoms. Moreover, depressive, anxiety, hypomanic and negative symptoms were characterized by increased IgA responses to the noxious (XA + 3HK + QA + PA)/protective (AA + KA) TRYCAT ratio. All symptom dimensions were associated with increased IgM responses to QA, while depressive, anxiety, positive and negative symptoms were accompanied by lowered IgM responses to 3HK. Hypomanic symptoms were additionally accompanied by lowered IgM responses to AA, and negative symptoms by increased IgM responses to KA. In conclusion, both shared and distinct alterations in the activity of the TRYCAT pathway, as well as its regulatory factors and consequences, may underpin affective and classical psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Increased mucosa-generated production of noxious TRYCATs, especially PA, and specific changes in IgM-mediated regulatory activities may be associated with the different symptom dimensions of schizophrenia.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

Country representatives from the Asia Fungal Working Group (AFWG) contacted as many laboratories performing mycology diagnosis as possible in their respective countries, requesting that the laboratory heads complete the online survey. In total, 241 laboratories responded, including 71 in China, 104 in India, 11 in Indonesia, 26 in the Philippines, four in Singapore, 18 in Taiwan, and seven in Thailand. Overall, 129/241 (53.5%) surveyed mycology laboratories operate as separate designated mycology laboratories, 75/241 (31.1%) conduct regular formal staff training, 103/241 (42.7%) are accredited, and 88/157 (56.1%) participate in external quality assurance scheme (EQAS) programs. Microscopy and culture methods are available in nearly all laboratories, although few perform DNA sequencing (37/219; 16.9%) or use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) (27/219; 12.3%) for isolate identification. Antifungal susceptibility testing is performed in 142/241 (58.9%) laboratories, mainly for yeasts. The most commonly performed nonculture diagnostic is cryptococcal antigen testing (66 laboratories), followed by galactomannan testing (55), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis (37), and beta-D-glucan testing (24). Therapeutic drug monitoring is conducted in 21 laboratories. There is almost no access to advanced diagnostic tests, like galactomannan, β-D-glucan, and PCR, in the surveyed laboratories in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. These results highlight the need for development of quality laboratories, accreditation and training of manpower in existing laboratories, and access to advanced non-culture-based diagnostic tests to facilitate the diagnosis of fungal infections in Asia.",medical,Infectious Diseases

Animals: Thirty-nine dogs were included. The diabetic and control groups consisted of 19 and 20 dogs, respectively. Methods: Plasma cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP concentrations were measured in the diabetic and control groups. Echocardiography was performed in all dogs to evaluate cardiac structure and function. Echocardiographic values and cardiac biomarker concentrations between the two groups were compared with the Mann–Whitney U test. The p-value < 0.05 was considered statistical significance. Results: No evidence of cardiac structural changes was detected in diabetic dogs on two-dimensional echocardiography. The echocardiographic values of diabetic and control dogs were within reference intervals. Echocardiographic changes indicating diastolic dysfunction assessed by spectral flow Doppler echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging were found in diabetic dogs (42.10%) compared with control dogs (10.00%; p = 0.022). Diabetic dogs with durations of diabetes mellitus > 1 year had an increased left ventricular wall thickness and echocardiographic changes suggesting diastolic dysfunction compared with those with duration of diabetes mellitus < 1 year. No evidence of systolic dysfunction was detected in diabetic dogs. No significant difference in plasma cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP concentrations was found between the two groups. Conclusions: Echocardiographic changes suggested that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was detected in diabetic dogs without changes in the concentration of cardiac biomarkers including cTnI, Gal-3, and NT-proBNP compared with the age- and breed-matched control dogs.","biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science","Physiology, Veterinary (all)"

Leaching tests were performed, with different leachants and pH conditions, on cement and fly ash stabilised soils used for soil improvement in road embankment construction projects in Northern Thailand. The results suggested that chemical compounds (CaO and MgO) on fly ash surfaces can control the pH of the fly ash and soil leachant. The dissolution of chromium and zinc was found to be amphoteric and controlled by oxide minerals at a high or low pH. Arsenic leaching was found to be oxyanionic where AsO4 3- prevented the adsorption of arsenic onto the negatively charged fly ash surface. Different types of leachant also leached out in different amounts of heavy metals.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; terrestrial pollution, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Pollution"

Australia's pig herd has been quarantined for over 30 years, however S. suis remains a significant cause of disease. In this study, we investigated S. suis from 148 cases of clinical disease in pigs from 46 pig herds over a period of seven years, to determine the level of genetic difference from international isolates that may have arisen over the 30 years of separation. Isolates underwent whole genome sequencing, genome analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data was compared at the core genome level to clinical isolates from overseas. Results demonstrated five predominant multi-locus sequence types and two major cps gene types (cps2 and 3). At the core genome level Australian isolates clustered predominantly within one large clade consisting of isolates from the UK, Canada and North America. A small proportion of Australian swine isolates (5%) were phylogenetically associated with south-east Asian and UK isolates, many of which were classified as causing systemic disease, and derived from cases of human and swine disease. Based on this dataset we provide a comprehensive outline of the current S. suis clones associated with disease in Australian pigs and their global context, with the main finding being that, despite three decades of separation, Australian S. suis are genomically similar to overseas strains. In addition, we show that ST1 clones carry a constellation of putative virulence genes not present in other Australian STs.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Veterinary (all)"

CW which obtained from acidolysis reaction was compounded with PLA pellets into nanocomposite films by cast film extrusion. The morphology and crystallinity of CW were observed by TEM and XRD, illustrated that the dimension of whisker was affected by hydrolysis time. Increasing of hydrolysis time, the length of whisker was more regular with narrower distribution. Moreover, the crystallinity of whisker was obviously increased after acid hydrolysis. The nanocomposite film showed rough surface compared to pure PLA film due to some agglomeration of nanoparticles. However, CW and PLA were well-mixed with no phase separation. The introduction of 0.1 phr of CW decrease cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc) from about 121°C to 118°C and also increase the degree of crystallinity around 10%. There was no difference of thermal transition temperature between pure PLA and nanocomposite films with the addition of CW more than 0.1 phr which inspected by DSC. Despite the transition temperature express insignificantly different, the degree of crystallinity of nanocomposite was increase, indicating that chitin whisker would induce the crystallinity of PLA.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

We included 62 patients in a single-blind, randomized controlled study. The intervention group was treated with care as usual plus BLT for three consecutive days. Delirium was diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria with the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Risk factors for delirium were measured, including the APACHE II score, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), as well as hematocrit and bicarbonate levels. Results were adjusted for treatment with nasal cannula oxygen and medications. Thirteen patients developed delirium within the three days following surgery. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed a significant preventive effect of BLT on delirium, which was independent of risk or treatment factors. Higher APACHE-II and ISI scores, lower hematocrit and lower bicarbonate levels increased the risk of developing delirium. BLT plus nasal cannula oxygen significantly reduced the likelihood of delirium. BLT significantly lowered ISI scores, while nasal cannula oxygen significantly enhanced bicarbonate levels. The results indicate that BLT and supplementary oxygen therapy may protect against delirium by targeting sleep-wake and deficits in the bicarbonate buffer system.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

The immunoblotting and immunolocalization showed that the PmPLP1 protein was highly expressed and located at the plasma membrane of gills from YHV-infected shrimp. Moreover, the PmPLP1 expressed in the Sf9 insect cells resided at the cell membrane rendering the cells more susceptible to YHV infection. Using the ELISA binding and mortality assays, the synthetic external loop of PmPLP1 was shown to bind the purified YHV and neutralize the virus resulting in the decrease in YHV infection. Our results suggested that the PmPLP1 was likely a receptor of YHV in shrimp.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

A conventional screening test to detect ANCA in the serum is indirect immunofluorescence study, and subsequently confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A positive staining of ANCA can be classified into three main categories based on the staining patterns: cytoplasmic, perinuclear, and atypical. Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) mostly have a positive cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA) whilst a perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA) is more common in microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) patients.

During the last decade, studies reported that L-arginine HCl supplementation during gestation increased sow and piglet performances. However, clinical studies concerning the association between L-arginine HCL supplementation and some neonatal piglet characteristics as well as colostrum and milk yield of sow are still lacking. The present study aims to determine the effect of L-arginine HCl supplementation in sow diet during late gestation on piglet characteristics at birth, colostrum consumption (CC), concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in colostrum, milk yield, average daily gain at d 7 and 21 and piglet mortality at d 7 and 21 of life. In total, 166 sows were allocated into four groups, i.e., CON (n = 66), ARG-0.5 (n = 42), ARG-1.0 (n = 41) and ALA (n = 17). The sows in each group were fed with a conventional gestation diet (CON) or the same diet supplemented with 0.5% L-arginine HCl (ARG-0.5), 1.0% L-arginine HCl (ARG-1.0) or 1.7% L-alanine (ALA, isonitrogenous with ARG-1.0). The feeding protocol was carried out from 85 days of gestation until farrowing. The proportion of live-born piglets, piglet birth weight (BWB), within-litter variation of BWB, proportion of piglets with BWB above 1.35 kg, proportion of growth-restricted piglets (defined as BWB below 1.0 kg), blood oxygen saturation (SatO2) and heart rate were determined in 2292 newborn piglets from 166 litters. Colostrum consumption of each individual piglets and the colostral concentration of IgG was determined. The milk yield between d 0–7 and 7–21 and relative backfat loss were estimated in each individual sow. The piglet mortality and body weight was determined at d 7 and 21 of life. On average, the number of piglet born alive per litter was 12.4. The proportion of stillborn piglets, piglets with BWB above 1.35 kg and growth-restricted piglets were 6.9%, 62.7% and 14.0%, respectively. Piglet preweaning mortality at d 7 and 21 were 8.5% and 12.4%, respectively.

Compared to the CON group, ARG-0.5 increased BWB (+7.0%, P < 0.001), increased SatO2 (+3%, P < 0.001) and reduced heart rate (−20%, P < 0.001) and tended to reduce the relative backfat loss (−4.4%, P = 0.06). No difference between ARG-1.0 and ARG-0.5 was observed among these traits. Other traits including within-litter variation of BWB, growth-restricted piglets, average daily gain, piglets preweaning mortality and CC and milk yield were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). The colostral concentration of IgG at 1 h after onset of farrowing in ARG-1.0 sows (116 mg/ml) was higher than CON, ARG-0.5 and ALA sows (85, 74 and 78 mg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). In conclusions, dietary L-arginine HCl supplementation in late gestating sows favourably increased proportion of live-born piglets, BWB, SatO2 and IgG concentration in the sow colostrum.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; antibodies and Immunologynoglobulins; Immunologynoglobulin, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"
Changes in free amino acid concentrations and associated gene expression profiles in the abdominal muscle of kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) acclimated at different salinities,"Koyama H., Mizusawa N., Hoashi M., Tan E., Yasumoto K., Jimbo M., Ikeda D., Yokoyama T., Asakawa S., Piyapattanakorn S., Watabe S.",2018-06-01,"Abdominal Muscles, Acclimatization, Amino Acids, Animals, Penaeidae, Salinity, Transcriptome, Alanine-glyoxylate transaminase, Glutamateammonia ligase, Osmolytes, Osmoregulation, RNA-seq analysis","Shrimps inhabiting coastalwaters can survive in a wide range of salinity. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their acclimation to different environmental salinities have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we acclimated kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) at 1.7%, 3.4% and 4.0% salinities. After acclimating for 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, we determined free amino acid concentrations in their abdominal muscle, and performed RNA sequencing analysis on this muscle. The concentrations of free amino acids were clearly altered depending on salinity after 24 h of acclimation. Glutamine and alanine concentrations were markedly increased following the increase of salinity. In associationwith such changes,many genes related to amino acid metabolism changed their expression levels. In particular, the increase of the expression level of the gene encoding glutamateammonia ligase, which functions in glutaminemetabolism, appeared to be associated with the increased glutamine concentration at high salinity. Furthermore, the increased alanine concentration at high salinity was likely associated with the decrease in the expression levels of the the gene encoding alanine-glyoxylate transaminase. Thus, there is a possibility that changes in the concentration of free amino acids for osmoregulation in kuruma shrimp are regulated by changes in the expression levels of genes related to amino acid metabolism.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Physiology, Aquatic Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Molecular Biology, Insect Science"
Hydrolysis of eucalyptus wood chips under hot compressed water in the presence of sulfonated carbon-based catalysts,"Weerasai K., Champreda V., Sakdaronnarong C., Shotipruk A., Laosiripojana N.",2018-07-01,"Cellulose and hemicellulose, Degradation by-products, Eucalyptus, Increasing temperatures, Lignocellulose, Lignocellulosic biomass, Pre-Treatment, Solid acid catalysts, Eucalyptus, Hydrolysis, Lignocellulose, Pretreatment, Solid acid catalyst, Sugar","Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars and derivatives is a key step in production of biofuels and commodity chemicals in a biorefinery. In this study, catalytic hydrolysis of eucalyptus chips with solid sulfonated carbon-based catalysts prepared from three different carbon precursors (sucrose, glucose, and xylose) was studied under hot-compressed water at 150–250 °C with reaction time of 1–10 min. Increasing temperature up to 200 °C led to higher sugar yields from cellulose and hemicellulose while further increase in temperature caused higher formation of sugar degradation by-products. Sulfonated-sucrose (SO3H-Suc) showed the greatest performance on sugar production compared to other catalysts with less formation of furans and anhydroglucose; its high catalytic activity was related to its high acid site density as proven by NH3-TPD measurement. Size reduction and chemical pretreatment of the biomass were found to enhance the hydrolysis yield and reaction selectivity. The highest sugar yield of 40.7% comprising glucose, fructose, and xylose was achieved using 5% (w/w) SO3H-Suc at 200 °C for 5 min with milled biomass (60–100 μm) pretreated by alkaline oxidation. The work provides an alternative catalytic process for hydrolysis of lignocellulose in biomass industry.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Food Science, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering (all)"

Evidence has suggested that depression could be associated with excess all-cause mortality across different settings and populations, although the causality of these associations remains unclear. Methods: We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase electronic databases were searched through January 20, 2018. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated associations of depression and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were selected for the review. The evidence was graded as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak based on quantitative criteria that included an assessment of heterogeneity, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects, and excess significance bias. Results: A total of 26 references providing 2 systematic reviews and data for 17 meta-analytic estimates met inclusion criteria (19 of them on all-cause mortality); data from 246 unique studies (N = 3,825,380) were synthesized. All 17 associations had P < 0.05 per random effects summary effects, but none of them met criteria for convincing evidence. Associations of depression and all-cause mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction, in individuals with heart failure, in cancer patients as well as in samples from mixed settings met criteria for highly suggestive evidence. However, none of the associations remained supported by highly suggestive evidence in sensitivity analyses that considered studies employing structured diagnostic interviews. In addition, associations of depression and all-cause mortality in cancer and post-acute myocardial infarction samples were supported only by suggestive evidence when studies that tried to adjust for potential confounders were considered. Conclusions: Even though associations between depression and mortality have nominally significant results in all assessed settings and populations, the evidence becomes weaker when focusing on studies that used structured interviews and those that tried to adjust for potential confounders. A causal effect of depression on all-cause and cause-specific mortality remains unproven, and thus interventions targeting depression are not expected to result in lower mortality rates at least based on current evidence from observational studies.",medical,Medicine (all)

Design: Two-year, randomized, open-label study at 10 sites in Australia and Spain. Participants: Of 112 adults on TDF-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) screened, 87 with lowBMD (T-score1.0 at hip or spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and undetectable plasma HIV viral load were randomized to either switch TDF to another active antiretroviral drug or to continue TDF-based ART and receive intravenous zoledronic acid (ZOL) 5mg annually for 2 years. Primary outcome measure: Change in lumbar spine BMD at 24 months by intentionto-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included changes in femoral neck and total hip BMD, fractures, safety, and virological failure. Results: Forty-four participants were randomized to TDF switch and 43 to ZOL, mean age 50 years (SD 11), 96% men, mean TDF duration 5.9 years (SD 3.1), and mean spine and hip T-scores 1.6 and 1.3, respectively. At 24 months, mean spine BMD increased by 7.4% (SD 4.3%) with ZOL vs. 2.9% (SD 4.5%) with TDF-switch (mean difference 4.4%, 95% CI 2.6 6.3; P 0.001). Mean total hip BMD increased by 4.6 (SD 2.6%) and 2.6% (SD 4%), respectively (mean difference 1.9%, 95% CI 0.5 3.4; P 0.009). There was one fracture in the ZOL group vs. seven fractures in four TDF-switch participants. Virological failure occurred in one TDF-switch participant. Other safety endpoints were similar. Conclusion: ZOL is more effective than switching TDF at increasing BMD in HIVpositive adults with low bone mass.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

The Thai government has tried to repopulate the cranes using wild individuals from Cambodia as initial breeding stock. Although captive breeding can reintroduce species back into the wild, the genetic diversity of the population is also important. This study aimed to screen microsatellite markers to investigate the genetic diversity of G. a. sharpii from two breeding facilities in Thailand and to assess its potential for future conservation programs. Eighteen microsatellite loci isolated from whooping crane (G. americana) and blue crane (Anthropoides paradisea) were screened in all captive reared cranes from Khao Kheow Open Zoo (n = 11) and Bangpra Water Bird Breeding Station (n = 17), Chonburi Province. Of 18 loci analyzed, 14 were found to be polymorphic, and 3 loci were in linkage disequilibrium. Apparent deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was observed only at locus Gram8, resulting from the presence of a null allele. The average expected and observed heterozygosities from 10 loci analyzed are 0.61 and 0.64, respectively. The overall fixation index suggested that cranes from both facilities shared many common alleles (FST= 0.023, p < 0.05); in addition, Bayesian clustering analysis implied that cranes from two breeding facilities are homogeneous (K = 1). Our findings reveal high level of genetic diversity of the captive crane population in Thailand and suggest that the breeding stocks may be suitable for ensuring a sustainable breeding program in the future.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

The location and size of ES for stacked benefit applications are identified. To evaluate the benefits of ES, several case studies are simulated using a distribution system simulator. The simulation results show that ES can successfully provide voltage management and frequency regulation services to the distribution circuit. Voltage regulation can be achieved by controlling the reactive power generated or absorbed by the ES inverter. In this control mode, ES can successfully mitigate the voltage variation concerns due to the variability of both PV generation and the frequency regulation schedule. Frequency regulation service, on the other hand, can be achieved by using real power control of ES. In this control mode, ES charges and discharges in accordance with the frequency regulation schedule. By simultaneously controlling both real and reactive power, ES can provide multiple benefits termed as stacked benefits for the feeder.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Methods: Fifty healthy control children and 51 vertically infected children were included in the study. The HIV-infected group consisted of survivors who had not received antiretroviral therapy at birth. The HIV-infected group averaged 11.4 (2.5) years of age, with a median CD4 count of 683 cells/mm3. Most (71%) of the HIV-infected children were on antiretroviral therapy for a median of 34 months (range: 33–42) with HIV RNA <40 copies/mL in 89% of the sample. The HIV-uninfected group averaged 10.6 (2.6) years of age. Magnetic resonance imaging was acquired to determine volumes of the caudate, putamen, thalamus, pallidum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, total white matter, total gray matter and cortical gray matter. Correlational analyses examined the degree of shared variance between brain volumes and both cognitive performances and laboratory markers of disease activity (T cells and plasma viral load). Results: HIV-infected children exhibited larger volumes of the caudate, nucleus accumbens, total gray matter and cortical gray matter when compared with the controls. Volumetric differences were predominately evident in children under 12 years of age. HIV-infected children performed worse than controls on most neuropsychologic tests, though neither cognitive performances nor laboratory markers corresponded to brain volumes in the HIV-infected children. Conclusions: Outcomes of the present study suggest abnormal brain maturation among HIV-infected pediatric survivors.

There is an on-going effort to control the formation of these detrimental phases through the additions of trace elements and grain refiners. However, the role of grain refinement on the formation of intermetallics is still unclear and conflicting results exist. To gain better understanding, in situ synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy experiments were performed on a commercial Al–Si–Cu alloy with grain refiner addition. Three-dimensional microstructure evolution and intermetallic precipitation were quantified. The influence of the β-intermetallics on the evolution of permeability during equiaxed dendritic solidification was also investigated numerically. The results illustrate that grain refinement affects α-Al grain structure as well as nucleation temperature of primary and intermetallic phases, but there is no evidence that it alters the precipitation sequence of intermetallics or their morphology. The simulation results reveal that intermetallics block interdendritic liquid flow and hence reduce permeability.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, energy, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Mechanics of Materials, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Objective: First, evaluate the impact of PC on medicine therapy-related QoL using the PROMPT-QoL in Thai patients. Second, compare the outcomes of drug-related problems (DRPs) between usual care (UC) and PC groups. Third, assess the responsiveness of the PROMPT-QoL. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary public hospital in Bangkok, Thailand from March to October 2016. A total of 514 patients were randomly allocated into the UC (N = 255) and pharmacist-led patient-centered PC (N = 259) groups. The follow-up period was three months. Results: A split-plot ANOVA showed that the PC group significantly improved four domain scores and total score of the PROMPT-QoL than the UC group (all p < 0.01). For improved patients in the PC group (N = 164), the responsiveness of these four domains and the total score was moderate-to-high with standardized effect sizes between 0.23 and 3.01. The PC group also significantly yielded higher proportion of patients with better DRP outcomes than the UC group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Pharmacist-led patient-centered PC could improve patients’ medicine therapy-related QoL and DRP outcomes.

However, solving such problems for cases where large number of pixel variables and possible disparity labels are common can be impractical as the computational complexity grows fast with the number of labels. We proposed a speedup scheme using local label hierarchy in which we exploit characteristics of stereo vision problem to obtain a hierarchical energy minimization technique. In doing so, we give definitions and notations for local label hierarchy as well as approaches for label-wise grouping. We also generalize the definition of energy function to include sets of labels and present heuristics for assigning group potentials. Our approach builds different “local” hierarchy for each variable using information from the energy function which enables us to achieve better performance when compared to using the same hierarchy for every variable. The added processing steps have significantly less theoretical computational complexity than the overall process. Our method was tested with different combinations of cost functions, and our experiment has shown that our heuristics can assist in speeding up the computation time while providing comparable energy and error.","computer science, engineering","Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In response to this development, researchers have turned their attention to several compounds derived from natural origins, including cypripedin (CYP), a phenanthrenequinone substance extracted from Dendrobium densiflorum. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of CYP to induce apoptosis and enhance cisplatin-mediated death of human lung cancer NCI-H460 cells using cell viability and apoptosis assays. The induction of apoptosis by CYP was observed at a concentration of > 50 μM with the appearance of morphological changes, including DNA condensation and chromatin fragmentation. Together with, CYP was able to activate caspase-3 and downregulate the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Also, a non-cytotoxic dose of CYP synergistically potentiated the effect of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer line H460 cells, which clearly exhibited the apoptotic phenotype. Western blot analysis revealed that the underlying mechanism involved the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, whereas the levels of other apoptotic regulatory proteins were not altered.

This research investigates the biodegradation rates of diesel, hexadecane and phenanthrene, by conducting a microcosm study and survey of the autochthonous microbial community in contaminated mangrove sediment, using an Illumina MiSeq platform. The biodegradation rates of diesel, hexadecane and phenanthrene were 82, 86 and 8 mg kg−1 sediment day−1, respectively. The removal efficiencies of hexadecane and phenanthrene were >99%, whereas the removal efficiency of diesel was 88%. A 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis revealed that the major bacterial assemblages detected were Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria. The bacterial compositions were relatively constant, while reductions of the supplemented hydrocarbons were observed. The results imply that the autochthonous microorganisms in the mangrove sediment were responsible for the degradation of the respective hydrocarbons. Diesel-, hexadecane- and phenanthrene-degrading bacteria, namely Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Staphylococcus sp., were also isolated from the mangrove sediment.

These phantoms are denoted DIMITRA paediatric skull phantoms as these have been primarily developed and validated for the DIMITRA European research project (Dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging: an investigation towards low-dose radiation induced risks). Methods: To create the DIMITRA paediatric phantoms, six human paediatric skulls with estimated ages ranging between 4 and 10 years- old were selected, protected with nonradiopaque tape and immersed in melted Mix-D soft tissue equivalent material, by means of a careful procedure (layer-by-layer). Mandibles were immersed separately and a Mix-D tongue model was also created. For validation purposes, the resulting paediatric phantoms were scanned using a cone-beam CT unit with different exposure parameter settings. Results: Preliminary images deriving from all scans were evaluated by two dentomaxillofacial radiologists, to check for air bubbles, artefacts and inhomogeneities of the Mix-D and a potential effect on the visualization of the jaw bone. Only skulls presenting perfect alignment of Mix-D surrounding the bone surfaces with adequate and realistic soft tissue thickness density were accepted. Conclusions: The DIMITRA anthropomorphic phantoms can yield clinically equivalent images for optimization studies in dentomaxillofacial research. In addition, the layer-by-layer technique proved to be practical and reproducible, as long as recommendations are carefully followed.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

Essential mechanism is a Multi-Ion Exchange (MIE). In carbonate formation, collaboration of Potential Determining Ions (PDI) with rock surface and crude oil results in adjustment of surface equilibrium. These ions in injected brine are thoroughly investigated but effects from formation brine are not well documented. In this study, ratio of divalent ions including calcium and magnesium ions in formation brine is studied. Results from imbibition test shows that formation brine containing calcium ion to magnesium ion ratio of 1:1 yields response to LSWF. Oppositely, formation brines with high ratios of 10:1 and 15:1 do not respond to LSWF. As calcium ion in connate water diffuses to injected water, high calcium ion will exhibit dissolution mechanism of rock surface which is part of oil recovery mechanisms. Formation brine with high calcium ion is therefore not recommended for LSWF. High portion of magnesium ion in formation brine does not affect effectiveness of LSWF.

The simplest and most common technique for upgrading biogas is absorption process. In this study, two processes between water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing with diethanolamine (DEA) solution integrated with regeneration and recirculation are compared through Aspen Plus simulations. The aim of this study is to find the suitable operational condition in absorption process in order to increase the efficiency of the process in recovery methane and to decrease the energy consumption in the system. Our model was developed by including one additional absorber unit. Results show that the systems, both water scrubbing and chemical scrubbing, can achieve high purity of biomethane of >96 %v/v. In comparison between models for water scrubbing, our proposed system offers higher recovery methane of 4.68% of and 7,863.07 kW of energy of biomethane. In chemical scrubbing process, our system was able to decrease the pressure of absorber from 55.2 to 10 bar. Consequently, the recovery methane and energy of biomethane were increased while the energy consumption of system was decreased.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, corrosion, energy",Energy (all)

The development of cancer molecular knowledge has surpassed the novel concept of cancer biology and unraveled principle targets for anticancer drug developments and treatment strategies. Metastatic breast cancer cells acquire their aggressive features through several mechanisms, including augmentation of survival, proliferation, tumorigenicity, and motility-related cellular pathways. Clearly, natural product-derived compounds have since long been recognized as an important source for anticancer drugs, several of which have been shown to have promising anti-metastasis activities by suppressing key molecular features supporting such cell aggressiveness. This review provides the essential details of breast cancer, the molecular-based insights into metastasis, as well as the effects and mechanisms of potential compounds for breast cancer therapeutic approaches. As the abilities of cancer cells to invade and metastasize are addressed as the hallmarks of cancer, compounds possessing anti-metastatic effects, together with their defined molecular drug action could benefit the development of new drugs as well as treatment strategies.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"
"In Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety, and Physiosomatic Symptoms Are Strongly Related to Psychotic Symptoms and Excitation, Impairments in Episodic Memory, and Increased Production of Neurotoxic Tryptophan Catabolites: a Multivariate and Machine Learning Study","Kanchanatawan B., Thika S., Sirivichayakul S., Carvalho A.F., Geffard M., Maes M.",2018-04-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anxiety, Depression, Female, Humans, Machine Learning, Male, Medically Unexplained Symptoms, Memory Disorders, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Thailand, Tryptophan, Young Adult, Anxiety, Depression, Immune, Inflammation, Schizophrenia, Tryptophan catabolites","The depression, anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (DAPS) of schizophrenia are associated with negative symptoms and changes in tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning. The aim of this study is to delineate the associations between DAPS and psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism (PHEM) symptoms, cognitive tests as measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) and IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs. We included 40 healthy controls and 80 participants with schizophrenia. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with The Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scales, respectively. Physiosomatic symptoms were assessed with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale (FF). Negative symptoms as well as CERAD tests, including Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word List Memory (WLM), and WL Delayed Recall were measured, while ratios of IgA responses to noxious/protective TRYCATs (IgA NOX_PRO) were computed. Schizophrenia symptoms consisted of two dimensions, a first comprising PHEM and negative symptoms, and a second DAPS symptoms. A large part of the variance in DAPS was explained by psychotic symptoms and WLM. Of the variance in HAM-D, 58.9% was explained by the regression on excitement, IgA NOX_PRO ratio, WLM, and VFT; 29.9% of the variance in HAM-A by psychotic symptoms and IgA NOX/PRO; and 45.5% of the variance in FF score by psychotic symptoms, IgA NOX/PRO, and WLM. Neural network modeling shows that PHEM, IgA NOX_PRO, WLM, and MMSE are the dominant variables predicting DAPS. DAPS appear to be driven by PHEM and negative symptoms coupled with impairments in episodic memory, especially false memory creation, while all symptom dimension and cognitive impairments may be driven by an increased production of noxious TRYCATs, including picolinic, quinolinic, and xanthurenic acid.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We recruited nonglaucomatous Vietnamese subjects and constructed a normative database for peripapillary RNFL and macular GCIPL thickness. The probability color-codes for each decade of age were calculated. We evaluated the agreement with κ coefficient between optical coherence tomography color probability codes with Cirrus built-in original normative database and the Vietnamese normative database. Results: In total, 149 eyes of 149 subjects were included. The mean age of enrollees was 60.77 (±11.09) years, with a mean spherical equivalent of +0.65 (±1.58) D and mean axial length of 23.4 (±0.87) mm. Average RNFL thickness was 97.86 (±9.19) μm and average macular GCIPL was 82.49 (±6.09) μm. Agreement between original and adjusted normative database for RNFL was fair for average and inferior quadrant (κ=0.25 and 0.2, respectively); and good for other quadrants (range, κ=0.63 to 0.73). For macular GCIPL κ agreement ranged between 0.39 and 0.69. After adjusting with the normative Vietnamese database, the percent of yellow and red color-codes increased significantly for peripapillary RNFL thickness. Conclusions: Vietnamese population has a thicker RNFL in comparison with Cirrus normative database. This leads to a poor color-code agreement in average and inferior quadrant between the original and adjusted database. These findings should encourage to create a peripapillary RNFL normative database for each ethnicity.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

The statistical relationship with the metal concentration in shallow groundwater wells was established with urine data. According to the groundwater data, the health risk assessment results for four metals appeared to be higher for participants who drank groundwater than for the other group. The carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk of arsenic (As) were found in 25.86 and 31.03% of participants, respectively. For lead (Pb), 13.79% of the participants had a non-carcinogenic risk. Moreover, 30 of the 58 participants in the groundwater-drinking group had As urine higher than the standard, and 26, 2 and 9 of the 58 participants had above-standard levels for cadmium (Cd), Pb and mercury (Hg) in urine, respectively. Both the risk assessment and biomarker level of groundwater-drinking participants were higher than in the other group. The results showed an average drinking rate of approximately 4.21 ± 2.73 L/day, which is twice as high as the standard. Interestingly, the As levels in the groundwater correlated with those in the urine of the groundwater-drinking participants, but not in the non-groundwater-drinking participants, as well as with the As-related cancer and non-carcinogenic risks. The hazard index (HI) of the 100 participants ranged from 0.00 to 25.86, with an average of 1.51 ± 3.63 higher than the acceptable level, revealing that 28 people appeared to have non-carcinogenic risk levels (24 and 4 people for groundwater-drinking participants and non-groundwater-drinking participants, respectively). Finally, the associated factors of heavy metals in urine were the drinking water source, body weight, smoking, sex and use of personal protective equipment.","environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

The study was conducted in the paddy field of Khao Dawk Mali 105 in 4 stations. The results of the study revealed that; in period 1, from the period of seeding to tillering, CH4 Flux is in the range of 0.193–1.383 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 or 0.728± 0.429 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 in average; in period 2, from tillering to ripening, CH4 Flux is 1.311–2.446 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 with the average of 1.938 ± 0.359 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1; In period 3, from ripening to harvesting, CH4 Flux of 0.873– 2.235 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 with the average of 1.575± 0.351 mg CH4 m-2 hr-1 Regarding the result, the amount of methane flux has increased according to the age span and the growth of the rice. Besides, there were factors affecting the escalation of the gas release: the water level in the paddy field which means the emission will be decreased when the water is managed to drain prior to harvest stage, considering the factors of the height of rice plant in the paddy field, the smaller number and lower rice plant height is, the lesser methane is emitted. However, in term of the temperature, the higher temperature is, the more methane increases. Consequently, the study of methane flux from rice paddy as well as its factors contributes to the farmers’ ability to manage their paddy fields effectively. This will lead to low organic carbon farming and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agricultural sectors.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

The models were developed using SuperPro® Designer software by gathering the optimized data from the laboratory scale experiments. Sizing of unit operations, chemicals and utility consumptions, and estimation of capital and operating costs with the cost breakdown analysis were acquired from the simulation. A membrane-based process design was proposed in this study. The processes mainly consisted of microfiltration for cell removal, a series of ultrafiltration for eliminating proteins, and the integrated reverse osmosis systems to recover, pre-concentrate, and pre-purify lactic acid. Among the 3 proposed process designs, the in-parallel membrane-based process exhibited the highest lactic acid recovery yield, while the purity remained sufficiently high compared to commercial-grade products. The number of unit operations was found to be responsible for high production cost, in terms of both investment and operating costs. Omitting centrifugation and ultrafiltration at a 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off and use of the in-parallel integrated brackish water reverse-osmosis membrane units could lower operating costs by 23–31% for various fermentation broths that entered the downstream processing units.","genergyal, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Transformation of heavy metal fractionation under changing environments: a case study of a drainage system in an e-waste dismantling community,Damrongsiri S.,2018-04-01,"Chemical Fractionation, Copper, Electronic Waste, Metals, Heavy, Soil, Soil Pollutants, Thailand, Zinc, E-waste, Fractionation, Heavy metal, Sediment, Sewer, Soil, Transformation","The change in environmental conditions during the transportation of contaminated soil and sediment was expected to affect the transformation of heavy metal fractionation. This study disclosed the serious contamination of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the sewer sediment of an e-waste dismantling community in Thailand which may be caused by flushed contaminated soil and e-waste fragments. Two environmental conditions were simulated to observe the transformation of heavy metal fractionation. The anoxic sewer condition was induced using high substrate and sulfate in a closed container. The aeration of anoxic contaminated sediment was applied to simulate the transformation to an oxidative environment. The BCR sequential extraction was applied for heavy metal fractionation in this study. The study results exhibited that when heavy metal contaminated soil was transferred into this induced anoxic condition, fractionation was redistributed based on the chemical change of system that tends to be associated into F3 (oxidizable fraction) > F2 (reducible fraction) > F1 (acid soluble/exchangeable fraction). Cu exhibited the outstanding capability association to F3. The iron sulfide was not observed as usual due to its lower capability than Cu, Pb, and Zn. When contaminated sediment was transported to a more oxidative environment, the heavy metals fractionation would be redistributed again among those new environment media. It is noteworthy that F3 of Cu was stable even in oxic conditions. F2 of Fe was not developed by this oxic condition, possibly because its dehydration process was limited. The redistribution under an oxic environment became F1 > F2 > F3 indicating their more available form. This transformation was imperative and should be taken into account in heavy metal contaminated site management and control.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; disposal, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Analysis revealed that the surface areas of modified MPPCHs increased significantly from Na–BTN; however, the higher MPTMS contents resulted in less porous surface areas. An ethylene adsorption study showed that modified MPPCHs exhibited higher adsorption efficiency of ethylene gas than that of Na–BTN due to the non-polar property of the modified functional groups.

A nationwide multi-institutional registry was conducted to compare the histopathology, clinical features, and survival of Thai adult patients with NHL using large registries, especially those from Far East Asia (FEA). Using a web-based registry system, 13 major medical centers from the 4 geographic regions of Thailand prospectively collected, from 2007 to 2014, the diagnostic pathology, according to the World Health Organization classification, 2008, clinical features and survival of 4056 patients who were newly diagnosed with NHL. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 16-99 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. From the total of 4056 patients, T/NK-cell lymphoma (TNKCL) accounted for 12.6% of cases, and 5.1% had human immunodeficiency virus–associated lymphoma. The four leading histological subtypes were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (58.1%); follicular lymphoma (5.6%); extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (5.2%); and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (4.0%). With a median follow-up duration of 46.1 months, the median overall survival of B-cell NHL was significantly longer than that of patients with TNKCL (76.5 vs 28.8 months, P =.0001). Compared to FEA, the Thai registry had an approximately one-half lower relative frequency of TNKCL; the prevalence of extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma was much lower than in Korea, and the frequency of extranodal TNKCL, nasal type, was strikingly low compared to China. It is concluded that while the median age of Thai patients with NHL was approximately a decade younger than for Caucasians, the long-term survival rates for most histological subtypes were comparable. While the histological distribution generally complied with the characteristic Asian features, some differences from FEA were observed.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Oncology, Cancer Research"

Among the monometallic catalysts (Fe, Co and Cu/TiO2), only Fe/TiO2 catalyst exhibited some selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, while Co/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 were highly selective only to CH4 and CO, respectively. The addition of a small amount of second metal (Co and Cu) on Fe showed the synergetic promotion on the CO2 conversion and the space-time yields (STY) of hydrocarbon products. The incorporation of K and La as promoters can further improve the activity and product selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, indicating that the promoted Fe-based bimetallic catalysts are promising for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Role of mucoprotective agents in endoscopic submucosal dissection-derived ulcers: A systematic review,"Pittayanon R., Martel M., Barkun A.",2018-12-01,"Aged, Blood Transfusion, Demulcents, Drug Therapy, Combination, Endoscopic Mucosal Resection, Female, Gastroscopy, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage, Protective Factors, Proton Pump Inhibitors, Risk Factors, Stomach Ulcer, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Wound Healing, Healing, Mucoprotective agent, Post-gastric ESD, PPI, Ulcer","Background: Currently, it is still unclear whether adding a mucoprotective agent to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) results in better outcomes compared with using a PPI alone in patients with post-gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) ulcers. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of PPI alone versus combination treatment in healing of post-gastric ESD ulcers, as well as on delayed bleeding and amount of blood transfused. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of knowledge databases, up until May 2017, for randomized trials comparing PPI alone versus PPI plus a mucoprotective drug in achieving ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD was performed. The primary outcome is scarring stage on endoscopic assessment at 4 or 8 weeks after gastric ESD. Results: From an initial 3071 citations, eight articles (n = 953 lesions from 934 patients) were analyzed. Patients receiving combination treatment achieved a scarring stage significantly more often than those on a PPIs alone at 4 or 8 weeks after ESD, (risk ratio = 1.36, 95% CI; 1.06–1.75). No study reported amount of blood transfused. There were no significant between treatment-group differences in terms of delayed bleeding (risk ratio = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.17–1.99). Neither location of ulcer nor Helicobacter pylori infection was related to ulcer scarring stage. Conclusion: The limited evidences suggested combination treatment may be more effective in accelerating the process of ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD than the use of PPI alone, but does not appear to alter delayed bleeding risk.","genergyal, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"
CD4/CD8 ratio normalization rates and low ratio as prognostic marker for non-AIDS defining events among long-term virologically suppressed people living with HIV NCT00411983 NCT,"Han W.M., Apornpong T., Kerr S.J., Hiransuthikul A., Gatechompol S., Do T., Ruxrungtham K., Avihingsanon A.",2018-09-27,"Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active, Biomarkers, CD4-CD8 Ratio, Female, HIV Infections, Humans, Incidence, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Male, Prognosis, Proportional Hazards Models, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Thailand, Viral Load, Asia, CD4/CD8 ratio, Immune restoration, Long-term virological suppression, Non-AIDS events","Background: Immune restoration is often incomplete after ART in HIV patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We studied the incidence and probability of CD4/CD8 normalization in an adult Thai HIV cohort and explored the predictive value of the ratio for developing of non-AIDS defining events (NAEs). Methods: We analyzed data from HIV-infected Thai adults between 1996 and 2017 in the HIV-NAT 006 prospective long-term cohort in Bangkok, Thailand. Normalization was defined as CD4/CD8 ratio ≥ 1 on two consecutive visits, and normalization probability was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. NAEs were a composite endpoint including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, non-AIDS defining malignancies and death. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with CD4/CD8 ratio normalization and NAEs. Results: A total of 800 ART-naïve patients with baseline CD4/CD8 ratio of < 0.8 who started combination ART, and had sustained virological suppression were enrolled. Participants were on ART for a median of 8.9 years and virologically suppressed for 6.1 years. The probabilities of CD4/CD8 normalization at 2, 5 and 10 years after virological suppression were 5.1%, 18.6% and 39.1%, respectively. Factors associated with normalization in multivariate analysis were female sex (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.47, 95% CI 1.71-3.56, p < 0.001) and baseline CD4 counts ≥ 350 cells/mm3 (HR: 3.62, 95% CI 2.36-5.55), p < 0.001) vs. < 200 cells/mm3 as reference. The second analysis explored the predictive value of CD4/CD8 ratio for NAEs. Older age (HR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13, p < 0.01) and current CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.3 (HR: 3.02, 95% CI 1.27-7.21, p = 0.01) or between 0.3 and 0.45 (HR: 2.03, 95% CI 1.03-3.98, p = 0.04) vs. > 0.45 were independently associated with higher risk of progression to NAEs in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Our findings showed that complete immune recovery is uncommon in an Asian setting and earlier ART initiation at higher CD4 counts may have increased the ratio sooner. The findings demonstrate the use of CD4/CD8 ratio as a prognostic marker for clinical progression of NAEs.

Association between secondhand smoke exposure and quality of life in pregnant women and postpartum women and the consequences on the newborns,"Kalayasiri R., Supcharoen W., Ouiyanukoon P.",2018-04-01,"Adult, Female, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Maternal Exposure, Postpartum Period, Pregnancy, Pregnant Women, Prevalence, Quality of Life, Self Report, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, Young Adult, Cigarette, Postpartum women, Pregnant women, Prenatal exposure, Quality of life, Secondhand smoke","Purpose: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is prevalent and could damage the health of non-smokers, especially that of pregnant women (PW) and postpartum women (PPW). Nevertheless, there is no study on the impact of SHS during pregnancy on the quality of life (QOL) of PW and PPW. The study’s purpose is to study the effects of exposure to SHS on the QOL of pregnant and postpartum women and health of the newborns. Methods: Self-reports and urine tests for cotinine were used to obtain data on SSH exposure in 296 women in the second trimester of pregnancy and 106 women in the postpartum period at the Obstetrics & Gynecology Clinic located in a university hospital. The WHOQOL-BREF-THAI and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were used to assess QOL and postpartum depression, respectively. Results: Of the participants, 88.2% of PW and 62.3% of PPW reported exposure to SHS during pregnancy. Of the PPW, 5.7% had postpartum depression. PW with good QOL were less likely to have family member who smoked (p = 0.007) or to be exposed to SHS in public parks (p = 0.037) or in the household or workplace (p = 0.011). Likewise, PPW with good QOL in the psychological domain were less likely to be exposed to SHS during pregnancy, as shown in both verbal report (p = 0.010) and objective measure of urine cotinine test (p = 0.034). In addition, maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and other health problems in the newborns (p < 0.05).

A five-Kazal-domain SPIPm2 is the most abundant KPIs in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon and up-regulated in response to yellow head virus (YHV) infection. In this study, the role of SPIPm2 in YHV infection was investigated. The expression of SPIPm2 in hemocytes, gill and heart from 48-h YHV-infected shrimp was increased. The expression of SPIPm2 in hemocytes was significantly increased after 12 h of infection and gradually increased higher afterwards. Silencing of SPIPm2 by dsRNA interference resulted in the increased expression of different apoptosis-related genes, the increased expression of transcriptional factors of antimicrobial synthesis pathways, the reduction of circulating hemocytes in the shrimp hemolymph, and the increased susceptibility of the silenced shrimp to YHV infection. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7 in the hemocytes of SPIPm2-silenced shrimp was also increased by 5.32-fold as compared with those of the control shrimp. The results suggested that the SPIPm2 was involved in the hemocyte homeostasis.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

The relations of roundness, dynamic cutting forces, and cutting conditions have been investigated. In order to eliminate the effects of the cutting conditions, the dynamic cutting forces are dimensionless by taking the ratio of the average variations of dynamic radial force to that of the dynamic feed force. The exponential function is employed for the sake to model the in-process prediction of roundness which consists of cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, tool nose radiuses, rake angles, and dynamic cutting force ratio. The experimentally obtained results showed that the better roundness errors can be obtained by increasing the cutting speed, the tool nose radius, and the rake angle. The new cutting tests have been conducted to verify the obtained model. It is understood that the in-process roundness can be predicted well during cutting with the high accuracy by using the proposed method.","engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Software, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of glaucoma patients who had Baerveldt implantation in 2004 and completed 18 months of follow-up. At 18 months of follow-up, medical records for HP and its associated factors, and surgical outcomes such as rate of failures, intraocular pressure (IOP), numbers of medications administered, and complications were reviewed and identified. Results: Thirty-seven patients were eligible. Mean (SD) preoperative IOP was 30.5 (7.9) mmHg which significantly lowered to 13.1 (7.0) mmHg post-operation. Mean numbers of medications (SD) significantly decreased from 3.6 (0.7) to 1.3 (1.3). Failure rate at 18 months was 10.8% (4/37 patients). HP was noted in 18/37 patients (48.6%) with the onset between 1 and 3 months post-surgery. Preoperative IOP and one previous glaucoma surgery were associated with presence of HP (p = 0.010, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.96 and p = 0.003, OR 26.12, 95% CI 2.95–231.41, respectively). The presence of HP was predictive of postoperative numbers of medications administered (p = 0.001). None of those with HP were from the failure group. Conclusion: Baerveldt implantation is an effective procedure with high success rate. HP was common after Baerveldt implantation. Preoperative IOP and numbers of previous glaucoma surgery are risk factors for developing HP. Presence of HP can predict whether long-term anti-glaucoma medication(s) are needed or not.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

The aims of this retrospective descriptive multicentric study were to describe the computed tomographic characteristics of arterioportal communications in a group of cats and dogs, and to propose a classification based on computed tomography (CT) angiographic anatomy. Computed tomography databases from multiple veterinary hospitals were searched for cats and dogs with a diagnosis of arterioportal communication. A total of 36 animals (33 dogs, three cats) met the inclusion criteria. There were 32 intrahepatic arterioportal malformations and four extrahepatic fistulae. The intrahepatic arterioportal malformations were classified as right divisional (11/32) and left divisional (21/32), and the left divisional were subclassified as left medial (16/21) and left lateral (4/21). One patient showed multiple intrahepatic arterioportal communications with concomitant left medial and left lateral conformations. Two patients with intrahepatic arteriovenous malformation showed concomitant congenital intrahepatic shunts.

Effect of rice husk ash silica as cement replacement for making construction mortar,"Kantapong B., Withit P., Tachai L., Katsuyoshi K.",2018-01-01,"Acid treated, Carbon residue, Cement replacement, Compression strength, Rice husk, Rice husk ash, Cement, Compressive strength, Mortar, Rice husk ash, Silica","Rice husk ash (RHA) is used as a replacement to cement to produce mortar. The effect of 5, 10, and 15wt% addition to the density and compressive strength of mortar is investigated. It was found that with the increasing addition of RHA causes the decrease of compressive strength and density of mortars. Compressive strength of mortar drops with addition of RHA, from a value of 42 MPa of no RHA addition, to 24 MPa of 15wt% RHA addition. Reduction in compression strength may be due to the decrease in density, which arises from porous RHA. This is more dominant in mortar made from addition of RHA without prior acid treated. Carbon residue and impurity in RHA further reduce the compressive strength of mortar. In addition, this research validate the use of a more environmentally friendly citric acid for partially removal of oxide impurities prior to burning the rice husk.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The method requires minimal input data which are normally monitored at all sites so that additional expensive weather observatory devices are not necessary. The proposed SOM can classify weather condition into sunny, cloudy and rainy day, using only the current and past irradiance profile data as input. Then, the ANN-based SPF model for each weather condition is constructed, trained and validated, accordingly. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated using actual field data from the 500-kW solar farm in Mae Hong Son district, Thailand. Accuracy performance obtained indicates that additional spinning reserve of less than 10 %, with respect to the installed solar power capacity, would be required when the proposed SPF method is applied to the energy management system (EMS) for the city.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Extracted samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with Q-Exactive plus hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry, using 2.6 μm C18 media. A 0.1% v/v acetic acid/acetonitrile mobile phase was applied over a 20 min gradient. Method detection limits in full scan mode were ca. 0.04–2.38 ng of analyte per g of sample. Linearity ranged from 0.9750 to 0.9996 over the calibration range of 0.01–100 μg/L; MS mass accuracy was <2 ppm for most analytes. This method was applied to quantify six pharmaceuticals and personal care products in seven invertebrate samples. For tandem mass spectrometry analysis, selection of precursor ions was performed for each pharmaceutical, with Mass Frontier software illustrating the fragmentation mechanism. Effects of collision energy on intensities of ions was further investigated. The tandem mass spectrometry condition resulting in the highest signal of respective selected product ion was selected to confirm each pharmaceutical, which was initially observed in the full scan mode.

The anti-tyrosinase and immunomodulatory effects of sericin have been known for decades. However, the therapeutic effects of sericin on hyperpigmentation disorders have not been well documented. Methods: In this study, we used an in vitro model to study the anti-tyrosinase, tolerogenic, and anti-melanogenic effects of sericin on Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PEG)-stimulated melanocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and artificial skin (MelanoDerm™). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, conventional and immunolabeled electron microscopy, and histopathological studies were performed. Results: The results revealed that urea-extracted sericin has strong anti-tyrosinase properties as shown by a reduction of tyrosinase activity in melanin pigments both 48 h and 10 days after allergic induction with PEG. Anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β were upregulated upon sericin treatment (10, 20, and 50 µg/mL), whereas production of allergic chemokines, CCL8 and CCL18, by DCs was diminished 48 h after allergic induction with PEG. Moreover, sericin lowered the expression of micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a marker of melanogenesis regulation, in melanocytes and keratinocytes, which contributed to the reduction of melanin size and the magnitude of melanin deposition. However, sericin had no effect on melanin transport between melanocytes and keratinocytes, as demonstrated by a high retention of cytoskeletal components. Conclusion: In summary, sericin suppresses melanogenesis by inhibition of tyrosinase activity, reduction of inflammation and allergy, and modulation of MITF function.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

Methods: The susceptibility of 53 F. columnare isolates to 11 antimicrobials, including 2 quinolones, was investigated by the disk diffusion method. Oxolinic acid (OXO) was subsequently chosen for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Sequence analysis of four genes within the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of OXO-resistant F. columnare compared with susceptible isolates was subsequently performed. Results: The disk diffusion assay revealed that the majority of isolates were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. However, 14 and 8 isolates were resistant to the quinolone antibiotics OXO and nalidixic acid, respectively. No multidrug resistance was observed. The MIC assay revealed five additional isolates that were resistant to OXO (≥4 μg/mL), making a total of 19 OXO-resistant isolates observed in this study. DNA sequencing identified missense mutations both in parC and gyrA but not in gyrB or parE in QR F. columnare isolates. Mutation in parC resulted in the change His87 → Tyr. For gyrA, 15 isolates of Thai origin exhibited a change at residue Ser83 to either Phe, Tyr or Ala, whereas 3 Vietnamese isolates contained two mutation sites (Ser83 → Phe and Asp87 → Tyr).

The development of dental educators has so far received little consideration. This study aimed to agree curriculum content for developing dental educators so that they are better able to support changing undergraduate dental education. Methods: Adopting consensus methodology, a 2-round Delphi was conducted in 2012. Fifty-three dental educators and 39 dental students across Europe volunteered to take part. The Delphi questionnaire was developed based on literature, piloted and sent to participants to gather opinions and seek consensus on educational content using rating scales and open-ended questions. Numeric data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results and Discussion: This study revealed 7 domains of curriculum content for dental educators. Four of these domains were considered essential: educational principles; educational practice in dentistry; curriculum, quality and improvement; and educational professionalism. Three domains were viewed as optional and could be tailored to local needs: educational principles in relation to specific contexts, educational research, and educational and healthcare management. When developing training for dental educators, factors which need consideration were identified as the academic position and teaching experience of educators, and the nature of clinical dental education. Conclusion: The results are beneficial for individual educators to inform professional development plans; institutions to devise faculty developments; ADEE to inform policies on developing European dental educators; and other disciplines to inform training for their educators.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"

No previous studies examined IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to the TRYCAT pathway in deficit versus nondeficit schizophrenia. We measured IgM responses to NOX TRYCATs, namely, quinolinic acid (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic acid (PA), and xanthurenic (XA) acid, and PRO TRYCATs, including kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA), in 40 healthy controls and 40 deficit and 40 nondeficit schizophrenic patients. We computed the IgM responses to NOX (QA + PA + 3HK + XA)/PRO (AA + KA) ratio and ∆ differences in IgA − IgM TRYCAT values and NOX/PRO ratio. Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by significantly attenuated IgM responses to all TRYCATs and NOX/PRO ratio and highly increased ∆IgA − IgM NOX/PRO ratio as compared to nondeficit schizophrenia and healthy controls. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are significantly and positively associated with increased IgM responses directed against the KA/3HK ratio and ∆IgA − IgM NOX/PRO ratio. The findings support the view that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct subtype of schizophrenia that may be significantly discriminated from nondeficit schizophrenia. Deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by a highly specific defect in IgM isotype-mediated regulatory responses directed to the TRYCAT pathway. Lowered IgM regulatory responses together with mucosa-derived activation of the TRYCAT pathway may contribute to neuroprogression, negative symptoms, and deficit schizophrenia. All in all, a highly specific defect in the compensatory (anti-)inflammatory reflex system (CIRS), namely, natural IgM-mediated regulatory responses, may underpin deficit schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Investigation of a simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing method on pure nickel using quartz and RHA,"Hengprayoon B., Leelachao S., Visuttipitukul P.",2018-01-01,"Ammonium chloride, Argon atmospheres, Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS), Glancing incident angle, Interdiffusion layer, Nickel aluminides, Rice husk ash, X ray diffractometers, Nickel, Nickel aluminide, Pack aluminizing, Rice husk ash (RHA)","This research aims to study the simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing method using silica (SiO2) from Rice Husk Ash (RHA) which contains 99.45% SiO2 in comparison with commercial SiO2 in the form of quartz. Samples can thus be categorized into two groups: quartz-doped and RHA-doped. Simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing of pure nickel was performed at 1000°C for 4 hours under an argon atmosphere. The pack used in this research was prepared from aluminum (Al), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2, i.e. quartz and RHA) powder at ratios of 29:2:60:9 by weight, respectively. Post aluminized samples were characterized by glancing incident-angle X-ray diffractometer (GIXD). Quantitative analysis of the layer was performed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the resulting microstructure. It was found that simultaneous silicon-modified pack aluminizing can be successfully performed by doping RHA and quartz into the pack. The aluminized layer consists of Ni2Al3 and NiAl3 with a small amount of silicon. RHA was found to be more effective than quartz as a silicon source providing a higher amount of silicon in the aluminized layer. Moreover, using RHA successfully forms a silicon-rich interdiffusion layer beneath the typical aluminized layer.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

We sought to examine the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure in patients with IBD. Methods: We identified patients diagnosed with IBD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1980 through 2010 (n = 736). For each patient, 2 individuals without IBD (controls, n = 1472) were randomly selected, matched for age, sex, and index date of disease diagnosis. Primary outcomes were AMI and heart failure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the risk of AMI and heart failure. Results: After adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, IBD associated independently with increased risk of AMI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.82; 95% CI, 1.98–4.04) and heart failure (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.36–3.03). The relative risk of AMI was significantly increased in patients with Crohn's disease (aHR vs controls, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.65–5.13) or ulcerative colitis (aHR vs controls, 2.70; 1.69–4.35). The relative risk of AMI was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR vs controls, 5.08; 95% CI, 3.00–8.81) and nonusers (aHR vs controls, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08–2.98). The relative risk of heart failure was significantly increased among patients with ulcerative colitis (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.18–3.65), but not Crohn's disease. The relative risk of heart failure was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.93–4.57), but not nonusers. Conclusions: In a population-based cohort study, we found that despite a lower prevalence of traditional risk factors for AMI and heart failure, patients with IBD are at increased risk for these cardiovascular disorders.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

With the intent of collecting evidence to confirm the presence of rickettsioses in dogs and to assess the level of associated potential for accidental human infection, human buffy coat from patients with fever of unknown origin (n = 168), whole blood samples from dogs (n = 353), and 19 flea groups from our dog sample population were studied during the 2012 to 2014 study period. The presence of Rickettsia was investigated by molecular detection of 23S rRNA gene of Rickettsia genus, citrate synthase (gltA) gene, and 17-kDa outer membrane gene. All positive samples were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Using phylogenetic analysis, three groups of Rickettsia were detected, as follows: Rickettsia felis in 8 patients and 8 dogs; R. felis-like sp. in 2 patients, 5 dogs, and 11 flea samples; and Rickettsia typhi in 3 patients. In addition to confirming the presence of R. felis in Thai patients, the findings of this study suggest that R. felis-like sp. isolated from fleas that were symbiotically coexisting with dogs that we evaluated in this study can transmit and cause disease in dogs and humans in Bangkok.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Hundred grams of film solution contained 0.4 g KGM, 3.8 g WPI and 1.5 g glycerol. During drying process, air velocity was varied to produce fast drying (3 h) and slow drying (15 h) in tray dryers under 50 °C. The high air velocity resulted in a significant higher drying rate in fast drying than low air velocity in slow drying. Drying curves from both processes were well-fitted with Page model and Henderson and Pabis model (R2 ≥ 0.98). Fast drying improved transparency and mechanical properties without impairing color, solubility or water vapor permeability (WVP). Fast-dried film had less surface roughness and contained larger protein clusters. It also had greater melting enthalpy of protein aggregates, implying stronger networks. For stability study, fast-dried film was stored at 4-35 °C for 24 days. Transparency decreased over time. Overall mechanical properties have improved during storage. Color, solubility and WVP did not significantly change over time at all conditions (p > 0.05). Microstructure of aged films was relatively similar to that of the freshly prepared film. Overall, the fast-dried KGM-WPI film exhibited reasonable storage stability.","chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science, Biophysics, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Development of novel AEDs therefore remains a high priority. Perampanel is a first-in-class non-competitive selective AMPA receptor antagonist with a unique mechanism of action. Clinical efficacy and safety of perampanel as adjunctive treatment for focal seizures with/without secondary generalization (±SG) and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures have been established in five phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a long-term extension study, and perampanel is approved as monotherapy for focal seizures ±SG in the USA. In patients with focal seizures ±SG, add-on perampanel resulted in median percent reduction in seizure frequency 23.3%-34.5% and ≥50% responder rate 28.5%-37.6%; in PGTC seizures, these results were 76.5% and 64.2%, respectively. Efficacy among adolescents (reduction in seizure frequency 34.8%-35.6%; ≥50% responder rate 40.9%-45.0%) and elderly people (reduction in seizure frequency 12.5%-16.9%; ≥50% responder rate 22.2%-42.9%) is similar to those in adults, and results remain comparable between Asian (reduction in seizure frequency 17.3%-38.0%) and global populations. Perampanel has been extensively studied in real-world clinical practice, with similar efficacy and safety results to the RCTs (≥50% responder rate 12.8%-75.0%; adverse events of somnolence/sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and behavioral changes). Real-world observational studies suggest that perampanel tolerability can be improved by slow titration (2 mg every 2-4 weeks), and bedtime administration can mitigate somnolence and dizziness. Counseling about the potential for behavioral changes and close monitoring are recommended.","genergyal, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"
Recognizing the leaky gut as a trans-diagnostic target for neuro-immune disorders using clinical chemistry and molecular immunology assays,"Simeonova D., Ivanovska M., Murdjeva M., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2018-01-01,"Autoimmune Diseases, Clinical Chemistry Tests, Humans, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G, Immunoglobulin M, Bacteria, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Depression, Gut, Immune, Inflammation","Background: Increased intestinal permeability with heightened translocation of Gram-negative bacteria, also known as “leaky gut”, is associated with the pathophysiology of neuroimmune disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CSF) and (deficit) schizophrenia, as well as with general medical disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome. This review aims to summarize clinical biochemistry and molecular immunology tests that may aid in the recognition of leaky gut in clinical practice. Methods: We searched online libraries, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Scopus, with the key words “diagnosis” or “biomarkers” and “leaky gut”, “bacterial translocation”, and “intestinal permeability” and focused on papers describing tests that may aid in the clinical recognition of leaky gut. Results: To evaluate tight junction barrier integrity, serum IgG/IgA/IgM responses to occludin and zonulin and IgA responses to actomyosin should be evaluated. The presence of cytotoxic bacterial products in serum can be evaluated using IgA/IgM responses to sonicated samples of common Gram-negative gut commensal bacteria and assays of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and other bacterial toxins, including cytolethal distenting toxin, subunit B. Major factors associated with increased gut permeability, including gut dysbiosis and yeast overgrowth, use of NSAIDs and alcohol, food hypersensitivities (IgE-mediated), food intolerances (IgG-mediated), small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), systemic inflammation, psychosocial stressors, some infections (e.g., HIV) and dietary patterns, should be assessed. Stool samples can be used to assay gut dysbiosis, gut inflammation and decreased mucosal defenses using assays of fecal growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi and stool assays of calprotectin, secretory IgA, β-defensin, α-antitrypsin, lysozyme and lactoferrin. Blood and breath tests should be used to exclude common causes of increased gut permeability, namely, food hypersensitivities and intolerances, SIBO, lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption. Discussion: Here, we propose strategies to recognize “leaky gut” in a clinical setting using the most adequate clinical chemistry and molecular immunology assays.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

In this systematic review we aimed to determine the effects of AH combined with INCS (AH-INCS) for treating AR. Methods: Literature searches were performed using Medline and Embase. Randomized, controlled trials that studied the effects of AH-INCS vs INCS monotherapy for treating patients with AR were included. The primary outcomes were total nasal symptom scores, total ocular symptom scores, and disease-specific quality of life. The secondary outcomes were objective tests for nasal patency and adverse events. Results: Sixteen studies (4026 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with INCS, AH-INCS decreased total nasal symptom scores (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.19 to −0.06; p < 0.001; 10 trials, 3348 patients) and total ocular symptom scores (SMD, −0.12, 95% CI, −0.20 to −0.04; p = 0.003; 6 trials, 2378 patients). Subgroup analysis indicated no benefit with the oral AH-INCS combination but did show benefit with intranasal AH-INCS (SMD, −0.18; 95% CI, −0.27 to −0.09; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences with regard to disease-specific quality of life (SMD, −0.07; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.02; p = 0.12; 6 trials, 1981 patients), nasal inspiratory flow (MD, −0.03 L/min; 95% CI, −0.57 to 0.50; p = 0.91; 1 trial, 54 patients), or adverse events.

Then, transparent cellulose sheet was successfully prepared by backfilling the nano/micro sized aerogel channel with a refractive index matching polymer which was PMMA emulsion in this study. The transparent cellulose sheet exhibited 80-90 percent transparency. In contrast, cellulose aerogel exhibited relatively low percent transmittance only 8.24%. In addition, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of transparent cellulose sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm (10.45 ppmK-1) was significantly lower that pure PMMA sheet (79.70 ppmK-1), indicating that aerogel based transparent cellulose exhibited lower thermal expansion than neat plastic.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

This is lacking in the Asia-Pacific region. Design: The observational Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was established to quantify the extent of hyperlipidemia in adults with acute and stable coronary heart disease globally. Methods: Patients with stable coronary heart disease or hospitalised with an acute coronary syndrome were enrolled across nine Asia-Pacific countries from July 2013 to October 2014. Lipid-lowering therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment (<70 mg/dL) were assessed. The acute coronary syndrome cohort was followed up 4 months post-discharge. Results: Of the 4592 patients enrolled, 2794 had stable coronary heart disease and 1798 were admitted with an acute coronary syndrome. In the coronary heart disease cohort, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 86.9 mg/dL, with 91.7% using lipid-lowering therapy and 31% achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL. In the acute coronary syndrome cohort at admission, the corresponding values were 103.2 mg/dL, 63.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Target attainment was significantly higher in lipid-lowering therapy-treated than non-treated patients in each cohort (32.6% vs. 12.9% and 31.1% vs. 9.0%, respectively). Mean atorvastatin-equivalent dosages were low (20 ± 15 and 22 ± 18 mg/day, respectively), with little use of non-statin adjuvants (13.0% and 6.8%, respectively). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target attainment had improved by follow-up for the acute coronary syndrome patients, but remained low (41.7%). Conclusions: Many patients in Asia at very high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level above the recommended target.

Ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) amoA genes outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) amoA genes in reactor NRI, while only AOB amoA genes were detectable in reactor NRII. The AOA amoA gene sequences retrieved from NRI were characterized within the Nitrososphaera sister cluster of the group 1.1b Thaumarchaeota. Two inhibitors for ammonia oxidation, allylthiourea (ATU) and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), were applied individually and as a mixture to observe the ammonia-oxidizing activity of both microorganisms in the reactors’ sludge. The results indicated that AOA and AOB jointly oxidized ammonia in NRI, while AOB played the main role in ammonia oxidation in NRII. DNA-stable isotope probing with labeled 13C–HCO3 − was performed on NRI sludge. Incorporation of 13C into AOA and AOB implied that both microorganisms may perform autotrophy during ammonia oxidation. Taken together, the results from this study provide direct evidence demonstrating the contribution of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in the nitrifying reactors.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial metabolism and physicsiology; nitrogen transport and metabolism, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov were searched up to 7 February 2017. Two independent reviewers selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments to alleviate agitation in people with all-types dementia. Data were extracted using standardized forms and study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs. Data were pooled using meta-analysis. The primary outcome, efficacy, was 8-week response rates defined as a 50% reduction in baseline agitation score. The secondary outcome was treatment acceptability defined as treatment continuation for 8 weeks. Results: Thirty-six RCTs comprising 5585 participants (30.9% male; mean ± standard deviation age, 81.8 ± 4.9 years) were included.

Haloperidol appeared less efficacious than nearly all comparators. Most treatments had noninferior treatment continuation compared to placebo, except oxcarbazepine, which was inferior. Findings were supported by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Risperidone, serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a class and dextromethorphan/quinidine demonstrated evidence of efficacy for agitation in dementia, although findings for dextromethorphan/quinidine were based on a single RCT. Our findings do not support prescribing haloperidol due to lack of efficacy, or oxcarbazepine due to lack of acceptability.

However, pre-EBV cut-off values vary among studies. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of 208 NPC patients from a phase II/III study comparing sequential (SEQ) vs. simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity modulated radiation therapy. The objective was to identify the optimal pre-EBV cut-off value to predict overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. Results: The pre-EBV and post-treatment EBV DNA (post-EBV) were detectable in 59.1% and 3.8% of the patients, respectively. A new pre-EBV cut-off value of 2300 copies/ml was identified by the receiver operating characteristics analysis. This cut-off value showed 82% sensitivity, 59% specificity and 31.7% positive and 93.5% negative predictive values in predicting OS. The 3-year OS, PFS and DMFS were 95.6 vs. 73.8%, 89.8 vs. 55.3% and 93 vs. 70.1% for pre-EBV < vs. ≥ 2300 copies/ml, respectively. Older age group (≥ 45 years), high pre-EBV and detectable post-EBV concentration were independent predictors for OS, PFS and DMFS in a multivariate analysis. When the stage grouping and pre-EBV value were combined, a subgroup of patients with stage II-III and pre-EBV values < 2300 copies/ml. had the best survival outcomes, while the worst survival subgroup was the patients with stage III-IVb with pre-EBV values ≥ 2300 copies/ml.

In order to handle this kind of problem, Steganography can be used instead. It can be operated in two domains: Spatial and frequency domains. Usually, spatial domain-based methods usually yield higher payload than transform domain-based methods. On the other hand, transform domain-based methods usually work well with image compression. In a recent survey, many existing transform domain-based methods are designed for a JPEG-based image. Even though the JPEG-based image is widely used, the JPEG compression performance is not good enough in cloud era for which tons of images are transferred over the internet. Thus, the newer image format such as WebP is presented to provide better compression performance. In this research, the new scheme for image steganography based on WebP is presented. The proposed method archived good performance in terms of data capacity, image quality and file size compared to the existing JPEG-based method. Moreover, because WebP supports alpha-channel. Thus, image steganography with alpha-channel is also introduced.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Group 3: IM route of chitosan bacterin followed by IM route of chitosan bacterin; group 4: commercial bacterin via IM route followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route; group 5: commercial bacterin via IM route followed by commercial bacterin via IM route; group 6: chitosan bacterin via IM followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route; and group 7: chitosan bacterin via IO route followed by chitosan bacterin via IO route were determined. At 16 wk of age, all groups, excluding group 1, were challenged intratracheally with 0.1 mL containing Thai MG strain 10 7 colony-forming unit. At 17, 18, and 20 wk of age, 5 birds in each group were bled for serological testing and swabbed at the choanal cleft for the quantitative real-time PCR assay, the euthanized and necropsied. The results showed that birds vaccinated with a commercial intramuscular bacterin followed by an intraocularly chitosan adjuvant bacterin showed the best protection against the MG challenge. The study indicated that chitosan could be the effective mucosal adjuvant and increased the effectiveness of MG bacterin.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology
A randomized trial of low-dose gabapentin for post hospitalization relapse prevention in a Thai clinical sample of alcohol dependence,"Chompookham P., Rukngan W., Nilaban S., Suwanmajo S., Yoosom P., Kalayasiri R.",2018-12-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Alcoholism, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists, Female, Gabapentin, Hospitalization, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Secondary Prevention, Thailand, Young Adult, Alcohol, Dependence, Gabapentin, Heavy drinking","Pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder show a modest effect, and they are unavailable in certain countries. The study's aim is to investigate the effects of gabapentin on alcohol drinking. One hundred twelve Thai individuals with alcohol dependence and very high alcohol consumption were randomly assigned to either of two groups: gabapentin treatment or placebo. Oral treatment with at least 300 mg of gabapentin per day or placebo was administered once a day for twelve weeks. The alcohol drinking pattern was assessed by means of the timeline followback method. The drinking behaviours of the two groups were compared by means of the Poisson repeated measures model and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analysis. Twenty subjects (35.7%) from the gabapentin group and 14 subjects (25.0%) from the placebo group completed the study protocol. The participants in the gabapentin group did not differ from those in the placebo group with respect to demographics or baseline alcohol drinking behaviour. After follow-up, the gabapentin group showed a lower percentage of heavy drinking days per week than the placebo group (p < 0.005). GEE analysis showed treatment by time interaction on lowering drinking days within a week (p < 0.05). In conclusion, gabapentin may be used to reduce alcohol-drinking behaviours.","neuroscienceoscience; behavioural neuroscienceoscience; addiction, tolerance and withdrawal mechanisms; alcohol, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

The process simulation was performed using the Aspen plus® software based on the plant biodiesel production capacity of 40,000 tonnes/y. Even though the L-SCM had a higher total capital investment than the Alkali-cat process ($7.19 million versus $4.91 million), it was economically viable. The L-SCM process provided a lower manufacturing cost of $37.28 million and the highest net present value (NPV) of $45.48 million. However, the C-SCM process was not financially profitable because of the large amount of methanol employed in the recycling loop. Sensitivity analysis of all the processes was investigated based on variations in the feedstock and products selling price and revealed that the biodiesel selling price and palm oil price were the major effects on the sensitivity of the NPV.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Is the occiput-wall distance valid and reliable to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis?,"Wiyanad A., Chokphukiao P., Suwannarat P., Thaweewannakij T., Wattanapan P., Gaogasigam C., Amatachaya P., Amatachaya S.",2018-12-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Child, Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures, Female, Humans, Kyphosis, Male, Middle Aged, Reproducibility of Results, Thoracic Vertebrae, Young Adult, Cobb angle, Dowager's hump, Round back, Spine","Background: Hyperkyphosis may be frequently found nowadays due to the change in current lifestyles of sustained flexion postures and age-related system decline. The occiput-wall distance (OWD) is a practical measure that is commonly used to screen and monitor thoracic hyperkyphosis in epidemiologic studies. However, there was no clear evidence to support the clinical utility of the tool as compared to the data from direct standard measures. Objectives: To investigate psychometric properties—including validity, reliability, and appropriate cut-off point—of the OWD to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis, as compared to a standard Cobb's method. Design: Observational study. Methods: This study was conducted in ninety-nine participants, aged 10 years and above who had different degrees of thoracic hyperkyphosis from several communities. All participants were assessed for their severity of thoracic hyperkyphosis using the OWD, and 14 participants were involved in a reliability study. Within 7 days later, all participants were at a hospital to complete a radiographic examination. Results: Outcomes from OWD had good concurrent validity with the Cobb angles (r = 0.683, P < 0.001) and excellent rater reliability when assessed by well-trained health professionals (ICCs > 0.9, P < 0.001). The OWD of at least 6.5 cm had the best diagnostic properties to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis (sensitivity = 71.4%, specificity = 76.6%, and area under the curve = 0.846). Conclusion: The findings support validity and reliability of OWD, and offer a clear cut-off point to determine the presence of thoracic hyperkyphosis for clinical utility in various settings.",Health Professions,"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

Melamine is successfully used as a Nitrogen source for graphene doping by simple reflux process. The influence of reducing agent ratio is also investigated to study the degree of reducing of graphene functionalized melamine on capacitive behavior. At reducing agent/graphene ratio of 1:1, the nitrogen functional graphene can deliver the highest specific capacitance of 333.38 F/g at 10mV/sec, which is much higher than that obtained from bare graphene. The increasing of reducing agent ratio higher than 1 tends to decrease the capacitive values of graphene functionalized melamine confirming the efficiency of doped Nitrogen content on graphene. This N-doped graphene feature can be viewed as the potentially ideal candidate materials for supercapacitor application.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

By integrating these two proposed methods into electronic colon cleansing (ECC), FTM can be effectively removed by a simple thresholding method. For subjective or clinical evaluation, a radiologist grades the quality of cleansing based on five causes of low quality cleansing. The average grade of our proposed method for clinical evaluation is 2.5714 out of 4. For objective evaluations, three cases exist: PEH correction, ECC, and visual assessment. First, PEH correction evaluation measures the success in the removal of PEH voxels with CT attenuations greater than or equal to 500 HU using the proposed PEH correction by comparing the results of this correction with the results from the existing method via CT attenuation profiles. Second, ECC is evaluated by comparing the results from applying our proposed methods with the ground truth. The results indicate that the goodness of cleansing is 0.01% and the global mean relative error is less than 0.016% with 99.99% confidence. Third, visual assessment of our ECC results confirms that soft-tissue components around FTM, especially ATT layers, are preserved.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Biomedical Engineering

Unlike other CNS depressants, including alcohol and opiates, no treatment is currently approved for inhalant dependence. In this report, a novel approach of substitution treatment for inhalant addiction was explored in a double-blinded, randomized, controlled crossover design to examine the effects of inhalation of essential oil and perfume on the reduction of cue-induced craving for inhalant in thirty-four Thai males with inhalant dependence. The craving response was measured by the modified version of Penn Alcohol Craving Score for Inhalants (PACS-inhalants). The participants (mean age ± SE = 27.9 ± 1.4) in this trial had used inhalant for 5.8 ± 1.1 years. Cravings could be induced in all participants by visual cues as assessed by ^50% increases in inhalant craving levels. Generalized estimating equations showed a significant suppressant effect of essential oil, but not perfume, on the craving response as compared with baseline cue-induced craving. Moreover, essential oil, but not perfume, had significant effects on physiological responses including decreasing pulse rate. It is concluded that inhaling essential oil as a substitution treatment for inhalant may be used as part of treatment programs for reducing inhalant craving.","neuroscienceoscience; behavioural neuroscienceoscience; addiction, tolerance and withdrawal mechanisms; alcohol, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

This 3-year multicenter study was conducted on elderly Thai patients with AML, and aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and factors impacting the survival outcome of the patients. From the 235 elderly patients with AML, patients with poor performance status and patients receiving low-intensive therapy had significantly poorer survival outcome. Background: Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poorer prognosis than younger ones. Several factors contribute to the poor outcomes for this patient group. Patients and Methods: This study investigated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of elderly Thai patients with AML. This 3-year, prospective, multicenter study was focused on Thai patients with AML aged over 60 years who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2016. Results: Of 680 patients with AML, 235 elderly patients with AML (34.6%) were identified, with a mean age of 70 ± 8 years. Using a 3-group cytogenetic risk classification (favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk), the proportions of patients in each category were 3.6%, 73.8%, and 22.6%, respectively. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 846 days. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients was 128.2 days (range, 0-1205 days), with a 1-year OS of 13%. From a multivariate analysis, the significant factors associated with an improved long-term OS were patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and those receiving intensive therapy. Conclusion: Our study confirms the high prevalence of AML in elderly patients with generally poor outcomes.

In many countries such as Thailand, cementitious materials are usually used for ground improvement. Controlled Lowstrength Material (CLSM) was considered in this study as a pavement base material. The CLSM mixes were prepared by varying cement, fly ash and fine aggregate content. Each mixed component was studied for their physical and chemical properties. After mixing, properties of the CLSM were investigated based on the standard testing of fresh concrete and cement-treated base material. The flowability, setting time and bleeding were checked to ensure that the CLSM were self-compacting. The mechanical properties of hardened CLSM were determined by means of CBR, unconfined compressive strength and resilient modulus tests. The resilient modulus results were used in the analytical design of flexible pavement with CLSM base. The critical traffic data under high-volume road collected by the Thailand Department of Highway was adopted in this study. Results show that the CLSM base considerably increased the performance as well as design life of asphalt pavement compared with the conventional crush rock base pavement.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

The present work reports on the significant promoting effects of K and La addition to Fe–Cu/TiO2 catalyst on higher hydrocarbon production from CO2 hydrogenation. The incorporation of both K and La promoters can improve both CO2 hydrogenation activity and selectivity to higher hydrocarbons of Fe-based catalyst. Characterization by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) showed that the presence of K promoter significantly decreased the adsorption of H2, which suppressed the CH4 formation. On the other hand, La addition can promote the moderately adsorbed CO2 species (mainly monodentate carbonate species), which leads to the enhanced C5–C7 selectivity. The simultaneous use of promoters La and K can tailor the H and C coverage on the catalyst surface, which plays an important role in altering product distribution in CO2 hydrogenation.

To date, 3 bocaviruses, canine bocaviruses 1 to 3 (CBoV-1–3), have been shown to affect dogs with different disease manifestations reported for infected animals. We used next-generation sequencing to identify a novel strain of canine CBoV-2 (CBoV TH-2016) in a litter of puppies that died in Thailand from acute dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which no causal pathogen could be identified in routine assays. Analysis of the complete coding sequences of CBoV TH-2016 showed that this virus was most closely related to a strain previously identified in South Korea (isolate 14D193), with evidence of genetic recombination in the VP2 gene with related strains from South Korea and Hong Kong. Use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of CBoV TH-2016 in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous virus spread, while only intestinal tissue was found to be positive by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. Histologic small intestinal lesions associated with CBoV TH-2016 infection were eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within villous enterocytes without villous atrophy or fusion, similar to those previously considered pathognomonic for CBoV-1 infection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights in the pathogenicity of canine bocavirus infections and suggests that a novel recombinant CBoV-2 may result in atypical findings of CBoV infection. Although the specific cause of death of these puppies remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric CBoV TH-2016 infection is possible.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)

Methods: We recruited 80 schizophrenic patients and 40 healthy controls and assessed 10 key cognitive tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results: Partial Least Squares path modeling shows that a large part of the variance in negative symptoms and the deficit phenotype (39-53%) is explained by executive impairments, TRYCAT levels and male sex and that 53.4% of the variance in executive impairments is explained by TRYCATs, lower education, age and a familial history of psychosis. Specific indirect effects of TRYCATs, age and education on negative symptoms are mediated by executive impairments. Nevertheless, sustained attention, memory and emotion recognition also mediate the effects of TRYCATS, lower education and male sex on negative symptoms. Conclusion: Deficit schizophrenia is accompanied by a broader spectrum of cognitive impairments than nondeficit schizophrenia, including executive functions, sustained attention, episodic and semantic memory and emotion recognition.

We present a 69 arcmin 2 ALMA survey at 1.1 mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band part of the GOODS-South field. Methods. We tapered the 0″24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized beam of 0″60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extracted a catalog of galaxies purely selected by ALMA and identified sources with and without HST counterparts down to a 5σ limiting depth of H=28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). Results. ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy at 1.1 mm in the 0″60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity σ ≃ 0.18 mJy beam -1 ) with a purity greater than 80%. Among these detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive status will require additional investigation. We detect additional three sources with HST counterparts either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections. Conclusions. Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies with ALMA with a median redshift of z=2.92 and a median stellar mass of M ∗ =1.1 × 10 11 M ⊙ . Our sample includes 20% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the mid-infrared with Spitzer-IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them (z∼4.3 and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts z> 4. At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an X-ray AGN, compared to ∼14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes affected by confusion.","optical variables measurements, fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"
The immunopathogenic and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-12 in periodontal disease,"Issaranggun Na Ayuthaya B., Everts V., Pavasant P.",2018-04-01,"Animals, Humans, Immunity, Cellular, Interleukin-12, Mice, Periodontal Diseases, Periodontium, bone remodeling, immunomodulation, inflammation, interleukin-12, periodontal disease","Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is an inflammatory cytokine that promotes the response of the immune system. This cytokine has been implicated as a potent stimulator of several diseases characterized by inflammatory-induced bone destruction, such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. Yet, the exact role of IL-12 in the development and progress of periodontitis has not been clarified. Several studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between the level of IL-12 and the severity of periodontal destruction. Deletion of IL-12 in mice with periodontitis significantly suppressed the level of bone destruction. Interestingly, next to a role in modulating the pathogenesis, IL-12 also has immunological-regulatory properties. This cytokine induces expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Thus, these findings suggest both negative and positive influences of IL-12 in periodontal disease. It is currently proposed that the diversity of action of cytokines is a molecular key which regulates biological development and homeostasis. Accordingly, the actions of IL-12 might be one of the mechanisms that regulate homeostasis of periodontal tissue during and following inflammation. Therefore, this article aims to review both destructive and protective functionalities of IL-12 with an emphasis on periodontal disease.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Synthesis of these specific core-shell nanostructures is achieved via a facile, novel, and one-pot approach using oxidative growth of C-TiO2 onto TiC nanoparticles, which has a higher electrochemical activity than those of pure P25 and TiC nanoparticles. The core-shell nanostructured anodes exhibit a high lithium storage capacity (352.8 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1), good rate capability (253.6 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 158.1 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1), and outstanding cycle stability in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) (~ 150 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 400 cycles), which is about 48 times and 7 times higher than that of TiO2 electrode (~ 3.3 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1) and TiC (~ 25 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). According to the first-principle calculation, the ultrahigh capacity and cycle stability of the as-prepared anode is ascribed to the enhancement of Li+ absorption and diffusion ability through formation of C-TiO2 porous layer onto the conductive TiC particles. Moreover, the increase of electron density around the Fermi level is found to be mainly caused by the core-shell nanostructures. The results demonstrate that the presence of TiC plays an important role in providing high conductivity and the novel core-shell nanostructure can buffer the huge volume expansion and contraction during prolonged cycling, resulting in great potential applications in LIBs.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Materials Science, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Add-on Treatment with Curcumin Has Antidepressive Effects in Thai Patients with Major Depression: Results of a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study,"Kanchanatawan B., Tangwongchai S., Sughondhabhirom A., Suppapitiporn S., Hemrunrojn S., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2018-04-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Curcumin, Depressive Disorder, Major, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Statistics, Nonparametric, Thailand, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult, Depression, Immune, Inflammation, Oxidative and nitrosative stress","Activation of immune-inflammatory and oxidative-nitrosative (IO&NS) stress pathways plays a role in major depression (MDD). Evidence suggests that curcumin (500–1000 mg/day), a polyphenol with strong anti-IO&NS properties, may have efficacy either as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment for depression. Further controlled trials with extended treatment periods (> 8 weeks) and higher curcumin doses are warranted. This 12-week study was carried out to examine the effects of adjunctive curcumin for the treatment of MDD. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 65 participants with MDD were randomized to receive either adjunctive curcumin (increasing dose from 500 to 1500 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Four weeks after the active treatment phase, a follow-up visit was conducted at week 16. Assessments of the primary, i.e., the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and secondary, i.e., the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), outcome measures were rated at baseline and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks later. Curcumin was more efficacious than placebo in improving MADRS scores with significant differences between curcumin and placebo emerging at weeks 12 and 16. The effects of curcumin were more pronounced in males compared to females. There were no statistically significant treatment-emerging adverse effects and no significant effects of curcumin on blood chemistry and ECG measurements. Adjunctive curcumin has significant antidepressant effects in participants with MDD as evidenced by significant benefits occurring 12 and 16 weeks after treatment initiation. Curcumin administration was safe and well-tolerated even when combined with antidepressants. Future trials should include treatment-by-sex interactions to examine putative antidepressant effects of immune-modifying compounds.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

Therefore, 8 mol% YSZ thin films were deposited by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique on the porous NiO-YSZ anode substrates prepared by powder injection molding (PIM) method. The effects of EPD conditions on the electrolyte microstructures were investigated, and the half-cell fabrication parameters and co-sintering temperature were subsequently optimized. The dense YSZ thin films at the thicknesses of 2.12 and 2.93 μm with the full coverage of the porous substrates were obtained at the applied voltage of 30 V for 90 and 120 s, respectively, at the co-sintering temperatures of 1250 °C. The open circuit voltages (OCV) of 0.98–1.06 V were achieved at the operating temperature of 800 °C (as compared to theoretical OCV of 1.14 V), which in turn confirm the high-density YSZ films. Although the anode porosity and pore interconnectivity needed to be further improved for higher SOFC power density, the obtained half-cells already showed the potential of the EPD-PIM combined fabrication methods for the future upscale and cost-effective SOFC production.","Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

This research investigated the effects of framing on the people’s perception of earthquake risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. There were three frames conveying the same earthquake risk but presented in different terms. These statements were in frequency terms of building damage: 475 severely damaged private buildings in 500 years, 10% chance of occurrence in 50 years, and one severely damaged private building per year. The objective of this research was to determine whether framing the same earthquake risk in different terms led to different perceptions of the risk by different people, leading to 1. what would be the most effective framing type regarding severely damaged private buildings, 2. which affected people’s earthquake risk perception most, and 3. whether experiencing an earthquake disaster would change the risk perception of the residents. The result showed that presenting the risk as “one severely damaged private building per year” was the most commonly selected among the three frames and was statistically significant. This finding clarifies that short time frames influence people’s earthquake risk decisions, and agencies can effectively use framing to communicate the earthquake risk to people in seismic regions to stimulate their earthquake preparedness and to reduce future earthquake risk. However, earthquake experience does not change the risk perception of the residents.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

Although many compounds isolated from natural products have been used to treat it, drug resistance is a serious problem, and alternative anti-cancer drugs are required. Here, melittin from Apis mellifera venom was used, and its effects on bronchogenic carcinoma cell proliferation and tumour-associated macrophage differentiation were evaluated. Methods: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of melittin was measured by MTT. Cell death was observed by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) co-staining followed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle arrest was revealed by PI staining and flow cytometry. To investigate the tumour microenvironment, differentiation of circulating monocytes (THP-1) into tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) was assayed by sandwich-ELISA and interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined. Cell proliferation and migration was observed by flat plate colony formation. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by ELISA. The change in expression levels of CatS, Bcl-2, and MADD was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Melittin was significantly more cytotoxic (p < 0.01) to human bronchogenic carcinoma cells (ChaGo-K1) than to the control human lung fibroblasts (Wi-38) cells. At 2.5 μM, melittin caused ChaGo-K1 cells to undergo apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The IL-10 levels showed that melittin significantly inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs (p < 0.05) and reduced the number of colonies formed in the treated ChaGo-K1 cells compared to the untreated cells. However, melittin did not affect angiogenesis in ChaGo-K1 cells. Unlike MADD, Bcl-2 was up-regulated significantly (p < 0.05) in melittin-treated ChaGo-K1 cells. Conclusion: Melittin can be used as an alternative agent for lung cancer treatment because of its cytotoxicity against ChaGo-K1 cells and the inhibition of differentiation of THP-1 cells into TAMs.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

This study aims to determine the outcome of dilatation and predictors of failed dilatation in patients with acid-induced corrosive esophageal stricture. Patients diagnosed of corrosive esophageal strictures were included. Endoscopic dilatation with graded Savary-Gilliard dilator was performed as the first line treatment. Outcome of dilatation was considered favorable when patients were able to swallow solid without intervention at least six months after successful dilatation. Failure of dilatation was defined as one of the following; complete luminal stenosis, inability to perform safe dilatation, perforation, and inability to maintain adequate luminal patency. Surgery or repeated dilatation was indicated in failed dilatations. There were 55 patients with corrosive esophageal strictures. Of 55 patients, 41 (75%) had failed dilatation (38 having esophageal replacement procedure, two continue repeated dilatation and one unfit for surgery). Of 323 sessions of dilatations, eight out of 55 patients (14.5%) had perforations. There was no dilatation-related mortality. Patients with concomitant pharyngeal stricture (p = 0.0001), long (≥ 10 cm) stricture length (p < 0.0001), number of dilatation >6 sessions per year (p = 0.01) and refractory stricture (inability to pass a larger than 11 mm dilator within three sessions) (p = 0.01) were more likely to have failed dilatation.

The essential computation in environmental study is context-dependent-differential computation to analyze the changes of various situations (air, water, CO2, places of livings, sea level, coral area, etc.). It is important to realize global environmental computing methodology for analyzing difference and diversity of nature and livings in a context dependent way with a large amount of information resources in terms of global environments. In the design of environment-analysis systems, one of the most important issues is how to integrate several environmental aspects and analyze environmental data resources with semantic interpretations. In this paper, we present an environmental-semantic computing system. Our environmental-semantic computing system realizes integration and semantic-search among environmental-semantic spaces with water-quality and image databases. We have already presented a concept of ""Semantic Computing System"" for analyzing and interpreting environmental phenomena and changes occurring in the oceans and rivers in the world. We also introduce the concept of ""SPA (Sensing, Processing and Analytical Actuation Functions)"" for realizing a global environmental system, to apply it to Multi-dimensional World Map (5-Dimensional World Map) System. This concept is effective and advantageous to design environmental systems with Physical-Cyber integration to detect environmental phenomena as real data resources in a physical-space (real space), map them to cyber-space to make analytical and semantic computing, and actuate the analytically computed results to the real space with visualization for expressing environmental phenomena, causalities and influences. This paper presents integration and semantic-analysis methods for two environmental-semantic spaces with water-quality and image databases. We have implemented an actual space integration system for accessing environmental information resources with water-quality and image analysis. We clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of our method and system by showing several experimental results for environmental medical document databases.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

Buffalo and bovine oocytes were collected by the aspiration technique from follicles and submitted for in vitro fertilisation; the embryos were later divided into four experiments. Experiment 1, buffalo and bovine embryos were pre-treated in the presence and absence of 10 μM forskolin for 24 h. Lipid contents were determined by Nile red staining and confocal microscopy. We found that 10 μM forskolin was capable to reduce lipid contents within developing embryos in both of species (P < 0.01). Lipid contents within Day 2 embryos exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than did Day 7 embryos in both animal species. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to investigate the adverse effects of 10 μM forskolin on embryo development. In Experiments 3 and 4, Day 2 (4- to 8-cell stage) and Day 7 (blastocyst stage) embryos were pre-treated with 10 μM forskolin for 24 h and further cryopreserved with a controlled-rate freezing technique. The successful cryopreservation was determined by post-thawed embryonic development in vitro. The results showed that the blastocyst rate of the 4–8 cell stage in the forskolin-treated group had increased in both species, while the hatching and hatched blastocyst rates of forskolin-treated day 7 bovine embryos were significantly higher than those of the non-treated group (52.1% vs. 39.4%; P < 0.05). However, delipidation with forskolin did not affect the developmental rate of the day 7 buffalo embryos (P = 0.73). Our studies showed that delipidation by forskolin treatment increased the survival rate of cryopreservation in buffalo and bovine in vitro produced embryos.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

This study thus aimed to develop a closed-culture system for in vitro CD4+ T lymphocyte expansion by using a commercially available GMP-grade culture bag and anti-CD3/28 activation. Freshly isolated CD4+ T cells by immunorosette formation from healthy donors and cryopreserved CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected patients with CD4 count over 500 cells/μL were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 coated beads. The activated cells were then expanded in conventional culture flasks and GMP-grade culture bags for three weeks. Fold expansion, cell viability, growth kinetic and phenotypic characters were observed. Results revealed that purified CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals cultured in flasks showed better expansion than those cultured in bags (797-fold and 331-fold, respectively), whereas, their cell viability, growth kinetic and expanded CD4+ T cell purity were almost similar. A large-scale production was also conducted and supported consistency of cell proliferation in the closed-culture system. Frozen CD4+ T lymphocytes from the patients were able to remain their growth function and well expanded with a good yield of 415-fold, 85% viability and 96% purity of CD4+ T cells at the end of a 3-week culture in bags. This developed closed-culture system using culture bags and anti-CD3/28 coated beads, therefore, can achieve a large number of expanded CD4+ T lymphocytes with good reproducibility, suggesting a promising protocol required for adoptive immunotherapy.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; diagnosis and disease monitoring, medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

However, polymer solution is somewhat difficult to be injected due to high viscosity and thus, water slug is recommended to be injected before and during polymer injection in order to increase an ease of injecting this viscous fluid into the wellbore. In this study, numerical simulation is performed to determine the most appropriate operating parameters to maximize oil recovery. The results show that pre-flushed water should be injected until water breakthrough while alternating water slug size should be as low as 5% of polymer slug size. Concentration for each polymer slugs should be kept constant and recommended number of alternative cycles is 2. Combining these operating parameters altogether contributes to oil recovery of 53.69% whereas single-slug polymer flooding provides only 53.04% which is equivalent to 8,000 STB of oil gain.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

We found novel sets of transcripts completing several important reproductive pathways such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. In addition, we found transcripts encoding for receptors crucial for initiation of the maturation process, such as GnRH receptor (GnRHR), voltage-dependent calcium channel L type alpha-1C (CACNA1C) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Moreover, we found a putative novel vigillin encoding for an estrogen–induced polysome-associated protein, which has not been reported in penaeid shrimp. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanism of the pathways important to reproductive maturation might be similar to those in the vertebrate. The obtained data will consequently accelerate the study of reproductive biology of this important species to ensure a sustainable shrimp farming industry.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Aquatic Science, Genetics"

Methods: Retrospective review of stereotactic biopsies performed during 2009–2013 for suspicious calcifications in the ipsilateral breast of patients who completed BCT. Results: 94/2773 (3.4%) had stereotactic biopsies for suspicious calcifications in the ipsilateral breast; 7/94 (7.4%) had DCIS (6) or invasive (1) cancer; 5/7 occurred in the same breast quadrant as the primary. All 7 originally had negative surgical margins (≥2 mm); 6 received whole breast irradiation, and 2 received adjuvant chemotherapy + endocrine therapy. Median time to detection was 11 months (range, 6–20 months). There was a strong association between calcification morphology (particularly pleomorphic) and likelihood of malignancy (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy of calcifications identified within 24 months post-BCT has a 7% cancer yield. Tissue biopsy should be performed rather than imaging followup alone when breast calcifications have suspicious morphology.",medical,Surgery
Biomass gasification integrated with CO2 capture processes for high-purity hydrogen production: Process performance and energy analysis,"Detchusananard T., Im-orb K., Ponpesh P., Arpornwichanop A.",2018-09-01,"Biomass Gasification, CO2 capture, Energy analysis, Exergetic performance, Exergy Analysis, Exergy efficiencies, Steam gasification, Temperature increase, CO2 capture, Energy analysis, Exergy analysis, Steam gasification","The performance of an integrated biomass gasification and CO2 capture process to produce H2-rich gas satisfying a PEMFC specification is investigated. Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO2 sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H2 concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 °C. For the integrated process, the H2 concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 °C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO2 is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO2, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H2 production increase as the CO2/C ratio increases, whereas the CO2 emission shows the opposite trend. The maximum exergy efficiency of 69.65%, based on the hydrogen production and the heat generation, is achieved at CO2/C and CaO/C ratios of 0.6 and 4.48, respectively. At this condition, a specific emission of CO2 of 4.4 g CO2 - eqMJ- 1 and an energy conversion efficiency of 88.09% are achieved.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Tungsten loaded CaO/hydroxyapatite materials containing both basic, and acidic sites were derived from addition of 12-phosphotungstic acid to powdered bovine bone (BV), followed by calcination at 750 °C. Addition of 10% tungsten afforded 10 W/BV, which catalyzes FAME production from high acid value oil feedstock (24.38 mg KOH/g of oil) in 7 h at 120 °C at a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1. Conversion of waste cooking oil to FAME via simultaneous transesterification/esterification can be achieved in 5 h at 100 °C and at a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1, significantly more efficient than achievable using other bi-functional catalyst systems. The 10 W/BV catalyst system, readily prepared from a cheap, biomass derived support containing basic sites, is reusable, and allows for the production of fuel quality FAME in high yields from waste cooking oil, allowing for sustainable use of an otherwise wasted resource.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

However, little is known about how different mannan structures of common oral Candida species affect DC activation. The effects of heat-inactivated (HI) yeast cells and soluble mannan of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis on bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) responses were compared. HI Candida and the mannan exhibited different effects on BMDC activation and functions, which could be due to other carbohydrate compositions in the yeast cell wall. Among Candida mannan, the C. albicans mannan was the weakest stimulus and induced only interferon (IFN)-γ production. This suggests the possibility that C. albicans mannan may skew T helper (Th) responses from protective Th17 toward Th1. In contrast, C. parapsilosis mannan caused strong BMDC activation and high production of several proinflammatory cytokines which possibly promote hyperinflammation. Meanwhile, C. dubliniensis mannan induced moderate BMDC responses, which may correlate with its lower pathogenicity. Therefore, mannan of each Candida species play distinct roles in DC responses and may be involved in the immunopathogenesis and disease severity of oral candidiasis as well as other Candida infection.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Methods and Results: A bacterial genome was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the bacterium belongs to Vibrio harveyi species. Further phylogenetic analysis inferred from core genome SNPs revealed a close relationship between our bacterium and the V. harveyi isolated from groupers in Taiwan and China. blastp results indicated that V. harveyi piscine strains carried numerous adhesin, secretion system, siderophore and toxin-related genes. Genome comparison between Y6 and 32 strains of V. harveyi from different origins showed that at least 17 potential virulence genes were present exclusively in the strain Y6. Many of these (six of 17 genes) were homologous to pyoverdine siderophore, a secreted high-affinity iron chelator, clusters originally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Genome of V. harveyi Y6 was incorporated by a bacteriophage VHY6φ and replication protein of the phage was most similar to CTXφ described previously in Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio fischeri. However, the cholera toxin-encoding genes, namely ctxA and ctxB, were absent from VHY6φ, while the CTXφ-enterotoxin gene (zonula occludens toxin; zot) remained intact. Conclusions: Several putative virulence genes and a phage carrying toxin gene were identified in the genomes of SDMN-associated V. harveyi Y6. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study confers genomic information of the piscine pathogenic V. harveyi which recently caused widespread mortality. Such information is of importance to gain insight into bacterial molecular pathogenesis.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology; virulence, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

It is important to seek new noninvasive fat removal treatments that are both safe and efficacious. Objective: To assess the extent to which carboxytherapy, which is the insufflation of carbon dioxide gas into subcutaneous fat, results in reduction of fat volume. Methods: In this randomized, sham-controlled, split-body study, adults (body mass index, 22-29 kg/m2) were randomized to receive 5 weekly infusions of 1000 cm3 of CO2 to 1 side of the abdomen, and 5 sham treatments to the contralateral side. The primary outcome measures were ultrasound measurement of fat layer thickness and total circumference before and after treatment. Results: A total of 16 participants completed the study. Ultrasound measurement indicated less fat volume on the side treated with carboxytherapy 1 week after the last treatment (P =.011), but the lower fat volume was not maintained at 28 weeks. Total circumference decreased nominally but not significantly at week 5 compared with baseline (P =.0697). Participant body weights did not change over the entire course of the study (P = 1.00). Limitations: Limitations included modest sample size and some sources of error in the measurement of circumference and fat layer. Conclusion: Carboxytherapy provides a transient decrease in subcutaneous fat that may not persist. Treatment is well tolerated.","genergyal, dermatology and venergyeology, medical",Dermatology

First, six catalysts including Hbeta zeolite (HBZ), mixed phases of γ-χ-Al2O3 (M-Al) and γ-Al2O3 (G-Al) with and without Pd modification (0.5 wt%) were prepared. The catalytic dehydration of vaporized ethanol at temperature ranging from 200 to 400° C was performed over the catalysts. For ethylene production, the most promising catalyst is HBZ (giving ethylene yield of ca. 99% at 400° C), whereas Pd modification has no significant effect on ethylene production. Considering the production of diethyl ether, it is produced at lower temperature (ca. 250° C) than that of ethylene. The most active catalyst to produce diethyl ether is HBZ with Pd modification (giving diethyl ether yield of ca. 48% at 250° C). Thus, increased diethyl ether yield can be achieved with Pd modification at low temperature for the HBZ catalyst. Other catalysts such as M-Al and G-Al can also produce significant amounts of ethylene. To elucidate the effect of Pd modification on these catalysts, different characterization techniques such as nitrogen physisorption (BET and BJH methods), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption were performed and further discussed in more detail.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Measurements included advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid peroxides (LOOH), −sulfhydryl (SH) groups, total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in participants with CAP, with and without depression, as well as healthy controls (no depression, no CAP). Root canal LPS levels were positively associated with CAP, clinical depression, severity of depression (as measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory) and O&NS biomarkers, especially NOx and TRAP. CAP-related depression was accompanied by increased levels of NOx, LOOH, AOPP, and TRAP. In CAP participants, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.734, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.001) between root canal LPS and the HDRS score. There were significant and positive associations between CAP or root canal endotoxin with the vegetative and physio-somatic symptoms of the HDRS as well as a significant inverse association between root canal endotoxin and quality of life with strong effects on psychological, environmental, and social domains. It is concluded that increased root canal LPS accompanying CAP may cause depression and a lowered quality of life, which may be partly explained by activated O&NS pathways, especially NOx thereby enhancing hypernitrosylation and thus neuroprogressive processes.

For asymptomatic Leishmania infection among Thai patients with HIV/AIDS, the sensitivity and specificity of the nested-PCR-ITS1 in buffy coat were 73.9 and 100%, respectively. However, the sensitivity in saliva was 26.1% and specificity was 100%. Using the nested-PCR-ITS1, saliva and buffy coat samples showed positive agreement in only 52.0% of patients. Saliva tested results with the nested-PCR-ITS1 showed positive agreement with the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) in 46.5% of patients. Only 12.1% of the samples showed positive agreement for Leishmania infection among all the three tests: saliva, buffy coat and DAT results. Using nucleotide sequencing, at least three species of Leishmania infection were identified in saliva, i.e., L. siamensis (n = 28), L. martiniquensis (n = 9), and L. donovani complex (n = 1). As a result, buffy coat still appears to be a better specimen to diagnose asymptomatic VL infection among individuals with HIV. However, the use of both buffy coat and saliva together as clinical specimens would increase the sensitivity of Leishmania detection.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; Multidisciplinaryiple infections, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

Appropriate coagulant doses were determined based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and coagulation with ferric chloride (FeCl3) at 0.1-0.2 mM or poly-aluminum chloride (PACl; [Al2(OH)nCl6-n]m) at 0.2-0.4 mM improved removal of TiO2 NPs to more than 90%, and, simultaneously, turbidity was significantly reduced. Using 0.2 mM FeCl3 as a coagulant, the mean particle size of suspended TiO2 NPs decreased from 145 to 43 nm after coagulation and sedimentation as a result of effective floc formation. Microfiltration (nominal pore size: 0.45 μm and 0.10 μm) of uncoagulated TiO2 NP suspensions produced lower NP concentrations in the filtrate than that in the filtrate of pre-coagulated water. This is because pre-coagulation and settling removed large NPs in the feed water that reduce the number of smaller particles than the pore sizes by clogging or blocking membrane pores. Results suggest that removal of NPs by coagulation/sedimentation followed by membrane filtration may be less efficient than direct membrane filtration. Addition of salts (NaCl 0.3-15 mM or CaCl2 0.1-5 mM) to TiO2 NP suspensions before coagulation led to significant reduction (0.28-0.47 mg/L) of TiO2 concentrations in supernatant after sedimentation. Phosphate addition (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mM) increased TiO2 NP concentration after FeCl3 or PACl coagulation and settling, but TiO2 NP removal rate by MF was improved by phosphate addition except for filtering TiO2 NP suspension with 1.0 mM phosphate by a 0.45 μm membrane.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, mixing and separation, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

This consensus organised by IAB—Interdisciplinary Working Group Movement Disorders wants to provide a brief and practical new definition of spasticity—for the first time—based on its various forms of muscle hyperactivity as described in the current movement disorders terminology. We propose the following new definition system: Spasticity describes involuntary muscle hyperactivity in the presence of central paresis. The involuntary muscle hyperactivity can consist of various forms of muscle hyperactivity: spasticity sensu strictu describes involuntary muscle hyperactivity triggered by rapid passive joint movements, rigidity involuntary muscle hyperactivity triggered by slow passive joint movements, dystonia spontaneous involuntary muscle hyperactivity and spasms complex involuntary movements usually triggered by sensory or acoustic stimuli. Spasticity can be described by a documentation system grouped along clinical picture (axis 1), aetiology (axis 2), localisation (axis 3) and additional central nervous system deficits (axis 4). Our new definition allows distinction of spasticity components accessible to BT therapy and those inaccessible.

The best separation can be achieved when solid flocs were formed at 1.0 mM, which exceeded the dosage from the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of 0.75 mM. Two different mechanisms were proved for the emulsion destabilization depending upon the Al3+ concentration under this pH range. The first mechanism was the adsorption of Al(OH)3 on surface of oil droplets, which led to the droplet coalescence. By increasing the Al3+ dosage, the sweep flocculation by Al(OH)3 precipitates occurred. Al3+ dosage for effective destabilization was increased in accordance with oil concentration. The formation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates in bayerite structure was affirmed by analyzing elemental composition and crystalline structure of flocs from the destablization.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

As HPV-16 transforms the cell, E6 oncoprotein is over-expressed. Therefore, molecular detection of HPV-16 E6 mRNA is now being used for diagnosis and prediction of cancer development. Besides detecting E6 mRNA, a rapid lateral flow detecting the E6 protein using enzyme immunoassay is also now on market with a sensitivity of 53.5% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-3 or more severe (CIN-3+). Here, an immunogold-agglutination assay was developed to detect not only HPV-16 E6 protein but also L1, a major capsid protein found in the productive stage of the virus. Evaluation of this test using HPV-16 DNA positive cervical samples showed that the HPV-16 E6 immunogold-agglutination assay results correlated well with the progression of the cervical lesions, i.e., 10.34% of CIN-1, 68.75% of CIN-3 and 80% of cancer (CaCx) and none for healthy normal samples. Interestingly, the HPV-16 L1 protein was found in most of the cases with cancer indicating the possibility of virion production. Immunogold-agglutination assay for E6 protein is simpler, easier to be performed with a sensitivity of 73.1% for CIN-3+ suggesting a good method for laboratory diagnostic use.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, Immunology",Virology
Late Middle Pleistocene ecology and climate in Northeastern Thailand inferred from the stable isotope analysis of Khok Sung herbivore tooth enamel and the land mammal cenogram,"Suraprasit K., Bocherens H., Chaimanee Y., Panha S., Jaeger J.-J.",2018-08-01,"Large mammals, Middle Pleistocene, Palaeoclimatology, Paleodiet, Paleohabitat, Pleistocene, Southeastern asia, Stable isotopes, Teeth enamel, Thailand, Large mammal, Paleoclimatology, Paleodiet, Paleohabitat, Pleistocene, Southeastern Asia, Stable isotopes, Thailand","Paleoecological and paleoclimatic records based on the stable isotopes of mammalian tooth enamel are poorly known in mainland Southeast Asia during the Pleistocene. Khok Sung in Northeastern Thailand is a late Middle Pleistocene terrace deposit, tentatively dated either as 213 ka or 188 ka, yielding 15 described mammalian taxa with especially abundant and complete fossil remains. To investigate paleodiets and habitats of these ancient mammals and to understand the corresponding regional climate, we performed an analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes extracted from tooth enamel carbonate of various mammalian taxa, coupled with the cenogram method. The enamel δ13C values of Khok Sung mammals indicate a variety of diets, ranging from pure C3 to C4 plants, suggesting that C4 grasses were a major component of local Thai ecosystems during the late Middle Pleistocene. The stable isotopic distinction between C3 and C4 plants suggests that the Pleistocene wildlife habitats ranged from closed forests to open grasslands for the Khok Sung area. Moreover, differences within sympatric Pleistocene herbivores such as proboscideans, rhinoceroses, and cervids characterize possible niche partitioning by minimizing interspecific overlap. Paleoclimatic interpretations based on the intra-tooth variability in enamel δ18O values from large mammals and on the cenogram analysis reflect significant seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature, and humid conditions, for the Khok Sung locality. Compared to modern environments in Thailand, it is apparent that C4-dominated grasslands were more widespread at that time when anthropic impacts on the ecosystems were presumably absent or minimal.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; zoology, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

Reversing plain L-loops may create such advantageous force system during space closure. Design: Force systems of reversed L-loops were compared with T-loops at three interbracket distances (IBD). Setting: Computational study. Methods: Using finite element analysis, loop response during simulated loop-pulling was determined for plain reversed L- and T-loop configurations at three IBDs and two sizes. Force systems were calculated on both loop ends for two activation forces. Results: The 12 mm IBD reversed L-loops had almost equal M/F ratios in opposite directions at both ends. A small intrusive force was found at the canine bracket (CB). The 6 mm IBD reversed L-loops showed larger M/F ratios and extrusive forces at the premolar bracket (PB) and smaller M/F with intrusive forces at CB. The force system of 12 mm IBD T-loops showed the similar force systems as off-centered V-bends with extrusive force at CB, whilst plain 6 mm IBD T-loops showed properties similar to centered V-bends with less extrusive force at CB. Conclusions: Reversed L closing loops placed no extrusive force on the CB end at various IBDs, indicating that reversed loops will generate an intrusive force at anterior teeth during space closure.",dentistry,Orthodontics

Recently, the heterozygous missense mutation, c.1178A>G, p.Tyr393Cys, in exon 9 of P4HB which encodes protein disulfide isomerase, has been found in three Caucasian patients with CCS. Ethnic background is known to affect clinical manifestations, especially facial features of dysmorphic syndromes. Here, we describe the first Asian CCS patient possessing the recurrent mutation in P4HB. Although she had several common features of CCS including bulging forehead, ocular proptosis, midface hypoplasia, long bone deformity, popcorn epiphyses, vertebral fractures, and scoliosis, she did not have hydrocephalus, wormian bones, and dentinogenesis imperfecta, commonly seen in Caucasian patients. Interestingly, she is the only one without macrocephaly. Radiologically, metadiaphyseal fractures of the long bones with metaphyseal sclerosis were found, substantiating that they provide a definitive radiological feature of CCS. In addition, we showed for the first time a three-dimensional facial scan of a patient with CCS. She had been given intravenous bisphosphonate since the age of 9 months and had responded well. Our study presents the clinical features of the first Asian patient, supports metaphyseal scleroses and fractures as radiological clues, strengthens early bisphosphonate administration, and confirms the etiologic role of the c.1178A>G variant in P4HB across populations.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"
The Putative Role of Environmental Mercury in the Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders and Subtypes,"Morris G., Puri B.K., Frye R.E., Maes M.",2018-06-01,"Autism Spectrum Disorder, Environmental Exposure, Humans, Mercury, Oxidative Stress, Autism spectrum disorders, Cytokines, Immune, Inflammation, Mercury, Oxidative stress","Exposure to organic forms of mercury has the theoretical capacity to generate a range of immune abnormalities coupled with chronic nitro-oxidative stress seen in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The paper discusses possible mechanisms explaining the neurotoxic effects of mercury and possible associations between mercury exposure and ASD subtypes. Environmental mercury is neurotoxic at doses well below the current reference levels considered to be safe, with evidence of neurotoxicity in children exposed to environmental sources including fish consumption and ethylmercury-containing vaccines. Possible neurotoxic mechanisms of mercury include direct effects on sulfhydryl groups, pericytes and cerebral endothelial cells, accumulation within astrocytes, microglial activation, induction of chronic oxidative stress, activation of immune-inflammatory pathways and impairment of mitochondrial functioning. (Epi-)genetic factors which may increase susceptibility to the toxic effects of mercury in ASD include the following: a greater propensity of males to the long-term neurotoxic effects of postnatal exposure and genetic polymorphisms in glutathione transferases and other glutathione-related genes and in selenoproteins. Furthermore, immune and inflammatory responses to immunisations with mercury-containing adjuvants are strongly influenced by polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and by genes encoding effector proteins such as cytokines and pattern recognition receptors. Some epidemiological studies investigating a possible relationship between high environmental exposure to methylmercury and impaired neurodevelopment have reported a positive dose-dependent effect. Retrospective studies, on the other hand, reported no relationship between a range of ethylmercury-containing vaccines and chronic neuropathology or ASD. On the basis of these results, we would argue that more clinically relevant research is required to examine whether environmental mercury is associated with ASD or subtypes. Specific recommendations for future research are discussed.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

SDS with 1, 4, and 8 mM was then investigated for its roles on the methane hydrate formation with and without THF. The experiments were conducted in a quiescent condition in a fixed volume crystallizer at 8 MPa and 4°C. The results showed that almost all studied THF and SDS concentrations enhanced the methane hydrate formation kinetics and methane consumption compared to that without the promoters, except 1 mol% THF. Although, with 1 mol% THF, there were no hydrates formed for 48 hours, the addition of just 1 mM SDS surprisingly promoted the hydrate formation with a significant increased in the kinetics. This prompts the use of methane hydrate technology for natural gas storage application with minimal promoters.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Bi2O3 was expected to improve radiation shielding properties of the glass samples. Mass attenuation coefficients, effective atomic number (Zeff) and effective electron density (Ne) of the glass samples ((80 – x)HPSg – (20)Na2O – (x)Bi2O3 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol%) were determined at different photon energies. The energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) and fast neutron removal cross sections were also calculated for the given materials. The results clearly revealed that mass attenuation coefficient and other parameters depends on concentration of Bi2O3 and addition of Bi2O3 significantly increased shielding capability of glass samples against gamma rays as well as fast neutrons. The results of Zeff and Ne confirmed the ability of shielding of the glass samples with Bi2O3 as well. Physical properties of glass samples were also investigated in the present work. The obtained ultrasonic velocities and Young's modulus of the glass samples led us to a conclusion that the network structures of the glass are loss of compact structures due to creation of NBOs when adding the Bi2O3. The FTIR measurements confirmed NBOs forming in the network structures of the glass samples with increase of Bi2O3 contents. The reported structural and radiation attenuation properties of recycled glass with Bi2O3 should be important in radiation shielding applications which requires high strength of structures at the same time.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

TB often affects those from a low socio-economic background. OBJECTIVE : To assess the socio-economic determinants of TB in HIV-infected patients in Asia. DESIGN: This was a matched case-control study. HIVpositive, TB-positive cases were matched to HIVpositive, TB-negative controls according to age, sex and CD4 cell count. A socio-economic questionnaire comprising 23 questions, including education level, employment, housing and substance use, was distributed. Socio-economic risk factors for TB were analysed using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULT S : A total of 340 patients (170 matched pairs) were recruited, with 262 (77.1%) matched for all three criteria. Pulmonary TB was the predominant type (n = 115, 67.6%). The main risk factor for TB was not having a university level education (OR 4.45, 95%CI 1.50-13.17, P=0.007). Burning wood or coal regularly inside the house and living in the same place of origin were weakly associated with TB diagnosis. CONCLUS IONS : These data suggest that lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of TB in Asia.

This research aims to elucidate the hydrogen effects in different Lewis acid-doped ZN catalysts on ethylene polymerization behaviors in terms of catalytic activity and polymer properties. With the absence of hydrogen during polymerization, it was found that ZnCl2 decreased the catalytic, because it acted as a catalyst poison. The catalytic activity was in the order of None–THF &gt; ZnFe–THF &gt; ZnAl–THF &gt; Zn–THF. Thus, the addition of second Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and FeCl2 was able to improve the catalytic activity of Zn–THF catalyst. In addition, ZnFe–THF catalyst exhibited slightly higher activity than ZnAl–THF catalyst. This is because FeCl2 may better participate in MgCl2 structure due to similar atomic radius, leading to more efficiently removal of the remaining THF in the final catalyst. With the presence of hydrogen during polymerization, the decrease in catalytic activity was in the order of ZnFe–THF &lt; ZnAl–THF &lt; Zn–THF &lt; None–THF with increasing H2/C2H4 molar ratio from 0.08 to 0.60.

The effective coverage framework is an assessment tool that can be used to assess health service performance by considering target population who need and receive quality service. The aim of this study is to measure effective coverage of hypertension screening services at the provincial level in Thailand. Methods: Over 40 million individual health service records in 2013 were acquired. Data on blood pressure measurement, risk assessment, HT diagnosis and follow up were analyzed. The effectiveness of the services was assessed based on a set of quality criteria for pre-HT, suspected HT, and confirmed HT cases. Effective coverage of HT services for all non-HT Thai population aged 15 or over was estimated for each province and for all Thailand. Results: Population coverage of HT screening is 54.6%, varying significantly across provinces. Among those screened, 28.9% were considered pre-HT, and another 6.0% were suspected HT cases. The average provincial effective coverage was at 49.9%. Around four-fifths (82.6%) of the pre-HT group received HT and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk assessment. Among the suspected HT cases, less than half (38.0%) got a follow-up blood pressure measurement within 60 days from the screening date. Around 9.2% of the suspected cases were diagnosed as having HT, and only one-third of them (36.5%) received treatment within 6 months. Within this group, 21.8% obtained CVD risk assessment, and half of them had their blood pressure under control (50.8%) with less than 1 % (0.7%) of them managed to get the CVD risk reduced. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hypertension screening coverage, post-screening service quality, and effective coverage of HT screening in Thailand were still low and they vary greatly across provinces. It is imperative that service coverage and its effectiveness are assessed, and both need improvement. Despite some limitations, measurement of effective coverage could be done with existing data, and it can serve as a useful tool for performance measurement of public health services.",medical,Health Policy

This paper describes an algorithm that exploits building blocks with compact genetic algorithm in order to solve difficult optimization problems under the assumption that we have already known building blocks. The main idea is to update the probability vectors as a group of bits that represents building blocks thus avoiding the disruption of the building blocks. Comparisons of the new algorithm with a conventional compact genetic algorithm on trap-function and traveling salesman problems indicate the utility of the proposed algorithm. It is most effective when the problem instants have common structures that can be identify as building blocks.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Software, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"

Despite having few morphological differences from other subspecies, a recent phylogeographic study showed that M. f. aurea is clearly distinct genetically from Macaca fascicularis fascicularis (common long-tailed macaque) and suggests that M. f. aurea experienced a disparate evolutionary pathway versus other subspecies. To construct a detailed evolutionary history of M. f. aurea and its relationships with other macaque species, we performed phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimation of whole mitochondrial genomes (2 M. f. aurea, 8 M. f. fascicularis, and 16 animals of 12 macaque species) and 2871 bp of the Y chromosome (1 M. f. aurea, 2 M. f. fascicularis, and 5 animals of 5 macaque species) and haplotype network analysis of 758 bp of the Y chromosome (1 M. f. aurea, 2 M. f. fascicularis, and 21 animals of 19 macaque species). Whereas the Y chromosome of M. f. aurea clustered with those of the fascicularis species group in the phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses, its mtDNA clustered within the clade of the sinica species group. Based on this phylogenetic incongruence and the estimated divergence times, we propose that proto-M. f. aurea underwent hybridization with a population of the sinica species group between 2.5 and 0.95 MYA after divergence from the common ancestor of M. fascicularis. Hybridization and introgression might have been central in the evolution of M. f. aurea, similar to what occurred in the evolution of other macaque species and subspecies.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, medical","Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

To function well, the inferior properties of WPUs should be overcome with good adhesion and cohesion mechanisms. High-performance WPU adhesive was synthesized by incorporating an amino-functionalized porous clay heterostructure (APCH) into the WPU to increase its internal strength via formation of urea linkages between fillers and the polymer matrix, to yield an organic/inorganic hybrid adhesive with greater cohesion. Urea linkages, as characterized by Fourier-self deconvolution of the C=O stretching vibration region (1600−1800 cm−1), increased with increasing APCH content. In addition, APCH significantly enhanced the adhesion properties of bonded joints together with an improved thermal stability of the adhesive, affirmed by the DSC analysis and higher viscosity observed by a Brookfield viscometer. The highest peel strength (126 N/m) was achieved with a WPU hybrid adhesive containing 2.0 wt% APCH, which can be used for application in untreated oriented polypropylene (OPP) lamination.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the anatomical features and location of the dorsal nasal artery (DNA), and to provide clinical anatomical information to reduce side effects and severe complications in the perinasal area. Methods: Using the 31 cadaveric noses in Asians, dissections and histologic examinations were performed to identify the location and depth of the vascular structures including DNA. Results: Dorsal nasal artery ran downward at 20.3 ± 3.5 mm from the intercanthal line and the communicating branch that connected the bilateral DNAs was located 8.5 ± 3.5 mm inferior to the intercanthal line. The DNA was located at 4.4 ± 3.2 mm, 4.6 ± 4.4 mm, and 5.2 ± 4.4 mm lateral to the midline of the nose on the intercanthal, quadrisected, and bisected lines, respectively. At the level of nasal bone, DNA was located superficial to the muscular layer and it runs inferolaterally on dorsum on nose. It was running more deeply and located beneath the fibromuscular layer at the cartilaginous portion of the dorsum of nose. Conclusions: Injection into deep fatty layer may reduce the risk of arterial injury and the consequent complications. However, in a hooked nose, the tip of the needle traveling along the deep layer approaches the superficial layer due to the convexity of the hump as it passes over it, which can increase the probability of damaging the DNA.",medical,Dermatology

After adjusting for ever being pregnant and asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STI) at enrollment, PHIV were more likely to have HR-HPV than HU (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.77; P =.03). Conclusions. Perinatal HIV infection was associated with a higher risk of HR-HPV and abnormal cervical cytology. Our results underscore the need for HPV vaccination for PHIV adolescents and for prevention and screening programs for HPV and other STIs.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Eighty-one participants with antipsychotic-naïve FEP, 173 with SCZ and 438 HC were enrolled in this study. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed using the Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I (SCID-I). The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) were used to measure symptoms severity. Telomere length (TL) was determined using a multiplex qPCR assay. After adjustment for age, years of education, and smoking status, we found that patients with SCZ had longer TL (relative ratio (RR) = 1.08) than the HC group (RR = 1.00, Wald χ2 = 12.48, p = 0.002). Further, non-remitted SCZ patients presented longer TL (RR = 1.00) compared to remitted SCZ (RR = 0.88, Wald χ2 = 7.20, p = 0.007). TL in patients also correlated to psychopathology assessment in terms of total (p = 0.003) and positive PANSS scores (p = 0.001). No correlation with negative PANSS, YMRS, and CDSS or effects of medication was found on TL. Although the exact pathways underlying longer TL in SCZ patients remain unclear, these findings raise more questions than answers and suggest that TL may be of immense value on SCZ progression. Further studies are required to investigate the association of TL in FEP and SCZ.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

But it is lack of a good clinical trial to prove and compare their effects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of UltraTENS with PhP on mild to moderate degree of symptomatic knee OA. METHODS: Sixty-one patients (55 women), mean age of 63.4 ± 8.1 y, 50-90 mm VAS of knee pain and Kellgren-Lawrence score of grade I-III were randomly allocated into UltraTENS and PhP (N = 31 and 30, respectively). The UltraTENS group received a combined ultrasound with TENS program and a non-drug gel, whereas the PhP group got an ultrasound program with piroxicam gel and sham TENS. All patients were treated for a total of 10 sessions, consisting of five times per week and 10 min per session. Before and after treatment, patients were evaluated knee pain by using the 100-mm VAS and functional performance by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index. RESULTS: The UltraTENS and PhP groups experienced considerable improvement in both VAS and total WOMAC scores post-treatment (P< 0.001). The PhP had better VAS of pain and WOMAC scores but no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that UltraTENS and PhP were effective for relieving pain and improve functionality knee OA without significant differences between their effects.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation"
High temperature multidimensional gas chromatographic approach for improved separation of triacylglycerols in olive oil,"Waktola H.D., Kulsing C., Nolvachai Y., Marriott P.J.",2018-05-11,"2D separations, Flow condition, Heart cuts, High temperature, Retention time, Sampling strategies, Temperature programmed, Triacylglycerols, Chromatography, Gas, Flame Ionization, Olive Oil, Rheology, Temperature, Triglycerides, Comprehensive sampling, Heart-cut multidimensional GC, Olive oil, Triacylglycerols","Heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatographic (H/C MDGC) methods under suitable flow and high temperature (T) program conditions were developed to separate olive oil triacylglycerols (TAGs). Different column sets were selected for further evaluation, each with relatively short non-polar first dimension (1D) and mid-polar second dimension (2D) columns of high T limits (350 °C). The 1D separation displayed three major groups of peaks in an area ratio of approximately 5:33:62 (of increasing retention), using flame ionisation detection (FID). Four groups of minor peaks, with 2 of them located between the major peaks, were also detected. The H/C fractions of the minor peaks, and sub-sampled regions across the major peaks eluting from the 1D outlet, were cryotrapped at the 2D inlet. The trapped TAGs then underwent temperature programmed 2D separation. Each of the ‘H/C’ zones generally gave 2–5 – and in some cases more – separated peaks of TAGs on the 2D column, under suitable flow condition and phase polarity that resulted in improved separation. Six sub-sampled H/Cs from various regions of the individual peaks from the 1D column were simultaneously trapped and released to 2D, resulting in apparently more than 22 individual TAG peaks. According to their different retention times, different TAGs were revealed within each of the 3 major groups, using H/C sub-sampling. A comprehensive sampling strategy that covers most of the 1D peaks further revealed the presence of more TAGs in the olive oil sample. This tandem column strategy was able to resolve more components than that usually observed on a single column.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The influence of biomass type and composition (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) on the yield and selectivity of pyrolysis products was investigated. There was a great difference between CFP and non-CFP products yield. The highest aromatics carbon yield was only 1.34% (corncob) during non-CFP tests. While a remarkable improvement in aromatics carbon yields were 12.12%, 12.52%, and 12.58% obtained from pinewood, corncob, and poplar biomass during CFP tests, respectively. The dominant aromatic compound was benzene with selectivities of 49.6% (bagasse), 46.8% (rice straw), 48.0% (nutshell), and 50.78% (corncob). Moreover, the highest CFP olefins carbon yields were 10.19% (pinewood), 10.69% (corncob), and 9.89% (poplar), compared to highest non-CFP olefins carbon yields were low as 3.37% (bagasse), 2.85% (rice straw), and 2.82% (nutshell).

Acute effect of ivabradine on heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption in dogs with asymptomatic mitral valve degeneration,"Pirintr P., Limprasutr V., Saengklub N., Pavinadol P., Yapao N., Limvanicharat N., Kuecharoen H., Kijtawornrat A.",2018-01-01,"Administration, Oral, Animals, Benzazepines, Cardiac Output, Dogs, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Heart Rate, Heart Valve Diseases, Male, Mitral Valve, Myocardium, Oxygen Consumption, Renin-Angiotensin System, Dog, Heart rate, Ivabradine, Mitral valve degeneration, Myocardial oxygen consumption","Degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) is a common cardiac disease in geriatric dogs characterized by the degeneration of the mitral valve, leading to decreased cardiac output and activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This disease results in an increased resting heart rate (HR) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). A recent publication demonstrated that dogs with asymptomatic DMVD had a significantly higher HR and systemic blood pressure (BP) than age-matched control dogs. This higher HR will eventually contribute to increased MVO2. This study aimed to determine the effects of a single oral dose of ivabradine on the HR, MVO2 as assessed by the rate-pressure product, and BP in dogs with asymptomatic DMVD. Seven beagles with naturally occurring DMVD were instrumented by the Holter recorder and an oscillometric device to measure electrocardiogram and BP for 24 and 12 h, respectively. Each dog was randomly subjected to receive either placebo or ivabradine (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg). The results revealed that oral administration of ivabradine significantly decreased the HR and rate-pressure product in a dose-dependent manner without adverse effects. The highest dose of 2.0 mg/kg significantly reduced systolic and mean BP. Therefore, the findings imply that a single oral ivabradine administration at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg is suitable for dogs with asymptomatic DMVD to reduce the HR and MVO2 without marked effects on BP. This may potentially make ivabradine promising for management of an elevated HR in DMVD dogs.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science","Animal Science and Zoology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Veterinary (all)"

However, its anti-neurodegenerative potential is not yet clearly known. This work aimed to evaluate the protective effect of AE leaf extract against glutamate-induced oxidative damage in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, a neurodegenerative model system due to a reduction in glutathione levels and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Methods: Cell viability, apoptosis, and ROS assays were performed to assess the protective effect of AE leaf extract against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. The antioxidant capacity of AE was evaluated using in vitro radical scavenging assays. The subcellular localization of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the mRNA and protein levels of genes associated with the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant system were determined to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of AE leaf extract. Results: We demonstrated that AE leaf extract is capable of attenuating the intracellular ROS generation and HT22 cell death induced by glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment of glutamate with the extract significantly reduced apoptotic cell death via inhibition of AIF nuclear translocation. The increases in Nrf2 levels in the nucleus and gene expression levels of antioxidant-related downstream genes under Nrf2 control were found to be significant in cells treated with the extract. Conclusions: The results suggested that AE leaf extract possesses neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced oxidative injury and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Modeling of the integrated process is performed by using the Aspen Custom Modeler program. The simulation results show that the production rates of synthesis gas and bio-oil derived from an IBPG process increase as pyrolysis temperature increases, due to the increased volatiles. Compared to a conventional biomass gasification, IBPG provides additional bio-oil as a valued by-product, releases less waste heat and offers higher energy efficiency at the same synthesis gas production rate. The IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C shows the best technical performance. However, pinch analysis indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C or 500 °C and conventional biomass gasification is technically feasible; the optimum heat integration structures are achieved. The economic analysis, which considers only the reaction-related equipment, indicates that the IBPG process with a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C offers synthesis gas and bio-oil production rates of 1.185 and 0.2044 kmol h−1, respectively, and an energy efficiency of 68.86% is most economically feasible.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, petroleum engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Cognitive measures were assessed with the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Word List Memory (WLM), Constructional Praxis, Word List Recall (WLRecall), and Word List Recognition (WLRecognition), while TRYCAT measurements assessed the IgA/IgM responses to noxious TRYCATs, namely quinolinic acid (QA), 3-OH-kynurenine (3HK), picolinic acid (PA), and xanthurenic (XA) acid, and more protective (PRO) TRYCATs, including kynurenic acid (KA) and anthranilic acid (AA). IgA NOX/PRO, IgM KA/3HK, and IgA/IgM NOX/PRO ratios were computed. Schizophrenia was accompanied by lower VFT and WLM, while BNT (dysnomia) and MMSE are significantly lower in multiple- than first-episode schizophrenia. Deficit schizophrenia is strongly associated with worse outcomes on VFT, MMSE, WLM, WLRecall, WLRecognition, and delayed recall savings and increased false memories. Around 40–50% of the variance in negative symptoms’ scores was explained by VFT, WLM, WLRecall, and MMSE. Increases in IgA NOX/PRO, IgM KA/3HK, and/or IgA/IgM NOX/PRO ratios were associated with impairments in VFT, BNT, MMSE, WLM, WLRecall, WLRecognition, and false-memory creation. In conclusion, nondeficit schizophrenia is accompanied by mild memory impairments, while disease progression is accompanied by broader cognitive impairments. Deficit schizophrenia and negative symptoms are strongly associated with deficits in working memory, delayed recall and recognition, and increased false-memory creation. These cognitive impairments and memory deficits are in part explained by increased production and/or attenuated regulation of TRYCATs with neurotoxic, excitotoxic, immune-inflammatory, oxidative, and nitrosative potential, which may contribute to neuroprogression.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Investigation of instructional design on reading comprehension affect the demand for mobile application for students with learning disabilities,"Pannim P., Suwannatthachote P., Numprasertchai S.",2018-11-05,"Bangkok , Thailand, Instruction design, Instructional designs, Learning disabilities, Mobile applications, Reading comprehension, Reading Comprehensive, Semi structured interviews, Instruction design, Learning disabilities, Mobile application, Reading Comprehensive","This research aims to investigate the current teaching methods for reading comprehension that affect the demand for mobile application for students with learning disabilities (LDs). This research examines the factors that significantly impact on the application of visual language - mind maps with stories and Thai traditional folk tales for teaching reading comprehension via mobile application. The instruments used in the study are questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The collected samples consist of 423 students with LDs at elementary level (grades 4-6), and 36 teachers in teaching Thai, from 17 schools located in Bangkok, Thailand. All of them are respondents to the questionnaires and 17 teachers were invited to attend semi-structured interviews. The findings show that students have the greatest need for learn with stories and Thai traditional folk tales, with an average of 4.55. Secondly, students are motivated using rewarding technique with the mean of 4.17, followed by using mind maps to summarize stories with the mean of 4.05. These values are consistent with the teacher's point of view. Additionally, the results from semi-structured interviews suggest that the new instructional design should integrate mind maps into multimedia folk tales application. Consequently, the findings emphasize the need for mobile applications in order to improve reading comprehension skill for students with LDs in learning Thai language.","computer scienceuter programming languages, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Formulation of microemulsion-based washing agent for oil recovery from spent bleaching earth-hydrophilic lipophilic deviation concept,"Arpornpong N., Charoensaeng A., Khaodhiar S., Sabatini D.A.",2018-03-20,"Bleaching process, Environmental issues, Fatty alcohol ethoxylates, Hydrophilic-lipophilic deviations, NaCl concentration, Oil recoveries, Phase behavior study, Spent bleaching earth, Hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation, Microemulsions, Oil recovery, Spent bleaching earth, Surfactant","The disposal of spent bleaching earth (SBE), an industrial refining waste from the bleaching process, is a crucial environmental issue. The objective of this work was thus to formulate a microemulsion-based washing agent for the removal of residual rice bran oil from SBE using the hydrophilic–lipophilic deviation (HLD) concept. The HLD equation was used to calculate the optimum salinity at various temperatures in the washing agent solution based on the alkane carbon number (ACN) of the rice bran oil. Three fatty alcohol ethoxylate surfactants (Dehydol LS series) were selected for use as nonionic surfactants. From the HLD equation and phase experiments, Dehydol LS3TH was selected to formulate the microemulsion-based washing agent for oil recovery from the SBE. The HLD equation predicted a Winsor Type III microemulsion to occur at 8.5 wt.% of NaCl at 25 °C. Phase behavior studies demonstrated that a Type III microemulsion occurred over a NaCl concentration range of 10–20 wt.%. From these results, a correlation was confirmed between the theoretical HLD prediction and the experimental phase behavior. In the oil recovery study, the microemulsion-based washing agent provided the highest total oil extraction efficiency: up to 71.38 ± 1.75% at the optimum salinity of 15 wt.% NaCl, and a contact time of 30 min at 25 °C. Thus, the HLD concept for predicting microemulsion formulation was found to be an effective way to formulate a microemulsion-based washing agent for vegetable oil removal from SBE.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Practical Approach in Developing Desirable Peel–Seal and Clear Lidding Films Based on Poly(Lactic Acid) and Poly(Butylene Adipate-Co-Terephthalate) Blends,"Liewchirakorn P., Aht-Ong D., Chinsirikul W.",2018-05-01,"Bulk morphologies, Haze, Lidding films, Optimum conditions, Polies (butylene adipate co terephthalate), Poly lactic acid, Sealing temperature, Surface irregularities, haze, peel failure, peelable lidding film, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), poly(lactic acid)","In this research, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blend with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) were selected to fabricate peelable lidding films. In general, blending PLA with PBAT results in hazy films; however, desirable low haze films (<10%) could be achieved in this study by designing proper blend composition and cast film process under optimum conditions. Based on various blends containing PBAT ranging from 15 to 30% by weight, it could be seen that a PBAT/PLA blend of 20/80 showed desired optical and peel–seal property, which had a haze of <10% and low peel strength in an easy-peel characteristic. It was also observed that not only the blend composition but also the film thickness could influence both optical and peel–seal behaviours because the bulk morphology and surface irregularities of the films could vary by changing films' thicknesses. Thus, cast extruded pristine and PBAT/PLA (20/80) blend films of three different thicknesses (20, 35 and 50 μm) were studied. Peel–seal behaviour and optical properties of these films were examined. An I-peel test (180°) of films sealed on PLA sheet (thickness of ~350 μm) with different interfacial sealing temperature illustrated failure mechanism of four types, i.e. tearing, partial tearing, cohesive and adhesive failure. Based on this study, the PBAT/PLA of 20/80 wt% films with thickness of 20 μm can be used as easy-peel lidding film sealed with PLA container. Such PBAT/PLA blend films possess a low haze of ~4% and a low peel strength of 8–10 N/15 mm at a broad range of interfacial sealing temperature of 76–105°C.

The results revealed that the storage modulus at room temperature increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker, that is, from 5.1 GPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 8.8 GPa (at 20 wt%). Glass transition temperatures were increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker in the range of 154°C–170°C. Furthermore, all samples exhibited approximately 99% of shape fixity with recovery time ranging from 8 to 27 min. Interestingly, the incorporation of silicon carbide whisker could significantly increase recovery stress from 3.4 MPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 11.2 MPa (at 20 wt%). Moreover, the addition of silicon carbide whisker provides microwave actuating ability to the sample. Recovery time under microwave heating was significantly shortened to be in a range of 3–5 min. These results suggest potential use of the composites as microwave-responsive sensors and other shape memory devices.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanical Engineering"
Observation and explanation of two-dimensional interconversion of oximes with multiple heart-cutting using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography,"Kulsing C., Nolvachai Y., Wong Y.F., Glouzman M.I., Marriott P.J.",2018-04-20,"Comprehensive MDGC, Comprehensive two dimensional GC, Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography, Deans switches, Interconversion process, Interconversions, Isomerisation, Multidimensional gas chromatography, Chromatography, Gas, Computer Simulation, Kinetics, Oximes, Temperature, 2D interconversion, Chiral GC × GC, Comprehensive MDGC, Deans switch, Ionic liquid, On-line isomerisation","Real-time interconversion processes produce unconventional peak broadening in gas chromatography (GC), and can be used to generate kinetic and thermodynamic data. In this study, an unusual separation situation in comprehensive two dimensional GC where two dimensional interconversion (i.e. a raised plateau in both first and second dimension, 1D and 2D) was observed in analysis of oxime isomers. This resulted in a characteristic and unusual rectangular peak shape in the two dimensional result. A related theoretical approach was introduced to explain the peak shape supported by simulation results which can be varied depending on concentration profiles and kinetics of the process. The simulated results were supported by experimental results obtained by a comprehensive heart-cut multidimensional GC (H/C MDGC) approach which was developed to clearly investigate isomerisation of E/Z oxime molecules in both 1D and 2D separations under different isothermal conditions. The carrier gas flow and oven temperature were selected according to initial results for 1D interconversion on a poly(ethyleneglycol) stationary phase, which was further used in both 1D and 2D separations to result in broad zones of oxime interconversion in both dimensions. The method involved repetitive injections of oxime sample, then sampling contiguous fractions of sample into a long 2D column which is intended to promote considerable interconversion. Comprehensiveness arises from the fact that the whole sample is sampled from the 1D to the 2D column, with the long 2D column replacing the short 2D column used in classical comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography, where the latter will not promote sufficient interconversion. Data processing and presentation permits a ‘rectangular’ distribution corresponding to the separated compounds, characteristic of this experiment.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Modern onshore and offshore sediment samples were compared with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, three palaeotsunami and a 2007 storm deposit from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, to determine provenance relationships between these coastal overwash deposits. Sedimentological and stratigraphic characteristics are generally inadequate to discriminate tsunami and storm deposits so a statistical approach (including cluster analysis, principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis) was used based on grain size, mineralogy and trace element geochemistry. The mineral content and trace element geochemistry are statistically inadequate to distinguish the provenance of the modern storm and tsunami deposits at this site, but the mean grain size can potentially discriminate these overwash deposits. The 2007 storm surge deposits were most likely sourced from the onshore sediment environment whereas all four tsunami units statistically differ from each other indicating diverse sediment sources. Our statistical analyses suggest that the 2004 tsunami deposit was mainly derived from nearshore marine sediments. The uppermost palaeotsunami deposit was possibly derived from both onshore and nearshore materials while the lower palaeotsunami deposits showed no clear evidence of their sediment sources. Such complexity raises questions about the origin of the sediments in the tsunami and storm deposits and strongly suggests that local context and palaeogeography are important aspects that cannot be ignored in tsunami provenance studies.","genergyal, earth sciences","Oceanography, Geology, Geochemistry and Petrology"

We conducted a cross-sectional study. BV prevalence was assessed by Nugent score and Amsel criteria. Descriptive statistics was used to present baseline characteristics; kwallis rank test – to compare variables between the four groups; logistic regression – to assess factors, related to BV prevalence. The analysis included 137 women in the four study groups with a median age of 39 years. Median BV prevalence by Nugent score was 45%, intermediate vaginal flora – 7% and normal vaginal flora – 48%. There was no statistically significant difference in the BV prevalence between the four study groups, p = 0.711. Threefold lower BV prevalence was found, assessed by Amsel criteria compared to Nugent score. Women with body mass index (BMI) < 20 had higher probability to have BV or intermediate vaginal flora, OR = 3.11, 95% CI (1.2–8.6), p = 0.025. The study found a high BV prevalence in the four study groups, related neither to HIV status, nor to Cu-IUD use. BV prevalence was associated only with low BMI. Thus, Cu-IUD could be a good contraceptive choice for HIV-positive women.

Uncomplicated common bile duct stone removal guided by cholangioscopy versus conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography,"Ridtitid W., Luangsukrerk T., Angsuwatcharakon P., Piyachaturawat P., Aumpansub P., Hurst C., Chaiteerakij R., Kongkam P., Rerknimitr R.",2018-06-01,"Cholangiography, Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde, Female, Gallstones, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Sphincterotomy, Endoscopic, Young Adult, Cholangioscopy, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, Fluoroscopy, Non-radiation","Background: Although previous studies have reported the possibility of therapeutic ERCP without fluoroscopy, more robust documentation of fluoroscopy-free common bile duct stone (CBDS) clearance is needed. Technically, “digital cholangioscopy” (DCS) may be used to confirm CBDS clearance. We aimed to compare the feasibility, safety, and radiation exposure between patients with CBDS undergoing stone removal by DCS and conventional ERCP (cERCP). Methods: Fifty (50) consecutive patients with a CBDS size < 15 mm underwent DCS (SpyGlass DS Direct Visualization System, Boston Scientific, Marlboro, MA, USA) between December 2015 and October 2016. Of 202 consecutive patients undergoing cERCP during the same time frame, 50 matched pairs were created using propensity score matching analysis. In the DCS group, patients underwent biliary cannulation and CBDS removal without fluoroscopy followed by DCS to confirm complete CBDS clearance. A final occlusion cholangiogram was performed as the current standard of care to confirm CBDS clearance. Results: Cannulation success rates were similar between the DCS and cERCP groups (98 vs. 98%). By intention-to-treat analysis, CBDS clearance in the DCS and cERCP groups was not different (90 vs. 98%; p = 0.20, respectively). DCS had successful CBDS removal in 45 cases, whereas 5 (10%) failed for clearance by DCS due to technical limitations. Adverse events were not different between both groups. Conclusions: In the management of uncomplicated CBDS, our data confirmed the feasibility of DCS for CBDS clearance as it showed efficacy and safety comparable to those of cERCP. Although certain conditions may limit its effectiveness, DCS offers the ability to perform CBDS clearance without the need for fluoroscopy unit and can avoid radiation exposure while ERCP under fluoroscopy remains the current standard of care in patients with CBDS.","gastroenterology, medical",Surgery

However, it remains unclear if patients with OSA carry a higher risk of recurrent AF after successful catheter ablation. This meta-analysis was conducted (1) to evaluate the association between OSA and recurrent AF after catheter ablation, and (2) to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the risk of recurrent AF in patients with OSA. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases from inception through July 2017 to identify studies that evaluated the risk of recurrent AF after successful catheter ablation in patients with OSA were included. Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined using random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Seven observational studies with a total of 4572 patients AF after successful catheter ablation were enrolled. Compared to patients without OSA, the pooled OR of recurrent AF in patients with OSA was 1.70 (95% CI, 1.40-2.06, I2 = 0). Among OSA patients with AF after successful catheter ablation, the use of CPAP was significantly associated with decreased risk of recurrent AF with pooled OR of 0.28 (0.19-0.40, I2= 0). Egger's regression asymmetry test was performed and showed no publication bias for the associations of OSA and CPAP with recurrent AF. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggested a significant association between OSA and recurrent AF after catheter ablation. The use of CPAP in patients with OSA is associated with reduced risk of recurrent AF after catheter ablation.",medical,Health Policy

The BoHV-1 genome encodes at least 10 BoHV-1 microRNA (miRNA) genes, whose functions remain poorly understood. This study sought to understand the role of three BoHV-1 miRNA genes, Bhv1-miR-B6, Bhv1-miR-B8 and Bhv1-miR-B9, which are located proximal to the BoHV-1 origins of replication (OriS). Therefore, plasmids expressing the precursor miRNA hairpins for the Bhv1-miR-B6, Bhv1-miR-B8, and Bhv1-miR-B9 genes were constructed and transfected into Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells prior to BoHV-1 infection. Interestingly, transient expression of either Bhv1-miR-B8 or Bhv1-miR-B9 in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells prior to infection resulted in partial suppression of BoHV-1 replication, quantified through estimating levels of glycoprotein C mRNA and protein levels. Putative interactions between the mature miRNA bhv1-miR-B8-3p and bhv1-miR-B9 and BoHV-1 transcripts were identified providing plausible pathways for these molecules to affect virus replication. Therefore, these two miRNAs are implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of BoHV-1 transcripts important for virus replication and could be used to limit BoHV-1 replication.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, medical","Cancer Research, Virology, Infectious Diseases"

However, there has no research to discuss the effect of temperature on methanogenic activity in relation to micronutrient transport and availability. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature on methanogenic activity in relation to nutrient uptakes, micronutrient transports, and mass balance using anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBR) with recycled biogas for treating ethanol wastewater at mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures. The increase in temperature from 37 to 55 °C increased in both of the optimum chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate and methanogenic activity, corresponding to the results of N and P uptakes, energy balance, and mass balance. The higher temperature of the thermophilic operation as compared to the mesophilic one caused a lower water solubility of the produced H2S, leading to lowering the reduction of divalent cation micronutrients. The thermophilic operation could prevent the deficit of micronutrients, thus causing a higher methanogenic activity, while the mesophilic operation still had the deficit of most micronutrients, leading to the lower activity.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

One out of 977 samples from first-time/high-risk donors was RR for anti-HTLV-I/II antibodies. This sample was co-reactive for HBsAg, but negative for HTLV by EIA or in-house HTLV-I qPCR. The ARCHITECT rHTLV-I/II assay exhibited a specificity of 99.93% in low-risk donors and 99.90% among high-risk donors. This study concluded that HTLV-I/II prevalence is low among blood donors in Thailand. But periodic surveillance should be continually conducted to ensure high blood safety standards in the country.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Effects of combined lower thoracic epidural/ general anesthesia on pain control in patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery,"Thepsoparn M., Sereeyotin J., Pannangpetch P.",2018-01-01,"Adult, Analgesia, Epidural, Analgesics, Opioid, Anesthesia, Epidural, Anesthesia, General, Bupivacaine, Female, Fentanyl, Humans, Lumbar Vertebrae, Lumbosacral Region, Male, Middle Aged, Pain Management, Pain, Postoperative, Treatment Outcome, general anesthesia, Low thoracic epidural anesthesia, Lumbar spine surgery, Pain","Objective. Our objective was to compare postoperative pain relief and operating field condition of single-shot, low-Thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia versus general anesthesia alone. Summary of Background Data. Prior studies have suggested that continuous epidural analgesia provides better postoperative pain relief and less intraoperative blood loss, but with the risk of the epidural catheter contaminating the surgical field. Methods. A total of 22 patients scheduled for elective lumbar spine surgery were enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups. Group B (block) received a single-shot epidural block with 0.25% bupivacaine plus 4mg of morphine with a total volume of 10 mL before receiving general anesthesia with desflurane, and cisatracurium. Group G (general) received general anesthesia alone with desflurane, cisatracurium, and any systemic analgesia deemed appropriate by the attending anesthesiologist. Postoperative pain score, opioid consumption, intraoperative blood loss, surgical field rating score, and other side effects were recorded at the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours postoperatively. Results. Both groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status. Fentanyl consumption was significantly lower (P <.05) for group B (block) at the PACU and 24 hours. Mean fentanyl consumption at PACU was 20mg for group B and 85mg for group G. At 24 hours mean fentanyl consumption was 80mg for group B and 386mg for group G. Pain measured with numerical rating scale, surgical field rating score, blood loss, and complications were similar in both groups. Conclusion. Single-shot low-Thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia provides better pain control than general anesthesia alone.",medical,"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Neurology (clinical)"

In the original paper, the authors presented a numerical model to calculate the seismic displacement for rock slopes with cracks using the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. For the proposed numerical model, the upper bound limit analysis and rigid block displacement technique were employed in which the actual horizontal and vertical earthquake ground motion records were utilized in the analyses. This discussion addresses the theoretical issues of the computed permanent seismic displacements in conjunction with the upper bound limit analysis using the rigid block displacement technique. In addition, the discussion comments on some issues related to the assumption of using the factor of safety being less than 1 for a calculation of induced seismic displacement under an actual time history of horizontal and vertical accelerations, and the use of fixed crack depth ratios of 0.1 and 0.2 in the parametric studies of the original paper.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science"

Design: Retrospective single-center study. Setting: Level 1 trauma center. Patients: Sixty-five patients with unilateral DIACFs, reexamined at an average of 8.1 years after surgery. Intervention: Internal fixation of DIACF with lateral plate or percutaneous screws. Main Outcome Measurements: Dynamic pedobarography, AOFAS, Zwipp, SF-36 scores, Foot Function Index, Böhler angle, and articular congruity. Results: When compared with the uninjured side, pedobarography of the operated foot revealed a significantly increased contact area of the hindfoot and midfoot, with a decreased contact area under first/ second metatarsal (MT) and first/second toe after DIACF. Maximum pressure and pressure time integral were significantly increased at the midfoot and lateral MT with a decrease under the hindfoot and first to second MT/toe. Midfoot pressure time integral correlated with the range of plantarflexion. Fracture classification correlated with MT 1 contact time. Hindfoot and MT contact times were negatively correlated with Böhler angle. Patients with the smallest side-to-side differences in pedobarogaphy had overall highest scores and significantly greater ankle/hindfoot range of motion at follow-up. Conclusions: Significant correlations were found between clinical and pedobarographic results. Increased contact areas and time at the midfoot indicating a lateral load shift correlated with inferior outcome and decreased subtalar motion. These results support the importance of reconstruction of the subtalar joint and overall bony morphology of the calcaneus with preservation of subtalar motion as necessary for global foot function.","orthopedic surgery, medical","Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

The stoichiometry of drug/CD complexes is most frequently 1:1. However, natural CDs have a tendency to self-assemble and form aggregates in aqueous media. CD aggregation can limit their solubility. Through derivative formation, it is possible to enhance their solubility and complexation capacity, but this depends on the type of substituent and degree of substitution. Formation of water-soluble drug/CD complexes can increase drug permeation through biological membranes. To maximize drug permeation the amount of added CD into pharmaceutical preparation has to be optimized. However, solubility of CDs, especially that of natural CDs, is affected by the complex formation. The presence of pharmaceutical excipients, such as water-soluble polymers, preservatives, and surfactants, can influence the solubilizing abilities of CDs, but this depends on the excipients’ physicochemical properties. The competitive CD complexation of drugs and excipients has to be considered during formulation studies.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Variability of particle configurations achievable by 2-nozzle flame syntheses of the Au-Pd-TiO2 system and their catalytic behaviors in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene,"Pongthawornsakun B., Mekasuwandumrong O., Santos Aires F.J.C., Buchel R., Baiker A., Pratsinis S.E., Panpranot J.",2018-01-01,"2-nozzle system, Acetylene hydrogenation, AuPd alloy, AuPd/TiO2, Deposition precipitation, Particle composition, Reaction conditions, Selective hydrogenation, 2-nozzle system, Acetylene hydrogenation, AuPd/TiO2, Bimetallic AuPd alloy particles, Flame spray pyrolysis","Catalysts with Au and Pd supported on TiO2 (Au:Pd 1:1 wt/wt%) were prepared by 1- and 2-nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (FSP). The 2-nozzle configuration allowed to synthesize various particle configurations by separate or co-feeding of the metal precursor solutions to the two nozzles. For the Au-Pd/TiO2 system, four different catalyst particle configurations were investigated: “TiO2 + AuPd”, “Pd/TiO2 +Au”, “Au/TiO2 +Pd”, and “Pd/TiO2 + Au/TiO2”, where + separates the corresponding precursor solutions fed to the two nozzles. There were no significant differences in the specific surface areas and the average TiO2 crystallite sizes of the catalysts (100 m2/g and 16–17 nm, respectively) with the exception of “Pd/TiO2 +Au/TiO2”, which exhibited larger surface area and smaller crystallite size (152 m2/g, 12 nm) due to halving of the Ti precursor concentration in each nozzle. As revealed by CO chemisorption, XPS, and STEM-EDX results, the catalyst properties varied largely in terms of bimetallic AuPd particle compositions, the interaction between metal–metal and metal-support, and the location of Pd (or AuPd) on the TiO2. Among the catalysts studied, “TiO2 + AuPd” prepared with the 2-nozzle system exhibited the highest conversion of acetylene (∼50%) at 40 °C with high selectivity to ethylene ( > 95%). Co-feeding the noble metal precursors together with the Ti precursor afforded less active catalysts due to the formation of Ti-O species partially covering the most active bimetallic AuPd particles. Compared to the commercially available acetylene hydrogenation catalyst and the AuPd/TiO2 prepared by conventional co-impregnation and deposition-precipitation, all the FSP-AuPd/TiO2 catalysts showed superior performances under the reaction conditions used.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Over the recent decades, a number of natural materials, namely, biopolymers and bioceramics, have been proposed as the main constituent of osteochondral scaffolds, but also as cell carriers and signaling molecules. Overall, natural materials have been investigated both in the bone and in the cartilage compartment, sometimes alone, but often in combination with other biopolymers or synthetic materials. Biopolymers and bioceramics possess unique advantages over their synthetic counterparts due similarity with natural extracellular matrix, the presence of cell recognition sites and tunable chemistry.

The effect of temperature was studied in the range of 275-300 °C. Both deoxygenation and desulfurization led to approximately 100% conversions at 300 °C, while at 275 °C, palmitic acid deoxygenation was recorded at a higher conversion rate compared with that of the desulfurization of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene. The presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene during the deoxygenation of palmitic acid resulted in high conversions (>95%). Pressure drop studies showed that the formation of heavy products caused a gradual pressure drop throughout the reactor over time. The catalyst was deactivated during 10 d. Two different sulfur-containing reagents were used for catalyst reactivation including dimethyl-disulfide in n-C18 and LGO containing 484 ppmw of sulfur.

Significant findings from this study will be employed to develop a relevant and effective tool to educate children. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand, from August 2014 to December 2015. Study population included school-aged children between 9 and 14 years (4th to 8th grade). A structured age-appropriate, Thai culture-adjusted and simple 20-item questionnaire was used for this survey. The questionnaire comprised three domains which were eight items for knowledge (K), seven items for attitudes (A), and five items for practice (P). Descriptive and analytic statistics including Pearson's correlation were used to find correlation among KAP domains and age with KAP scores. Results: A total of 1040 students from 13 schools participated in our survey study. Mean age was 11.27 (SD 0.94). Some basic knowledge about epilepsy and practice of inserting objects into mouth of seizing persons account for a high magnitude of misunderstanding. Girls and older-aged children are associated with better positive attitudes towards epilepsy. It seems that educating children with knowledge of both epilepsy and first aid is necessary to improve positive attitudes among this age group. Conclusions: Given the findings, our study suggests that a lack of knowledge in some aspects of KAP in children exists. Educational materials should contain basic knowledge about the simple pathogenesis of seizure, seizure types and seizure characteristics, and provide explanation as to why inserting objects into mouths of seizing persons is not recommended.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; epilepsy, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

In the follicles, Kp-IR and KpR-IR were present in the oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells. Kp-IR was also detected in the follicular fluid of antral follicles. In CL, a strong intensity of Kp-IR was present in the periphery CL of development/maintenance, with a relatively fainter intensity in the central CL. By contrast, KpR-IR was present in both peripheral and central CL at the same intensity. In the uterus, Kp-IR and KpR-IR were present in the uterine glands, myometrium and perimetrium. The relative ovarian Kiss1 mRNA level was higher in the follicular stage than in the luteal stage (P < 0.05). We concluded that kisspeptin and its receptor are present in the cat ovary and uterus, suggesting possible local functions of kisspeptin at the extra-hypothalamic level, such as folliculogenesis, oocyte survival and uterine adenogenesis.","endocrinology and metabolism; biochemistryistryhemistry and physicsiology of reproduction; female; ovarian cycle and ovulation, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

The taxonomic position of the strain was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Meso-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, ribose, galactose and madurose were detected in cell-wall and whole-cell hydrolysates. The N-acyl type of muramic acid was acetyl. Menaquinones were MK-9(H6), MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H4). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16: 0, C16: 0, 10-methyl C18: 0 and iso-C14: 0. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. BLAST analysis of the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 98.8% similarity to Actinomadura oligospora NBRC 104149T, 98.7% similarity to Actinomadura gamaensis DSM 100815T and 97.2% similarity to Actinomadura rupiterrae KCTC 19559T.

The device was fabricated from a cotton thread (15 cm) treated with indicator solution, providing an easy-to-use platform for rapid measurement of analyte concentration in aqueous solution. The thread was immobilized onto a support, being a polypropylene sheet or box platform, to facilitate loading of liquid samples. Interaction between the deposited reagents and analytes in the samples then occurred within a few minutes. This resulted in zones of color change with different lengths along the thread depending on the analyte concentration. The interaction zones can be analyzed by human eyes based on comparison of the zone lengths with the printed scales which are correlated with the analyte concentrations. Complexometric titration using µTADs was initially investigated for Mg(II) determination in water and rubber latex samples. These devices consisted of two threads which were pretreated with Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and then treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at pH 10. Both threads were tied together with a central knot before being attached to the box platform prior to the analysis. Load of sample solution (6 µL) resulted in the length of red-violet color product on the threads being proportional to the concentration of Mg(II) in waters and rubber latex samples with the working concentration range of 25–1000 mg L−1. In addition, µTAD with a supporting polypropylene sheet consisting of several threads treated with AgNO3 and K2CrO4 indicators was applied for argentometric titration of chloride ion in water and food seasoning samples. After sample loading (3 µL), the initially red-brown threads turned into white corresponding to formation of AgCl(s) on the threads with a working concentration range of 75–600 mg L−1. Greater selectivity towards Mg(II) and chloride compared with potential interference ions was also observed. All the developed μTADs were applied for analysis of real samples which showed results being in agreement with those obtained by classical titrations.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of cathepsin B transcript in the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrCTSB) was obtained from 454 pyrosequencing of cDNAs from hepatopancreas and muscle. It was 1158 bp in length, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 987 bp corresponding to 328 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass and pI of MrCTSB protein was 36.04 kDa and 4.73. The major characteristics of MrCTSB protein consisted of a propeptide of C1 peptidase family at the N-terminus and a cysteine protease (Pept_C1) domain at the C-terminus. The 3-dimentional structure of MrCTSB was constructed by computer-assisted homology modeling. The folding of MrCTSB was highly conserved to human CTSB structure and the modeled MrCTSB displayed characteristics of cysteine proteinases superfamily. The docking study was performed to investigate binding interactions between known inhibitors against MrCTSB. Known inhibitors were oriented in the groove of catalytic site cleft. They bound to subsites from S2, S1, S1′ and S2′ respectively, with key residues in each subsite. Challenge of juvenile prawns with Aeromonas hydrophila revealed that the MrCTSB transcript in hepatopancreas significantly increased at 60–96 h post injection (hpi). This suggested that MrCTSB may play roles in innate immunity of M. rosenbergii. Our results provide useful information for a more comprehensive study in immune-related functions of MrCTSB.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Physiology, Molecular Biology"

We focused on the male coda, which is produced during vocal turn-taking with one's mate, and particularly its phrases containing rapid spectral and temporal variation, to investigate if modulation rates resemble those of lip-smacking in other nonhuman primates and human speech rhythm. Materials and methods: We produced recordings from a large population of wild gibbons. Using terminology consistent with that used to describe vocalizations in other singing species, we analyzed coda phrases, overall coda properties, coda distinctiveness across individuals, and flexibility of phrase production within song bouts. Results: Our song phrase-level analysis showed that male codas differed between individuals and increase in complexity within song bouts by the addition of the only two male-specific phrases of the species’ repertoire. These phrases differ from all others of the species and from vocalizations typical of the larger, nonhuman great apes, in that they contain rapid within-phrase modulation. Their modulation rates (6.82 and 7.34 Hz) are similar to that of lip-smacking in other nonhuman primates and speech in humans and, like human speech, are produced exclusively during exhalation. One phrase type (trills) contains multiple notes per exhalation, another characteristic similar to speech but not most primate vocalizations. Discussion: Our data highlight the complexity and flexibility of gibbon song, and show that particular phrase features likely arose from sexual selection pressures and possess similarities to human speech rhythm.","physicsiology, medical, sociology","Anatomy, Anthropology"

However, due to decreasing usage of voice calls and SMS, and low usage while people staying at home, identifying home and work locations are getting more difficult. In this paper, we develop a method to exploit daily-aggregated internet usage data (G-CDR) in addition to CDR for identifying work locations. We also develop a method for identifying home locations based on detecting sleeping time. This method can significantly increase home detection success rate and accuracy.

Effect of operating parameters of potassium carbonate supported on gamma alumina (K2CO3/γ-Al2O3) on CO2 capture capacity using depressurized regeneration,"Boonprasop S., Chalermsinsuwan B., Piumsomboon P.",2018-07-01,"CO2 capture, Depressurized regeneration, Hydrothermal treatments, Operating parameters, Physical adsorption, Pressure swing, Regeneration cycles, Sorption capacities, CO2 capture, Depressurized regeneration, Fluidized bed, K2CO3/γ-Al2O3, Pressure swing","Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) loaded at 17% by weight (wt.%) on a gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3) support was prepared by impregnation and then employed to adsorb carbon dioxide (CO2) under a turbulent fluidized bed regime in a glass riser–sorber. The spent K2CO3/γ-Al2O3 sorbent was regenerated in situ by depressurization at 0.8 or 0.2 atm for 2 or 20 min. The CO2 sorption occurred by both chemical sorption and physical adsorption and the total sorption capacity was not significantly dependent on the sorbent regeneration time (2 or 20 min) or regeneration cycles (1–3), but was strongly dependent upon the regeneration pressure, being better at 0.2 than at 0.8 atm. There was no detectable formation of inactive species, such as KAl(CO3)(OH)2H2O), on the regenerated sorbent and the meso-pore type IV surface area was not affected by the number of regeneration cycles. Rather the relocation of water on the sorbent surface in the hydrothermal treatment after sorbent regeneration is hypothesized to have played an important role in the CO2 capture capacity. This was because the accumulation of water near the pore entrance rather than deep inside the pore reduced the average pore diameter and increased the average pore volume when regenerated at 0.8 atm, but not at 0.2 atm. The regenerated sorbent (at 0.2 atm for 2 min) had a CO2 capture capacity of about 95% of that of the fresh adsorbent. As the result of the short regeneration time, the depressurization regeneration unit can be much more compact than the conventional heat regeneration unit.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

These processes enable redox sensing and facilitate homeostatic regulation of redox dependent protein signalling, function, stability and trafficking. Increased S-nitrosylation in an environment of increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) is initially a protective mechanism aimed at maintaining protein structure and function. When O&NS becomes severe, mechanisms governing denitrosylation and transnitrosylation break down leading to the pathological state referred to as hypernitrosylation (HN). Such a state has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and we investigate its potential role in the development and maintenance of neuroprogressive disorders. In this paper, we propose a model whereby the hypernitrosylation of a range of functional proteins and enzymes lead to changes in activity which conspire to produce at least some of the core abnormalities contributing to the development and maintenance of pathology in these illnesses.","psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Behavioral Neuroscience"

The soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens MC46 was isolated as TCC-degrading, plant-growth promoting bacterium. The characterizations were conducted in vitro revealing that it could utilize TCC as a sole carbon source, and at a wide and higher concentration range from 1.6–31.6 mg kg−1 than those previously reported, while the detoxification was assessed by cytogenotoxicity and phytotoxicity tests. The developed sawdust-based inoculant formula combined with molasses (5% w/w), and either PEG or CMC-starch blend (1% w/w) could maintain a 20-week shelf-life inoculant stability in terms of cell viability, and TCC-degrading activity. Bioaugmentation of the formulated inoculants into TCC-contaminated soil efficiently removed TCC up to 74–76% of the initial concentration, mitigated toxicity, restored plant growth and health, and enhanced soil enzyme activities. This work is the first to demonstrate potential application of the formulated plant-growth promoting bacterial inoculant for the treatment and detoxification of a persistent TCC contaminated in soil.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; terrestrial pollution, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Prior attempts used traditional prediction techniques based on Bag of words (BoW), where the order of words is discarded, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of criminal cases from Thai Supreme Court using End-To-End Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our model imitates a process of legal interpretation, whereby recurrent neural networks read the fact from an input case and compare them against relevant legal provisions with the attention mechanism. The model's output shows if a person is guilty of a crime according to the fact and laws. After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements. It features the text of fact expertly extracted from each judgement, textual provisions from Thai Criminal Code, and binary-format labels following the theoretical criminal law structure.

Clinical examination and biopsy usually detect OSCC at an advanced stage that is difficult to treat, leading to poor prognosis. DNA methylation pattern is tissue specific and has emerged as a biomarker for the detection of cancers of tissue origin. Herein, we aimed to discover a novel site-specific methylation marker for OSCC. Methods: We selected OSCC datasets analyzed using the IlluminaHumanMethylation27 BeadChip from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using a bioinformatics approach. From 27,578 CG dinucleotide (CpG) sites, the CpG site with the highest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells was selected for further validation. A total of 18 mucosal tissue samples were collected from nine healthy controls and nine from OSCC subjects and subjected to microdissection for cell purification, followed by DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion, and pyrosequencing. Additionally, epithelial cells were collected from 2 cohorts including oral rinse from healthy controls, oral rinse and oral swab from OSCC subjects and oral rinse from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were examined for their methylation status using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Among the 27,578 differentially methylated CpG sites, cg01009664 of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene showed the greatest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells. Validation of the TRH gene using pyrosequencing revealed a methylation percentage of 7% ± 3.43% in healthy cells in contrast to 63% ± 19.81% in cancerous cells. Screening of epithelial cells using real-time PCR showed that the DNA methylation level was significantly higher in oral swab and rinse samples collected from OSCC and oropharyngeal SCC subjects than those from healthy controls (p < 0.001). In addition, when using a cutoff at 3.31 ng/μL, the TRH methylation biomarker was able to distinguish OSCC and oropharyngeal SCC subjects from healthy controls with high level of area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity.

In this fast-moving area, interventions need to be tailored to resource-limited settings where most HIV-infected children live and take account of decreasing numbers of younger HIV-infected children after successful prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Innovative randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs enable several questions relevant to children’s treatment and care to be answered within the same study. We reflect on key considerations, and, with examples, discuss the relative merits of different RCT designs for addressing multiple scientific questions including parallel multi-arm RCTs, factorial RCTs, and crossover RCTs.

Cycloartobiloxanthone, a flavonoid isolated from stem bark of Artocarpus gomezianus, has potential for being developed for anticancer therapy. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against four human lung cancer cell lines (H23, H460, H292 and A549) and their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were assessed. Apoptotic induction in H460 cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay and protein hallmarks of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway were examined by western blot analysis. Results: Cycloartobiloxanthone exhibited potent cytotoxic effect on both small and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Nuclear Hoechst/PI staining revealed that apoptotic cell death was the main mechanism of toxicity of cycloartobiloxanthone. The apoptosis-inducing potency of cycloartobiloxanthone was comparable to those of standard anticancer drugs cisplatin and etoposide at the same concentration. Protein analysis further showed that apoptosis was mediated via mitochondria-dependent pathway. p53 was activated in cells treated with cycloartobiloxanthone. Subsequently, pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-associated X protein (BAX) was found to be significantly increased, concomitantly with the decrease of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). Moreover, markers of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, namely activated caspase-9, activated caspase-3, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), dramatically increased in cycloartobiloxanthone-treated cells compared to the non-treated controls. Conclusion: Cycloartobiloxanthone has anticancer activity against human lung cancer cells by triggering mitochondrial apoptotic caspase-dependent mechanism. This compound might have promising effects for cancer therapy.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology"

While methods for characterizing the multi-faceted challenges of managing freshwater ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of this new framework —the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) — in the Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders' preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms, the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to enhance or decrease water-related services, and how well the existing water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The role of intraoperative parameters on predicting laparoscopic abdominal surgery associated acute kidney injury,"Srisawat N., Kongwibulwut M., Laoveeravat P., Lumplertgul N., Chatkaew P., Saeyub P., Latthaprecha K., Peerapornratana S., Tiranathanagul K., Eiam-Ong S., Tungsanga K.",2018-10-22,"Abdomen, Acute Kidney Injury, Aged, Biomarkers, Cohort Studies, Female, Humans, Laparoscopy, Male, Middle Aged, Monitoring, Intraoperative, Postoperative Complications, Predictive Value of Tests, Prospective Studies, Acute kidney injury, Exposure index, Intra-abdominal hypertension, Laparoscopic abdominal surgery, NGAL","Background: Laparoscopic abdominal surgery has been widely used to reduce the length of hospital stay and complications from open abdominal surgery. During the operation, the creation of pneumoperitoneum is used for better visualization of the operating field. However, the effect of pneumoperitoneum on kidney function is unknown. We aimed to identify risk factors and predictors associated with AKI development following laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study of laparoscopic abdominal surgery patients between June 2012 and December 2013. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (uNGAL) was measured on the first 3 days after surgery as a surrogate marker of AKI. Results: Of the 64 patients, 23 (35%) developed postoperative AKI. The mean age, initial blood pressure, and initial glomerular filtration rate were not different between AKI and non-AKI groups. Inflation time and exposure index were significantly higher in the AKI group compared to non-AKI group (192.0 vs 151.1 min, p = 0.045, and 2325.9 vs 1866.1 mmHg-minutes, p = 0.035). Operation time, mean intra-abdominal pressure, duration of intraoperative hypotension, amount of blood loss and intravenous fluid were not different between groups. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, diabetes, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and type of operation (urological surgery), exposure index was significantly associated with postoperative AKI, with odds ratio (95% CI) 1.47 (1.05-2.04), p = 0.024. By combining the intraoperative parameters with clinical model the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.71 (95% CI 0.58-0.84). Conclusions: AKI was a common condition in laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Exposure index has been proposed as a novel predictor of laparoscopic abdominal surgery associated AKI.",medical,Nephrology

Methods: A longitudinal study (2009-2017) was performed in participants with AHI (n 439) attending a single clinic in Bangkok. Plasma samples obtained prior to ART were used to obtain HIV-1 pol sequences and combined with clinical and epidemiologic data to assess transmission dynamics (cluster formation and size) using phylogenetic analysis. Clusters were estimated using maximum likelihood, genetic distance of 1.5% and visual inspection. The potential transmitter(s) in a cluster was determined using time to viral suppression and interview data. Results: The cohort was predominantly MSM(93%) and infected with HIV-1 CRF01-AE (87%). Medians (ranges) for age and viral load prior to ART were 26 (18-70) years and 5.9 (2.5-8.2) log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. Median time from history of HIV-1 exposure to diagnosis was 19 (3-61) days. Viral suppression was observed in 388 of 412 (94%) participants at amedian timeof 12weeks followingART.Twenty-six clusters withmedian cluster size of 2 (2-5) representing 62 of 439 (14%) participants were observed. Younger age was associated with cluster formation: median 28 versus 30 years for unique infections (P 0.01). A potential transmitter was identified in 11 of 26 (42%) clusters. Conclusion: Despite high rates of viral suppression following diagnosis and treatment of AHI within a cohort of young Thai MSM, HIV-1 transmission continued, reflecting the need to expand awareness and treatment access to the entire MSM population.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

Many researches in the past decade has studied about recommendation systems. Recommendation systems can base on different variables with location-based services is one of the more interesting factor to a recommendation system. Recommendations on Location based Network is a service for assisting people to locate locations of their interests. A large number of recorded checked-in histories was gathered to make the prediction according to the desired preferences of each user. Furthermore, determinations have shown a social relationship leading to availability of information will assist in making better recommendations based on the locations. Recently, the recommendation system on location-based domain usually combines either content-based technique and collaborative technique, or collaborative technique and social-based techniques. It is difficult to find the way to combine those three techniques. So there is no research that combine those techniques on location-based recommendation system. This study proposes a new method that combines content-based technique, collaborative technique, and social-based techniques; to produce more efficient result results than location-based RS methods. The evaluation results show that the proposed method provide higher accuracy and coverage than two current location methods by measuring with the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and coverage matrix.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Although the number of properly characterized and clinically confirmed cases is about 20, it is suspected that this low number masks a potentially high prevalence, with clinical disease typically manifesting itself against an immunocompromised background, but with a substantial number of subclinical or cured cases of infection. To date leishmaniasis in Thailand has been mainly ascribed to two taxa within the recently erected subgenus Mundinia Shaw, Camargo & Teixeira, 2016, Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis Desbois, Pratlong & Dedet, 2014 and a species that has not been formally described prior to this study. Results: A case of simple cutaneous leishmaniasis was diagnosed in a patient from Nan Province, Thailand. Molecular analysis of parasites derived from a biopsy sample revealed this to be a new species of Leishmania Ross, 1908, which has been named as Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis Bates & Jariyapan n. sp. A formal description is provided, and this new taxon supercedes some isolates from the invalid taxon ""Leishmania siamensis"". A summary of all known cases of leishmaniasis with a corrected species identification is provided. Conclusions: Three species of parasites are now known to cause leishmaniasis is Thailand, L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis n. sp. in the subgenus Mundinia, which contains the type-species Leishmania enriettii Muniz & Medina, 1948, and a single case of Leishmania infantum Nicolle, 1908. This study now enables epidemiological and other investigations into the biology of these unusual parasites to be conducted.

Norms were provided by 584 Thai university students on eight dimensions: name agreement, object familiarity, visual complexity, category agreement, image agreement, two types of manipulability (graspability and mimeability), and age of acquisition. The results revealed comparatively similar levels of name agreement to Brodeur et al. especially when unfamiliar items were factored out. The pattern of intercorrelations among the Thai psycholinguistic norms was comparable to previous studies and our cross-linguistic correlations were robust for the same set of pictures in English and French.

In vehicle stability control system, the active rollover prevention is presented to prevent rollovers. An imminent rollover should be detected immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention. A traditional rollover index is able to detect un-tripped rollovers. However, it fails to detect tripped rollovers from external inputs such as tripping by the force of a vehicle striking a curb or a road bump. Thus, a new neural network algorithm to detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers is needed so any estimation algorithms to determine unknown parameters will no longer be used. The neural network algorithm uses multi-variables from available sensors on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warning into 3 levels: 'Safe', 'Low Risk', and 'High Risk'. Moreover, the algorithm can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollover by testing with a 1/5th scaled vehicle. In order to show dynamic similarity between the 1/5th scale vehicle and a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham π theorem is used. From experiment results, it is clear that the neural network algorithm can be used to accurately enable the rollover warning for the tripped and un-tripped rollover.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Control and Systems Engineering

Activated sludge collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant with good denitrification efficiency was used as the inoculum to start the system. The aim of this study was to examine the microbial populations in a high C/NO3 – ecosystem for potential DNRA microorganisms, which are the microbial group with the ability to reduce NO3 – to ammonium (NH4 +). A low C/NO3 – reactor was operated in parallel for direct comparisons of the microbial communities that developed under different C/NO3 – values. The occurrence of DNRA in the high C/NO3 – SBR was evidenced by stable isotope-labeled nitrate and nitrite (15NO3 – and15NO2 –), which proved the formation of NH4 + from dissimilatory NO3 –/NO2 – reduction, in which both nitrogen oxides induced DNRA activity in a similar manner. An analysis of sludge samples with Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing showed that the predominant microorganisms in the high C/NO3 – SBR were related to Sulfurospirillum and the family Lachnospiraceae, which were barely present in the low C/NO3 – system. A comparison of the populations and activities of the two reactors indicated that these major taxa play important roles as DNRA microorganisms under the high C/NO3 – condition. Additionally, a beta-diversity analysis revealed distinct microbial compositions between the low and high C/NO3 – SBRs, which reflected the activities observed in the two systems.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Soil Science, Plant Science"

We evaluated the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 in a new sepsis model of oral administration of pathogenic bacteria with GI leakage induced by either an antibiotic cocktail (ATB) and/or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). GI leakage with ATB, DSS, and DSS plus ATB (DSS+ATB) was demonstrated by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- dextran translocation to the circulation. The administration of pathogenic bacteria, either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, enhanced translocation. Bacteremia was demonstrated within 24 h in 50 to 88% of mice with GI leakage plus the administration of pathogenic bacteria but not with GI leakage induction alone or bacterial gavage alone. Salmonella bacteremia was found in only 16 to 29% and 0% of mice with Salmonella and Klebsiella administrations, respectively. Klebsiella bacteremia was demonstrated in 25 to 33% and 10 to 16% of mice with Klebsiella and Salmonella administrations, respectively. Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated GI leakage in these models, as shown by the reductions of FITC-dextran gut translocation, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, bacteremia, and sepsis mortality. The reduction in the amount of fecal Salmonella bacteria with Lactobacillus treatment was demonstrated. In addition, an anti-inflammatory effect of the conditioned medium from Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 was also demonstrated by the attenuation of cytokine production in colonic epithelial cells in vitro. In conclusion, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated the severity of symptoms in a murine sepsis model induced by GI leakage and the administration of pathogenic bacteria.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

Conventional chest physiotherapy (CPT) is a current technique recommended at the onset of lower-respiratory infections in cerebral palsy. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) in children with neuromuscular disease. To date, there has been no study of MI-E in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy. The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy in reducing hospital stay and improvement of atelectasis between MI-E and CPT in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy with lower-respiratory infections. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial. Children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy, age 6 months to 18 y, admitted for lower-respiratory infections and/or atelectasis at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between June 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015, were recruited. Those with pneumothorax, severe pneumonia, active tuberculosis, and shock were excluded. Children were randomized into the MI-E or CPT group. The MI-E group received MI-E (3 therapies/d), and the CPT group received CPT (1 therapy/d). Vital signs per protocol and chest radiograph as needed were recorded. RESULTS: There were 22 children enrolled in the study, 11 in the MI-E and 11 in the CPT group. Demographic data were comparable in both groups. The length of hospital stay was similar in both groups (MI-E 4-24 d vs CPT 6-42 d, P =.15). There were 17 subjects with atelectasis (MI-E [n = 9] versus CPT [n = 8]). In this atelectasis subgroup, MI-E had shortened therapy time when compared with CPT (2.9 ± 0.8 d vs 3.9 ± 0.6 d, P =.01). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: MI-E is proven to be beneficial in shortening the duration of airway clearance in children with quadriplegic spastic cerebral palsy presenting with lower-respiratory infections and atelectasis.

However, a recent study found that higher ERβ expression in tissue from diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients indicated a poorer survival. This study aimed to determine the ERβ expression in DLBCL tissue using immunohistochemistry and correlate with clinical outcomes. Methods: Diagnostic tissues from newly diagnosed adult DLBCL patients treated with Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide/Doxorubicin/Vincristine/Prednisolone were counted for ERβ1-expressing cells. Nodal lymphoma (N = 41) was analyzed separately from extra-nodal DLBCL (N = 31). Results: On immunohistochemistry, ERβ1 was expressed in 73.6% of cases with the median expressing cells of 20%. For nodal lymphoma, high ERβ expression (≥25%) was associated with poorer event free survival (EFS) independent of the international prognostic index with the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.49 (95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.03–6.00, P = 0.042). On the contrary, high ERβ expression (≥25%) was associated with superior outcomes in extra-nodal DLBCL with the adjusted HR of 0.25 (95% CI 0.09–0.75, P = 0.013) for EFS and adjusted HR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.10–0.85, P = 0.024) for overall survival in multivariate analyses. Conclusion: ERβ1 protein expression represented opposite prognostic factors in nodal vs. extra-nodal DLBCL.",medical,Hematology

Refactoring orchestrated web services into microservices using decomposition pattern,"Tusjunt M., Vatanawood W.",2018-12-01,"Architecture designs, BPEL, Business process model, Business scenario, Continuous modification, Microservices, Software industry, System modifications, BPEL, Decomposition pattern, Microservices, SOA","Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural design of inter-services collaborations. In general, SOA has three major roles, including client, service provider, and service broker. To access a service usually depends on a service broker, which causes inflexibility in system modification. The software industry now focuses more on productivity, flexibility of the constant changes and continuous modifications, for which the SOA style may not be suitable. Therefore, a new microservice style is an alternative serving those needs, which means a microservice unit is more adaptable and replaceable with no ripple effects. Since the microservice architecture design is considered as a collection of the small self-contained services, each service represents a business capability and carries its own isolated data. However, how to identify microservices is still a challenging task in the business process model level. This paper proposes an alternative mean to extract the existing SOA services from the BPEL flow and refactor them into a set of relevant microservices using the decomposition pattern. In our case study, we propose how to do the service refactoring against the business domain profiles collected from the extracted vocabularies from the given business scenarios. The resulting microservices are domain specific and conform to the business capability vocabularies extracted from the given business scenarios.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Signal Processing"

The sulfonic acid functionality was introduced by sequential hydrothermal carbonization and sulfonation of xylose. The morphology and textural properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and N2 sorption measurements, respectively. The presence of sulfonic acid on the surface was proven by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meanwhile, the acid properties were studied using an NH3-TPD profile. Two different sulfonated carbons that was activated with KOH before sulfonation and one that was compared. The KOH-activated sulfonated carbon contained both a porous structure and a high sulfonic acid content that improved the furfural yield and selectivity by more than 50% compared to the nonactivated sulfonated carbon. The reusability of the catalyst was investigated by monitoring the furfural selectivity over several reaction cycles, and after the 3rd cycle, a reduction in the selectivity from 72 to 30% was observed. However, the acid-functionalized carbon could still be useful for furfural production due to its low environmental impact in both the preparation and disposal steps. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 1455–1461, 2018.","environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Environmental Science (all)"

In this study, the NGA (Next Generation Attenuation) models were selected to predict ground motions due to the earthquake event. The equivalent linear and non-linear approaches were employed in the one-dimensional ground response analysis. Furthermore, the spectral responses produced by the equivalent linear and non-linear approaches were compared with the seismic design code of Thailand. The results showed that the ground motion from the NGA models agree with the strong motion parameters of Tarlay Earthquake. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) at ground surface obtained from both equivalent linear and non-linear approaches certainly results in the high amplification factor.

Lime powder treatment reduces urinary excretion of total protein and transferrin but increases uromodulin excretion in patients with urolithiasis,"Tosukhowong P., Kulpradit P., Chaiyarit S., Ungjareonwattana W., Kalpongnukul N., Ratchanon S., Thongboonkerd V.",2018-06-01,"Adult, Albuminuria, Calcium Compounds, Calcium Oxalate, Female, Humans, Kidney, Kidney Calculi, Male, Middle Aged, Oxides, Powders, Proteomics, Renal Elimination, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Transferrin, Uromodulin, Calcium oxalate, Kidney stone, Proteome, Proteomics, THP, Urinary proteins","Our previous study has shown that lime powder (LP) had an inhibitory effect against calcium oxalate stone formation. However, the precise mechanisms underlying such beneficial effect remained unclear. Our present study thus aimed to address the effect of LP on excretory level and compositions of urinary proteins using a proteomics approach. From a total of 80 calcium oxalate stone formers recruited into our 2-year randomized clinical trial of LP effect, 10 patients with comparable age and clinical parameters were selected for this proteomic study. 24-h urine specimens were collected from all subjects, at baseline (before) and after LP treatment for 6 months, and then subjected to quantitative proteomics analysis and subsequent validation by ELISA. Total urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased by LP treatment, but unaffected by placebo. Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC–MS/MS) followed by quantitative analysis revealed 17 proteins whose levels were significantly altered (16 decreased and 1 increased) exclusively by LP treatment. Among these, the decrease of transferrin and increase of uromodulin were validated by ELISA. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between microalbuminuria and urinary transferrin level by Pearson’s correlation test. In summary, LP treatment caused significant reduction in total urinary protein excretion and changes in urinary protein compositions that could be linked to stone inhibitory effects and might be relevant mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of LP to prevent kidney stone formation and recurrence.",medical,Urology

To investigate the differential expression of genes from P. monodon hemocytes that are involved in WSSV infection under the influence of PmVRP15 expression, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) of PmVRP15-silenced shrimp infected with WSSV was performed. The 189 cDNA clones of the forward library were generated by subtracting the cDNAs from WSSV-infected and PmVRP15 knockdown shrimp with cDNAs from WSSV-infected and GFP knockdown shrimp. For the opposite subtraction, the 176 cDNA clones in the reverse library was an alternative set of genes in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes in the presence of PmVRP15 expression. The abundant genes in forward SSH library had a defense/homeostasis of 26%, energy/metabolism of 23% and in the reverse SSH library a hypothetical protein with unknown function was found (30%). The differential expressed immune-related genes from each library were selected for expression analysis using qRT-PCR. All selected genes from the forward library showed high up-regulation in the WSSV-challenged PmVRP15 knockdown group as expected. Interestingly, PmHHAP, a hemocyte homeostasis associated protein, and granulin-like protein, a conserved growth factor, are extremely up-regulated in the absence of PmVRP15 expression in WSSV-infected shrimp. Only transcript level of transglutaminase II, that functions in regulating hematopoietic tissue differentiation and inhibits mature hemocyte production in shrimp, was obviously down-regulated as observed from SSH results. Taken together, our results suggest that PmVRP15 might have a function relevant to hemocyte homeostasis during WSSV infection.","environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

In the second part, there is a consideration of the role of lethal and sub-lethal activation of these pathways in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, with particular reference to the TNF-α-TNFR signalling axis; dysregulation of ASK-1-JNK signalling; prolonged or chronic PARP-1 activation; the role of pyroptosis and chronic inflammasome activation; and the roles of lysosomal permeabilisation, necroptosis and ferroptosis. Finally, it is suggested that, in addition to targeting oxidative stress and inflammatory processes generally, neuropsychiatric disorders may respond to therapeutic targeting of TNF-α, PARP-1, the Nod-like receptor NLRP3 inflammasome and the necrosomal molecular switch receptor-interacting protein kinase-3, since their widespread activation can drive and/or exacerbate peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation even in the absence of cell death. To this end, the use is proposed of a combination of the tetracycline derivative minocycline and N-acetylcysteine as adjunctive treatment for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

This paper presents a numerical study of railway embankment behaviour when constructed on soft soil. Simplified finite-element modelling was performed to predict stability and deformation characteristics of railway embankments under high-speed design requirements. The construction materials, including ballasts and subgrade soils were selected and tested to characterise their engineering properties. It was found that existing railway embankment conditions exhibit a large degree of movement under a high-speed train load. The study recommends improvements of subgrade conditions, using methods such as cement stabilisation to enhance stability and reduce settlement of the railway embankments.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology

Based on our previous studies, the bending radius of fiber greater than 1.5 cm will not affect the insertion loss of PMF [1]. Moreover, the measured PER of Panda PMF with LC/UPC connectors is more stable when that PMF is coiled around a hot rod with a minimum of 3-cm in diameter at 75°C temperature [2]. Hence, the hot rod with less constrained 6-cm in diameter at constant 75°C was selected for this PER measurement. Two PER setups were verified and compared for measuring LC/UPC PMF connectors. The Polarized Laser Source (PLS) at 1550 nm wavelength and PER meter from OZ Optics were used in both setups, in which the measured connector was connected to PLS at 0° angle while the other end was connected to PER meter. In order to qualify our setups, the percentage of Repeatability and Reproducibility (%R&R) were tested and calculated. In each setup, the PER measurement was repeated 3 trials by 3 appraisers using 10 LC/UPC PMF connectors (5 LC/UPC PMF patchcords with 3.5±0.5 meters in length) in random order. The 1st setup, PMF was coiled at a larger 20-cm diameter for 3 to 5 loops and left in room temperature during the test. The 2nd setup, PMF was coiled around a hot rod at constant 75°C with 6-cm diameter for 8 to 10 loops for at least 5 minutes before testing.

According to our results, the %R&R of the 1stPER test setup was 16.2% as marginality, and the 2nd PER test setup was 8.9% as acceptance. Thus, providing the better repeatability and reproducibility, this 2nd PER test setup having PMF coiled around a hot rod at constant 75°C with 6-cm diameter was selected for our next study of the impact of hot temperature on PER in LC/UPC PMF connector.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, computer science, Mathematics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Existing algorithms permit the client tasks to be sent and received simultaneously to the processors without any possibility of collisions. This implies an unrealistic situation that there is an unlimited number of I/O ports which in fact is physically limited by the underlying architecture and technology. This paper takes this crucial constraint of I/O ports that no existing algorithm has addressed as a part of client task scheduling. Task to be scheduled are represented by a directed acyclic graph with arbitrary dependency structures and arranged by their critical paths. Two theoretical scheduling patterns under multiple I/O ports to achieve the optimal makespan with minimum latent delay are discovered and proved, namely, triangular and parallelogram patterns. They are used as the principal basis for the proposed scheduling algorithm. The focus is on collision avoidance of these tasks to be sent or received through the multiple I/O ports. Plots of task graph on performance comparison with other algorithms from the experiment show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of shorter makespan, less delay, and less number of ports used. In the real application data set, the makespan performance obtained by the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms by 62.05%.",computer science,"Software, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Networks and Communications"

The ability to use for neural regeneration was evaluated in vitro towards murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line and mouse brain-derived neural stem cells. The surface modification with laminin immobilized on the PHB fibrous scaffolds supported the attachment and promoted the proliferation of Neuro2a very wells. Despite the good attachment and proliferation of Neuro2a and mouse brain-derived neural stem cells were not able to proliferate on the neat PHB, hydrolyzed PHB and laminin immobilized on hydrolyzed PHB fibrous scaffold.",Materials Science,Polymers and Plastics
Low temperature preparation of oxygen-deficient tin dioxide nanocrystals and a role of oxygen vacancy in photocatalytic activity improvement,"Anuchai S., Phanichphant S., Tantraviwat D., Pluengphon P., Bovornratanaraks T., Inceesungvorn B.",2018-02-15,"Low temperature preparation, Molecular oxygen adsorption, Non-stoichiometric, Photo catalytic degradation, Photocatalytic activities, Photocatalytic performance, Photoluminescence measurements, SnO2, Nonstoichiometric, Oxygen vacancy, SnO2, Valence band upshift","The introduction of oxygen vacancies (Vos) into tin dioxide crystal structure has been found as an effective method to improve its photocatalytic performance. Herein, oxygen-deficient tin dioxide (SnO2−x) nanocrystals were successfully prepared via a facile, one-step hydrothermal method at the temperature lower than those reported previously. The effect of hydrothermal temperature on phase composition and Vos content was also firstly investigated. Due to its high oxygen vacancy concentration, the SnO2−x prepared at 80 °C provides the best photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under UV–visible light. Scavenger trapping and nitroblue tetrazolium experiments also show that the Vos act as electron trapped sites and molecular oxygen adsorption sites, therefore increasing the production of active [rad]O2− radical which is the main species governing the photocatalytic activity of SnO2−x nanocrystals. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence measurement and electron spin resonance investigation clearly indicate that increasing the hydrothermal temperature results in the coexistence of SnO2−x and Sn3O4 phases and the reduction of Vos concentration which are detrimental to the photocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations also reveal that the presence of Vos is responsible for the upshift of valence band maximum and an extended conduction band minimum, hence a valence band width broadening and band gap narrowing which consequently enhance the photocatalytic performance of the oxygen-deficient SnO2−x.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Body image dissatisfaction in pregnant and non-pregnant females is strongly predicted by immune activation and mucosa-derived activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway,"Roomruangwong C., Kanchanatawan B., Carvalho A.F., Sirivichayakul S., Duleu S., Geffard M., Maes M.",2018-04-03,"Adult, Body Image, Depression, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, Inflammation, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Mucous Membrane, Personal Satisfaction, Postpartum Period, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Prospective Studies, Tryptophan, depression, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, inflammation, Physio-somatic symptoms, somatisation","Objectives: The aim of the present study is to delineate the associations between body image dissatisfaction in pregnant women and immune-inflammatory biomarkers, i.e., C-reactive protein (CRP), zinc and IgA/IgM responses to tryptophan and tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Methods: We assessed 49 pregnant and 24 non-pregnant females and assessed Body Image Satisfaction (BIS) scores at the end of term (T1), and 2–4 days (T2) and 4–6 weeks (T3) after delivery. Subjects were divided in those with a lowered BIS score (≤ 3) versus those with a higher score. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that a lowered T1 BIS score was predicted by CRP levels and IgA responses to tryptophan (negative) and TRYCATs (positive), perinatal depression, body mass index (BMI) and age. The sum of quinolinic acid, kynurenine, 3-OH-kynurenine and 3-OH-anthranilic acid (reflecting brain quinolinic acid contents) was the single best predictor. In addition, a large part of the variance in the T1, T2 and T3 BIS scores was explained by IgA responses to tryptophan and TRYCATs, especially quinolinic acid. Conclusions: Body image dissatisfaction is strongly associated with inflammation and mucosa-derived IDO activation independently from depression, pregnancy, BMI and age. IgA responses to peripheral TRYCATs, which determine brain quinolinic acid concentrations, also predict body image dissatisfaction.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"
Electrical conductivity response of methanol sensor based on conductive polyindole,"Phasuksom K., Prissanaroon-Ouajai W., Sirivat A.",2018-06-01,"Conductive Polymer, Correlation coefficient, Discrimination analysis, Electrical conductivity, Hydrogen bonding interactions, Low concentrations, Polyindoles, Theoretical limits, Chemical sensor, Conductive polymer, Gas sensor, Polyindole, Volatile organic compound","A methanol sensor based on polyindole was investigated and reported in this work. The polyindole sensor response was monitored by the electrical conductivity change at room temperature. The sensor responses of various vapors from non-polar, low polar, and high polar solvents were investigated; the highest relative responses of conductivity were observed when exposed to vapors from high polar solvents, especially methanol possessing the highest dielectric constant (ε) and hydrogen bonding interaction (δH) relative to other vapors inducing the highest interaction to the conductive polymer. The discrimination analysis of sensor was evaluated by the principal component analysis (PCA), it demonstrated that the sensor possessed the good discrimination efficiency towards high polar vapors. The sensor response depended on the doping mole ratio which was related to electrical conductivity of the conductive polymer. In this work, the dPIn/FeCl3 with the doping mole ratio of 10:1 provided the highest methanol relative response of conductivity of 57.83 at the low concentration of 11.36 ppm using nitrogen as a base gas. The sensitivity to methanol vapor was 5.27 ppm−1 with the correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9965, the theoretical limit of detection was as low as 0.048 ppm. The sensor based on the dPIn/FeCl3 10:1 is shown here a good candidate for use as a methanol sensing material.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; measurement methods, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation in the variable domain of λ6 light chain mutant Wil caused by the interaction between its unfolded state and epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate,"Abe Y., Odawara N., Aeimhirunkailas N., Shibata H., Fujisaki N., Tachibana H., Ueda T.",2018-12-01,"Amino Acid Sequence, Amyloid, Ascorbic Acid, Catechin, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Methionine, Mutation, Oxidation-Reduction, Peptide Mapping, Protein Binding, Protein Folding, Protein Unfolding, Spectrum Analysis, Thermodynamics, AL amyloidosis, Amyloid fibril formation, EGCG, Inhibition mechanism","Background: Light chains are abnormally overexpressed from disordered monoclonal B-cells and form amyloid fibrils, which are then deposited on the affected organ, leading to a form of systemic amyloidosis known as AL (Amyloid Light chain) amyloidosis. A green tea catechin, epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), which is thought to inhibit various amyloidoses, is a potent inhibitor of amyloid fibril formation in AL amyloidosis. Methods: An amyloidogenic variable domain in λ6 light chain mutant, Wil was incubated in the presence of EGCG. The incubation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. The interaction between Wil and EGCG was observed by using NMR and tryptophan fluorescence. Results: EGCG inhibited the amyloid fibril formation of Wil at pH 7.5 and 42 °C. Under these conditions, most Wil populations were in the unfolded state and several chemical reactions, i.e., oxidation and/or covalent bond oligomerization could be induced by auto-oxidated EGCG. Moreover, we found that EGCG bound to the unfolded state of Wil with higher affinity (Kd = 7 μM). Conclusions: Inhibition of amyloid fibril formation of Wil was caused by 1) EGCG binding to unfolded state rather than folded state and 2) chemical modifications of Wil by auto oxidation of EGCG. General significance: In the competitive formation of amyloid fibrils and off-pathway oligomers, EGCG produces the latter immediately after it preferentially binds to the unfolded state. It may be general mechanism of EGCG inhibition for amyloidosis.","genergyal, biochemistryistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

A series of their corresponding polyimides were obtained by the condensed polymerization of the respective monomeric isomer DATPP with a 1:1 ratio of 2,2′-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diaminobiphenyl (PFMB) and 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenediphthalic anhydride (6FDA). The inclusion of PFMB and 6FDA into the polymeric backbone causes the polymers to be moderately to highly soluble in organic polar solvents. The molar content of the respective DATPP monomer varied between 5 and 30%. All compounds were structurally characterized by 1H NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy and the porphyrin content in the polyimides was determined by UV–Visible absorption spectroscopy. Photophysical properties consisted of measuring both the UV–Visible (ground state) absorption and fluorescence (excited state) spectra, fluorescence quantum yields (Φf), and fluorescence lifetimes (τf) in dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylacetamide. Fluorescence quenching was also measured and observed by the Stern-Volmer relationship, using 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) as the quencher molecule. Both the bimolecular rate constant of fluorescence quenching (kq) and the Stern-Volmer constant (KQ) were calculated from this relationship. Furthermore, deviations from linearity depicted in the Stern-Volmer plots for TPP and ZnTPP at higher concentrations of AQ were also measured as a means of examining and explaining the simultaneous occurrence of dynamic (collisional) quenching and static quenching in the mechanisms of fluorescence quenching. It was found in this work that the significantly larger values in the static quenching constant (KS) than in the dynamic quenching constant (KD) are indicative that static quenching and ground state complex formation between the fluorophore and quencher is the dominant mechanism of fluorescence quenching of these systems at higher quencher concentrations.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The morphological and chemical characteristics of the sulfonated HTCDRB catalyst were also examined. In addition, the stability of the catalyst was evaluated based on the amounts of biomass conversion products (5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, levulinic acid and formic acid) leached into water at a specified biomass conversion condition. Since no HMF and furfural, and only small amounts of levulinic acid (1.75 wt.%), and formic acid (0.42 wt.%), were leached from the catalyst synthesized from HTCDRB prepared at the carbonization condition of 220 °C for 3 h, this condition was suggested to be a suitable carbonization condition. Despite having similar structural and chemical characteristics, the leaching test suggested that the DRB-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst was found to be more stable than the glucose-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst, prepared at the same condition. The catalytic activity for cellulose hydrolysis of the catalyst was higher than that of the commercial Amberlyst 16 WET catalyst.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science
Synergistic degradation of pyrene by five culturable bacteria in a mangrove sediment-derived bacterial consortium,"Wanapaisan P., Laothamteep N., Vejarano F., Chakraborty J., Shintani M., Muangchinda C., Morita T., Suzuki-Minakuchi C., Inoue K., Nojiri H., Pinyakong O.",2018-01-01,"Bacterial consortium, Cooperative interactions, Mangrove sediments, Meta-cleavage pathway, Microbial consortia, Mycobacterium, Novosphingobium, Ortho-cleavage pathway, Biodegradation, Environmental, Geologic Sediments, Mycobacterium, Pyrenes, Mangrove sediment, Mycobacterium, Novosphingobium, Pyrene, Synergistic degradation","A pyrene-degrading microbial consortium was obtained after enrichment with mangrove sediment collected from Thailand. Five cultivable bacteria (Mycobacterium spp. PO1 and PO2, Novosphingobium pentaromativorans PY1, Ochrobactrum sp. PW1, and Bacillus sp. FW1) were successfully isolated from the consortium. Draft genomes of them showed that two different morphotypes of Mycobacterium (PO1 and PO2), possessed a complete gene set for pyrene degradation. PY1 contained genes for phthalate assimilation via protocatechuate, a central intermediate, by meta-cleavage pathway, and PW1 possessed genes for protocatechuate degradation via ortho-cleavage pathway. The occurrence of biosurfactant-producing genes in FW1 suggests the involvement in enhancing the pyrene bioavailability. Biotransformation experiments revealed that Mycobacterium completely degraded 100 mg L−1 pyrene within six days, whereas no significant degradation was observed with the others. Notably, PY1 and PW1 exhibited higher activity for protocatechuate degradation than the others. The artificially reconstructed consortia containing Mycobacterium with the other three strains (PY1, PW1 and FW1) showed three-fold higher degradation rate for pyrene than the individual Mycobacterium. The enhanced pyrene biodegradation achieved in the consortium was due to the cooperative interaction of bacterial mixture. Our findings showing that synergistic degradation of pyrene in the consortium will facilitate the application of the defined bacterial consortium in bioremediation.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Several factors affect its efficacy and toxicity, including pharmacogenomics. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on treatment responses in irinotecan-based chemotherapy in 49 Thai mCRC patients. Materials and Methods: Forty-nine participants with mCRC enrolled in this study received irinotecan-based chemotherapy from January to June 2017. Genotypic analyses of ABCC2 (C > T, rs717620) and SLCO1B1 (A > G, rs2306283) were performed. Treatment responses were evaluated after at least three cycles of chemotherapy were given. Results: Allele frequencies of ABCC2 (C > T) and SLCO1B1 (A > G) were found at 18.37% and 78.57%, respectively. Neither was associated with treatment responses. However, combined genotypes of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 tended to be associated with clinical benefits in terms of partial responses (PR) and stable disease (SD). All patients (100%) with at least one variant allele of SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 were in a PR or SD group, while patients with other genotypes had progressive disease (PD) at 45.5% to 70%, (p = 0.059). Conclusion: The combined effect of ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 polymorphisms tended to be associated with treatment responses in irinotecan-based treated mCRC patients. Therefore, such polymorphisms could be factors impacting inter-individual variation of irinotecan efficacy in Thai mCRC patients.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

The AgNF was electrodeposited as redox indicator on a gold electrode, which was then functionalized with an electropolymerized layer of PPy, a conducting polymer, to immobilize the PNA probes. The fabrication process was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The biosensor was used to detect miRNA-21, a biomarker abnormally expressed in most cancers. The signal was monitored by the change in current of the AgNF redox reaction before and after hybridization using cyclic voltammetry. Two PNA probe lengths were investigated and the longer probe exhibited a better performance. Nucleotide overhangs on the electrode side affected the signal more than overhangs on the solution side due to the greater insulation of the sensing surface. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical signal was proportional to miRNA-21 concentrations between 0.20 fM and 1.0 nM, with a very low detection limit of 0.20 fM. The biosensor showed a high specificity which could discriminate between complementary, single-, doubled-base mismatched, and non-complementary targets. Three out of the seven tested plasma samples provided detectable concentrations (63 ± 4, 111 ± 4 and 164 ± 7 fM). The sensor also showed good recoveries (81–119%). The results indicated the possibilities of this biosensor for analysis without RNA extraction and/or amplification, making the sensor potentially useful for both the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer in clinical application.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Design: Ongoing observational database collating clinical data on HIV-infected children and adolescents in Asia. Methods: Data from 2001 to 2016 relating to adolescents (10-19 years) with perinatal HIV infection were analysed to describe characteristics at adolescent entry and transition and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens across adolescence. A competing risk regression analysis was used to determine characteristics at adolescent entry associated with mortality. Outcomes at transition were compared on the basis of age at cART initiation. Results: Of 3448 PHIVA, 644 had reached transition. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, cART initiation 7.2 years and transition 17.9 years. At adolescent entry, 35.0% hadCD4+ cell count less than 500 cells/ml and 51.1% had experience da WHO stage III/IV clinical event. At transition, 38.9% had CD4+ cell count less than 500copies/ml, and 53.4% had experienced a WHO stage III/IV clinical event. Mortality ratewas 0.71 per 100 person-years, with HIV RNA >1000copies/ml, CD4+ cell count less than 500cells/ml, height-for-ageorweight-for-agez-score less than - 2, historyofa WHO stage III/IV clinical event or hospitalization and at least second cART associated with mortality. For transitioning PHIVA, those who commenced cART age less than 5 years had better virologic and immunologic outcomes, though were more likely to be on at least second cART. Conclusion: Delayed HIV diagnosis and cART initiation resulted in considerable morbidity and poor immune status by adolescent entry. Durable first-line cART regimens to optimize disease control are key to minimizing mortality. Early cART initiation provides the best virologic and immunologic outcomes at transition.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; epidemiology, medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"
Factors influencing piglet pre-weaning mortality in 47 commercial swine herds in Thailand,"Nuntapaitoon M., Tummaruk P.",2018-01-01,"Animal Husbandry, Animals, Female, Linear Models, Longevity, Reproduction, Sus scrofa, Thailand, Weaning, Birth weight, Herd, Littermate, Parity, Pig, Pre-weaning mortality","The present study aims to determine the occurrence of piglet pre-weaning mortality in commercial swine herds in Thailand in relation to piglet, sow, and environmental factors. Data were collected from the database of the computerized recording system from 47 commercial swine herds in Thailand. The raw data were carefully scrutinized for accuracy. Litters with a lactation length < 16 days or >28 days were excluded. In total, 199,918 litters from 74,088 sows were included in the analyses. Piglet pre-weaning mortality at the individual sow level was calculated as piglet pre-weaning mortality (%) = (number of littermate pigs − number of piglets at weaning) / number of littermate pigs. Litters were classified according to sow parity numbers (1, 2–5, and 6–9), average birth weight of the piglets (0.80–1.29, 1.30–1.79, 1.80–2.50 kg), number of littermate pigs (5–7, 8–10, 11–12, and 13–15 piglets), and size of the herd (small, medium, and large). Pearson correlations were conducted to analyze the associations between piglet pre-weaning mortality and reproductive parameters. Additionally, a general linear model procedure was performed to analyze the various factors influencing piglet pre-weaning mortality. On average, piglet pre-weaning mortality was 11.2% (median = 9.1%) and varied among herds from 4.8 to 19.2%. Among all the litters, 62.1, 18.1, and 19.8% of the litters had a piglet pre-weaning mortality rate of 0–10, 11–20, and greater than 20%, respectively. As the number of littermate pigs increased, piglet pre-weaning mortality also increased (r = 0.390, P < 0.001). Litters with 13–16 littermate pigs had a higher piglet pre-weaning mortality than litters with 5–7, 8–10, and 11–12 littermate pigs (20.8, 7.8, 7.2, and 11.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Piglet pre-weaning mortality in large-sized herds was higher than that in small- and medium-sized herds (13.6, 10.6, and 11.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Interestingly, in all categories of herd size, piglet pre-weaning mortality was increased almost two times when the number of littermates increased from 11–12 to 13–16 piglets. Furthermore, piglets with birth weights of 0.80–1.29 kg in large-sized herds had a higher risk of mortality than those in small- and medium-sized herds (15.3, 10.9, and 12.2%, respectively, P < 0.001). In conclusion, in commercial swine herds in the tropics, piglet pre-weaning mortality averaged 11.2% and varied among herds from 4.8 to 19.2%. The litters with 13–16 littermate pigs had piglet pre-weaning mortality of up to 20.8%. Piglets with low birth weight (0.80–1.29 kg) had a higher risk of pre-weaning mortality. Management strategies for reducing piglet pre-weaning mortality in tropical climates should be emphasized in litters with a high number of littermate pigs, low piglet birth weights, and large herd sizes.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

Previous studies have shown that injection of specific dsRNAs can successfully inhibit viral infection in shrimp. However, inhibition requires high levels of dsRNA and dsRNA stability in shrimp is limited. Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been applied to deliver nucleic acids into host cells because of the protection of dsRNAs from host endonucleases as well as the target specificity provided by VLPs. Therefore, this study aimed to develop Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV) VLPs for dsRNA deliver to shrimp. The PstDNV capsid protein was expressed and can be self-assembled to form PstDNV VLPs. Co-expression of dsRNA-YHV-Pro and PstDNV capsid protein was achieved in the same bacterial cells, whose structure was displayed as the aggregation of VLPs by TEM. Tested for their inhibiting yellow head virus (YHV) from infecting shrimp, the dsRNA-YHV-Pro-PstDNV VLPs gave higher levels of YHV suppression and a greater reduction in shrimp mortality than the delivery of naked dsRNA-YHV-Pro. Therefore, PstDNV-VLPs are a promising vehicle for dsRNA delivery that maintains the anti-virus activity of dsRNA in shrimp over a longer period of time as compared to native dsRNAs.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Performance of integrated ferrate–polyaluminum chloride coagulation as a treatment technology for removing freshwater humic substances,"Amano M., Lohwacharin J., Dubechot A., Takizawa S.",2018-04-15,"Aluminum Hydroxide, Ferric Compounds, Humic Substances, Hydrogen Peroxide, Iron, Oxidation-Reduction, Water Purification, Ferrate, Humic-like fluorophores, Oxidant, Polyaluminum chloride (PACl), Ultraviolet irradiation","Ferrate-based technologies can play versatile roles in water treatment because of their potential for in situ production and because they do not form any harmful by-products. We compared the oxidative performance of Fe(VI) generated by an electrochemical process, with H2O2-UV irradiation (a standard oxidation process) for removing Suwannee River natural organic matter. It took only 5 min for Fe(VI) (Fe: 1.67 × 10−4 M) to reduce the fluorescence intensity of a humic-like fluorophore by 36% of the original value; in contrast, it took 120 min of irradiation using H2O2-UV ([OH[rad]] ∼ 1.8 × 10−13 M) to remove 68% of the original value. In addition to the short reaction time, ferrate can also form aggregates that can remove turbidity and adsorb organics and other contaminants present in water. Simultaneous addition of ferrate and polyaluminum chloride (PACl) to unfiltered natural water displayed the most efficient reduction of UVA254, primarily under acidic conditions. Ferrate pre-oxidation followed by PACl coagulation was the most effective process for reducing turbidity and chromaticity, because of the effects arising from the coagulation of ferrate that resulted in Fe(III)(s) species. Ferrate pre-oxidation generated low-molecular-weight UVA254-absorbing organics, whose dissolved organic matter (DOM) peak at 1250 Da was removed by PACl coagulation. Neither the initial pH nor the process order significantly affected the removal of organic carbon by the integrated ferrate-PACl process.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Compressive strength and setting time modification of class C fly ash-based geopolymer partially replaced with kaolin and metakaolin,"Hemra K., Yamaguchi S., Kobayashi T., Aungkavattana P., Jiemsirilers S.",2018-01-01,"Calcium silicate hydrate, Geopolymer, Initial setting time, Metakaolins, Microstructure evaluations, Replacement materials, Setting time, Solid/liquid ratios, Class C fly ash-based geopolymer, Compressive strength, Kaolin, Metakaolin, Setting time","Class C fly ash is widely used as a geopolymer raw material. It contains high calcium oxide and iron oxide resulting in a fast setting property. The influence of using kaolin and metakaolin replaced class C fly ash in geopolymer processing were investigated in term of compressive strength and setting time. Kaolin and metakaolin which calcined at different temperatures of 600°C and 700°C replaced Class C fly ash between 0 to 50 wt.%. The geopolymers were prepared at constant KOH concentration as 6.0 M, K2SiO3/KOH ratio as 1.0, solid/liquid ratio as 1.5 and 7 days of curing. The compressive strength is obviously increased when fly ash was replaced with both kinds of metakaolin, although, it is inclined to decrease when replaced by kaolin. The compressive strength is increased up to 13% and 47% with the replacement by 50 wt.% of metakaolin calcined at 600°C and 700°C, respectively. On the other hand, the replacement by 50 wt. % of kaolin give the initial setting time prolonging from about 6 min to 80 min. However, the initial setting time of metakaolin calcined at 600°C and 700°C replacement is also improved to about 37 min and 20 min, respectively. These results are from the different of amorphous phase and reactivity of the replacement materials. XRD analysis reveals the combination phases of amorphous geopolymer gel that is the broad hump centered at 28-30° 2θ, and products from the reaction such as calcium oxide, arcanite, calcium silicate hydrate, quartz and muscovite which the two latter are from unreacted metakaolin. They are confirmed by FT-IR result and microstructure evaluation by SEM. Therefore, the partially replacement of fly ash with kaolin and metakaolin in fly ash-based geopolymer production are affected to the compressive strength and the setting time.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Cinacalcet for treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Greeviroj P., Kitrungphaiboon T., Katavetin P., Praditpornsilpa K., Eiam-Ong S., Jaber B.L., Susantitaphong P.",2018-06-01,"Calcimimetic Agents, Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder, Cinacalcet, Humans, Minerals, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders, Cinacalcet, Meta-analysis","Background: Cinacalcet could decrease serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in previous meta-analyses. However, the effect of cinacalcet on the new biomarkers such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), bone markers, and vascular calcification are still unestablished. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of cinacalcet on all laboratory and clinical spectrums of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials.gov to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of cinacalcet relative to standard treatment on CKD-MBD surrogate markers and clinical outcomes. Random-effect models were used to compute the weighted mean difference for continuous variables and the risk ratio for binary variables. Results: Twenty-four RCTs (10,031 dialysis patients) were identified. Besides lowering effects on calcium, phosphate, and PTH, cinacalcet significantly reduced bone resorptive marker (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b) but unaltered bone formation markers (bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). Cinacalcet also resulted in significant higher risk of hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cinacalcet significantly lowered serum FGF-23 level, although unaltered all-cause mortalities. Conclusions: Use of cinacalcet in dialysis patients improves several CKD-MBD-related surrogate markers. However, the benefit on all-cause mortalities was not demonstrated.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; kidney, biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Nephrology, Urology, Physiology (medical)"
Sequential extraction and reactive extraction processing of spent coffee grounds: An alternative approach for pretreatment of biodiesel feedstocks and biodiesel production,"Tuntiwiwattanapun N., Tongcumpou C.",2018-07-01,"Biodiesel feedstock, Biodiesel production, Percolator, Reactive extraction, Sequential extraction, Sequential process, Situ transesterification, Spent coffee grounds, Biodiesel, In-situ transesterification, Percolator, Sequential process, Spent coffee grounds","An alternative approach to producing biodiesel from spent coffee grounds (SCGs) has been developed with methanol washing applied as a pretreatment step, followed by in-situ transesterification. Under optimal conditions, methanol washing was able to reduce the high acid value of SCGs to 0.78 mg KOH g−1 with a negligible loss of their oil content, which ended up being 11.43% by mass. Pretreated SCGs were then directly treated with a potassium methoxide solution and isopropanol as co-solvents in the in-situ transesterification process. A central composited rotatable design was applied to determine the optimal conditions for KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol. The results showed that both KOH concentration and proportion of isopropanol had significant effects on the biodiesel yields, residual triglyceride in the biodiesel, and extraction performance (p-value <0.05). The optimal conditions were provided by KOH concentration of 2.5 g in a 100 mL mixture of methanol and 25% volume of isopropanol, using 2.7 mL of the reagent to 1 g of SCGs at 30 °C for 2 h. Under these conditions, 88.8% biodiesel yield (i.e., 102 mg of biodiesel per 1 g of SCGs), with a less than 0.1% mass of residual triglycerides in the biodiesel, was achieved.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology; energygy, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science
Effectiveness of voriconazole and corneal cross-linking on Phialophora verrucosa keratitis: A case report,"Taechajongjintana M., Kasetsuwan N., Reinprayoon U., Sawanwattanakul S., Pisuchpen P.",2018-08-19,"Antifungal Agents, Corneal Diseases, Corneal Injuries, Eye Infections, Fungal, Humans, Keratitis, Male, Middle Aged, Phialophora, Voriconazole, Corneal cross-linking, Fungal keratitis, Phialophora verrucosa, Voriconazole","Background: We report a rare case of Phialophora verrucosa fungal keratitis, which required various types of treatment according to the intractable natural history of the disease. Case presentation: A 51-year-old Thai man with poorly controlled diabetes received a bamboo branch injury and developed a perforated corneal lesion on his left eye. A pathological study from therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty showed fungal hyphae. This was later identified as Phialophora verrucosa by polymerase chain reaction. This organism was aggressive and recalcitrant because it relapsed with two corneal grafts and was resistant to amphotericin B, natamycin, and itraconazole. However, we found that the efficacy of voriconazole was promising for treating Phialophora verrucosa. We also used corneal cross-linking to establish corneal integrity after the infection was under control. Conclusions: Because of the chronic nature of Phialophora verrucosa, a patient's first visit may occur many years after trauma, and sometimes clinical presentation might not appear to indicate fungal infection. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed in this situation. Voriconazole showed good results in our case. Instead of using a more invasive keratoplasty, we used corneal cross-linking to strengthen the corneal biomechanics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing the benefit of corneal cross-linking to improve corneal biomechanics in resolved Phialophora verrucosa keratitis.",medical,Medicine (all)
