Home-based chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer patients in Thailand: Cost-utility and budget impact analyses,"Kulthanachairojana N., Chansriwong P., Thokanit N.S., Sirilerttrakul S., Wannakansophon N., Taychakhoonavudh S.",2021-02-01,"Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Bevacizumab, Colonic Neoplasms, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Fluorouracil, Follow-Up Studies, Home Care Services, Humans, Leucovorin, Male, Middle Aged, Oxaliplatin, Prognosis, Retrospective Studies, Self-Management, colon cancer, cost-utility analysis, home-based chemotherapy, portable infusion pump","Home-based chemotherapy (HC) is a new treatment alternative to hospital-based chemotherapy treatment (IP) and is administered via portable intravenous pumps at the patient's home. HC reduces the demand for inpatient bed capacity in hospitals and reduces the cost of an infusion. This study takes a societal perspective while conducting the cost-utility and budget impact analyses (BIA) of HC and IP with an mFOLFOX6 regimen on patients with stage III colon cancer. We conducted a cost-utility analysis with a 6-month time horizon. The parameter inputs for the model were gathered from a retrospective cohort study on patients diagnosed with stage III colon cancer at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok. The resource usage of HC and IP was determined based on medical records. The per-unit direct medical, home health service, and adverse events (AE) management costs were gathered from the standard cost list. The health outcome of treatment was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years. Disutility related to AE was calculated. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the uncertainty results and performed BIA based on the societal perspective on a 1-year time horizon. HC provided a cost-saving of $1,513.37 per patient for the period of treatment. Thus, assuming 526 patients per year, the use of HC could achieve a cumulative annual cost-saving of $828,436. HC is a cost-saving strategy compared to IP for stage III colon cancer treatment. We recommend that the service reimbursement should include national standardization in chemotherapy regimens as well as practice guidelines and protocols to prevent serious AEs.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cancer Research"
Factors Associated with the Incidence and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 126-million Cases: A Meta-analysis,"Phannajit J., Takkavatakarn K., Katavetin P., Asawavichienjinda T., Tungsanga K., Praditpornsilpa K., Eiam-Ong S., Susantitaphong P.",2021-09-01,"Australia, COVID-19, Europe, Humans, Incidence, SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus disease-19, epidemiology, health system, incidence, mortality, pandemics","OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the current global incidence and mortality of COVID-19 and also explored the associated factors including geographic variations, transmission scenarios, country economic status, and healthcare performance. METHODS: The search was conducted in online databases based on reports from national authorities by March 28, 2021. Random-effects model meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were used to generate summary estimates and explored sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 125,704,789 reported by 216 countries. The pooled Daily Cumulative Index (DCI) was 1423.87 cases/day which was highest in South America (2759.15 cases/day) followed by North America (2252.49 cases/day), Europe (1858.44 cases/day), Asia (1484.84 cases/day), Africa (193.09 cases/day), and Australia/Oceania (18.55 cases/day). The overall pooled mortality rate of COVID-19 was 1.53%. Higher income countries and countries with community transmission had higher DCI. By meta-regression, country total health expenditure per capita, percentage of universal health coverage, and total number of tests were associated with higher DCI. On the contrary, country Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita were negatively correlated with mortality rate. CONCLUSION: To date, 216 countries around the world are affected by COVID-19. Higher income, GDP, and countries' investments on heath are associated with higher DCI while higher GDP correlates with lower mortality. Community transmission route have more impact on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19.",medical,Epidemiology
Association between depression and increased risk of readmission in patients with heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kewcharoen J., Tachorueangwiwat C., Kanitsoraphan C., Saowapa S., Nitinai N., Vutthikraivit W., Rattanawong P., Banerjee D.",2021-08-01,"Depression, Heart Failure, Hospitalization, Humans, Patient Readmission, Depression, Heart failure, Patient readmission","INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is one of the world leading causes of admission and readmission. Recent studies have shown that the presence of depression is associated with hospital readmission in patients after an index admission for heart failure (HF). However, there is disagreement between published studies regarding this finding. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of depression on readmission rates in HF patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to March 2020. Included studies were published study evaluating readmission rate of HF patients, with and without depression. Data from each study were combined using a random-effects model, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 53,165 patients (6194 patients with depression). The presence of depression was associated with an increased risk of readmission in patients with HF (pooled HR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.22-1.94, P<0.001, I2=55.4%). In a subgroup analysis, depression was associated with an increased risk of readmission in patients with HF in both short-term (<90 days) follow-up (pooled HR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.07¬ 2.85, P=0.025, I2=76.0%) and long-term (>90 days) follow-up (pooled HR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.32-1.90, P<0.001, I2=0.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that depression is associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission in patients with HF.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Medicine (all)"
Prevalence and Impact of Obesity on Disease-specific Outcomes in a Population-based Cohort of Patients with Ulcerative Colitis,"Johnson A.M., Harmsen W.S., Aniwan S., Tremaine W.J., Abu Dayyeh B.K., Loftus E.V.",2021-11-01,"Adult, Analysis of Variance, Body Mass Index, Cohort Studies, Colitis, Ulcerative, Correlation of Data, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Obesity, Outcome Assessment, Health Care, Prevalence, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], obesity, Ulcerative colitis[UC]","Background and Aims: There remains a historical misconception that inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients are underweight. However, recent data suggest rates of obesity in IBD parallel to those of the general population. The impact obesity has on the natural history of IBD is unclear. We aimed to determine obesity rates at the time of IBD diagnosis in a population-based cohort of ulcerative colitis [UC] patients. Methods: Chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with UC over 1970-2010. Data were collected on demographics, body mass index [BMI], disease characteristics, IBD-specific hospitalisations, intestinal resection, and corticosteroid use. The proportion of patients who were obese at the time of their diagnosis was evaluated over time, and survival free of IBD-related complications was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: A total of 417 adults were diagnosed with UC over 1970-2010, 55.4% of whom were classified as either overweight [34.8%] or obese [20.6%]. The prevalence of obesity increased 2-3-fold over the 40-year study period. Obese patients had a 72% increased risk of hospitalisation (hazard ratio [HR],1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.71; p = 0.018) when compared with normal weight patients. Additionally, with each incremental increase in BMI by 1 kg/m2, the risk of hospitalisation increased by 5% [HR,1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.008] and risk of corticosteroid use increased by 2.6% [HR,1.026; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; p = 0.05]. Conclusions: The prevalence of obesity in the UC population is increasing and may have negative prognostic implications, specifically regarding risk of future hospitalisation and corticosteroid use. Additional prospective studies are necessary to more clearly define these associations.","gastroenterology, medical",Medicine (all)
Prevalence and risk of residual viremia after ART in low- and middle-income countries A cross-sectional study,"Gatechompol S., Zheng L., Bao Y., Avihingsanon A., Kerr S.J., Kumarasamy N., Hakim J.G., Maldarelli F., Gorelick R.J., Welker J.L., Lifson J.D., Hosseinipour M.C., Eron J.J., Ruxrungtham K.",2021-01-01,"Adult, Anti-Retroviral Agents, Cross-Sectional Studies, Developing Countries, Female, HIV Infections, Humans, Logistic Models, Male, Prevalence, Retrospective Studies, Viremia, HIV molecular and monitoring core gag single copy assay, HIV-1, lowand middle-income countries, prevalence, residual viremia, risk factors","In order to design effective strategies to eradicate the HIV, an understanding of persistent viral reservoirs is needed. Many studies have demonstrated HIV residual viremia prevalence in high income countries, data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are limited. We assessed the prevalence, and factors associated with residual viremia in people with HIV (PWH), who were virally-suppressed on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in LMIC. We also compared residual viremia prevalence between the LMIC and US. This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study that utilized stored specimen samples from the AIDS clinical trials group (ACTG) studies A5175 and A5208. The last available sample among participants with plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL for ≥3 years were tested by the HIV molecular and monitoring core gag (HMMCgag) single copy assay (SCA). Residual viremia was defined as detectable if ≥1 copy/mL. Spearman’s correlation and multivariable stepwise logistic regression were used to assess associations of various factors with SCA. A total of 320 participants, 246 (77%) from LMIC and 74 (23%) from US, were analyzed. Median (IQR) age was 33 (2840) years; baseline CD4 166 (88,230) cells/mm3; HIV RNA 5.0 (4.5, 5.3) log10 copies/mL; duration of viral suppression 3.4 (3.1, 4.0) years and 48% were male. In 85 participants with information available, 53% were subtype C, 42% subtype B and 5% other subtypes. Overall prevalence of residual viremia was 57% [95% CI, 52–63] with 51% [40–63] in US and 59% [53–65] in LMIC. Among participants with detectable SCA, the median (IQR) HIV RNA was 3.8 (2.2, 8.1) copies/mL. The multivariable model conducted in LMIC participants showed that higher baseline HIV RNA was associated with detectable residual RNA (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8, 4.6 for every log10 increase, P < .001). After including both US and LMIC in the final model, baseline HIV RNA remained significant. No difference in SCA detestability was found between US and LMIC sites (OR 1.1 [0.6, 2.0], P = .72) after adjusting for baseline RNA and parent study. The prevalence of residual viremia between both groups were not different and more than half of the participants had detectable viremia.

Facile preparation protocol of magnetic mesoporous carbon acid catalysts via soft-template self-assembly method and their applications in conversion of xylose into furfural,"Toumsri P., Auppahad W., Saknaphawuth S., Pongtawornsakun B., Kaowphong S., Dechtrirat D., Panpranot J., Chuenchom L.",2021-11-01,"Acid catalyst, Carbon acid, Facile preparation, Furfural, Magnetic mesoporous carbons, Mesoporous carbon, Self-assembly method, Soft template, Soft-template self-assembly, ]+ catalyst, acid catalyst, furfural, magnetic, mesoporous carbon, soft-template self-assembly, xylose","Furfural is a valuable dehydration product of xylose. It has a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Various catalysts containing SO 3 H have been reported for the conversion of xylose into furfural. Nevertheless, the multi-step preparation is tedious, and the catalysts are usually fine powders that are difficult to separate from the suspension. Novel magnetic mesoporous carbonaceous materials (Fe/MC) were successfully prepared via facile self-assembly in a single step. A facile subsequent hydrothermal sulfonation of Fe/MC with concentrated H 2 SO 4 at 180°C gave mesoporous carbon bearing SO 3 H groups (SO 3 H@Fe/MC) without loss of the magnetic properties. Various techniques were employed to characterize the SO 3 H@Fe/MC as a candidate catalyst. It showed strong magnetism due to its Fe particles and possessed a 243 m 2 g -1 BET-specific surface area and a 90% mesopore volume. The sample contained 0.21 mmol g -1 of SO 3 H and gave a high conversion and an acceptable furfural yield and selectivity (100%, 45% and 45%, respectively) when used at 170°C for 1 h with γ-valerolactone as solvent. The catalyst was easily separated after the catalytic tests by using a magnet, confirming sufficient magneticstability.

Luminescence characterization of Mn-doped LiMgPO4 synthesized using different precursors,"Sronsri C., Sittipol W., U-yen K.",2021-05-01,"Cell volume, Different precursors, Luminescent property, Newberyite, Precipitation methods, Surface area, Synthesis temperatures, Thermal synthesis, Mn-doped mineral, Phosphor, Photoluminescence, Physical property, Thermal synthesis","In the present study, precipitation method was used to synthesize three Mn-doped minerals, namely, dittmarite, struvite, and newberyite, and LiMg0.74Mn0.26PO4 phosphor was prepared through thermal synthesis using each of the afore-mentioned minerals as a precursor. Slight changes in the X-ray diffraction positions in the Mn-dopants validated that the pure-doped phase resulted in the changes in cell volumes and lattice parameters, which demonstrated that the Mn-dopants retained the undoped crystal structures. Photoluminescence (PL) of the phosphors derived from different precursors was examined under various conditions, in terms of physical and luminescent properties. The observed PL was dependent on the surface area, synthesis temperature, particle size, and crystallite size. The energy gap (Eg) value for LiMg0.74Mn0.26PO4 synthesized at 900 ​°C was also determined (5.492 ​eV), and was observed to be slightly decreased compared to the corresponding value for LiMgPO4 (5.60 ​eV). Moreover, the Eg value for LiMg0.74Mn0.26PO4 obtained at 800 ​°C (5.416 ​eV) indicated that higher synthesis temperature resulted in a higher Eg value, from which it could be concluded that Eg restriction could have initiated because of the ratio between the surface areas and the volume of the sample. As expected, the highest PL performance was obtained when Mn-doped newberyite was used as a precursor.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Immunoglobulin G1 subclass responses can be used to detect specific allergy to the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in atopic dogs,"Khantavee N., Chanthick C., Tungtrongchitr A., Techakriengkrai N., Suradhat S., Sookrung N., Roytrakul S., Prapasarakul N.",2021-12-01,"Allergens, Animals, Dermatitis, Atopic, Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dog Diseases, Dogs, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Immunoglobulin E, Immunoglobulin G, Male, Skin Tests, Antibody, Biomarker, Canine atopic dermatitis, House dust mites, Immunoglobulin G1 subclass","Background: In dogs with atopic dermatitis, intradermal testing (IDT) or allergen specific IgE serological testing are routinely employed to identify causative allergens. These allergens can then be used for allergen-specific immunotherapy and allergy management. The clinical relevance of this testing is affected by the source of allergen, and other biomarkers that are more related to specific allergens still need to be identified. The aim of this study was to investigate levels of specific IgE, total IgG, and IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses against the local house dust mites (HDM) Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) and D. pteronyssinus (DP) as biomarkers by using in-house ELISAs in healthy (n = 33) and atopic dogs (AD) (n = 44) that were either positive or negative by IDT to HDM. Results: Being over 3 years of age was a risk factor for AD (Odds Ratio (OD) = 4.10, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.57–10.75, p = 0.0049), but there was no relation to IDT outcomes (OR = 0.9091, 95% CI 0.22–3.74, p = 1.00). High levels of all antibody isotypes (IgE, IgG, IgG1 and IgG2) against HDM were found in aged healthy dogs (> 3 years old). In AD, HDM-IgE and IgG1 levels were higher in dogs that were IDT positive to HDM than in IDT negative animals. Levels of IgE and IgG1 could be used to distinguish the specific allergens, whereas total IgG and IgG2 levels were not different between IDT-positive and IDT-negative AD. By the receiver operating characteristic curve at a false-positive rate = 0.10, both IgE and IgG1 showed better sensitivity than IgG and IgG2. Similar to IgE, serum IgG1 concentration was also relevant to IDT outcomes. Conclusions: Our in-house ELISAs coated with local HDM were useful for evaluating antibody levels, and we propose use of the HDM-specific IgG1 subclass as a biomarker to detect HDM specific allergens in AD, potentially together with an IgE based platform.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
Prominent indomethacin-induced enteropathy in fcgriib defi-cient lupus mice: an impact of macrophage responses and immune deposition in gut,"Bhunyakarnjanarat T., Udompornpitak K., Saisorn W., Chantraprapawat B., Visitchanakun P., Dang C.P., Issara-Amphorn J., Leelahavanichkul A.",2021-02-01,"Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, Disease Models, Animal, Endotoxemia, Enterocolitis, Female, Gene Deletion, Indomethacin, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Macrophage Activation, Macrophages, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Receptors, IgG, FcgRIIb deficient mice, Gut leakage, NSAIDs-enteropathy, Systemic lupus erythematosus","A high dose of NSAIDs, a common analgesic, might induce lupus activity through several NSAIDs adverse effects including gastrointestinal permeability defect (gut leakage) and endotoxemia. Indomethacin (25 mg/day) was orally administered for 7 days in 24-wk-old Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient (FcgRIIb-/-) mice, an asymptomatic lupus model (increased anti-dsDNA without lupus nephritis), and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Severity of indomethacin-induced enteropathy in FcgRIIb-/-mice was higher than WT mice as demonstrated by survival analysis, intestinal injury (histology, immune-deposition, and intestinal cytokines), gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay and endotoxemia), serum cytokines, and lupus characteristics (anti-dsDNA, renal injury, and proteinuria). Prominent responses of FcgRIIb-/-macrophages toward lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to WT cells due to the expression of only activating-FcgRs without inhibitory-FcgRIIb were demonstrated. Extracellular flux analysis indicated the greater mitochondria activity (increased respiratory capacity and respiratory reserve) in FcgRIIb-/-macrophages with a concordant decrease in glycolysis activity when compared to WT cells. In conclusion, gut leakage-induced endotoxemia is more severe in indomethacin-administered FcgRIIb-/-mice than WT, possibly due to the enhanced indomethacin toxicity from lupus-induced intestinal immune-deposition. Due to a lack of inhibitory-FcgRIIb expression, mitochondrial function, and cytokine production of FcgRIIb-/-macrophages were more prominent than WT cells. Hence, lupus disease-activation from NSAIDs-enteropathy-induced gut leakage is possible.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Different Ni-based catalysts, including Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Re/γ-Al2O3, and Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3, (10%Ni, 5%Cu, 2.5%Re) were used in upgrading of the bio-crude oil. Most catalytic systems could effectively eliminate S and decrease the N and O contents, and enhance more than 20% improvement in the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil (34 to 41–45 MJ/kg). Introducing only Cu could enhance the C[dbnd]O hydrogenation resulting in higher aromatic and alcohol compounds. While the addition of Re is effective for hydrodeoxygenation, it lowers denitrogenation due to amination reaction. Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 ternary alloy offered the best results on the overall performance, achieving the highest upgraded bio-oil yield of 58 wt% and the highest energy recovery in the upgrading process (ERupgrade) of 64.6%. As ER in HTL process (ERHTL) was ca. 71.8%, the overall ER (ERoverall) from algae biomass to upgraded bio-oil of 46.4% can be achieved for Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Carbon efficiency approx. 47.7% can be attained as the carbon in the algae biomass feedstock was retained in the upgraded bio-oil.

Selective detection of cortisol based on a label-free electrochemical assay was achieved by specific recognition of the cortisol DNA aptamer (CApt). The CApt was modified with streptavidin magnetic beads (MBs) before simple immobilization onto the electrode surface using a neodymium magnet. The electrochemical behavior of the aptamer-based biosensor was assessed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (vs Ag/AgCl). The specific binding between cortisol and CApt resulted in a decrease in charge transfer resistance (Rct) from EIS using [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− with increasing cortisol concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.10 to 100 ng/mL with a low detection limit (3SD/slope) of 2.1 pg/mL was obtained. Furthermore, the proposed biosensing system exhibited a satisfactory recovery in the range 97.4–109.2% with 5.7–6.6% RSD in spiked artificial human sweat. Regarding the applications of this tool, the aptamer-based biosensor has potential to be a versatile and point-of-care (POC) device for simple, sensitive, selective, disposable, and low-cost cortisol detection.

Nevertheless, membrane fouling in AnMBRs has been a major concern. In this study, the surfaces of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were modified with tannic acid (TA) and Cu(II) at various molar ratios of TA to Cu(II), including 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. The hydrophilicity, morphology, chemical structure, elemental composition, and antibacterial properties of the unmodified and modified membranes were analyzed using water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX), and the clear zone method, respectively. The modified membrane with a TA-to-Cu(II) molar ratio of 1:3 had high hydrophilicity with certain antibacterial properties; therefore, it was selected to be further tested in an AnMBR along with an unmodified membrane. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of the unmodified membrane and modified membrane were 92.2 ± 3.6% and 91.8 ± 4.0%, respectively. The modified membrane had higher permeability after backwashing with less chemical cleaning (CC) than the unmodified membrane. Surface modification with TA and Cu(II) appeared to reduce irreversible fouling on the membranes.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The sensing performance and the coupling properties of designed sensor are numerically analyzed by using a full vectorial finite element method (FEM) incorporating amplitude and wavelength interrogation techniques in the detection range varied from ${n_a}$ = 1.330-1.350. The maximum wavelength and amplitude sensitivity are obtained of 13700 nm/RIU and 1026 RIU-1, respectively. Here, the Ag-graphene composite nanowire can not only solve the problem of oxidation but also enhances the sensitivity of the sensor. In addition of high sensitivity, it also provides better performance than other sensing devices based on similar technologies such as Ag nanowire-filled sensors. Moreover, the influences of polishing depth (D), nanowire radius (rn), graphene layer (Lg) and channel size (s) on the designed sensor, are also thoroughly investigated here. The present work can provide a base for designing a real-time, highly sensitivity, remote sensing, and distributed SPR based RI sensor.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The governing equations of the bulk layers and the material surface/interfaces were formulated from linear elasticity and Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theories, respectively. The SBFE formulation was established in a general context to handle both homogenous and functionally graded bulk materials. Enforcing the continuity of the displacements and tractions along the material interfaces together with the surface/interface equations resulted in a system of non-homogeneous, linear, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the unknown nodal functions of the layer medium. A general solution of the final system of ODEs was constructed via a standard procedure and then used to form a system of linear algebraic equations governing the nodal boundary data.

Resurfacing receptor binding domain of Colicin N to enhance its cytotoxic effect on human lung cancer cells,"Arunmanee W., Duangkaew M., Taweecheep P., Aphicho K., Lerdvorasap P., Pitchayakorn J., Intasuk C., Jiraratmetacon R., Syamsidi A., Chanvorachote P., Chaotham C., Pornputtapong N.",2021-01-01,"Anticancer, Bacteriocins, Cancer cells, Colicins, Cytotoxic effects, Gram-negative bacteria, Human lung cancer cells, Pore forming toxins, Protein resurfacing, Receptor-binding domains, Anticancer, Colicin, Pore forming toxin, Protein resurfacing","Colicin N (ColN) is a bacteriocin secreted by Escherichia coli (E. coli) to kill other Gram-negative bacteria by forcefully generating ion channels in the inner membrane. In addition to its bactericidal activity, ColN have been reported to selectively induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells via the suppression of integrin modulated survival pathway. However, ColN showed mild toxicity against human lung cancer cells which could be improved for further applications. The protein resurfacing strategy was chosen to engineer ColN by extensive mutagenesis at solvent­-exposed residues on ColN. The highly accessible Asp and Glu on wild­type ColN (ColNWT) were replaced by Lys to create polycationic ColN (ColN+12). Previous studies have shown that increase of positive charges on proteins leads to the enhancement of mammalian cell penetration as well as increased interaction with negatively charged surface of cancer cells. Those solvent­-exposed residues of ColN were identified by Rosetta and AvNAPSA (Average number of Neighboring Atoms Per Side­chain Atom) approaches. The findings revealed that the structural features and stability of ColN+12 determined by circular dichroism were similar to ColNWT. Furthermore, the toxicity of ColN+12 was cancer ­selective. Human lung cancer cells, H460 and H23, were sensitive to ColN but human dermal papilla cells were not. ColN+12 also showed more potent toxicity than ColNWT in cancer cells. This confirmed that polycationic resurfacing method has enabled us to improve the anticancer activity of ColN towards human lung cancer cells.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, computer science","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Computer Science Applications"
Modifications of the wetting characteristics of electrodeposited porous copper by controlling the plating parameters and storage conditions,"Eltigani H., Boonyongmaneerat Y.",2021-11-01,"Engineering applications, Hydrogen bubbles, Hydrophobic and hydrophilic, Plating parameters, Porous structures, Storage condition, Wetting behavior, Wetting characteristics, Electrodeposition, Porous copper, Storage conditions, Wettability","The wetting behavior of copper is important for many engineering applications. The present study demonstrates a method to modify the wetting characteristics of copper surfaces by developing porous structures via the promotion of hydrogen bubbles and rapid and nonuniform growth of the deposits. The porous copper deposits are fabricated with various controlled plating parameters, and subsequently stored in different conditions, including air, water, and saline solution, to assess the possible influence of the storage conditions on the wetting behavior. The study shows that the wetting angles can be tailored by electrodeposition parameters, namely, plating bath formulation and applied current density, which influence the morphology of the porous structure. The storage conditions are found to largely affect the wetting behavior, owing to their influence on surface morphology and surface chemistry. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics are developed in the copper deposits stored in air and in the saline solution, respectively.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, physics","Structural Biology, Materials Science (all), Physics and Astronomy (all), Cell Biology"

Since there can be a lot of user reviews, it is cumbersome for the mobile development team to go through all user reviews to identify which ones contain useful information for further maintenance and evolution. This paper proposes an initial attempt to facilitate the maintenance and evolution process of a mobile development team by automating the generation of functional requirements from mobile application user reviews on the App Store and Play Store. Specifically, these functional requirements serve as change requirements for maintaining existing functions of the application or enhancing the application with new functions. The proposed approach is based on machine learning and natural language processing and consists of three steps. Firstly, user reviews that identify functional requirements are classified by text classification algorithms. Secondly, since some user reviews may address the same issues, distinct user reviews are identified by clustering techniques and text similarity. Finally, relevant information is extracted from the user reviews to generate functional requirements based on user review patterns and requirement boilerplates. In an evaluation, the generated functional requirements obtained moderate to high scores in terms of readability, unambiguity, completeness, and validity. The proposed approach can help the development team identify functional requirements from direct feedback of the users which should be considered and further refined in the maintenance and evolution of the mobile application.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Software, Information Systems and Management, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"
Hybrid deep learning based on a heterogeneous network profile for functional annotations of plasmodium falciparum genes,"Suratanee A., Plaimas K.",2021-09-01,"Algorithms, Deep Learning, Humans, Plasmodium falciparum, Protozoan Proteins, Functional annotations, Heterogeneous network, Hybrid deep learning, Protein network profiles","Functional annotation of unknown function genes reveals unidentified functions that can enhance our understanding of complex genome communications. A common approach for inferring gene function involves the ortholog-based method. However, genetic data alone are often not enough to provide information for function annotation. Thus, integrating other sources of data can potentially increase the possibility of retrieving annotations. Network-based methods are efficient techniques for exploring interactions among genes and can be used for functional inference. In this study, we present an analysis framework for inferring the functions of Plasmodium falciparum genes based on connection profiles in a heterogeneous network between human and Plasmodium falcipa-rum proteins. These profiles were fed into a hybrid deep learning algorithm to predict the orthologs of unknown function genes. The results show high performance of the model’s predictions, with an AUC of 0.89. One hundred and twenty-one predicted pairs with high prediction scores were se-lected for inferring the functions using statistical enrichment analysis. Using this method, PF3D7_1248700 and PF3D7_0401800 were found to be involved with muscle contraction and stri-ated muscle tissue development, while PF3D7_1303800 and PF3D7_1201000 were found to be related to protein dephosphorylation. In conclusion, combining a heterogeneous network and a hybrid deep learning technique can allow us to identify unknown gene functions of malaria parasites. This approach is generalized and can be applied to other diseases that enhance the field of biomedical science.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

It remains unclear if initiating ART during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) uniformly improves cognitive outcomes.Methods:Sixty-seven individuals (96% men, median age 28 years) initiated ART immediately after AHI diagnosis and maintained viral suppression for 6 years. They underwent a four-test neuropsychological battery that measured fine motor speed and dexterity, psychomotor speed, and executive functioning at baseline (pre-ART AHI), weeks 12, 24 and 96, and annually thereafter through week 288. Performances were standardized to calculate an overall (NPZ-4) score and frequencies of impaired cognitive performance (≤-1 SD on at least two tests, or ≤-2 SD on at least one test). Group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) was applied to identify distinct neuropsychological trajectories modelled from baseline to week 288. Posthoc analyses examined HIV-1 and demographic factors that differed between trajectory subgroups.Results:NPZ-4 scores improved from baseline to week 96 (P < 0.001) and from weeks 96 to 288 (P < 0.001), with frequencies of impaired performance of 30, 6 and 2% at the respective time-points. The amplitude of NPZ-4 improvement throughout the period was more than 0.5 SD and beyond practice effects. GBTA identified three NPZ-4 trajectory subgroups that all showed improvement over-time. The subgroup with lowest baseline performance exhibited worse depressive symptoms at baseline (P = 0.04) and the largest improvement among the three. HIV-1 indices did not differ between the subgroups.Conclusion:Cognitive performance improved in a sustained and stable manner after initiating ART during AHI.

AChE was partially purified using hydroxyapatite and chromatography columns. The specific characteristics of AChE were studied by western blot using commercial polyclonal antibody (Rabbit anti-Fish AChE). It was found that the protein band had a molecular weight of 71 kDa. After mice were injected with AChE 4 times, the spleen showed a response to the induction. Polyclonal B cells from the mouse's spleen were taken and fused with myeloma cells to produce hybrid cells. After two fusions were performed, the clones specific to AChE were selected by dot blot, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques. Two clones, ACHE 33 and ACHE 99, which had the isotype of IgM were found. These two produced monoclonal antibodies specific to AChE in both denatured and native forms. The ACHE 33 monoclonal antibody clone from hybrid catfish could be cross-react with two commercial freshwater fishes, Nile tilapia and climbing perch, based on dot blot, immunohistochemistry, and western blot techniques. Moreover, AChE in Nile tilapia and climbing perch with glyphosate- based herbicide exposure gave a positive result with ACHE 33 as protein with molecular weight of 66 kDa. Based on our results, the produced monoclonal antibody showed specificity and could be applied to test AChE expression to assess glyphosate-based herbicide contamination in hybrid catfish, Nile tilapia and climbing perch.

Several studies have investigated the impact of organizational agility on the performance of organizations. However, few studies have explored the impact of the organizational agility of new product development (NPD) teams during the process of NPD on the performance of new products. Additionally, the process of increasing the effectiveness of organizational agility with innovativeness during the NPD process lacks empirical examination. Based on the concept of dynamic capabilities, this article presents a framework to explain the antecedents and consequences of the mediator (organizational agility of product development teams). The moderating role of innovativeness in the NPD process is also proposed. The findings reveal that the organizational agility is important to the firm's successful product innovation because it improves the effectiveness of the fuzzy front end (FFE) in the NPD process. The agility of the development team can be increased by top management support and learning organization. In addition, innovativeness positively moderates the effect of organizational agility on managing FFE. Altogether, these findings provide implications for proficiently managing FFE in the NPD process.","fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Strategy and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The etiology of IBS is not completely understood, but diet appears to play an important role in its pathophysiology. Asian diets differ considerably from those in Western countries, which might explain differences in the prevalence, sex, and clinical presentation seen between patients with IBS in Asian and Western countries. Dietary regimes such as a low-fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet and the modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) diet improve both symptoms and the quality of life in a considerable proportion of IBS patients. It has been speculated that diet is a prebiotic for the intestinal microbiota and favors the growth of certain bacteria. These bacteria ferment the dietary components, and the products of fermentation act upon intestinal stem cells to influence their differentiation into enteroendocrine cells. The resulting low density of enteroendocrine cells accompanied by low levels of certain hormones gives rise to intestinal dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal secretion. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that changing to a low-FODMAP diet restores the density of GI cells to the levels in healthy subjects. These changes in gut endocrine cells caused by low-FODMAP diet are also accompanied by improvements in symptoms and the quality of life.",medical,Gastroenterology

Of these isolates, Vibrio campbellii strain FS5 was one of the two most highly inhibited bacteria at all crude oil concentrations. This bacterium showed a decrease in luminescence intensity of between 10.7 and 80.2% after a 15-min exposure to 0.0001–10 mg/L of crude oil. The degree of bioluminescence inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of crude oil. The presence of crude oil at all concentrations had negative effects on the log bioluminescence per log number of viable cells after 15- to 105-min exposure. About 10 to 100 times, lower half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values were observed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than those for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). In the presence of each individual BTEX and PAH, the bioluminescence inhibition increased with increasing exposure time (1–32 h). This indigenous bacterium can be used as a simple and general indicator of oil contamination and its impact on coastal waters as well as for assessing potential toxicity during oil bioremediation.","fluidex; related topics, regional and genergyal, environmental","Environmental Science (all), Pollution, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

However, there are limited data on patient selection and how to better predict toxicities or outcomes. Indexes used in patients with DLBCL, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI and age-adjusted IPI [aaIPI]) and in transplantation recipients, such as the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), have not been evaluated in this setting. Here we evaluated 4 indices— IPI, aaIPI, HCT-CI, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)—and their associations with early CAR T cell related-toxicities and outcomes. We demonstrated an association between high-risk IPI or aaIPI and inferior PFS in patients with R/R DLBCL treated with CAR T cell therapy. We also found an association between aaIPI and IPI with OS and neurotoxicity, respectively. CCI was not associated with toxicities or outcomes, and owing to the small sample size, we could not draw a conclusion regarding associations with the HCT-CI. Both the IPI and aaIPI are widely used tools that can now provide better information to guide selection of patients who would best benefit from CD19 CAR T cell therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Molecular Medicine, Hematology, Cell Biology, Transplantation"

Recently, calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3), a minus-end microtubule-stabilizing protein, has received increasing attention in cancer cell biology. However, the biological role of CAMSAP3 on senescence in human lung cancer remains incompletely understood. Methods: The function of CAMSAP3 on the regulation of cellular senescence-associated phenotypes in human non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells were determined in CAMSAP3 deletion (H460/C3ko) cells. The effects of CAMSAP3 on cell proliferation were investigated using MTT and colony formation assays. The cell cycle activity was evaluated by flow cytometry and the senescence-associated phenotypes were observed by SA-β-Gal staining. Quantitative RT-PCR and westen blot were used to evaluate the expression of cell cycle and senescence markers. Moreover, the interaction of CAMSAP3-ERK1/2 and possible partner protein was quantified using immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence. Lastly, an xenograft model were performed. Results: CAMSAP3 knockout promotes lung cancer cell senescence-associated phenotypes and induces G1 cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic investigation revealed that phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was markedly downregulated in CAMSAP3-deleted cells, suppressing cyclin D1 expression levels, and full-length CAMSAP3 abrogated these phenotypes. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, is required as a scaffold for CAMSAP3-modulating ERK signaling. Furthermore, an in vivo tumor xenograft experiment showed that tumor initiation is potentially delayed in CAMSAP3 knockout tumors with the downregulation of p-ERK and cyclin D1, resulting in a senescence-like phenotype. Conclusion: This study is the first to report an intriguing role of CAMSAP3 in lung carcinoma cell senescence-associated phenotypes via the modulation of p-ERK/cyclin D1 signaling.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cancer Research"

Nevertheless, the influence of the TGN series of compounds on the binding and permeation behaviors of an Aβ monomer to the cell membranes was not elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of compounds in the TGN series on the behavior of an Aβ monomer regarding its toxicity toward the bilayer lipid membrane using molecular dynamics (MD) simula-tion. MD simulations suggest that TGN4 is a potential agent that can interfere with the movement of the Aβ monomer into the membrane. The MM-GBSA result demonstrated that TGN4 exhibits the highest affinity to the Aβ1–42 monomer but has the lowest affinity to the bilayer. Moreover, TGN4 also contributes to a decrease in the binding affinity between the Aβ1–42 monomer and the POPC membrane. Regarding the results of the binding mode and conformational analyses, a high number of amino-acid residues were shown to provide the binding interactions between TGN4 and the Aβ1– 42 monomer. TGN4 also reduces the conformational transition of the Aβ1–42 monomer by means of interacting with the monomer. The present study presents molecular-level insights into how the TGN series of compounds affect the membrane adsorption and the conformational transition of the Aβ1–42 monomer, which could be valuable for the further development of new anti-Alzheimer agents.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

In this work, SPIONs are of our interest as directing agents to the targeted dendritic cells (DCs). Mannan extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as DCs targeting moieties. Herein, nanocomposites of silica magnetic nanoparticle-mannan (S-SPION-MN) were successfully synthesized as a magnetically assisted delivery system. The materials before Silica magnetic nanoparticles (S-SPION) and after mannan modification were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer to confirm their superparamagnetic character. The change in zeta potential from highly negative charge to slightly negative charge of the composites suggested the successful attachment of mannan on their surface. Chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the attachment of mannan through chemical bonding, corresponding to the observation of high stability of the particles over a two-week period. The synthesized materials were investigated for cytotoxicity, DC maturation, cytokine production, and cellular uptake. Moderate cell viability was observed after stimulating cells with the particulate mannan, S-SPION-MN, due to high activation of DCs. Under a magnetic induction, S-SPION-MN showed significant enhancement of DCs targeting within 15 min. Owing to the incorporation of mannan and SPIONs, the S-SPION-MN greatly enhanced cellular uptake and accordingly resulted in high DC activation and maturation. The resulted nanocomposites can be beneficial as a potential candidate in antigen delivery to targeted immune cells for further in vivo study.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies and specific autoantibodies in juvenile and adult systemic lupus erythematosus patients,"Rodsaward P., Chottawornsak N., Suwanchote S., Rachayon M., Deekajorndech T., Wright H.L., Edwards S.W., Beresford M.W., Rerknimitr P., Chiewchengchol D.",2021-12-01,"Adult, Antibodies, Antinuclear, Autoantibodies, Child, Humans, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Retrospective Studies, anti-double stranded DNA, antinuclear antibodies, autoantibodies, autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus","Background: Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and adult SLE (ASLE) patients present with different clinical manifestations, but it is unknown if there are differences in their antinuclear autoantibody (ANA) profiles or if staining patterns are associated with specific autoantibodies and clinical manifestations. Objective: To determine whether distinct types and numbers of ANA-staining patterns are associated with specific autoantibodies and clinical manifestations in JSLE and ASLE patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in Thai children (n = 146) and adults (n = 180) diagnosed with SLE using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria. Results: JSLE patients with a homogeneous pattern of staining and anti-dsDNA or anti-nucleosome antibodies in serum, developed renal involvement, leukopenia and acute/subacute cutaneous LE. Coarse speckled pattern with anti-RNP or anti-Sm showed thrombocytopenia and renal involvement in JSLE patients, but leukopenia in both groups. JSLE patients with fine-coarse speckled pattern and anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro-52 or anti-SSA developed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and renal involvement, whilst hemolytic anemia and serositis were commonly found in those with anti-Ro-52. Median SLEDAI score was higher in JSLE than ASLE patients. Conclusion: Detailed ANA-staining patterns with specific autoantibodies show particular clinical manifestations and hence prompt further clinical investigations in both JSLE and ASLE patients. Therefore, this study demonstrates that distinct patterns of ANA staining and specific autoantibodies are clinically important in both children and adults with SLE.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Bacterial nanocellulose (BC) films containing various concentrations of mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) peel extract were prepared and evaluated as a multifunctional nanofiber film. The extract was absorbed into BC hydrogel and air dried to entrap the extract into nanofiber network. The resulting films contained about 3, 35, and 294 mg of total phenolic compounds and 2, 24, and 250 mg of α-mangostin per cm3 of the dried films. The film containing the highest phenolic compounds and α-mangostin performed the inhibitory effect to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. High anticancer activity against B16F10 melanoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells having viabilities of 10 and 5%, respectively after 48 h were detected after the treatments with the film. However, the film had a low toxicity against normal fibroblast and keratinocyte cells with 41 and 99% viability, respectively.

Construction of an exposure-pathway-phenotype in children with depression due to transfusion-dependent thalassemia: Results of (un)supervised machine learning.,"Al-Hakeim H.K., Najm A.H., Moustafa S.R., Maes M.",2021-03-01,"Child, Depression, Humans, Phenotype, Reproducibility of Results, Supervised Machine Learning, Thalassemia, Biomarkers, Inflammation, Major depression, Neuro-immune, Nomothetic network psychiatry, Oxidative stress","Background:: Transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients are treated with continued blood transfusions and show a higher prevalence of depression. TDT with consequent iron overload and inflammation is associated with increased severity of depressive symptoms in TDT children. Aim of the study:: To construct a pathway-phenotype which combines iron overload and neuro-immune biomarkers with depressive symptom subdomains in TDT children. Methods:: We measured iron status parameters (iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation percentage) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α) biomarkers in TDT (n=111) and healthy (n=53) children and analyzed the results using machine learning. Results:: Cluster analysis separated TDT children with depression from those without depression and revealed two depressive subgroups one with low self-esteem and another with increased social-irritability scores. Exploratory factor analysis validated four depressive symptom dimensions as reliable constructs, namely key depressive, physiosomatic, lowered self-esteem and social-irritability dimensions. Partial Least Squares showed that 73.0% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from those four clinical subdomains, immune-inflammatory and iron overload biomarkers was explained by exposure variables including the number of blood transfusions and hospitalizations and use of deferoxamine. The exposure data, iron and immune biomarkers, and symptom subdomains are reflective manifestations of a single latent trait, which shows internal consistency reliability and predictive relevance. Conclusions:: The nomological network combining exposure, pathways and behavioral phenome manifestations provides an index of overall severity and disease risk and, therefore, constitutes a new drug target, indicating that iron overload and immune activation should be targeted to treat depression due to TDT.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; depression, psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) composite films containing three different antibacterial agents; silver zeolite A (AgZA), silver zeolite Y (AgZY) and silver zeolite ZSM-5 (AgZSM-5), at the concentration of 0.5–4%wt were produced by solvent casting and melt extrusion techniques. The effects of processing methods and antibacterial agents on the antibacterial activity, thermal and mechanical properties, including biodegradability of PBS composite films have been investigated. The antibacterial activity results revealed that AgZSM-5/PBS composite films had higher efficiency in antibacterial activity than the films with AgZA and AgZY. AgZSM-5/PBS composite films presented 99.9% of bacterial inhibition even at 0.5%wt of AgZSM-5. Thermal properties of PBS films were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition products of PBS composite films were analysed by pyrolysis/gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (Py/GC–MS). The thermal degradation kinetic of PBS composite films was also studied. The activation energy of PBS composite films degradation was calculated by Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa models, which were decreased as AgZA/PBS > AgZY/PBS > AgZSM-5/PBS. For the Kissinger method, the activation energies of PBS, AgZA/PBS, AgZY/PBS and AgZSM-5/PBS composite films were found to be 303.5, 251.8, 235.3 and 228.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Soil burial test was used to investigate the biodegradable properties of PBS composite films. PBS films were initially biodegraded after a month of soil burial test. PBS films with silver zeolite loading still showed the biodegradable activity after 3 months of soil burial test, although with lower biodegradation rate compared with neat PBS.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Increased high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), an inflammatory mediator, and Dickkopf-related protein (DKK1), a Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonist, affect the blood-brain barrier and induce neurotoxic effects and neurocognitive deficits. Aim: The present study aims to examine HMGB1 and DDK1 in nonresponders to treatments (NRTT) with antipsychotics (n = 60), partial RTT (PRTT, n = 55), and healthy controls (n = 43) in relation to established markers of SCZ, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and CCL11 (eotaxin), and to delineate whether these proteins are associated with the SCZ symptom subdomains and neurocognitive impairments. Results: HMGB1, DKK1, IL-6, and CCL11 were significantly higher in SCZ patients than in controls. DKK1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in NRTT than in PRTT and controls, while IL-10 was higher in NRTT than in controls. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that SCZ was best predicted by increased DDK1 and HMGB1, while NRTT (vs PRTT) was best predicted by increased IL-6 and CCL11 levels. A large part of the variance in psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and negative (PHEMN) symptoms and formal thought disorders was explained by HMGB1, IL-6, and CCL11, while most neurocognitive functions were predicted by HMGB1, DDK1, and CCL11. Conclusions: The neurotoxic effects of HMGB1, DKK1, IL-6, and CCL11 including the effects on the blood-brain barrier and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may cause impairments in executive functions and working, episodic, and semantic memory and explain, in part, PHEMN symptoms and a nonresponse to treatment with antipsychotic drugs.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

It has been hypothesized that due to increased survival chances, preparedness to instantly acquire fear towards evolutionary threats has been hardwired into neural pathways of the primate brain. Here, we compare participants’ fear of snakes according to experience; from those who often deal with snakes and even suffer snakebites to those unfamiliar with snakes. Methods: The Snake Questionnaire-12 (SNAQ-12) and Specific Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) were administered to three groups of participants with a different level of experience with snakes and snakebites: 1) snake experts, 2) firefighters, and 3) college students. Results: This study shows that individuals more experienced with snakes demonstrate lower fear. Moreover, participants who have suffered a snakebite (either venomous or not) score lower on fear of snakes (SNAQ-12), but not of all other potentially phobic stimuli (SPQ). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a harmless benign exposure might immunize people to highly biologically prepared fears of evolutionary threats, such as snakes.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

The total emission of greenhouse gases is called the carbon footprint and is expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) units. As a new educational institution, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) began to take part in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) programme that supports the reduction in carbon emissions. In this study, the total amount of CO2 produced from UTM during 4 years was measured under three categories: (1) the emissions from the fleet of university vehicles for public transportation, (2) the electricity and water emissions, and (3) the emissions produced by staff and student transportation, waste generation, paper, and maintenance by contractors. The special evaluation method is an alternative method to calculate greenhouse gases and measures all elements/sources of greenhouse gases under the same functional unit. This reference helps the assessor to avoid the double measurement of anthropogenic gases. The study results demonstrated that air transportation utilised by university students and employees and electricity usage contributed to 34.74%, 19.37%, and 18.19% of the carbon emissions, respectively. The total CO2 emissions from the three sources over 4 years were 48.442 MT. The data on the carbon footprint of the university can form the basis for monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in Malaysia. Moreover, the university constructed and operates a smart house, a large solar parking lot with a capacity of 10 MW, uses solar and wind-powered lighting, and encourages the use of bicycles and electric scooters to achieve an annual reduction in the total CO2 emissions intensity. The results of this study suggested that a carbon reduction project could encourage university members and public society to an understanding of the environment and allowing UTM to become a centre of excellence for the operation of a green campus for urban areas.

In most currently-available DCA methods, the decline exponent is assumed to be constant during the whole production period. However, production decline of a gas reservoir does not follow exponential (b = 0), hyperbolic (0 < b < 1), or harmonic (b = 1) decline profiles, and instead the value of b varies with production time. Application of current DCA methods to predict future performance yields erroneous results, especially for high-pressure gas reservoirs. The objective of this paper is to propose a new method in which the effect of depletion-related changes in the value of b is taken into account. The new methodology can be applied to analyze the production data from a gas well during the entire boundary dominated production period, allowing Gas Initially-In-Place (G) to be estimated at any stage of that period. The proposed methodology is validated using both synthetic and field examples.","petroleum engineeringneering, hydrocarbons, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"
Toward sustainable stormwater management: Understanding public appreciation and recognition of urban Low Impact Development (LID) in the San Francisco Bay Area,"Darnthamrongkul W., Mozingo L.A.",2021-12-15,"Rain, San Francisco, United States, Urban Renewal, Landscape appreciation, Low impact development (LID), Picturesque aesthetics, San Francisco Bay Area, Stormwater education, Sustainable stormwater management","In the United States, regulators, planners, and designers have promoted Low Impact Development (LID) as a landscape-based approach to better manage urban stormwater for ecological benefits. However, the projects have often failed to achieve positive public responses due to their unattractive and unkempt appearances. This study provides empirical insights into public perception of urban LID practices by studying user reactions to 16 sites located in the San Francisco Bay Area—eight with LID design and eight with conventional landscape design. Most of the 502 respondents, although expressing some misconceptions and limited stormwater knowledge, showed their appreciation and recognition of the LID landscapes. This finding implies that the implementation of new LID facilities can be continued and expanded without serious concern about strong public resistance, and suggests that the design of these existing LID sites can serve as models for the future projects in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with other urban areas. The study confirms the important role of picturesque beauty, naturalness, and neatness in satisfying public expectations, especially for aesthetic and ecological landscapes. Interestingly, interpretive signs appeared to be the preferable means for motivating stormwater education and the powerful means for producing positive public reactions to LID sites, suggesting the potential of urban LID projects as the venues for public education and outreach. The study not only emphasizes the alignment of aesthetics and ecology to enhance public satisfaction, but also promotes the aesthetic qualities and didactic opportunities as the essential components of LID implementation.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental management, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, perception, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

However, it may not completely anesthetize the anterior femoral cutaneous nerve (AFCN). We hypothesized that an AFCN block (AFCNB) in combination with an FTB would decrease pain during movement in the immediate 12 h postoperative period compared with an FTB alone. Methods: Eighty patients scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either FTB alone (FTB group) or AFCNB with FTB (AFCNB + FTB group) as part of the multimodal analgesic regimen. The primary outcome was pain during movement at 12 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, incidence of surgical incision site pain, intravenous morphine consumption, immediate functional performance, patient satisfaction, and length of hospital stay. Results: The NRS pain scores on movement 12 h postoperatively were significantly lower in the AFCNB + FTB group than in the FTB group (mean difference: –2.02, 95% CI: –3.14, –0.89, P < 0.001). The incidence of pain at the surgical incision site at 24 h postoperatively and morphine consumption within 48 h postoperatively were significantly lower (P < 0.001), and quadriceps muscle strength at 0° immediately after surgery was significantly greater in the AFCNB + FTB group (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The addition of ultrasound-guided AFCNB to FTB provided more effective analgesia and decreased opioid requirement compared to FTB alone after total knee arthroplasty and may enhance immediate functional performance on the day of surgery.",medical,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine

The concept of our proposed framework is rather simple as it iteratively applies three Fuzzy TOPSIS models to a set of suppliers-one at a time with respect to one key supply chain performance, each with different numbers of criteria. We have then applied this framework to evaluate the performance of a case study company's suppliers, whose business is related to fuel commercial marketing. We find that among 48 initial criteria, only 24 criteria seem to be relevant: 5, 13, 6 criteria in the cost, quality, and time Fuzzy TOPSIS models, respectively. Additionally, all of the 33 suppliers in this study are regarded as performed in terms of quality, but they may vary in terms of cost and service time. In particular, there are six suppliers requiring improvement on either cost or time metric, and only one supplier that needs attentions regarding cost and service time improvement. These results are in-line with expert's opinions as the company has a very stringent quality monitoring system; but, none exists in terms of cost and service time.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics, sociology","Decision Sciences (miscellaneous), Automotive Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization, Transportation"

Methods: We prospectively studied the DCE-MRI results of 47 patients with newly diagnosed NPC and their pre-treatment plasma EBV DNA levels. We recruited all patients who had undergone MRI (1.5 T) simulation at the radiation therapy department of our institute between January 2018–2019. Regions of interest were drawn at primary tumors, and DCE-MRI parameters, including mean values of Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and Vp, were recorded. Spearman's rank correlation was used to identify significant associations between the DCE-MRI parameters and the plasma EBV DNA level and NPC stages. Mann-Whitney U tests and unpaired t-test were performed to compare the DCE-MRI parameters among different groups and to identify optimal cut-off values using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: We found that the DCE-MRI parameters correlated with the plasma EBV DNA levels and NPC stages. Positive plasma EBV DNA was correlated with lower Kep (optimal cut-off value, 2.1 min−1; area under the curve [AUC], 0.714) and higher Ve (optimal cut-off value, 0.675; AUC, 0.706). Ve higher than 0.765 (AUC, 0.678) was correlated with plasma EBV DNA (≥2300 copies mL−1). Higher Ktrans (cut-off value, 1.495 min−1) was correlated with high-T stage (AUC, 0.767) and high-stage group (AUC, 0.711). Conclusions: The DCE-MRI parameters are correlated with the plasma EBV DNA status and NPC stages.

The positive relationship between molecular weight and mechanical properties of polymeric fibers can be ascribed to an increase in the length of the molecular chains. In this research, effect of Polylactic acid (PLA) molecular weight on morphological and mechanical properties of electrospun PLA were studied. PLA with two different molecular weights were used to prepare some samples by using electrospinning process at various concentrations (10%, 15% and 20% w/v). The condition for fabricating electrospun PLA was a 15 cm of collection distance and 15 kV of working voltage. Morphology of the electrospun PLA was studied by the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Mechanical properties including tensile strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break were determined by using the universal testing machine. The obtained suitable sample with optimum mechanical properties will be used in further step for the meniscus tissue engineering scaffold. The result of the study reported, the 20% low molecular weight electrospun (PLAL-20%H) fibers has the highest tensile strength (2.83 ± 0.47 MPa) and Young's modulus (160.67 ± 34.06 MPa) while 20% the high molecular weight electrospun (PLAH-20%) fibers has the highest elongation at break (25.87 ± 6.47%). In fact, the uniform and smooth surface fibers was observed in high relative humidity (RH) condition during electrospining process.

Structural searches of iron selenide (FeSe) under pressures have been investigated using the ab initio random structure searching technique. The DFT–D2 method of Grimme with van der Waals corrections is used to calculate the physical properties such as structural, lattice-vibrational, thermodynamic, electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties. The lowest enthalpy systems at pressures above 110 GPa appear closely in two structures which are orthorhombic-Pmmn and cubic-CsCl space groups. Besides, the temperature effect on thermodynamic properties is also analyzed using quasi-harmonic vibrational approximation. Demagnetized states of the FeSe–CsCl system can be determined from electronic structure and spin up-down states. The discovery of a new metallic CsCl-phase encourages us to investigate the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) at pressures greater than 110 GPa. This indicates that the Tc value in the CsCl-type FeSe under high pressure is related to the Fermi surface size.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

After booster vaccination, IgT and CD8 transcripts were significantly increased in the spleen of fish vaccinated with the HKV, but not with FKV. Both vaccines induced a specific IgM response in both serum and mucus. In summary, this study showed that both HKV and FKV are promising injectable vaccines for the prevention of disease caused by TiLV in Nile tilapia.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

Therefore, among the drug targets, ACE2 is suggested as a vital target of COVID-19 therapy. This hypothesis is based on the protective role of the drugs acting on ACE2. Therefore, this review discusses the impact and challenges of using ACE2 as a target in the current therapy of COVID-19.",medical,Pharmacology (medical)
Immobilizing Bactericides on Dental Resins via Electron Beam Irradiation,"Thongthai P., Kitagawa H., Iwasaki Y., Noree S., Kitagawa R., Imazato S.",2021-09-01,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Biofilms, Composite Resins, Electrons, Humans, Materials Testing, Methacrylates, Streptococcus mutans, anti-bacterial compounds, bacteria, biofilms, biomaterials, dental materials, polymer","Polymerizable bactericides, such as quaternary ammonium compound–based monomers, have been intensively studied as candidates for immobilizing antibacterial components on dental resin. However, they predominantly exhibit a bacteriostatic behavior, rather than bactericidal, as the immobilized components are left with insufficient molecular movement to disrupt the bacterial surface structure through contact-mediated action. In this study, we developed a novel strategy to increase the density of the immobilized bactericide and enhance its antibacterial/antibiofilm properties by combining a surface-grafting technique with electron beam irradiation. A solution of the quaternary ammonium compound–based monomer, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB), was coated on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin specimens at the concentrations of 30, 50, and 80 wt%. The coated resins were subsequently exposed to 10 MeV of electron beam irradiation at 50 and 100 kGy, followed by thermal stabilization at 60 °C. The antibacterial effect was evaluated by inoculating a Streptococcus mutans suspension on the coated PMMA resin samples, which exhibited bactericidal effects even after 28 d of aging (P < 0.05, Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). Transmission electron microscopy and bacteriolytic activity evaluation revealed that the S. mutans cells had sustained membrane depolarization. Furthermore, the antibiofilm effects against S. mutans and bacteria collected from human saliva were assessed. The thickness and the percentage of membrane-intact cells of the S. mutans and multispecies biofilms formed on the MDPB-immobilized surfaces were significantly lower than the uncoated PMMA specimens, even after 28-d aging (P < 0.05, Tukey’s honestly significant difference test). Thus, the immobilization of antibacterial MDPB via electron beam irradiation induced rapid membrane depolarization, increasing membrane permeability and eventually causing cell death. Our strategy substantially enhances the antibacterial properties of the resinous materials and inhibits biofilm formation, therefore demonstrating significant potential for preventing infectious diseases in the oral environment.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Historical data in 2021 perform the Telescope problem that occurs when transporting ships for a long time and the cumulative heat is a catalyst of Telescoping. The Six Sigma approach was applied to improve the process under five phases (DMAIC) to remedy this problem. Therefore, the researcher studied the process, analyzed the results from the cause-and-effect matrix, analyzed the potential causes of issues, and FMEA prioritized the rationales to solve. The experiment results revealed that adjusting the adhesive thickness and nip-pressure in the coating process were causes of high winding tension and Telescoping. Moreover, ageing temperature and time before cutting into tape can inhibit Telescope movement. After improvement by adjusting parameters in the process, the height of the core is downshifted and is in the manufacturing standard. Besides, the process capability was improved to Cp = 2.14 and Cpk = 1.35, which passed the 1.33 acceptance criteria of the factory. As a result, the improvement can reduce the occurrence of Telescope tape from 40% to 0% of the current waste.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays have been developed for accurate assessment of CNVs in several human genes. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate ddPCR assays for detection of the CNVs of P. falciparum genes associated with resistance to anti-malarial drugs. Methods: A multiplex ddPCR assay was developed to detect the CNVs in the pfmdr1 and pfplasmepsin2 genes, while a duplex ddPCR assay was developed to detect CNV in the pfgch1 gene. The gene copy number (GCN) quantification limit, as well as the accuracy and precision of the ddPCR assays were determined and compared to conventional quantitative PCR (qPCR). In order to reduce the cost of testing, a multiplex ddPCR assay of two target genes, pfmdr1 and pfplasmepsin2, was validated. In addition, the CNVs of genes of field samples collected from Thailand from 2015 to 2019 (n = 84) were assessed by ddPCR and results were compared to qPCR as the reference assay. Results: There were no significant differences between the GCN results obtained from uniplex and multiplex ddPCR assays for detection of CNVs in the pfmdr1 and pfplasmepsin2 genes (p = 0.363 and 0.330, respectively). Based on the obtained gene copy number quantification limit, the accuracy and percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) value of the multiplex ddPCR assay were 95% and 5%, respectively, for detection of the CNV of the pfmdr1 gene, and 91% and 5% for detection of the CNV of the pfplasmepsin2 gene. There was no significant difference in gene copy numbers assessed by uniplex or duplex ddPCR assays regarding CNV in the pfgch1 gene (p = 0.276). The accuracy and %RSD value of the duplex ddPCR assay were 95% and 4%, respectively, regarding pfgch1 GCN. In the P. falciparum field samples, pfmdr1 and pfplasmepsin2 GCNs were amplified in 15% and 27% of samples from Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, while pfgch1 GCN was amplified in 50% of samples from Yala, Thailand. There was 100% agreement between the GCN results obtained from the ddPCR and qPCR assays (κ = 1.00). The results suggested that multiplex ddPCR assay is the optional assay for the accurate detection of gene copy number without requiring calibration standards, while the cost and required time are reduced. Based on the results of this study, criteria for GCN detection by ddPCR analysis were generated. Conclusions: The developed ddPCR assays are simple, accurate, precise and cost-effective tools for detection of the CNVs in the pfmdr1, pfplasmepsin2 and pfgch1 genes of P. falciparum. The ddPCR assay is a useful additional tool for the surveillance of anti-malarial drug resistance.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

In the classification step, classifiers including Support Vector machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF) and Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network (EANN) are used as an alternative to a Softmax classifier and the performance of these classifiers are studied. The data set was created from various types of concrete structures using a standard digital camera and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The collected images are used in the crack detection system and in creating a 3D model of a sample concrete building using an image- based 3D photogrammetry technique. Then, the 3D model is used to create a mosaic image, in which the crack detection system was applied to create a global view of a crack density map. The map is then projected onto the 3D model to allow cracks to be located in the 3D world. A comparative study was conducted on the proposed crack detection system and the results prove that the combined architecture of CNN as a feature extractor and SVM as a classifier shows the best performance with the accuracy of 92.80. The results also show that the modified architecture by integrating CNN and other types of classifiers can improve a system performance, which is better than using the Softmax classifier.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction"

However, to ensure the system operations, distribution system operators should oversee the energy transactions of P2P market. Moreover, to more attract to the market participants, the losing market participants are rearranged to trade with the utility as the traditional market scheme. This paper proposes the pricing mechanism for P2P energy trading market allowing the winning market participants to trade the energy with the optimal exchange price, while the losing market participants can trade back with the utility with an excess energy rate for sellers and time-of-use rate for buyers. The algorithm of the proposed methodology is based on the optimization problem which the optimal solutions are used to impose the exchange price among the winning market participants. The results, of which the modified 22-bus distribution system is served as a test system, show that the proposed method is conducted to operate the P2P market without network constraint violations and allow the losing P2P market participants to trade with the utility.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"
Data pattern effect of SOA at 25 Gbps with different PRBS and multi-channel amplification,"Sawatdee P., Worasucheep D.-R., Luis R.S., Shimizu S., Shinada S., Furukawa H., Wada N.",2021-05-19,"Characteristic measurements, Cross gain modulation, Error free transmission, Linearly proportional, Multi-channel transmission, Optical signal to noise ratio, Pseudo-random binary sequences, Saturation region, Cross gain modulation, Data pattern effect, Semiconductor Optical Amplifier","This paper studies pattern effect of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) at 25.78125 Gbps in 100GBASE-LR4 standard: 4 channels at 1295, 1300, 1305 and 1310 nm. Three issues are evaluated: input powers of SOA, different Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) patterns, and multi-channel amplification. Based on characteristic measurements of SOA, the maximum gain is 25 dB at 0.2-A current and 1310-nm input, showing 3-dB saturation gain at -15 dBm input power. The 3-dB gain spectrum is 20.9 nm wide center at 1311.5 nm wavelength. The OSNR (Optical Signal to Noise Ratio) is linearly proportional to SOA's input power. The first issue, Bit Error Rate (BER) gets worse as SOA's input rises into saturation region due to severe data pattern effect. For example, comparing among -17.5, -12.5 and -7.5 dBm inputs, the lower power gives less BER. Hence, the SOA is better applied as pre-amplifier. The second issue (PRBS: 7, 23 and 31), their corresponding BERs get worse with longer patterns. For instance, PRBS31 always shows higher BER, while PRBS7 can offer error-free transmission. The BER performance of Gigabit Ethernet link using 8b/10b coding is well estimated with PRBS7. The third issue, when 3 channels are added to 1310-nm main channel for SOA amplification, the BERs results have more power penalty than the 1-channel case due to XGM (Cross Gain Modulation) inside SOA. However, the SOA can operate as pre-amplifier in multi-channel transmission, such as to extend the 100GBase-LR4 (10-km limit) links to 100GBase-ER4 (40-km limit) without a replacement of expensive optical transceivers.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

The hierarchical HZSM-5 by using 0.2 M NaOH with 0.25 M TPAOH for the desilication exhibited the best catalytic performance and the relative total peak area related to the aromatic hydrocarbons reached 65.8% with a yield of the detected aromatic hydrocarbons up to 45.2 mg/g-bio-oil. With the assistance of 0.25 M TPAOH for the desilication, the formation of mesopores became highly controllable, resulting in the increase in the surface area and maintainment of enough acid amounts, however, the coking on the surface of catalyst was not hindered. To solve the coking problem and increase the aromatic hydrocarbons production, the hierarchical HZSM-5 with the best performance was modified by various metals. It is found that 0.25 wt% Cu loaded hierarchical HZSM-5 increased the yield of the detected aromatic hydrocarbons up to 54.5 mg/g-bio-oil with a decrease in the coke formation.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Herein, the candidate structure of HfO2 is revealed to adopt a tetragonal structure under high-pressure phase with P4/nmm space group. This evidently confirms the stability of the HfO2 structures, since the decomposition into the component elements under pressure does not occur until the pressure is at least 200 GPa. Moreover, phonon calculations can confirm that the P4/nmm structure is dynamically stable. The P4/nmm structure is mainly attributed to the semiconducting property within using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof, the modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential in combination with the generalized gradient approximations, and the quasi-particle GW approximation, respectively. Our calculation manifests that the P4/nmm structure is likely to be metal above 200 GPa, arising particularly from GW approximation. The remarkable results of this work provide more understanding of the high-pressure structure for designing metal-oxide-based semiconducting materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

Results: Delirium was observed in 19 patients and was accompanied by significantly increased pO<sub>2</sub>, number of white blood cells, neutrophil percentage, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and lower mean platelet volume (MPV) after adjusting for age, central nervous system (CNS) disease, blood loss during surgery, sleep disorders, and body mass index. The severity of delirium was associated with lowered number of platelets and MPV. Psychomotor disorders were associated with lower bicarbonate levels. The requirement of physical restraint of the patients was predicted by increased percentages of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Prior CNS disease was together with these biomarkers a significant predictor of delirium and severity of delirium.

The hDPs proliferated when cultured with the ProRoot® MTA and Biodentine™ extraction media. The ProRoot® MTA and Biodentine™ extraction medium induced greater cell attachment and spreading. Moreover, the hDPs cultured in the ProRoot® MTA or Biodentine™ extraction medium migrated in a similar manner to those in serum-free medium, while a marked reduction in cell migration was observed in the cells cultured in DyCal® and TheraCal™ LC extraction media. Improved mineralization was detected in hDPs maintained in ProRoot® MTA or Biodentine™ extraction medium compared with those in serum-free medium. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the favorable in vitro biocompatibility and bioactive properties of ProRoot® MTA and Biodentine™ on hDPs, suggesting their superior regenerative potential compared with DyCal® and TheraCal™.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

One of the obstacles to manage large-scale and complex construction projects is inefficient communication between involving personnel. Most problems are such as misunderstanding contexts, incomplete information, ignorance, missing multimedia files, etc. In Thailand, organizations adopt digital transformation by utilizing a variety of applications and software to complete their projects, such as LINE, G-Suite, Asana, etc. Users have to spend a lot of time to learn each application and software to be able to achieve maximum performance. Construction process quality control assisted application is the new tool developed for uniting all needs and solving communication problems. Requirements are gathered by five interviews with three major organizations, the Thailand Department of Highway, Team Built Co., Ltd., and one major construction company. Requirements were analyzed to extract the most useful features that are beneficial to all users. React Native and the Expo framework were used to develop the frontend part of the application. For the backend part, the application used microservice architecture with various cloud services, like Amazon AWS, Expo Server, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. In the end, the application was put through hand-on tests by 13 on-site personnel. The final results showed the average scores of the user interface, hands-on experience, and benefits for the users were 4, 4.16, and 3.92 (out of 5), respectively, in which the total satisfaction score is 4.03(out of 5).","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics, sociology","Decision Sciences (miscellaneous), Automotive Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization, Transportation"

One of the most important impacts is the effect in the protection system. In a conventional grid system, synchronous machines supply fault currents up to 4-10 times p.u. but the inverter fault current is limited by its control system to be only 1-1.2 times rated current. The setting of protective devices in the power system, such as fuses and overcurrent relays, are calculated from the conventional grid fault current thus they cannot accurately detect faults in the power grid. This paper proposes a control algorithm for boosting the fault current injected to the grid during grid fault for an LCL grid-connected inverter. The fault current magnitude will be more than 2 times its rated current while the output voltage is under the rated value. Simulation results will be presented by MATLAB Simulink.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

The reduction reaction between chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) and sodium formate (HCOONa) at room temperature was performed to generate the aggregated gold microstructures on a PDMS sheet without chemical residuals. Superhydrophobic property was achieved when deposition time was reached to 2 h with water contact angle >160° and low contact angle hysteresis (H = 1.93°). Systematic investigations of the size, morphology, and mechanism of the generated gold films are presented. The generated gold film contains two different layers involving uniform spherical gold particles attached to the PDMS surface with the complex hierarchical structures on top. The complex structures play an important role in the superhydrophobic property, as they strongly promote the roughness to the PDMS surface. The durability of the fabricated gold film was elucidated by dropping ~7,200 waterdrops and external physical forces (e.g. stretch, bend, and twist). The main structures and their superhydrophobic properties have not disoriented after the tests. Moreover, the surface of the gold film demonstrated the potential applications as magnetical manipulation of droplets and a robust Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS substrate).","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

If environmentally benign materials are created with biodegradable ones, PEMs can evolve into practical technology. In this work, we have fabricated environmentally safe and economic PEMs based on sulfonate grafted sodium alginate (SA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). In the first step, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulphonic acid (AMPS) and sodium 4-vinylbenzene sulfonate (SVBS) are grafted on to SA by utilizing the simple free radical polymerization technique. Graft copolymers (SA-g-AMPS and SA-g-SVBS) were characterized by1H NMR, FTIR, XRD and DSC. In the second step, sulfonated SA was successfully blended with PVA to fabricate PEMs for the in vitro controlled release of 5-fluorouracil (anti-cancer drug) at pH 1.2 and 7.4 and to remove copper (II) ions from aqueous media. Moreover, phosphomolybdic acids (PMAs) incorporated with composite PEMs were developed to evaluate fuel cell characteristics, i.e., ion exchange capacity, oxidative stability, proton conductivity and methanol permeability. Fabricated PEMs are characterized by the FTIR, ATR-FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDAX. PMA was incorporated. PEMs demonstrated maximum encapsulation efficiency of 5FU, i.e., 78 ± 2.3%, and released the drug maximum in pH 7.4 buffer. The maximum Cu(II) removal was observed at 188.91 and 181.22 mg.g–1. PMA incorporated with PEMs exhibited significant proton conductivity (59.23 and 45.66 mS/cm) and low methanol permeability (2.19 and 2.04 × 10−6 cm2/s).","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Aims: To evaluate the treatment efficacy and safety of 585-nm QSNYL and 4% HQ cream combination vs 4% HQ cream alone for telangiectatic melasma in the skin phototypes III-V. Patients/Methods: Twenty-one Thai female patients with telangiectatic melasma and Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (FPTs) III-V were randomly treated with the 585-nm QSNYL on one side of the face for five sessions at 2-week intervals. All patients were assigned to apply HQ cream daily at night on both sides of the face for 10 weeks and a broad-spectrum sunscreen regularly throughout the study. The treatment efficacy and safety were evaluated using the Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI), biometric evaluation, patient assessment, and adverse effects. Results: The combination-treated side yielded more significant improvement of mMASI than the topical-treated side at weeks 2, 4, and 8, respectively. However, 19% of the patients developed postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) on the laser-treated side, especially in FPTs IV-V and rebound hyperpigmentation. There was a significant improvement of hemoglobin and melanin index, but without statistical difference between the two treatment groups. Conclusions: The combination of 585-nm QSNYL and HQ treatment yields treatment efficacy and skin rejuvenation effects for telangiectatic melasma. Nonetheless, a high incidence of PIH and rebound hyperpigmentation is adversely developed in dark FPT. Thus, this laser treatment should be cautiously applied in those with dark FPTs IV-V to avoid laser-induced pigment alteration.",medical,Dermatology
22-O-(N-Boc-l-glycine) ester of renieramycin M inhibits migratory activity and suppresses epithelial–mesenchymal transition in human lung cancer cells,"Oo Y., Nealiga J.Q.L., Suwanborirux K., Chamni S., Ecoy G.A.U., Pongrakhananon V., Chanvorachote P., Chaotham C.",2021-09-01,"Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Movement, Cell Survival, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, Esters, Glycine, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Tetrahydroisoquinolines, EMT, Human lung cancer cells, Invasion, Marine alkaloid, Migration, Renieramycin M","The incidence of metastasis stage crucially contributes to high recurrence and mortality rate in lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, no available treatment inhibits migration, a key metastasis process in lung cancer. In this study, the effect of 22-O-(N-Boc-l-glycine) ester of renieramycin M (22-Boc-Gly-RM), a semi-synthetic amino ester derivative of bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone alkaloid isolated from Xestospongia sp., on migratory behavior of human lung cancer cells was investigated. Following 24 h of treatment, 22-Boc-Gly-RM at non-toxic concentrations (0.5–1 μM) effectively restrained motility of human lung cancer H460 cells assessed through wound healing, transwell migration, and multicellular spheroid models. The capability to invade through matrix component was also repressed in H460 cells cultured with 0.1–1 µM 22-Boc-Gly-RM. The dose-dependent reduction of phalloidin-stained actin stress fibers corresponded with the downregulated Rac1-GTP level presented via western blot analysis in 22-Boc-Gly-RM-treated cells. Treatment with 0.1–1 μM of 22-Boc-Gly-RM obviously caused suppression of p-FAK/p-Akt signal and consequent inhibition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was evidenced with augmented level of E-cadherin and reduction of N-cadherin expression. The alteration of invasion-related proteins in 22-Boc-Gly-RM-treated H460 cells was indicated by the diminution of matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP, MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9), as well as the upregulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), TIMP2, and TIMP3. Thus, 22-Boc-Gly-RM is a promising candidate for anti-metastasis treatment in lung cancer through inhibition of migratory features associated with suppression on EMT.

In addition to traditional economic objectives, the environmental impact of sugarcane farm burning is included into the model to better reflect the current harvesting practice, where sugarcane growers often resort to burning their fields due to the lack of available harvesting resources during the season. An evolutionary algorithm based on a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is also devised to help solve the resulting Multi-Objective Harvesting Resource Scheduling Problem (MOHRSP), which normally becomes intractable for real-life problem instances. We find that the proposed PSO framework is notably efficient as it provides diverse sets of non-dominated solutions with markedly low coefficients of variation in a reasonable amount of time. We also find that, by sacrificing a slight amount of sugar production volume, the whole sugar supply chain could be largely improved, especially for the sugarcane growers, whose profitability turns out to be sensitive in the trade-offs with other objectives.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

This study investigates the macro-mechanical and micro-structural behaviours of dredged natural expansive clay from coal mining treated with ordinary Portland cement or hydrated lime addition.

Mechanical testing determined geotechnical engineering properties, including free swelling potential, California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength, resilient modulus, and shear wave velocity. The microstructures of treated soils are observed by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy to understand the behaviour of the expansive clay blended with cement and lime. Test results confirmed that cement and lime are effective agents for improving the swelling behaviour and other engineering properties of natural expansive clay. In general, chemical treatments reduce the swelling and increase the strength and modulus of expansive clay, subjected to chemical content and curing time. Scanning electron microscopy analysis can observe the increase in formation of particle clusters with curing period, and x-ray diffraction patterns display hydration and pozzolanic products from chemical particles. The correlations of mechanical properties and microstructures for chemical stabilised expansive clay are recommended.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

A number of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been used in clinical trials of therapeutic interventions for RIX; however, little is known regarding their measurement properties and methodological quality. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO for articles published up to May 2019 and evaluating at least one measurement property of PROMs relevant to RIX. The COSMIN guidelines were used to assess relevant measurement properties and methodological quality. Results: Nine validations studies were identified reporting on four PROMs relevant to RIX. The Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) showed overall high-quality evidence for structural validity and internal consistency, but low-quality evidence supporting reliability. The methodological quality of the Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia scale (GRIX), Xerostomia Inventory (XI) and the Xerostomia Quality of Life Scale (XeQoLS) was relatively low for all measurement properties.

We randomly assigned 5303 subjects to the derivation cohort and the remaining 2651 to the validation cohort. We collected data from the derivation cohort on age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, drinking, body mass index, medical conditions, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin. Associations between the colonoscopic findings of APN and each risk factor were examined using the Pearson χ2 test, and we assigned each participant a risk score (0–15), with scores of 0 to 3 as average risk and scores of 4 or higher as high risk. The scoring system was tested in the validation cohort. We used the Cochran–Armitage test of trend to compare the prevalence of APN among subjects in each group. Results: In the validation cohort, 79.5% of patients were classified as average risk and 20.5% were classified as high risk. The prevalence of APN in the average-risk group was 1.9% and in the high-risk group was 9.4% (adjusted relative risk, 5.08; 95% CI, 3.38–7.62; P <.001).

It is abundant in essential nutrients and sulphur-containing compounds such as glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC). Cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly) is produced by GSH catabolism and occurs in durian fruit pulp. Cysteine (Cys) is a precursor of sulphur-containing volatiles generated during fruit ripening. The aforementioned substances contribute to the strong odour and flavour of the ripe fruit. However, the genes encoding plant Cys-Gly dipeptidases are unknown. The aim of this study was to measure leucylaminopeptidase (LAP) activity in durian fruit pulp. Results: We identified DzLAP1 and DzLAP2, which the former was highly expressed in the fruit pulp. DzLAP1 was expressed at various ripening stages and in response to ethephon/1-MCP treatment. Hence, DzLAP1 is active at the early stages of fruit ripening. DzLAP1 is a metalloenzyme ~ 63 kDa in size. It is activated by Mg2+ or Mn2+ and, like other LAPs, its optimal alkaline pH is 9.5. Kinetic studies revealed that DzLAP1 has Km = 1.62 mM for its preferred substrate Cys-Gly. DzLAP1-GFP was localised to the cytosol and targeted the plastids. In planta Cys-Gly hydrolysis was confirmed for Nicotiana benthamiana leaves co-infiltrated with Cys-Gly and expressing DzLAP1. Conclusions: DzLAP1 has Cys-Gly dipeptidase activity in the γ-glutamyl cycle. The present study revealed that the LAPs account for the high sulphur-containing compound levels identified in fully ripened durian fruit pulp.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science

Included studies were published observational studies that compared the risk of cardiovascular outcomes among dialysis patients with CABG and DES. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to explore heterogeneity.ResultsThirteen studies were included in this analysis, involving total 56 422 (CABG 21 740 and PCI 34 682). Compared with DES, our study demonstrated CABG had higher 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.85, P = 0.009] but lower cardiac mortality (OR 0.78, P < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR 0.5, P < 0.001) and repeat revascularization (OR 0.35, P < 0.001). No statistical differences were found between CABG and DES for long-term mortality (OR 0.92, P = 0.055), composite outcomes (OR 0.88, P = 0.112) and stroke (OR 1.49, P = 0.457).

First episode psychosis and schizophrenia are systemic neuro-immune disorders triggered by a biotic stimulus in individuals with reduced immune regulation and neuroprotection,"Maes M., Plaimas K., Suratanee A., Noto C., Kanchanatawan B.",2021-11-01,"Down-Regulation, Gene Ontology, Humans, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Neuroprotection, Protein Interaction Maps, Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Up-Regulation, Bacterial translocation, Inflammation, LPS, Neuro-immune, Physiological stress, Psychiatry, Schizophrenia","There is evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by activation of the immune-inflammatory response (IRS) and compensatory immune-regulatory systems (CIRS) and lowered neuroprotection. Studies performed on antipsychotic-naïve first episode psychosis (AN-FEP) and schizophrenia (FES) patients are important as they may disclose the pathogenesis of FES. However, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of FEP/FES is not established. The aim of the current study was to delineate a) the characteristics of the PPI network of AN-FEP and its transition to FES; and b) the biological functions, pathways, and molecular patterns, which are over-represented in FEP/FES. Toward this end, we used PPI network, enrichment, and annotation analyses. FEP and FEP/FES are strongly associated with a response to a bacterium, alterations in Toll-Like Receptor-4 and nuclear factor-κB signaling, and the Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator of the transcription proteins pathway. Specific molecular complexes of the peripheral immune response are associated with microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and gliogenesis. FEP/FES is accompanied by lowered protection against inflammation, in part attributable to dysfunctional miRNA maturation, deficits in neurotrophin and Wnt/catenin signaling, and adherens junction organization. Multiple interactions between reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor, E-cadherin, and β-catenin and disrupted schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) expression increase the vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of immune molecules, including cytokines and complement factors. In summary: FEP and FES are systemic neuro-immune disorders that are probably triggered by a bacterial stimulus which induces neuro-immune toxicity cascades that are overexpressed in people with reduced anti-inflammatory and miRNA protections, cell–cell junction organization, and neurotrophin and Wnt/catenin signaling.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

A total of 274 consecutive subjects who attended the Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, were selected. Demographic data were collected. HbA1c was assessed using a finger prick blood sample and analyzed with a point-of-care (POC) testing machine (DCA Vantage® ). Hyperglycemia was defined as POC HbA1c ≥ 5.7%. Random blood glucose (RBG) was also evaluated using a glucometer (OneTouch® SelectSimple™) and hyperglycemia was defined as RBG ≥ 110 mg/dl or ≥140 mg/dl. The subjects were then sent for laboratory measurements for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c . The prevalence of AGR (defined as FPG ≥ 100 mg/dl or laboratory HbA1c ≥ 5.7%) and potential type 2 DM (defined as FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl or laboratory HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) among subjects was calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using FPG and HbA1c for the diagnosis of AGR and potential type 2 DM. The prevalence of hyperglycemia defined as POC HbA1c ≥ 5.7%, RBG ≥ 110 mg/dl, and RBG ≥ 140 mg/dl was 49%, 63%, and 32%, respectively. After the evaluation using laboratory measurements, the prevalence of AGR was 25% and 17% using laboratory FPG and HbA1c criteria, respectively. Based on the ROC curves, the performances of POC HbA1c and RBG in predicting FPG-defined potential type 2 DM were high (AUC = 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–0.99 and AUC = 0.94; 95% CI 0.86–1.0, respectively) but lower in predicting AGR (AUC = 0.72; 95% CI 0.67–0.78 and AUC = 0.65; 95% CI 0.59–0.70, respectively). This study suggested that POC testing might be a potential tool for screening of subjects with potential type 2 DM in a dental setting.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; endocrine pancreas; diabetes, insulin, and glucose tolerance, geobase; related topics, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Design: Circulating and synovial fluid CLU levels in 259 knee OA patients were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relative CLU mRNA expression in 50 knee OA synovial tissues and 4 knee OA FLSs was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Plasma CLU levels of knee OA patients were significantly higher than paired synovial fluid samples. Compared with early-stage knee OA patients, those with advanced-stage OA had considerably increased plasma and synovial fluid CLU levels. There were significant positive associations of plasma and synovial fluid CLU levels with radiographic severity of knee OA. Plasma CLU levels were directly correlated with its synovial fluid levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in the patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis unveiled the potential utility of plasma CLU as a novel biomarker for knee OA severity (AUC = 0.80), with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 73.3%. Marked upregulation of CLU mRNA expression was observed in both the inflamed synovial tissues and FLSs of knee OA. Conclusion: Increased CLU mRNA and protein levels in the systemic and local joint environments of knee OA might reflect knee OA severity, especially systemic and synovial inflammation.","medical, engineering, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Biomedical Engineering, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

Methods: Forty-one women completed questionnaires assessing characteristic menstruation symptoms, duration of menstrual cycle and number of pads used/day and completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) during the consecutive days of their menstrual cycle. Menses-related symptoms (MsRS) were computed from the sum of 10 pre- and post-menses symptoms and the menstruation blood and duration index (MBDI) was computed based on the daily number of pads and duration of menses. We assayed serum levels of various biomarkers at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the subjects' menstrual cycle. Results: MBDI was significantly associated with a) MsRS including low abdominal cramps, and gastro-intestinal (GI) and pain symptoms (positively); b) plasma levels of haptoglobin (Hp), CCL5, insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)1 (all positively); and c) estradiol and paraoxonase (PON)1 arylesterase activity (both inversely). MsRS were significantly predicted by CCL5 and IGF-1 (both positively) and progesterone (inversely). Low-abdominal cramps, and gastro-intestinal and pain symptoms were associated with lower progesterone levels. The MBDI+MsRS score was significantly predicted by the cumulative effects of (in descending order of importance): Hp, IGF-1, PON1 arylesterase, estradiol and PAI. Conclusion: Menstruation-related features including estimated blood loss, duration of menses, cramps, pain, and gastro-intestinal symptoms are associated with hormone-immune-metabolic biomarkers, which mechanistically may explain those features. Future research should construct a cross-validated algorithm using MBDI+MsRS features in a larger study group to delineate a useful case-definition of menstruation-related distress.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The first-time assessment of G6PD deficiency prevalence and molecular characterization of G6PD mutations in the Lao Theung population were performed in this study. Methods: A total of 252 unrelated Lao Theung participants residing in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) were recruited. All participant samples were tested for G6PD enzyme activity and G6PD gene mutations. The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR for detecting G6PD Aures was developed. Results: The G6PD mutations were detected in 11.51% (29/252) of the participants. Eight G6PD mutations were detected. The G6PD Aures was the most common mutation identified in this cohort, which represented 58.62% (17/29) of all mutation. The mutation pattern was homogenous, predominantly involving the G6PD Aures mutation (6.75%), followed by 1.19% G6PD Union and 0.79% each G6PD Jammu, G6PD Mahidol and G6PD Kaiping. One subject (0.4%) each carried G6PD Viangchan and G6PD Canton. Interestingly, one case of coinheritance of G6PD Aures and Quing Yan was detected in this cohort. Based on levels of G6PD enzyme activity, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the Lao Theung population was 9.13% (23/252). The prevalence of G6PD deficient males and females (activity < 30%) in the Lao Theung population was 6.41% (5/78) and 1.72% (3/174), respectively, and the prevalence of G6PD intermediate (activity 30–70%) was 5.95% (15/252).

Our study aimed to explore the effects of NDMVs on proinflammatory cytokines expressed by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). FLS were isolated from the synovium of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients undergoing sur-gery. NDMVs, isolated from TNFα-stimulated healthy neutrophils, were characterized by electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. MTT and scratch wound healing assays were used to measure FLS viability and migration after treatment with NDMVs, while internalization of fluorescently labeled NDMVs was appraised by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines in supernatants were quantified by the Bio-Plex system. Incubation of FLS with NDMVs at a vesicle/cell ratio of 100 resulted in a time-dependent uptake, with 35% of synoviocytes containing microvesicles over a 6–24 h time period, with no significant change in cell viability. TNFα stimulated the cytokine expression in FLS, and NDMVs down-regulated TNFα-induced expression of IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IFNγ and MIP-1β. However, this down-regulation was selective, as NDMVs had no significant effects on TNFα-stimulated expression of IL-2 or IL-4. NDMVs were internalized by FLS to inhibit TNFα-stimulated broad-spectrum proinflammatory cytokine secretion. NDMVs, therefore, may exhibit an anti-inflammatory role in the regulation of the FLS function.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Recent Findings: Almost three decades ago when the clinical entity of Brugada syndrome (BrS) was described in patients who had abnormal coved-type ST elevation in the right precordial EKG leads in patients who had no apparent structural heart disease but died suddenly from ventricular fibrillation. Since its description, the syndrome has galvanized explosive research in this field over the past decades, driving major progress toward better understanding of BrS, gaining knowledge of the genetic pathophysiology and risk stratification of BrS, and creating significant advances in therapeutic modalities. One of such advances is the ability for electrophysiologists to map and identify the arrhythmogenic substrate sites of BrS, which serve as good target sites for catheter ablation. Subsequently, several studies have shown that catheter ablation of these substrates normalizes the Brugada ECG pattern and is very effective in eliminating these substrates and preventing recurrent VF episodes. Summary: Catheter ablation has become an important addition for treatment of symptomatic BrS patients with recurrent VT/VF episodes.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

Under optimized conditions, the TiO2/MXene-PVA/GO hydrogel/SPCE response due to the oxidation of NE at +0.4 V (vs. Ag|AgCl) is proportional to the concentration of NE over 0.01 to 1.00 μM (R2 = 0.9968) and 1.00 to 60.0 μM (R2 = 0.9936) ranges with a detection limit (3σ) of 6 nM without interferent effect from common interferences in urine. Furthermore, this sensor was employed for urinary NE determination and validated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV detector at 280 nm; the average recovery was found to be 97.6 to 102%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 4.9%. This device was sensitive enough to evaluate an early stage of neurological disorder via detecting clinically relevant NE level. Eventually, it was integrated with pantyliners which could be a potential wearable sensor in the near future.

Little is known regarding its efficacy in eliminating medium-sized cytokines in sepsis. This study aimed to explore the effects of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) using the EMiC2 filter on cytokine clearance. Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted in critically ill patients with sepsis and acute kidney injury requiring kidney replacement therapy. We measured concentrations of 12 cytokines [Interleukin (IL) IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF)] in plasma at baseline (T0) and pre- and post-dialyzer at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h after CVVHD initiation and in the effluent fluid at corresponding time points. Outcomes were the effluent and adsorptive clearance rates, mass balances, and changes in serial serum concentrations. Results: Twelve patients were included in the final analysis. All cytokines except EGF concentrations declined over 48 h (p < 0.001). The effluent clearance rates were variable and ranged from negligible values for IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, and EGF, to 19.0 ml/min for TNF-α. Negative or minimal adsorption was observed. The effluent and adsorptive clearance rates remained steady over time. The percentage of cytokine removal was low for most cytokines throughout the 48-h period. Conclusion: EMiC2-CVVHD achieved modest removal of most cytokines and demonstrated small to no adsorptive capacity despite a decline in plasma cytokine concentrations. This suggests that changes in plasma cytokine concentrations may not be solely influenced by extracorporeal removal.

This work firstly presents a step-by-step conversion of water hyacinth into carbon nanohorns through hydrothermal treatment, carbonization and arc in water. As the first step, the hydrothermal treatment at 220 °C could convert the dried water hyacinth with carbon content of 39% to hydro-char with carbon content of 57%. Graphitic rods were prepared by compression of the hydro-char which was carbonized at 900 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. With the arc in water step, carbon nanohorns with an average size of 39 nm could be produced as confirmed by TEM analyses. Therefore, the usage of water hyacinth waste as renewable source for producing high value-added carbon nanohorns via the step-by-step process would be another promising technology for biomass utilization.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Chemistry (all), Mechanical Engineering, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Interrupting prolonged sitting may reduce these risks. However, more information is needed to understand the patterns of interrupting prolonged sitting to obtain metabolic health benefits. Objective: This study examined the effects of interrupting prolonged sitting with different intensities and durations of walking with an equivalent energy expenditure on postprandial metabolic responses in young Chinese men with central obesity. Design: A randomized crossover experimental trial was conducted. Setting: Participants underwent three 6-hour experiments with a 7-day washout period between each experiment: prolonged sitting, 3 min of light-intensity walking every 30 minutes, and 1.5 minutes of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes. Participants and Samples: Baseline (fasting) and 6-hour postprandial metabolic glucose and lipid levels were analyzed among 18 young Chinese men with central obesity. Main Outcome Measures: Generalized estimating equations (adjusted for the potential confounders explaining residual outcome variance (body mass index) and age), trial order, preprandial values, and lead-in activity) were used, and the incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) of each outcome were compared between prolonged sitting and interrupted prolonged sitting conditions. Results: Compared with prolonged sitting, both interrupting prolonged sitting conditions reduced the iAUCs for glucose (P <. 05) but not insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, or nonesterified fatty acids. Conclusions: Both conditions of interrupted prolonged sitting reduced postprandial glucose concentrations in young Chinese men with central obesity when the energy expenditure was equivalent.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"
Nationwide cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical stabilization of rib fractures by flail chest status and age groups,"Choi J., Mulaney B., Laohavinij W., Trimble R., Tennakoon L., Spain D.A., Salomon J.A., Goldhaber-Fiebert J.D., Forrester J.D.",2021-03-01,"Age Factors, Aged, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Female, Flail Chest, Fracture Fixation, Humans, Length of Stay, Male, Markov Chains, Middle Aged, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Retrospective Studies, Rib Fractures, Sensitivity and Specificity, Treatment Outcome, cost-effectiveness, Cost-effectiveness analysis, economic, QALY, rib fractures","BACKGROUND: Surgical stabilization of rib fracture (SSRF) is increasingly used to manage patients with rib fractures. Benefits of performing SSRF appear variable, and the procedure is costly, necessitating cost-effectiveness analysis for distinct subgroups. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRF versus nonoperative management among patients with rib fractures younger than 65 years versus 65 years or older, with versus without flail chest. We hypothesized that, compared with nonoperative management, SSRF is cost-effective only for patients with flail chest. METHODS: This economic evaluation used a decision-analytic Markov model with a lifetime time horizon incorporating US population-representative inputs to simulate benefits and risks of SSRF compared with nonoperative management. We report quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses accounted for most plausible clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Compared with nonoperative management, SSRF was cost-effective for patients with flail chest at willingness-to-pay threshold of US $150,000/QALY gained. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture costs US $25,338 and US $123,377/QALY gained for those with flail chest younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was not cost-effective for patients without flail chest, costing US $172,704 and US $243,758/QALY gained for those younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that, under most plausible scenarios, SSRF remained cost-effective for subgroups with flail chest, and nonoperative management remained cost-effective for patients older than 65 years without flail chest. Probability that SSRF is cost-effective ranged from 98% among patients younger than 65 years with flail chest to 35% among patients 65 years or older without flail chest. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical stabilization of rib fracture is cost-effective for patients with flail chest. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture may be cost-effective in some patients without flail chest, but delineating these patients requires further study.",medical,"Surgery, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

The effect of mutations on its structure and function are however poorly characterized. Methods: Database search identified nonsense and missense mutations in the N-terminal TPR motifs and the C-terminal, catalytic JmjC domain, but also in the intrinsically disordered region connecting both these two well-structured domains. KDM6A variants with cancer-derived mutations were generated using site directed mutagenesis and fused to eGFP serving as an all-in-one affinity and fluorescence tag to study demethylase activity by an ELISA-based assay in vitro, apoptosis by FACS, complex assembly by Co-immunoprecipitation and localization by microscopy in urothelial cells and apoptosis by FACS. Results: Independent of the mutation and demethylase activity, all KDM6A variants were detectable in the nucleus. Truncated KDM6A variants displayed changes in complex assemblies affecting (1) known interactions with the COMPASS complex component RBBP5 and (2) KDM6A-DNA associated assemblies with the nuclear protein Nucleophosmin. Some KDM6A variants induced a severe cellular phenotype characterized by multiple acute effects on nuclear integrity, namely, release of nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm, increased level of DNA damage indicators RAD51 and p-γH2A.X, and mitosis defects. These damaging effects were correlated with increased cell death. Conclusion: These observations reveal novel effects of pathogenic variants pointing at new specific functions of KDM6A variants. The underlying mechanisms and affected pathways have to be investigated in future research to understand how tumor cells cope with and benefit from KDM6A truncations.","human genetics, biochemistryistry","Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

However, there are limited studies in Thailand and Japan on organic fresh milk from the customer perspective to support one function of the organic fresh milk system. This study aims to fill in this gap. Researchers conducted the developed questionnaires with 418 samples in Thailand and 432 samples in Japan. This study examines attitudes toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. The collected data was analyzed using a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model. The results showed that attitudes toward behavior and subjective norms are associated with willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. Package labeling also has a strong influence on perception. Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, healthy consumption and lifestyle had a positive effect toward the purchase of organic fresh milk. Social media also affects subjective norms correlated with willingness to purchase such milk. However, one’s perceived behavioral control for willingness to purchase organic fresh milk in Thailand is not significant, whereas in Japan it is.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

Active TB after transplant mostly occurs from reactivation of latent infection. Understanding risk factors and clinical information of TB may provide an appropriate prevention and treatment strategies in this specific patient population, however data from high endemic area is scarce. Methods: A matched single-center, case-control study was conducted in our institute. Cases were defined as newly diagnosed confirmed or clinical active TB in patients who underwent kidney transplant (KT) between April 1992 and October 2018. For each case, 5 controls were matched by age and sex. Risk factor associated with TB was determined using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Results: Between study period, KT was performed in 787 patients. Twenty-seven patients (3.43%) were diagnosed with active TB including 20 confirmed and 7 clinical diagnosed cases. The global incidence of TB in our population was 315 cases per 100 000 patients per year. Among 27 cases, pulmonary involvement was the most common (48.1%) followed by disseminated (18.5%), extrapulmonary (14.8%), pleura (11.1%) and pleuropulmonary (7.4%) TB. Allograft rejection was significantly associated with active TB (P <.001). The median onset duration of infection was 17 months (IQR, 4-59 months) after KT. Twenty-four (88.9%) patients received rifampicin containing regimen for treatment with median duration of 10 months (IQR, 6-12 months). All patients were cured after complete treatment, however those with TB remained having unfavorable outcomes including higher all-cause mortality and graft loss. Conclusions: Incidence rate of TB in KT recipients is higher than normal population. Allograft rejection was identified as a significant risk factor. Increase unfavorable outcomes including graft loss and mortality were also observed among patients with TB.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Transplantation"

Whether they are caused only by low neutrophil count or the combination of neutropenia and aberrant dental cells is unknown. Methods: Genetic variant was identified with exome sequencing. Dental pulp cells isolated from the SCN patient with an ELANE mutation were investigated for gene expression, enzyme activity, proliferation, colony formation, wound healing, apoptosis, ROS, attachment, spreading and response to lipopolysaccharide. Results: ELANE cells had diminished expression of ELANE and SLPI and reduced neutrophil elastase activity. Moreover, ELANE cells exhibited impaired proliferation, colony forming, migration, attachment and spreading; and significantly increased ROS formation and apoptosis, corresponding with increased Cyclin D1 and MMP2 levels. The intrinsic levels of TGF-β1 and TNF-α were significantly increased; however, IL-6, IL-8 and NF-kB1 were significantly decreased in ELANE cells compared with those in controls. After exposure to lipopolysaccharide, ELANE cells grew larger, progressed to more advanced cell spreading stages and showed significantly increased SLPI, TNF-α and NF-kB1 and tremendously increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression, compared with controls. Conclusion: This study, for the first time, suggests that in addition to neutropenia, the aberrant levels and functions of ELANE, SLPI and their downstream molecules in pulp cells play an important role in oral complications in SCN patients. In addition, pulp cells with diminished neutrophil elastase and SLPI are highly responsive to inflammation.","genergyal, biochemistryistry",Cell Biology

Totally, 15 bacterial cultures were enumerated from lake soil, out of fifteen, one isolate was recognized as PHB producer based on Sudan Black B staining along with PHB selective media. The PHB positive isolate was identified as Bacillus cereus by standard biochemical and 16S rRNA analyses. The produced PHB was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FR-IR) and Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analyses. The signal band for the PHB compound was noticed at 1633.71 cm-1 on FT-IR analysis. Three signals were recorded as 2.55, 2.372, and 3.389 ppm on 1H NMR analysis and these were analogous of the methylene group, methyl group, and methine group, correspondingly and these factors are polymeric representatives of PHB. The suitable growth conditions and factors for B. cereus were optimized as 10% of inoculum, at 35 °C, pH 7.5, 2 g L-1 of yeast extract, rice bran 20 g L-1, and 48 h of incubation for production of PHB. Under these optimized circumstances, B. cereus produced 90.80% of PHB as 32.78 g L-1 of PHB from 38.54 g L-1 of biomass. Finally, the results concluded that the isolated B. cereus would be a suitable candidate for viable PHB fabrication due to its low-cost substrate consuming potential and minimal cost of production.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Generation expansion planning (GEP) is a complex optimization problem. To get a realistic plan with the lowest cost, acceptable system reliability, and satisfactory CO2 emissions for the coming decades, a complex multi‐period mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model needs to be formulated and solved with individual unit characteristics along with hourly power balance constraints. This problem requires huge computational effort since there are thousands of possible scenarios with millions of variables in a single calculation. However, in this paper, instead of finding the globally optimal solutions of such MILPs directly, a simplification process is proposed, breaking it down into multiple LP subproblems, which are easier to solve. In each subproblem, constraints relating to renewable energy generation profiles, charge‐discharge patterns of ESSs, and system reliability can be included. The proposed process is tested against Thailand’s power development plan. The obtained solution is almost identical to that of the actual plan, but with less computational effort. The impacts of uncertainties as well as ESSs on GEP, e.g., system reliability, electricity cost, and CO2 emission, are also discussed.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This work focuses on the one-pot synthesis of bifunctional Cu0/Cu2O catalysts for the photothermal conversion of CO2 and H2O. The experimental results show that the Cu0/Cu2O catalysts with a Cu0/Cu2O interface and a controllable ratio of Cu0 to Cu2O can be readily synthesized by tuning the ratio of the Cu precursor to the reductant (N2H4). The activity of the prepared Cu0/Cu2O catalysts in the photothermal catalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O is greatly influenced by the ratio of Cu0 to Cu2O and the reaction temperature. Cu0/Cu2O-R2, a catalyst prepared with a Cu precursor to N2H4 ratio of 1:2, exhibited the highest activity, i.e., 13.2 μmol g-1 h-1 of CO and 2.6 μmol g-1 h-1 of CH3OH at 383 K, which is much higher than those of Cu2O or Cu. Such enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of the interface between Cu0 and Cu2O, which is beneficial not only to photocatalysis but also to thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. This work illustrates that a bifunctional catalyst with mixed metal oxidation states can be prepared by a one-pot method and is efficient for improving the performance of the directly coupled photothermal catalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The elemental composition, phase structure, and morphology of the FB powder were investigated and compared with commercial hydroxyapatite powder (SM powder). The FB-powder exhibited 1.01 at. % of Mg while the SM-powder showed Mg in ppm-level. Carbonate groups were detected in the two powders. Both HAp and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) structures were found in the FB powder, but the SM powder exhibit only the HAp phase. Irregular-shaped particles were observed in the FB powder. After the two HAp powders were sintered at 1200 °C and 1250 °C for 2 h (FB-1200, FB-1250, SM-1200, and SM-1250), the β-TCP intensity peaks of the FB-ceramic samples significantly increased with increasing sintering temperature. The highest relative density, well-packed grains, and β-TCP stabilization by Mg at the Ca5 site of the FB-1250 structure were the dominant factors governing the highest mechanical properties. Although high density was observed in the SM-1200 sample, Vickers hardness of the SM-1200 sample is lower than the FB-1250 sample. This may be attributed to the partial decomposition of HAp into β-TCP, α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP), and Ca10(PO4)6O phases. In addition, the increase of grain size was the main factor that governs the increasing compressive strength and Young's modulus instead of density and phase decomposition of the SM-ceramic samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Here, we reported a simple and effective method for the preparation of nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbonaceous material for liquid phase adsorbents and supercapacitor electrodes. In this method, the target carbonaceous material (biochar) was produced by one-step pyrolysis and activation of bamboo chips under the ammonia atmosphere. Two green activation reagents (K2C2O4 and KHCO3) were introduced into the preparation process simultaneously. The physicochemical properties of biochar were studied by means of SEM, BET, XRD, XPS and so on. The characterization results confirmed that the vascular bundle structure of bamboo can be well preserved by pyrolysis under ammonia atmosphere combined with green activation, and the nitrogen atoms were successfully introduced into the biochar's skeleton uniformly. The physicochemical properties of biochar can be adjusted suitable for high phenol adsorption and supercapacitor electrodes at different temperatures.

Diagnostic Value of Interleukin-34 as a Novel Biomarker for Severity of Knee Osteoarthritis,"Udomsinprasert W., Panon K., Preechanukul S., Jittikoon J., Jinawath A., Honsawek S.",2021-12-01,"Biomarkers, Humans, Interleukins, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Synovial Fluid, Synovial Membrane, biomarker, interleukin-34, knee osteoarthritis, synovial inflammation","Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether plasma and synovial fluid interleukin-34 (IL-34), an inflammatory cytokine reportedly implicated in synovial inflammation-induced joint degeneration, were associated with radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and could emerge as knee OA biomarkers. Design: Ninety-six knee OA patients and 72 healthy controls were recruited. Plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were quantified using ELISA. IL-34 mRNA and protein expressions in inflamed (n = 15) and noninflamed synovial tissues (n = 15) of knee OA patients were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Significant increases in plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were found in knee OA patients—especially those with advanced stage (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Both plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were positively associated with radiographic severity (r = 0.64, P < 0.001; r = 0.50, P < 0.001, respectively). There was a direct link between plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis uncovered that the optimal cutoff value of plasma IL-34 as a novel biomarker reflecting knee OA severity was defined at 3750.0 pg/mL (AUC = 0.85), with a sensitivity of 83.1% and a specificity of 74.2%. Further analysis revealed that IL-34 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in inflamed synovium compared with noninflamed synovium obtained from knee OA patients (P < 0.001), consistent with protein expression analysis demonstrating IL-34 overexpression localized in the lining and sublining layers of inflamed synovium. Conclusions: All findings suggest that elevated plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 would reflect knee OA severity and might have potential utility as biomarkers for the disease progression.","medical, engineering, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Biomedical Engineering, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"
"Towards a new model and classification of mood disorders based on risk resilience, neuro-affective toxicity, staging, and phenome features using the nomothetic network psychiatry approach","Maes M., Moraes J.B., Bonifacio K.L., Barbosa D.S., Vargas H.O., Michelin A.P., Nunes S.O.V.",2021-03-01,"Adult, Disability Evaluation, Female, Humans, Machine Learning, Male, Middle Aged, Mood Disorders, Quality of Life, Reactive Nitrogen Species, Reactive Oxygen Species, Resilience, Psychological, Suicidal Ideation, Antioxidants, Biomarkers, Inflammation, Major depression, Mood disorders, Neuro-immune, Oxidative and nitrosative stress","Current diagnoses of mood disorders are not cross validated. The aim of the current paper is to explain how machine learning techniques can be used to a) construct a model which ensembles risk/resilience (R/R), adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), staging, and the phenome of mood disorders, and b) disclose new classes based on these feature sets. This study was conducted using data of 67 healthy controls and 105 mood disordered patients. The R/R ratio, assessed as a combination of the paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene, PON1 enzymatic activity, and early life time trauma (ELT), predicted the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol – paraoxonase 1 complex (HDL-PON1), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), nitro-oxidative stress toxicity (NOSTOX), staging (number of depression and hypomanic episodes and suicidal attempts), and phenome (the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scores and the Clinical Global Impression; current suicidal ideation; quality of life and disability measurements) scores. Partial Least Squares pathway analysis showed that 44.2% of the variance in the phenome was explained by ELT, RONS/NOSTOX, and staging scores. Cluster analysis conducted on all those feature sets discovered two distinct patient clusters, namely 69.5% of the patients were allocated to a class with high R/R, RONS/NOSTOX, staging, and phenome scores, and 30.5% to a class with increased staging and phenome scores. This classification cut across the bipolar (BP1/BP2) and major depression disorder classification and was more distinctive than the latter classifications. We constructed a nomothetic network model which reunited all features of mood disorders into a mechanistically transdiagnostic model.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

All cases that have been studied molecularly possess at least one DICER1 pathogenic variant. Here, we characterized nine pituitary samples, including three fresh frozen PitBs, three normal fetal pituitary glands and three normal postnatal pituitary glands using small-RNA-Seq, RNA-Seq, methylation profiling, whole genome sequencing and Nanostring® miRNA analyses; an extended series of 21 pituitary samples was used for validation purposes. These analyses demonstrated that DICER1 RNase IIIb hotspot mutations in PitBs induced improper processing of miRNA precursors, resulting in aberrant 5p-derived miRNA products and a skewed distribution of miRNAs favoring mature 3p over 5p miRNAs. This led to dysregulation of hundreds of 5p and 3p miRNAs and concomitant dysregulation of numerous mRNA targets. Gene expression analysis revealed PRAME as the most significantly upregulated gene (500-fold increase). PRAME is a member of the Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) signaling pathway and in PitBs, the RAR, WNT and NOTCH pathways are dysregulated. Cancer Hallmarks analysis showed that PI3K pathway is activated in the tumors. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated a quiet genome with very few somatic alterations. The comparison of methylation profiles to publicly available data from ~ 3000 other central nervous system tumors revealed that PitBs have a distinct methylation profile compared to all other tumors, including pituitary adenomas. In conclusion, this comprehensive characterization of DICER1-related PitB revealed key molecular underpinnings of PitB and identified pathways that could potentially be exploited in the treatment of this tumor.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics; gene mutations, medical, neuroscience","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Response surface optimization of biodiesel synthesis over a novel biochar-based heterogeneous catalyst from cultivated (Musa sapientum) banana peels,"Jitjamnong J., Thunyaratchatanon C., Luengnaruemitchai A., Kongrit N., Kasetsomboon N., Sopajarn A., Chuaykarn N., Khantikulanon N.",2021-12-01,"Banana peels, Biodiesel production, Central composite designs, Heterogeneous catalyst, Independent variables, Response surface methodology, Response surface optimization, Transesterification reaction, Biodiesel, Cultivated banana peels, Heterogeneous catalyst, Response surface methodology (RSM), Transesterification","In this work, response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize the biodiesel yield of the transesterification reaction. A novel solid carbon-supported potassium hydroxide catalyst derived from the pyrolysis of cultivated banana (Musa sapientum) peels and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was used as the catalyst for biodiesel production. A five-level (− 2, − 1, 0, + 1, and + 2) RSM with a four-factor central composite design of independent variable factors (methanol to palm oil molar ratio (6:1–18:1), catalyst loading (3–7 wt.%), reaction time (30–150 min), and reaction temperature (50–70 °C)) were randomly setup using the Design of Experiment program. The 30 wt.% K2CO3 catalyst calcined at 600 °C under atmosphere pressure exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the pyrolysis ash was rich in K that formed a basic heterogeneous catalyst. Within the range of selected operating conditions, the optimized methanol:oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time, and reaction temperature were found to be 15:1, 4 wt.%, 120 min, and 65 °C, respectively, to give a biodiesel yield of 99.16%. The actual biodiesel yield of 98.91% was obtained under the predicted optimal conditions. The high R2 (96.76%) and R2adj (92.97%) values indicated that the fitted model showed a good agreement with the predicted and actual biodiesel yield.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The intact PHB biosynthesis operon of C. necator A-04, an alkaline tolerant strain isolated in Thailand with a high degree of 16S rRNA sequence similarity with C. necator H16, was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1, pColdI, pColdTF, pBAD/Thio-TOPO, and pUC19 (native promoter) and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. While the phaCA–04 gene was insoluble in most expression systems tested, it became soluble when it was expressed as a fusion protein with trigger factor (TF), a ribosome associated bacterial chaperone, under the control of a cold shock promoter. Careful optimization indicates that the cold-shock cspA promoter enhanced phaCA–04 protein expression and the chaperone function of TF play critical roles in increasing soluble phaCA–04 protein. Induction strategies and parameters in flask experiments were optimized to obtain high expression of soluble PhaCA–04 protein with high YP/S and PHB productivity. Soluble phaCA–04 was purified through immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The results demonstrated that the soluble phaCA–04 from pColdTF-phaCABA–04 was expressed at a level of as high as 47.4 ± 2.4% of total protein and pColdTF-phaCABA–04 enhanced soluble protein formation to approximately 3.09−4.1 times higher than that from pColdI-phaCABA–04 by both conventional method and short induction method developed in this study. Cultivation in a 5-L fermenter led to PHB production of 89.8 ± 2.3% PHB content, a YP/S value of 0.38 g PHB/g glucose and a productivity of 0.43 g PHB/(L.h) using pColdTF-phaCABA–04.

The objective of the registry was to evaluate glycemic control and complications of patients with type 1 diabetes. Materials and Methods: Patients’ demographics, clinical data, frequencies of daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), glycemic control and complications were collected. Results: Among the 1,907 type 1 diabetes patients, the mean age was 21.2 ± 11.3 years. The mean glycated hemoglobin level was 9.35 ± 2.41%, with significant variations among age groups (P < 0.001). Conventional insulin treatment and intensive insulin treatment were used in 43 and 57% of patients, respectively. Mean glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in patients treated with conventional insulin treatment compared to those treated with intensive insulin treatment (9.63 ± 2.34 vs 9.17 ± 2.46%, P = 0.002). Compared to the conventional insulin treatment group, significantly more patients in the intensive insulin treatment group achieved good glycemic control (P < 0.001), and fewer had diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.031). The prevalence of microvascular complications increased significantly with age (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed good glycemic control to be associated with age 25 to <45 years, intensive insulin treatment with SMBG three or more times daily and diabetes duration of 1 to <5 years.

Blooms of Chattonella with fisheries damage have been recorded in East Asia since 1969, whereas they have been only recorded in Southeast Asia since the 1980s. Occurrences of Chattonella have been documented from six Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, with mass mortalities mainly of farmed shrimp in 1980–1990s, and farmed fish in 2000–2010s. These occurrences have been reported with the names of C. antiqua, C. marina, C. ovata, C. subsalsa and Chattonella sp., owing to the difficulty of microscopic species identification, and many were not supported with molecular data. To determine the distribution of C. marina complex and C. subsalsa in Southeast Asia, molecular phylogeny and microscopic observation were also carried out for cultures obtained from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Philippines, Russia, Singapore and Thailand. The results revealed that only the genotype of C. marina complex has been detected from East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Russia), whereas both C. marina complex (Indonesia and Malaysia) and C. subsalsa (Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) were found in Southeast Asia. Ejection of mucocysts has been recognized as a diagnostic character of C. subsalsa, but it was also observed in our cultures of C. marina isolated from Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, and Russia. Meanwhile, the co-occurrences of the two harmful Chattonella species in Southeast Asia, which are difficult to distinguish solely based on their morphology, suggest the importance of molecular identification of Chattonella genotypes for further understanding of their distribution and negative impacts.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; organic pollution, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Aquatic Science, Plant Science"

Here, we investigated the effects of NB-O3 on the innate immunity of fish by monitoring the expression levels of nonspecific immune-related genes (IL-1β, IL-2β, TNF-α), heat-shock protein genes (HSP70, HSP90-α), and a bacteriolytic enzyme, C-type lysozyme, gene (LYZ) post-treatment with this technology. Following exposure to NB-O3, the different tissues of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were collected over time for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. The expression of all the genes evaluated in the gills, the head kidney, and the spleen of the NB-O3 treated group was significantly up-regulated compared to that in the untreated control group. The expression levels were the highest (approx. 2 to 4-fold) at 15 min and 3 h post-exposure and then decreased from 6 to 24 h. These findings suggested that NB-O3 could switch on the innate immunity genes of Nile tilapia. Thus, we hypothesized that the NB-O3-immune-activated fish would respond more effectively to subsequent bacterial infections, thereby improving survivability compared to that of untreated fish. To test this hypothesis, 3 h post NB-O3 exposed fish and unexposed fish were challenged with a lethal dose of Streptococcus agalactiae. Interestingly, the survival rate of the NB-O3 group was significantly higher than that of the non-treated controls, with a relative percent survival (RPS) of 60–70%. Together, these findings indicate, for the first time, that NB-O3 may trigger the nonspecific defense system of the fish, thereby improving fish survivability during subsequent bacterial infections. This research identified another potential benefit of NB-O3 in aquaculture for preventing infectious bacterial diseases.","environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

This paper explores whether such declines are present among MSM and transgender women (TGW) in Southeast Asia and discusses implications for HIV policies and programming. A scoping review was conducted of scientific publications and selected documents regarding the spread of HIV infection among MSM and TGW in major urban centres of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Continued high HIV prevalence and incidence among MSM are found in integrated behavioural and biological surveillance (IBBS) and research studies. HIV prevalence among MSM under IBBS decreased only in Bangkok from 28.6% in 2014 to 10.3% in 2018, whereas it was increasing in Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City, Vientiane, and Phnom Penh. HIV/AIDS case reports regarding new HIV infection diagnoses among MSM have started to decrease in Singapore since 2011 and have been plateauing in Metropolitan Manila since 2017. Where data were available, it was found that HIV prevalence among TGW was high and if IBBS was conducted, it was increasing. HIV prevalence among TGW under IBBS in Jakarta had risen to 34.0% (2015) and 14.0% (2019) in Phnom Penh. These findings suggest that most ASEAN member states have so far failed to effectively implement and scale-up scientifically proven biomedical HIV prevention measures and counter stigma and discrimination that impedes access to appropriate HIV prevention and treatment serVICes for MSM and TGW.",medical,Medicine (all)

In identifying these essential genes, the network diffusion (ND) approach is a widely used technique applied in gene prioritization. However, there is still a large number of candidate genes that need to be evaluated experimentally. Therefore, it would be of great value to develop a new strategy to improve the precision of the prioritization. Given the efficiency and simplicity of centrality measures in capturing a gene that might be important to the network structure, herein, we propose a technique that extends the scope of ND through a centrality measure to identify new disease-related genes. Five common centrality measures with different aspects were examined for integration in the traditional ND model. A total of 40 diseases were used to test our developed approach and to find new genes that might be related to a disease. Results indicated that the best measure to combine with the diffusion is closeness centrality. The novel candidate genes identified by the model for all 40 diseases were provided along with supporting evidence. In conclusion, the integration of network centrality in ND is a simple but effective technique to discover more precise disease-related genes, which is extremely useful for biomedical science.","biological Materials Sciencerials and tissue engineeringneering, fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all), Computational Mathematics, Applied Mathematics"

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the effects of behavioral and pharmacological sleep interventions on glucose metabolism. Methods: Medline and Embase were used for systematic search. Studies reporting behavioral or pharmacological interventions in population with sleep disturbances, with measured outcomes of glucose metabolism and sleep parameters were selected. Results: Twenty two studies were eligible for review (eight were conducted in people with type 2 diabetes). Studies were grouped into three types of intervention: sleep extension (n = 6), sleep education or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I, n = 6) and pharmacological interventions (n = 10). CBT-I and sleep education resulted in significantly improved self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, mean difference, MD, −1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.83, −0.80), non-significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c level (MD -0.35%, 95% CI -0.84, 0.13), and non-significant reduction in fasting glucose levels (MD -4.76 mg/dL, 95% CI -14.19, 4.67). Other studies were not eligible for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of interventions or outcomes. Sleep extension was able to increase sleep duration by varying degrees in short sleepers, and five of six studies demonstrated relationships between the intervention and measures of insulin resistance. A majority of pharmacological intervention studies showed improved sleep but the effects on glucose metabolism were mixed. Conclusions: Available sleep interventions were effective in improving sleep but the effects on glucose metabolism were inconclusive. Larger randomized studies with consistent outcome measurements are needed to demonstrate this potential causal relationship.",medical,Medicine (all)

Secreted factors and cell surface components from Lactobacillus species have been shown to modulate the host immune system. However, the precise role of L. reuteri secreted factors and surface proteins in influencing dendritic cells (DCs) remains uncharacterized. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that L. reuteri secreted factors will promote DC maturation, skewing cells toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In acute colitis, we speculate that L. reuteri promotes IL-10 and dampens pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby improving colitis. Methods & Results: Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs were differentiated into immature dendritic cells (iDCs) via IL-4 and GM-CSF stimulation. iDCs exposed to L. reuteri secreted factors or UV-irradiated bacteria exhibited greater expression of DC maturation markers CD83 and CD86 by flow cytometry. Additionally, L. reuteri stimulated DCs exhibited phenotypic maturation as denoted by cytokine production, including anti-inflammatory IL-10. Using mouse colonic organoids, we found that the microinjection of L. reuteri secreted metabolites and UV-irradiated bacteria was able to promote IL-10 production by DCs, indicating potential epithelial-immune cross-talk. In a TNBS-model of acute colitis, L. reuteri administration significantly improved histological scoring, colonic cytokine mRNA, serum cytokines, and bolstered IL-10 production. Conclusions: Overall these data demonstrate that both L. reuteri secreted factors and its bacterial components are able to promote DC maturation. This work points to the specific role of L. reuteri in modulating intestinal DCs. New & Noteworthy: Lactobacillus reuteri colonizes the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and exerts beneficial effects on host health. However, the mechanisms behind these effects have not been fully explored. In this article, we identified that L. reuteri ATTC PTA 6475 metabolites and surface components promote dendritic cell maturation and IL-10 production. In acute colitis, we also demonstrate that L. reuteri can promote IL-10 and suppress inflammation. These findings may represent a crucial mechanism for maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Physiology (medical)"

A Hybrid E-nose System based on Metal Oxide Semiconductor Gas Sensors and Compact Colorimetric Sensors,"Maw A.K., Somboon P., Srituravanich W., Teeramongkonrasmee A.",2021-06-26,"Classification performance, Classification results, Colorimetric sensor arrays, Electronic nose (e-nose), Measurement procedures, Metal oxide semiconductor, Metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors, Volatile organic compound (VOC), hybrid e-nose, metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensors, paper-based colorimetric sensors, VOC classification","Commercial metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have been widely used by recent studies as detection units of electronic noses (e-nose) in various applications including disease diagnosis. However, the enoses employing the MOS sensors can only discriminate a limited number of odor groups due to their poor selectivity. Preliminary studies have shown that the selectivity of the MOS sensors can be enhanced by jointly integrating with other sensory units such as QCM or potentiometric sensors, which, however, involves complex interface circuitry and measurement procedures. In contrast, this paper presents a hybrid electronic nose that combines olfactory information from an MOS sensor array together with a compact paperbased colorimetric sensor array which is simpler and easier to utilize. The proposed system employs total 8 MOS sensors, and the compact paper-based colorimetric sensors are fabricated with indicator dyes such as phenol red, methyl red, and methylene blue. Color profiles of the paper-based sensors are captured using a USB-microscope and the alterations of the dyes during the gas exposure are monitored. The improvement of the system performance in classifying six volatile organic compounds (VOC) are investigated by comparing the classification results of the system with and without the colorimetric sensors. The measurement data from both sensor arrays are mapped to the feature space using principal component analysis (PCA) for pattern extraction. It was confirmed that pattern separation among the target VOCs could be improved based on data fusion of these two sensor arrays. This hybrid e-nose system may be useful for improvement of VOC classification performance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Control and Systems Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Control and Optimization"

As students were expected to use mathematical software to solve complex mathematical formula, internet access was also allowed to simulate a more realistic working context. The exam questions had to be carefully set to assess the in-depth learning and application, focusing on the physical meanings, problem setting, modeling and result interpretation as the previously time-consuming mathematical solving was taken care of by the computer. The internet access had affected various aspects of exams, particularly the data formula, language translation, unit conversion and the ability to describe questions with colored photos or videos. The availability of internet resources further penalized students who did not properly prepare for the exams; they faced the problems in the online time management, utilization of academic and professional database, and the use of online translation in the disciplinary context. The initial concern for cheating appeared to be minor. Generally, students were either eager for or wary on exams with internets but they all seemed to recognize the reality of the needs and challenges. The proposal could also address some of the online exam issues in the COVID-19 era and the new normal after.","information sources and analysis, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, sociology","Computer Science Applications, Engineering (miscellaneous), Media Technology, Education"

As demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering techniques, the HA-pNIPAM was simply assembled into spherical nano-sized particles with the thermoresponsive behavior. The success of curcumin aqueous solubi-lization was confirmed by fluorescent spectroscopy. The resulting nanogel formulation enhanced the aqueous solubility and uptake into NIH-3T3 cells of curcumin. This nanogel formulation also demon-strates cytocompatibility against NIH-3T3 cells, which deems it safe as a delivery vehicle. Moreover, the formulation has a slight skin-protection effect using an artificial skin equivalence model. The curcumin-loaded HA-pNIPAM nanogel showed an anti-proliferative activity against MDA-MB-231, Caco-2, HepG2, HT-29, and TNF-α-induced hyperproliferation of keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. The thermoresponsive HA-pNIPAM nanogel reported here could be further optimized as a platform for controlled-release systems to encapsulate pharmaceuticals for therapeutic applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Chromatographic separation was per-formed on a C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm id, 1.7 µm) with a gradient elution system of water and acetonitrile, each containing 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The column temperature was controlled at 33 °C. The compounds were detected simultaneously at the maximum wave-lengths of mycophenolic acid (MPA), 254 nm, and curcumin (CUR), or MPA-CUR, at 420 nm. The developed method was validated according to the ICH Q2(R1) guidelines. The linear calibration curves of the assay ranged from 0.10 to 25 μg/mL (r2 ≥ 0.995, 1/x2 weighting factor), with a limit of detection and a limit of quantitation of 0.04 and 0.10 μg/mL, respectively. The accuracy and precision of the developed method were 98.4–101.6%, with %CV < 2.53%. The main impurities from the specificity test were found to be MPA and CUR. Other validation parameters, including robustness and solution stability, were acceptable under the validation criteria. Forced degradation studies were conducted under hydrolytic (acidic and alkaline), oxidative, thermal, and photolytic stress conditions.

However, bio-jet fuels usually suffer from poor cold flow properties. Hence, this research aimed to convert palm olein to bio-jet fuel range with high content of iso-alkanes via hydroconversion over nickel (Ni)/zeolite-based catalysts. The levels of liquid biofuels classified as bio-gasoline, bio-jet and green diesel, including the selectivity for chemical compositions were evaluated. Under 40 bar initial H2 pressure at 360 °C for 4 h, the use of Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts (Ni content = 10 wt%) provided the maximum iso-/n-alkane ratio at 1.67 with a bio-jet yield of 20.8 wt%. The schematic reaction mechanism for this process was also proposed. The incorporation of platinum (Pt) into the Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts to a Pt/(Pt + Ni) wt ratio of 0.24 increased the bio-jet yield to 28.7 wt% with iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.02. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicated that the freezing temperature (Tf) of the biofuels decreased with increasing iso-/n-alkane ratio, where the Tf of the liquid biofuels with iso-/n-alkane ratio > 1.00 was not observed. For the biofuels/fossil jet fuel (Jet A-1) blends, the use of biofuels having iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.67 could be blended with Jet A-1 up to 50/50 (v/v) and the Tf of the blended jet fuel was found at ca. −80 °C, which was lower than the limitation according to ASTM D1655-04a (−47 °C).","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Methods: Seven focus questions were identified, and seven electronic search queries were conducted in PubMed. Human studies reporting on bleeding on probing, probing depth or case definitions of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were included. Results: Emerging evidence with bone-level implants suggests a link between EA combined with convex EP and peri-implantitis. Depth of the peri-implant sulcus of ≥3 mm is shown to be reducing the effectiveness of treatment of established peri-implant mucositis. Modification of the prosthesis contour is shown to be an effective supplement of the anti-infective treatment of peri-implant mucositis. Limited evidence points to no difference with regard to the risk for peri-implant mucositis between tissue- and bone-level implants, as well as the material of the abutment or the prosthesis. Limited evidence suggests the use or not of prosthetic abutments in external connections and does not change the risk for peri-implantitis. Literature with regard to prosthesis retention type and risk for peri-implantitis is inconclusive. Conclusions: Limited evidence indicates the involvement of EA, EP, sulcus depth and restricted accessibility to oral hygiene in the manifestation and/or management of peri-implant mucositis/peri-implantitis.

Previous clinical studies, mostly conducted in intensive care settings, showed associations between glycocalyx shedding and clinical outcomes. We aimed to explore the association of plasma syndecan-1, a marker of glycocalyx degradation, with the subsequent fluid requirements and clinical outcomes of emergency department patients with sepsis. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a randomized trial of fluid resuscitation in the emergency department. The study was conducted in the emergency department of an urban 1500-bed tertiary care center. The data of 95 adults who were diagnosed with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion and had undergone baseline syndecan-1 measurement were included. The syndecan-1 levels at baseline (T0) and hour 6 (T6) were studied to characterize their association with clinical outcomes, including subsequent fluid administration, organ failure outcomes and mortality. Results: The median syndecan-1 levels at T0 and T6 were 207 (IQR 135–438) and 207 (IQR 128–490) ng/ml, respectively. Syndecan-1 levels at T0 were correlated with baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (ρ = 0.35, p < 0.001). Syndecan-1 levels at both T0 and T6 were correlated with subsequent fluid administration over 24 and 72 h and associated with the diagnosis of septic shock, the maximum dose of vasopressors and the need for renal replacement therapy (p < 0.05).

Adaptive Indoor Localization System for Large-Scale Area,"Vongsuteera T., Rojviboonchai K.",2021-01-01,"Area classification, Basic service sets, Changing environment, Existing systems, Fingerprint database, Indoor localization, Indoor localization systems, Searching spaces, Area classification, fingerprint, indoor localization, indoor localization system, large-scale, Wi-Fi","Generally, fingerprint-based indoor localization works inefficiently when deployed in a large-scale area. This is because it consumes massive resources and takes long processing time for searching the exact location in the large fingerprint database. Moreover, the changing environment can degrade overall performance. To tackle these problems, we propose an adaptive indoor localization system for a large-scale area. Our system consists of three main parts. First, our area classification algorithm is the key to overcome the problem caused by the large-scale area. It identifies an area of the user's queries whether they are outdoor or located in a specific building. Specifically, the algorithm can filter out the queries sent from outdoor or out-of-scope areas. Then, the information of this part is sent to the next part. Second, our fingerprint-based indoor localization algorithm can utilize the information from the first part by searching only the fingerprint in the specific building. This can significantly reduce searching space and processing time in order to localize the exact location. Third, our missing-BSSID detector algorithm detects the missing Basic Service Set Identifiers (BSSIDs) in the incoming query and updates a sampling database. This part is for our system to quickly adapt to the changing environment. We evaluated and deployed our system in a large-scale exhibition including 37 multi-floor buildings, covering 486,000 m2 and generating approximately 600,000 records of queries from users. In addition, we created a simulation to evaluate our system in the critically-changing environment. Our proposed system achieves high accuracy. More importantly, our area classification algorithm can significantly reduce the overall processing time compared to the previous work. Also, we showed that when applying our missing-BSSID detector algorithm to our system as well as other existing systems, the overall system performance can be significantly improved.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Background: The development of a safe and effective LAA occluder has been shown to be challenging. Methods: The novel OMEGATM LAA occluder (Eclipse Medical, Ireland) was tested in a porcine model and three-dimensional (3D) human LAA models – this as a prelude to its first-in-human use. Results: In a first series of in-vivo experiments, the OMEGATM LAA occluder was shown to have a satisfactory device biocompatibility in a porcine model. The design of the OMEGATM device was further refined and optimized following three more series of in-vivo experiments. The second generation OMEGATM device was designed with thinner wires, leading to a profile reduction. Based on in-vitro testing of different OMEGATM device sizes implanted at different depths in human three-dimensional (3D) LAA models, it could be determined that (1) the landing zone should be measured at a median depth of 12 mm from the LAA ostium; (2) the distal self-retaining inverted cup should have 10%-25% compression to minimize device embolization risk; and (3) the disc should be slightly inverted, i.e. pulled into the LAA, to promote complete LAA occlusion. The combined in-vivo and in-vitro testing resulted in an optimized pre-procedural planning of the first-in-human case treated with the OMEGATM device. Conclusions: This series of carefully planned in-vivo and in-vitro experiments allowed demonstration of the safety and efficacy of the OMEGATM LAA occluder. This approach of thorough preclinical testing of medical devices may reduce the risk of complications in first-in-human cases and may become the standard approach for device development and preclinical testing in the future.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

The TNTs were synthesized on the Ti-6Al-4V surface through the anodization process at different anodization time. The TNTs morphology was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The wettability and the chemical composition of the Ti-6Al-4V surface and the TNTs were assessed using the contact angle meter, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The vancomycin of 200 ppm release behavior under controlled atmosphere was measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and hence, the position for retention time at 2.5 min was ascertained. The FESEM analysis confirmed the formation of nanostructured TNTs with vertically oriented, closely packed, smooth and unperforated walls. The maximum cumulative vancomycin release of 34.7% (69.5 ppm) was recorded at 24 h. The wetting angle of both Ti-6Al-4V implant and the TNTs were found below 90 degrees.

Significant reductions in dry mass and water absorbency were observed after P(KA) (53% and 54%, respectively) and P(Am-co-KA) (43% and 40%, respectively) were buried in the soil for ten weeks, indicating their partial biodegradation. Although the living fungal culture failed to degrade the polymers, digestion by its crude peroxidase (20 U/g, 16 h) significantly decreased the dry mass (15%; 15.0 ± 0.3 g) and water absorbency (13%; 16.0 ± 1.0 g/g) of P(KA). Chemical oxidation using H2O2 at high temperature with/without peroxidase efficiently liquidized both polymers specifying significant changes of their structures. The maximum degradation of P(KA) (99.84% weight loss) was obtained when incubated with 12.8% (v/w) H2O2 at 65 °C for 7.3 h while 98.43% weight loss was achieved after P(Am-co-KA) was incubated with 14.8% (v/w) H2O2 at 68 °C for 9.2 h. To assess the phytotoxicity of the degraded products, their effect on seed germination was determined. No significant inhibition was observed in mung bean germinating on both the untreated polymers and their oxidized products. On sweet corn, the degraded products were apparently less inhibitory than did the untreated polymers. These results suggested that the rapid and efficient degradation of polyacrylate and its copolymer by the thermo-oxidation of H2O2 could be applied for a larger scale of superabsorbent waste management.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study enrolling a sample derived from the patient population undergoing OSM-MWFILB over a 7-year period. The predictor variables were grouped into demographic, related health status, anatomic, tumor-specific, and therapeutic categories. The primary outcome variable was the presence of postmaxillectomy epiphora (PME). Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate regression mixed-effect models were computed. Results: The study sample was composed of 134 patients (46.3% females; 71.6% squamous cell carcinomas) with a mean age of 64.7 ± 12.2 years. There were 23 (17.2%) PME events, which were significantly associated with eight variables: male gender, poor general health (ASA III–IV), large vertical defect (Brown and Shaw's class III–IV), squamous cell carcinoma tumor type, big tumor size (T3-4), cervical lymph node metastasis (N1-2), long operating time > 3 h, and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy in both univariate mixed regression and multivariate Cox hazards analyses. Healing of PME in irradiated patients was significantly delayed.

It not only facilitates the processability but also tunes the final properties of the resultant rubber. In general, for a polar rubber like acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), the processing aids earning the most attention are synthesized from petroleum, such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP). However, due to their toxicity, many rubber chemists have tried to find alternative chemicals that are environmentally friendly and derived from a renewable resource. In this research, we investigated the effects of the soybean oil fatty acid (SBOFA), synthesized in house via hydrolysis of SBO, on the properties of NBR in comparison with DOP. Initially, it was found that the addition of SBOFA improved the flowability of the NBR compound, as indicated by the progressive decrease in the Mooney viscosity with increasing levels of SBOFA. The results from various techniques indicated that the crosslink density of the NBR vulcanizates passed through the maximum at the SBOFA loading of 4 phr. Upon loading SBOFA up to 4 phr, there was no significant deterioration in the mechanical strength of the SBOFA-plasticized NBR vulcanizates. Typically, the presence of SBOFA at 4 phr enhanced the thermal resistance of the NBR vulcanizate by shifting the thermal decomposition to a higher temperature. At a given loading, it was found that the SBOFA-plasticized NBR vulcanizate showed a comparable plasticizing efficiency and mechanical strength with the DOP-plasticized one. The result from this study shows that SBOFA is a good alternative sustainable eco-friendly processing aid to use for NBR.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Interdecadal variation of the wintertime precipitation in Southeast Asia and its possible causes,"Dong Z., Wang L., Xu P., Pimonsree S., Limsakul A., Singhruck P.",2021-03-01,"Atmospheric circulation, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, East Asian winter monsoon, Inter-decadal pacific oscillations, Inter-decadal variations, Time-scale features, Tropospheric winds, Walker circulation, Climate variability, Interdecadal variability, Monsoons, Sea ice, Sea surface temperature","Based on several observational and reanalysis datasets for the winters 1901-2017, this study investigates the interdecadal (ID) variation of the Southeast Asian rainfall (SEAR) and its potential drivers. The dominant mode of the wintertime SEAR on the ID time scale features enhanced precipitation over the eastern Maritime Continent and the Philippines and a slight decrease of precipitation over the western Maritime Continent, or the opposite sign. The ID SEAR variability peaks at the 8-16-yr period and explains more than 20% of the total variance regardless of the datasets and period considered, highlighting the importance of the ID variability of the SEAR. The atmospheric circulation that facilitates abundant ID SEAR is characterized by enhanced lower-tropospheric wind convergence and cyclonic anomalies over the South China Sea and the Philippines. On the one hand, this wind convergence is attributed to the enhanced Walker circulation induced by the negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). On the other hand, it is attributed to the enhanced northerly anomalies along the coast of East Asia induced by a strong East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and reduced autumn Arctic sea ice in the Barents-Kara Seas. These mechanisms are further confirmed by model experiments from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The effects of the IPO, EAWM, and Arctic sea ice on the SEAR are mostly independent. They together explain approximately 70% of the SEAR variance on the ID time scale.","fluidex; related topics, regional weather patterns, earth sciences",Atmospheric Science

With an emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, growing emphasis has been placed on the palliative needs of people with Parkinson’s (PwP), particularly elderly, frail, and with comorbidities. Areas covered: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge on aspects of daily living in PwP and might interact negatively with a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS), both directly and indirectly–as a consequence of pandemic-related social and health care restrictions. Here, the authors outline some of the motor and NMS relevant to PC, and propose a pragmatic and rapidly deployable, consensus-based PC approach for PwP during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, potentially relevant also for future pandemics. Expert opinion: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a considerable impact on PwP and their caregivers, ranging from mental health issues to worsening of physical symptoms–both in the short- and long-term, (Long-COVID) and calls for specific, personalized PC strategies relevant in a lockdown setting globally. Validated assessment tools should be applied remotely to flag up particular motor or NMS that require special attention, both in short- and long-term.","neuroscience, medical","Neuroscience (all), Neurology (clinical), Pharmacology (medical)"

Many protest events use Twitter as a communication tool. However, other peoples who want to avoid protest sites might want to know whether the event will occur in advance. This paper thus presents a method to predict protest in Thailand based on the analysis of Twitter messages. Normally the protest prediction models are built on a single machine learning model, whereas in this paper our protest prediction model is built on a two-level model using Naïve Bayes (NB) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning methods. We built a text classification model to classify tweets into categories related to the time period of the event, then we used the results from the text classification model to develop the protest prediction model. Our prediction model can learn an upcoming protest in 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours. The results obtained from the 10-fold cross validation of both models performed well, with the text classification model achieving 77.6 percent of accuracy and the accuracy from protest prediction model is 97.7%.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Hardware and Architecture, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Antidepressants and Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death: A Network Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"Prasitlumkum N., Cheungpasitporn W., Tokavanich N., Ding K.R., Kewcharoen J., Thongprayoon C., Kaewput W., Bathini T., Vallabhajosyula S., Chokesuwattanaskul R.",2021-04-23,"Antidepressive Agents, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Death, Sudden, Cardiac, Humans, Network Meta-Analysis, Norepinephrine, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors, antidepressant, network meta-analysis, sudden cardiac death","Background: Antidepressants are one of the most prescribed medications, particularly for patients with mental disorders. Nevertheless, there are still limited data regarding the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with these medications. Thus, we performed systemic review and meta-analysis to characterize the risks of VA and SCD among patients who used common antidepressants. Methods: A literature search for studies that reported risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in antidepressant use from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database from inception through September 2020. A random-effects model network meta-analysis model was used to analyze the relation between antidepressants and VA/SCD. Surface Under Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) was used to rank the treatment for each outcome. Results: The mean study sample size was 355,158 subjects. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) patients were the least likely to develop ventricular arrhythmia events/sudden cardiac deaths at OR 0.24, 0.028-1.2, OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.038-1.6) for serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.043, 1.8) for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), respectively. According to SUCRA analysis, TCA was on a higher rank compared to SNRI and SSRI considering the risk of VA/SCD. Conclusion: Our network meta-analysis demonstrated the low risk of VA/SCD among patients using antidepressants for SNRI, SSRI and especially, TCA. Despite the relatively lowest VA/SCD in TCA, drug efficacy and other adverse effects should be taken into account in patients with mental disorders.",medical,Medicine (all)

Meanwhile, bone tissue engineering has not been widely adopted in clinical practice because of the prevalence of postoperative infections. Therefore, enhancing the potential of HAp with antimicrobial agents would be an optional way of preventing bacteria persistence in chronic or long-term infections. Xanthone substance obtained as a mangosteen (MG) extract inhibited a broad spectrum of bacteria that slowed recovery of injury and wounds. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the surface morphology of MG-coated HAp granules, whereas in vitro studies tested the antibacterial susceptibility of bacterial strains usually involved in wound infection. MG-coated HAp granules strongly inhibited bacterial growth with a clear zone after 24 h in time-kill tests. Cytotoxicity was investigated to assess the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells. Results indicated positive mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. MG-coated HAp granules were successfully produced and showed potential for bone tissue engineering applications.

Fluoroquinolone resistance in non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica isolated from slaughtered pigs in Thailand,"Poomchuchit S., Kerdsin A., Chopjitt P., Boueroy P., Hatrongjit R., Akeda Y., Tomono K., Nuanualsuwan S., Hamada S.",2021-01-01,"Animals, Cephalosporins, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Fluoroquinolones, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella Infections, Animal, Serogroup, Swine, Thailand, Fluoroquinolone, Pigs, Salmonella, Serovar, Thailand","Introduction. The emergence and spread of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica (NTS) serovars resistant to fluoroquinolones and third- and higher-generation cephalosporins is a matter of great concern. Antimicrobial-resistant NTS is increasingly being discovered in humans, animals, food animals, food products, and agricultural environments. Pigs are considered a major reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella spp. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella spp. warrant further surveillance and characterization for a better understanding of the bacteria isolated from animals. Aim. NTS isolated from pork from slaughterhouses across Thailand were characterized in terms of their serovars; resistance to fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems; and antimicrobial resistance genes. Methodology. A total of 387 NTS isolates, collected from slaughtered pigs in ten provinces across Thailand between 2014 and 2015, were characterized based on their serovars, antimicrobial resistance genes, and susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Results. Among all NTS isolates, S. enterica serovar Rissen was predominant. Antimicrobial resistance was exhibited in 93/387 isolates (24%). Although 24 (6.2%) isolates were susceptible to all the tested antimicrobials, they were found to possess β-lactamase genes, such as blaTEM, blaSHV, or blaCTX-M. Mobilized colistin-resistant genes (mcr) and resistance to colistin were not observed in any tested isolate. Carbapenem resistance was detected in ten isolates (10.7%); however, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48-like, and blaIMP were not present. Among the 93 antimicrobial-resistant isolates, 87.1% showed fluoroquinolone resistance with the quinolone resistance gene (qnrS) combined with topoisomerase genes parC (T57S) or gyrA (S83E/Y and D124E/G) substitutions, or topoisomerase gene substitutions alone. Conclusion. We found high fluoroquinolone resistance rates among the NTS isolates from pigs from slaughterhouses. The fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism in NTS was associated with the combination of qnrS and substitutions in gyrA, parC, or both. To prevent the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant NTS between animals and humans, continuous monitoring, surveillance, and regulation of Salmonella in the pork supply chain are pivotal.","genergyal, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"

This study explored melatonin regulation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with DR and its relation to sleep and circadian functioning. Methods: Thirty-five participants (10 non-diabetic controls, 10 T2D without DR, and 15 T2D with DR) were recruited. Overnight urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) and objective sleep and wrist activity (7-day actigraphy) were obtained. Results: After adjusting for covariates, having T2D with DR was significantly associated with lower urinary aMT6s (β = − 1.369, p = 0.004) compared with controls, while having T2D without DR was not (p = 0.418). T2D patients with DR reported poorer sleep quality (p = 0.014) and had greater variability of sleep duration (p = 0.017) than others, while no differences were found in sleep duration, efficiency, and rest-activity rhythm. After adjusting for covariates, lower nocturnal aMT6s was significantly associated with greater sleep variability. Conclusion: T2D patients with DR exhibited low overnight production of aMT6s which likely contributed to sleep irregularities possibly due to weak circadian signaling. Whether or not melatonin supplementation could improve health in T2D patients with DR remains to be explored.",medical,"Otorhinolaryngology, Neurology (clinical)"

An increase in the air temperature has caused changes in the hydrologic cycle, which have been followed by several emergencies of natural extreme events around the world. Thailand is one of the countries that has incurred a huge loss in assets and lives from the extreme flood and drought events, especially in the northern part. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the hydrological regime in the Yom and Nan River basins, affected by climate change as well as the possibility of extreme floods and droughts. The hydrological processes of the study areas were generated via the physically-based hydrological model, namely the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The projected climate conditions were dependent on the outputs of the Global Climate Models (GCMs) as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 between 2021 and 2095. Results show that the average air temperature, annual rainfall, and annual runoff will be significantly increased in the intermediate future (2046–2070) onwards, especially under RCP 8.5. According to the Flow Duration Curve and return period of peak discharge, there are fluctuating trends in the occurrence of extreme floods and drought events under RCP 2.6 from the future (2021–2045) to the far future (2071–2095). However, under RCP 8.5, the extreme flood and drought events seem to be more severe. The probability of extreme flood remains constant from the reference period to the near future, then rises dramatically in the intermediate and the far future. The intensity of extreme droughts will be increased in the near future and decreased in the intermediate future due to high annual rainfall, then tending to have an upward trend in the far future.","water engineeringneering, runoff, streamflow and basins, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

Although the alcohol-assisted process allows the reduction in operating temperature and pressure, the subsequent product purification is complicated. Comparative studies between the conventional CO2 hydrogenation and the alcohol-assisted processes are carried out (case I–V). The alcohol-assisted processes present the opportunity of increasing the CO2 conversion per-pass and reducing 25% of the hydrogen consumption, the barriers in the conventional process. However, the product purifications remain challenging due to the azeotrope of methanol and by-products. Energy consumptions decrease in the feed and reaction sections of the alcohol-assisted processes but significant increase in the product purifications. The formation of by-products and the sequence of purification units affect process performance and economics. The obtained results indicate that the product purification and the catalyst development to increase methanol selectivity and produce an easy-separated by-product play key roles in the enhancement of the process feasibility.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

In this paper, we focus on removing aircraft shadow from remote sensing images where the shadows occur on wings, bodies, and tails. Since it is very difficult to get shadow-free aircraft images and a shadow aircraft image of the same type for the training part, we adopted Mask-ShadowGAN for solving this issue. The benefit of the Mask-ShadowGAN algorithm is that, in the training part, the technique does not require the same images that have both shadow and shadow-free. In the experiment, we evaluated our proposed technique using RMSE and Jaccard similarity index for measurement. The experimental result shows that our technique shows promising results.

The composites were prepared by the conventional facile hot compression molding method. The composite was immersed in a strongly acidic environment of pH 2.2 for a period of 3, 6, and 9 days. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were used to elucidate the structure and morphology of the composites. The thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry, water absorption, hardness, coefficient of friction and wear rate was performed as per the ASTM standards to characterize the as-prepared and aged composites. The experimental test results revealed that with an increase in acid aging time, the acid aged samples lost surface matrix such that the fiber was seen on the surface. The effects of corrosion seemingly reduced the crystallinity of the acid aged samples allowing amorphous regions to be trapped within the crystals. Water absorption of the samples increased with aging time due to inherent voids in the specimens as weight gain values were 5.27, 16.80, 19.33 and 19.91%, respectively for control and acid aged samples. Hardness values initially decreased with immersion time and increased which was attributed to the crystallinity of the specimens and to some extent the elemental carbon present in the specimens before and after aging. The measured hardness values of the control and acid aged composites were 2.98, 7.27, 14.40 and 9.07 HV, respectively. From the thermal analysis, it was noticed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer shifts to higher temperatures as the aging time in the acidic medium increased, which can be attributed to cross-linking of the polymer chains. The control specimen shows higher coefficient of friction (CoF) because they are more rigid than the acid aged samples, and hence under dry sliding can cause more friction leading to increased heat and CoF.","mixing and separation, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Herein, lignosulfonate-graft-poly[acrylamide-co-(acrylic acid)], LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels are synthesized by inverse suspension, a well-known and practical industrial process. Taking advantage of a chain transfer reaction with lignosulfonate (LS), no modification of lignin is therefore required. LS is confirmed to incorporate in the microgels as evidenced by elemental analysis, FTIR, DOSY 1H NMR, and XPS spectroscopies. Microgel particles with a high percent LS grafting are obtained by decreasing the monomer concentration in the disperse phase. Additionally, the LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels containing LS promote thermal stability and render the faster and stronger methylene blue (MB) adsorption. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms understudy indicate that the adsorption behavior of MB on the microgels follows the pseudo-second order and Langmuir model. It is found that the LS-g-P(AAm-co-AA) microgels can take up MB with 154 mg g−1 of adsorption capacity.

In this study, spent green tea was mixed with deionized water at various ratios ranging from liquid to solid to obtain spent green tea extract (ex-SGT) having different concentrations used for synthesis of AgNPs. The results indicated that a good distribution of particles with a bandgap energy of 2.17 eV which was in the visible region for ethylene photo-degradation was successfully obtained with the synthesized AgNPs-60 (ex-SGT at the ratio of 60:1).

Protonation status and control mechanism of flavin–oxygen intermediates in the reaction of bacterial luciferase,"Tinikul R., Lawan N., Akeratchatapan N., Pimviriyakul P., Chinantuya W., Suadee C., Sucharitakul J., Chenprakhon P., Ballou D.P., Entsch B., Chaiyen P.",2021-05-01,"Binding Sites, Biocatalysis, Crystallography, X-Ray, Escherichia coli, Flavin Mononucleotide, Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide, Gene Expression, Hydrogen Peroxide, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Luciferases, Bacterial, Models, Molecular, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxygen, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical, Protein Conformation, beta-Strand, Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs, Protons, Recombinant Proteins, Substrate Specificity, Thermodynamics, Vibrio, active site histidine, bacterial luciferase, flavin intermediate, flavin monooxygenase, protonation status","Bacterial luciferase catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction by oxidizing long-chain aldehydes to acids using reduced FMN and oxygen as co-substrates. Although a flavin C4a-peroxide anion is postulated to be the intermediate reacting with aldehyde prior to light liberation, no clear identification of the protonation status of this intermediate has been reported. Here, transient kinetics, pH variation, and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to probe the protonation state of the flavin C4a-hydroperoxide in bacterial luciferase. The first observed intermediate, with a λmax of 385 nm, transformed to an intermediate with a λmax of 375 nm. Spectra of the first observed intermediate were pH-dependent, with a λmax of 385 nm at pH < 8.5 and 375 at pH > 9, correlating with a pKa of 7.7–8.1. These data are consistent with the first observed flavin C4a intermediate at pH < 8.5 being the protonated flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, which loses a proton to become an active flavin C4a-peroxide. Stopped-flow studies of His44Ala, His44Asp, and His44Asn variants showed only a single intermediate with a λmax of 385 nm at all pH values, and none of these variants generate light. These data indicate that His44 variants only form a flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, but not an active flavin C4a-peroxide, indicating an essential role for His44 in deprotonating the flavin C4a-hydroperoxide and initiating chemical catalysis. We also investigated the function of the adjacent His45; stopped-flow data and molecular dynamics simulations identify the role of this residue in binding reduced FMN.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial metabolism and physicsiology; nitrogen transport and metabolism, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

This study aimed to compare the wear resistance, abrasiveness, color stability, and displacement resistance of zirconia and PEEK milled crowns. An ideal tooth preparation of a first maxillary molar was done and scanned by an intraoral scanner to make a digital model. Then, the prosthetic crown was digitally designed on the CAD software, and the STL file was milled in zirconia (CaroZiir S, Carol Zircolite Pvt. Ltd., Gujarat, India) and PEEK (BioHpp, Bredent GmbH, Senden, Germany) crowns using five-axis CNC milling machines. The wear resistance, color stability, and displacement resistance of the milled monolithic zirconia with unfilled PEEK crowns using a chewing simulator with thermocyclic aging (120,000 cycles) were compared. The antagonist wear, material wear, color stability, and displacement were evaluated and compared among the groups using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney U-test. Zirconia was shown to be three times more abrasive than PEEK (p value < 0.05). Zirconia had twice the wear resistance of PEEK (p value < 0.05). Zirconia was more color stable than PEEK (p value < 0.05). PEEK had more displacement resistance than zirconia (p value < 0.05). PEEK offers minimal abrasion, better stress modulation through plastic deformation, and good color stability, which make it a promising alternative to zirconia crown.","lubrication, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Differential atmospheric errors can only be neglected for distances at a certain extent. The network-based RTK (NRTK) resolves differential atmospheric errors and orbit errors from GNSS observations of a network of reference stations before sending the computed corrections to requested users. These coefficients of correction models are explicitly determined based upon network observations on common ambiguity level and coefficient of correction models; namely, Virtual Reference Station (VRS) observations, Flächen-Korrektur Parameters (FKP) standing for area correction parameters, Master-Auxiliary Concept (MAC) and Individualised-MAC (I-MAC). This study aims to evaluate performances of four main correction models from a reference station network in Thailand principally structured by the Royal Thai Survey Department. In this experiment, an identical antenna is used whiles four receivers are observed in order to determine and evaluate performances concurrently. Obstacles are constantly a challenge in GNSS observations; hence, it is included in this positioning estimations. It is found that, in the observed area without obstacles, percentage of fixed solutions is higher than 95% when VRS and I-MAC correction models are applied and greater than 75% with MAC and FKP. With obstacles, success rate percentage of fixed ambiguities using FKP is better than 50% while other models are less than 50%. The horizontal positioning accuracy is better than 5 centimetres in unobstructed conditions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Thus, power loss minimization plays an important role in a power distribution system. In this paper, the alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem is proposed to optimize the transmission loss taking into account system operating limits. The ACOPF is a nonlinear and nonconvex problem, so the ACOPF is computationally intractable in practice. Therefore, second-order cone programming (SOCP) hierarchy acquired from sum of squares (SOS) polynomials and exploitation of the network structure are used to reduce the complexity of computation. The proposed method was applied to 24-bus IEEE test cases. The results of the systems are presented and compared with the conventional ACOPF method.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Timely liver transplant (LT) may improve survival. We evaluated various indices for assessment of the severity of liver failure and their application for eligibility and timing of living donor LT (LDLT). Methods: Altogether 1021 patients were analyzed for the severity and organ failure at admission to determine transplant eligibility and 28 day survival with or without transplant. Results: The ACLF cohort [mean age 44 ± 12.2 years, males 81%) was of sick patients; 55% willing for LT at admission, though 63% of them were ineligible due to sepsis or organ failure. On day 4, recovery in sepsis and/or organ failure led to an improvement in transplant eligibility from 37% at baseline to 63.7%. Delay in LT up to 7 days led to a higher incidence of multiorgan failure (p < 0.01) contributing to 23% of the first week and 55% of all-cause 28-day mortality. In a matched cohort analysis, the actuarial survival with LT (n = 41) and conditional survival in the absence of transplant (n = 191) were comparable, when the condition, i.e., transplant was adjusted. The comparison curve showed differentiation in survival beyond 7 days (p < 0.01). Conclusions: ACLF is a rapidly progressive disease and risk stratification within the first week of hospitalization is needed. ‘Emergent LT’ should be defined in the first week in the ACLF patients; the transplant window for improving survival in a live donor setting.

It is shown that cauliflower-like concatemer LAMP products can mediate crystal etching of AgNPls, with a threefold signal enhancement versus linear dsDNA. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), an antimicrobial resistant bacterium that poses a formidable risk with persistently high mortality, is used as a model pathogen. Due to the excellent color contrast provided by AgNPls, the PAD allows qualitative analysis by the naked eye and quantitative analysis using a smartphone camera, with detection limits down to a single copy in just 30 min, and a linear response from 1 to 104 copies (R2 = 0.994). The entire assay runs in situ on the paper surface, which drastically simplifies operation of the device. This is the first demonstration of single copy detection using a colorimetric readout, and the developed PAD shows great promise for translation into an ultrasensitive gene-based point-of-care test for any infectious disease target, via modification of the LAMP primer set.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering, pharmacology","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Pharmaceutical Science"

In the current study, antibodies were investigated in patients recently diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 245 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection had been confirmed via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March and October 2020. Serum samples were acquired between 2 and 60 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. All specimens were tested simultaneously using an IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT), IgG nucleocapsid protein-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), IgG, and IgA spike protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Blood donor samples obtained in 2018 were used as negative controls. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT IgG were compared with the IgG immunoassays as standards. The RDT IgG exhibited 97.5% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity compared with a CMIA IgG, 98.4% sensitivity, and 78.8% specificity compared with an ELISA IgG. IgM, IgG, and IgA seropositivity rates were low between 1 and 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset or the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. IgM seropositivity rate began decreasing after 4 weeks, whereas IgG and IgA seropositivity rate remained at appreciable levels over the 8-week study period. No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was detected. Conclusions: IgG RDT alone or combined with molecular diagnostic tests may be useful for identifying recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Meanwhile the reverse jig—a RETAC jig with a top screen—is used to separate plastics lighter than water with different SGs. In this study, a novel method that combines the principle of reverse and hybrid jigs, called “reverse hybrid jig separation” was developed to separate plastics lighter than water having similar SGs but different surface wettabilities. The tests were carried out with wastes from an eco-cable wire recycling facility in Japan, which is composed of polyethylene (PE) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). The reverse hybrid jig separation results showed that bubble attachment to and detachment from plastic particles strongly influenced the separation efficiency. In addition, the effects of particle size on separation efficiency were also evaluated.","mixing and separation, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences","Control and Systems Engineering, Chemistry (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanical Engineering"

Statins are discussed in the context of these disorders, with particular focus on the putative mechanisms involved in their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Recent clinical data suggest that statins may have antidepressant properties, however given their interactions with many known biological pathways, it has not been fully elucidated which of these are the major determinants of clinical outcomes in mood disorders. Moreover, it remains unclear what the appropriate dose, or appropriate patient phenotype for adjunctive treatment may be. High quality randomised control trials in concert with complementary biological investigations are needed if the potential clinical effects of statins on mood disorders, as well as their biological correlates, are to be better understood.","genergyal, psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Behavioral Neuroscience"

To accomplish this goal, the distribution systems are improved and the control functions in PV inverter are also adopted. This paper proposes how to enhance the maximum PV system, called hosting capacity (HC) of distribution system, by using the control functions, i.e. cosphi(P), Q(U), and Q(U)/ P(U). Furthermore, an OLTC is brought to cooperate with the control functions in PV inverter to improve the HC of distribution system. The simulation data are based on typical distribution system in Thailand which is obtained from the utility. The network constraints are considered i.e. the line capacity and voltage rise due to main obstructions of PV system interconnections. The simulation results show that if a control system is added to PV inverter, the maximum amount of PV capacity connecting to the distribution grid will be higher, and if OLTC is installed into the distribution system, the maximum amount of PV capacity will be the highest.","electrical engineeringneering, genergyal, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Aspen Plus was used to carry out a thermodynamic investigation into the influence of various operating conditions on hydrogen production and process thermal efficiency. The steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C), the CaO to carbon molar ratio (CaO/C), the metal oxide to carbon molar ratio (MeO/C), the metal oxide composition (NiO:CuO), and the oxidising agent species were all shown to influence the process performance. The main findings were that; (1) the introduction of CaO reduces the potential for coke formation with predicted zero coke formation for CaO/C ratios > 0.4; (2) increasing amounts of metal oxide (MeO/C) and steam (S/C) enhance the hydrogen production yield and purity; (3) due to its involvement in an exothermic reaction, the presence of CuO allows for the reforming reactor to operate as an adiabatic reactor with an operating temperature within the range of 600 °C–700 °C; (4) an increase in the NiO:CuO ratio leads to an increase in methane conversion. With the operating conditions of S/C = 3, CaO/C = 1, MeO/C = 1, NiO:CuO = 0.9 and air as the oxidising agent, a hydrogen purity as high as 98% was predicted for the SE-CL-SMR process, along with the lowest observed CO2 production rate. Under the same conditions and using pinch analysis, the thermodynamic model prediction of the thermal process efficiency is reported as ca. 86%. This is significantly higher than the reported efficiency of 79% for the ‘Sorption-Enhanced Steam Methane Reforming’ (SE-SMR) process, predicted using similar thermodynamic models.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Bacopa monnieri extracts were previously found to exhibit chemical-genetic synthetic lethal effects in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model of colorectal cancer lacking Rad1p, a structural and functional homologue of human XPF. However, the mechanisms for B. monnieri extracts to limit proliferation and promote an apoptosis-like event in RAD1 deleted yeast was not elucidated. Our current analysis has revealed that B. monnieri extracts have the capacity to promote mutations in rad1Δ cells. In addition, the effects of B. monnieri extracts on rad1Δ yeast is linked to disruption of the vacuole, similar to the mammalian lysosome. The absence of RAD1 in yeast sensitizes cells to the effects of vacuole disruption and the release of proteases. The combined effect of increased DNA mutations and release of vacuolar contents appears to induce an apoptosis-like event that is dependent on the meta-caspase Yca1p. The toxicity of B. monnieri extracts is linked to sterol content, suggesting saponins may be involved in limiting the proliferation of yeast cells. Analysis of major constituents from B. monnieri identified a chemical-genetic interaction between bacopasaponin C and rad1Δ yeast. Bacopasaponin C may have potential as a drug candidate or serve as a model for the development of analogs for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This study examined the starch compositional, structural, and functional variability among five Thai glutinous rice cultivars, and the effect of molecular structure and composition on starch functionality was pinpointed. Findings: Amylose content, amylopectin chain-length distribution (CLD), and relative crystallinity were not different among the cultivars (p ≤.05), whereas RD14 possessed largest mean granule diameter. Conclusion temperature of gelatinization and peak viscosity (PV) were lowest in RD6 and RD10, respectively, while RD6, RD10, and RD14 had lower breakdown (BD) compared to others. Despite small variation within each parameter, multivariate analysis revealed the distinct characteristic of waxy donor, RD6, and RD10 compared to others. Proportion of amylopectin B1 chains and granule size showed negative correlation (r > 0.5) with PV and BD, respectively, whereas proportion of amylopectin B2 chains positively correlated (r > 0.5) with PV and final viscosity (FV). Conclusion: Amylopectin CLD and starch granule size were the key factors determining starch pasting properties among these waxy rice genotypes. Significance and novelty: Variations in composition, structure, and properties of Thai glutinous rice starches were observed, which could be adopted for a diverse array of end uses.","genergyal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, chemistry","Food Science, Organic Chemistry"

"A multi-objective approach to sugarcane harvest planning in Thailand: Balancing output maximization, grower equity, and supply chain efficiency","Jarumaneeroj P., Laosareewatthanakul N., Akkerman R.",2021-04-01,"Conflicting objectives, Multi-objective evolutionary, Multi-objective modeling, Production environments, Resource efficiencies, Resource requirements, Supply chain actors, Supply chain efficiency, Equity, Evolutionary algorithm, Harvest scheduling, Multi-objective, Sugarcane harvesting problem","This paper addresses a multi-objective sugarcane harvesting problem in Thailand, where several conflicting objectives and local restrictions are regarded as major obstacles to a sustainable sugar production environment. A multi-objective modeling approach that balances three different objectives of different key supply chain actors, namely (i) maximizing output in terms of total sugar production volume, (ii) maximizing grower equity in terms of a fair harvesting time-slot distribution, and (iii) maximizing supply chain efficiency in terms of a lower variability in resource requirements across the harvesting season, is introduced and solved by a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary genetic algorithm. To better help the algorithm generate efficient solutions forming the Pareto front, two local searches are also embedded and intermittently performed during algorithm execution. Based on the information of an operating mill in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, we have found that our approach produces solutions that are close to optimal in terms of production output. Nonetheless, by sacrificing a small amount of production output, these solutions provide significant improvements in terms of grower equity and supply chain resource efficiency, which are crucial for the survivability of involved actors.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Protective role of Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract on methylglyoxal-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to DNA,"Chayaratanasin P., Adisakwattana S., Thilavech T.",2021-12-01,"Animals, Antioxidants, Cattle, Clitoria, DNA Damage, Flowers, Glycosylation, Oxidation-Reduction, Plant Extracts, Protective Agents, Protein Carbonylation, Pyruvaldehyde, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Anthocyanins, Clitoria ternatea, Methylglyoxal, Oxidative DNA damage, Protein glycation","Background: Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl precursor for the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) associated with age-related diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Clitoria ternatea L. flower has been reported to possess antioxidant and antiglycating properties. Evidence indicates that the extract of Clitoria ternatea L. flower inhibits fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidative damage to bovine serum albumin (BSA). However, there is no evidence to support the inhibitory effect of CTE against MG-mediated protein glycation and oxidative damage to protein and DNA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether C. ternatea flower extract (CTE) prevents MG-induced protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage. Methods: The formation of fluorescent AGEs in BSA was evaluated using spectrofluorometer. The protein carbonyl and thiol group content were used for detecting protein oxidation. DNA strand breakage in a glycation model comprising of MG, lysine and Cu2+ or a free radical generator 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) systems was investigated using gel electrophoresis. Generation of superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals in the MG/lysine system was assessed by the cytochrome c reduction assay and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the MG-trapping ability. Results: In the BSA/MG system, CTE (0.25–1 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs and protein oxidation by reducing protein carbonyl content as well as preventing the protein thiol depletion. The concentration of CTE at 0.125–1 mg/mL prevented oxidative DNA cleavage in MG/lysine and AAPH systems associated with the inhibition of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical formation. It also directly trapped MG in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from 15 to 43%. Conclusions: The study findings suggest that the direct carbonyl trapping ability and the free radical scavenging activity of CTE are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the prevention of protein glycation and oxidative DNA damage.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical",Complementary and Alternative Medicine

(MA) roots are needed as the source of active stilbenes in the industrial production of traditional medicines and cosmeceuticals. A recent investigation demonstrated resveratrol and its derivatives to be promising anti-COVID-19 agents. However, conventional cultivation of MA does not meet the demand for its stilbenes, and root quality usually varies between crops. This study established the in vitro non-GMO root culture of MA and optimized the root density, precursor feeding, and elicitors for stilbene productivity. A root culture with optimal inoculum density (3 g/flask of 30 mL medium) accumulated mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol at 18.7 ± 1.00 mg/g, 136 ± 5.05 µg/g, and 41.6 ± 5.84 µg/g dry weight (DW), respectively. The feeding of L-tyrosine shortened the time required to reach the stilbene productive stage. Root cultures co-treated with 200 µM methyl jasmonate and 2 mg/mL yeast extract accumulated the highest contents of mulberroside A (30.3 ± 2.68 mg/g DW), oxyresveratrol (68.6 ± 3.53 µg/g DW), and resveratrol (10.2 ± 0.53 µg/g DW). In summary, root culture is a promising and sustainable source of stilbenes for the development of health products and agents for further investigation as potential anti-COVID-19 agents.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering"

The impact energy of the specimens was tested at 298, 253, 223, 213 K and measured using ASTM E23 standard. After austenitizing and tempering, the microstructure of the specimens showed carbide precipitation. Tempering at 773 K resulted in the highest hardness due to secondary hardening, while tempering at 923 K resulted in the lowest hardness due to brittle carbide precipitation at the grain boundary which caused softening of the matrix by decreasing the solute carbon content. By contrast, the change in impact energy is inversely proportional to the hardness values. The impact surface of specimens tempered at 573, 673 and 773 K revealed transgranular fracture; on the other hand, the impact surface of the specimen tempered at 923 K revealed intergranular fracture. From our experimental results, the appropriate hardening and tempering procedure of AISI 410 for low temperatures applications is selectable.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

When searching for real estate, users can register a concurrent interest in recent and prior projects. Thus, an approach to recommend cold-start and warm-start items simultaneously must be determined. Furthermore, unrequired membership and stop-by behavior cause real estate recommendations to have many cold-start and new users. This characteristic encourages the use of a content-based approach and a session-based recommendation system. Herein, we propose a real estate recommendation approach for solving the item cold-start problem with acceptable warm-start item recommendations in the many-cold-start-users scenario. We modify a session-based recommendation system and employ existing mechanisms to efficiently deal with sequential and context information for the next-interacted item's encoded attribute prediction. Subsequently, we use the nearest-neighbors approach using weighted cosine similarity to determine conforming candidates. We use Recall@K and MRR@K with the top-n recommendation to evaluate warm-start and cold-start item recommendations among different applied mechanisms and against the baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of efficiently integrating the information and the difficulty in performing well in warm-start and cold-start item recommendations simultaneously. Our proposed approach illustrates the capability of solving the item cold-start problem while yielding promising results in both recommendations although neither result is the best. We believe that our approach provides a suitable compromise between both recommendations and that it will benefit recommendation tasks focusing on both recommendations.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
"Attitudes towards Kratom use, decriminalization and the development of a community-based Kratom control mechanism in Southern Thailand","Charoenratana S., Anukul C., Aramrattana A.",2021-09-01,"Attitude, Humans, Illicit Drugs, Mitragyna, Plant Leaves, Thailand, Community participation, Cultural rights, Decriminalization, Kratom, Thailand","Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) is an indigenous plant of Southeast Asia, which has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Despite local communities in Southern Thailand viewing Kratom as a traditional remedy and not as an illicit drug, Thailand criminalized Kratom in 1943 which has led to tensions between government authorities and local communities. This study employed a mixed-method design to explore alternative ways to decriminalize Kratom, using a Participatory Action Research framework to develop a community charter to better manage Kratom in Tambon Namphu, a rural sub-district in Southern Thailand. Quantitative data consisted of face-to-face surveys with 457 Tambon Namphu residents, 104 students and teachers and on-line self-complete surveys conducted with 1,058 people outside Tambon Namphu. Qualitative data were collected using focus groups, in-depth interviews and through public forums conducted with Tambon Namphu residents. Survey results indicate that most participants agreed with decriminalization of both Kratom cultivation and consumption and typically reported positive attitudes towards people who use Kratom. The most common reasons for supporting Kratom decriminalization were Kratom's perceived benefits for work productivity and health. People had more positive attitudes towards the consumption of fresh Kratom leaves than Kratom decoctions which were deemed more harmful. Participatory action research methods were used to pilot the development of a community consensus framework for Kratom control in Donsai, a village of 127 households. Following successful piloting, the community consensus framework on Kratom control was adopted in Donsai, adapted across Tambon Namphu and then extended to cover 135 villages across Thailand.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, medical","Medicine (miscellaneous), Health Policy"

The sensing response of the sensor is characterized by using a full-vectorial finite element method (FEM) for the detailed analysis of DSCPS, where a porous TiO2 (P-TiO2) layer is used as low index sensing material on the top of thin Ag film. The design of the proposed sensor is based on the wavelength modulation technique. A maximum sensitivity of 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 1.35 nm/% can be achieved for 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% volume fraction of IPA, respectively, with a 30% porosity of TiO2, which is the maximum filled porous voids that provides the highest sensitivity.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The medical records from animals visiting Chiang Mai University Small Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016 were reviewed. In total, 203 dogs and 49 cats with urinary tract diseases that had samples submitted for bacterial culture were identified;198 and 24 bacterial isolates were recovered from dogs' and cats' submitted samples, respectively. At least one episode of bacterial UTI was detected in 75.4% (95% CI: 69.4–81.3) of dogs and in 40.8% (95% CI: 26.6–55.1) of cats with UTI and submitted urine cultures. Of 242 submitted urinary samples from dogs and 60 urinary samples from cats, bacteria were identified in 74.0% (95% CI: 68.4–79.5) and 38.3% (95% CI: 26.0–50.6), respectively. The most common pathogen of bacteria positive cultured from dogs was Staphylococcus spp. (30.3%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.7%), and Proteus spp. (13.6%). For cats, the most common pathogen was Pseudomonas spp. (25.0%), followed by E. coli (20.8%) and Proteus spp. (16.7%). Staphylococcus spp. isolates from dogs and Proteus spp. isolates from cats were highly susceptible to Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) at 88% and 75%, respectively. Of all isolated bacteria, 67.1% of the bacteria from dogs and 83.3% from cats were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The proportion of MDR-bacterial urinary tract infections in dogs and cats with urologic problems in this study was high. This observation raises concerns regarding the potential of zoonotic transmission of MDR-bacteria from these companion animals. The results suggested that AMC remains a good empirical drug for treating UTIs in dogs in this region.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Epidemiology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron-transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron-transfer ability often suffers from the formation of a stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic-radical-containing viologen-derived ETMs, by which the electron-transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen-derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2′-bipyridine-based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post-quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat-ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site-isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 μmol h−1 g−1) and sustained performances when compared to a single-module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron transfer in photochemical processes through the multi-component cooperation.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Results from clinical trials showed that it had better renal and bone mineral outcomes compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). However, as we have seen with TDF, side effects from the new medication can be more prevalent and recognized after extensive use in real world situations. Sporadic cases of acute kidney injury in patients using TAF have started to emerge. Case presentation: We report a case of 49-year-old Thai, HIV treatment-experienced female with hypertension presented with worsening renal function after switching her antiretroviral regimen from TDF, emtricitabine (FTC), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to TAF, FTC and dolutegravir (DTG) for 3 months.

The possible causes of acute kidney injury and nephrotoxicity from TAF for this patient were discussed. We have extensively reviewed all published case reports of TAF-associated nephrotoxicity and summarized the essential information in this article. Conclusion: Although TAF has less nephrotoxicity compared with TDF; renal function should always be monitored after the initiation of both drugs. Future large cohort studies are required to identify the risk factors of TAF-associated nephrotoxicity and to design an effective preventive strategy.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Virology, Pharmacology (medical)"

This study demonstrated that the use of polymeric mixture containing different theophylline loadings (10, 30 and 60% w/w) in combination with multiple pharmaceutical polymers (hydroxy propyl cellulose (HPC), Eudragit® EPO, Kollidon® VA 64) and disintegrant (sodium starch glycolate) were successfully hot melt-extruded and FDM printed with no plasticizer. Rheological measurement was performed to understand the critical process parameters (CPP) while the mechanical property of extrudable and printable filaments was investigated by 3-point test for the formulation development. Surprisingly, HPC were found to be superior as a flexibility modifier in all printable filaments. A range of pharmaceutical characterizations were examined to ensure the critical quality attributes (CQA). Characteristic dissolution profiles were obtained. D-optimal mixture design of 17 formulations suggested that theophylline release was considerably affected by the combined action of different excipients and could predict the optimum formulation with the required quality target product profile (QTPP) in pharmacopoeia (85% release at 30 min). Therefore, this can be a useful platform to develop immediate release products for a specific group of patients commercially.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science
"Premature Senescence and Telomere Shortening Induced by Oxidative Stress From Oxalate, Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate, and Urine From Patients With Calcium Oxalate Nephrolithiasis","Chuenwisad K., More-krong P., Tubsaeng P., Chotechuang N., Srisa-Art M., Storer R.J., Boonla C.",2021-10-21,"Aged, Aging, Premature, Calcium Oxalate, Cell Line, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16, DNA Damage, Female, Humans, Hydrogen Peroxide, Male, Middle Aged, Nephrolithiasis, Oxalates, Oxidative Stress, Telomere Shortening, Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1, calcium oxalate, cellular senescence, kidney calculi, nephrolithiasis, oxalates, oxidative stress, urine","Oxidative stress, a well-known cause of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), is increased in patients with calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones (KS). Oxalate and calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) induce oxidative stress in renal tubular cells, but to our knowledge, their effect on SIPS has not yet been examined. Here, we examined whether oxalate, COM, or urine from patients with CaOx KS could induce SIPS and telomere shortening in human kidney (HK)-2 cells, a proximal tubular renal cell line. Urine from age- and sex-matched individuals without stones was used as a control. In sublethal amounts, H2O2, oxalate, COM, and urine from those with KS evoked oxidative stress in HK-2 cells, indicated by increased protein carbonyl content and decreased total antioxidant capacity, but urine from those without stones did not. The proportion of senescent HK-2 cells, as indicated by SA-βgal staining, increased after treatment with H2O2, oxalate, COM, and urine from those with KS. Expression of p16 was higher in HK-2 cells treated with H2O2, oxalate, COM, and urine from those with KS than it was in cells treated with urine from those without stones and untreated controls. p16 was upregulated in the SA-βgal positive cells. Relative telomere length was shorter in HK-2 cells treated with H2O2, oxalate, COM, and urine from those with KS than that in cells treated with urine from those without stones and untreated controls. Transcript expression of shelterin components (TRF1, TRF2 and POT1) was decreased in HK-2 cells treated with H2O2, oxalate, COM, and urine from those with KS, in which case the expression was highest. Urine from those without KS did not significantly alter TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 mRNA expression in HK-2 cells relative to untreated controls. In conclusion, oxalate, COM, and urine from patients with CaOx KS induced SIPS and telomere shortening in renal tubular cells. SIPS induced by a lithogenic milieu may result from upregulation of p16 and downregulation of shelterin components, specifically POT1, and might contribute, at least in part, to the development of CaOx KS.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Genotyping of Entamoeba nuttalli strains from the wild rhesus macaques of Myanmar and comparison with those from the wild rhesus macaques of Nepal and China,"Mon H.M., Feng M., Pattanawong U., Kosuwin R., Yanagi T., Kobayashi S., Putaporntip C., Jongwutiwes S., Cheng X., Tachibana H.",2021-08-01,"Animals, China, DNA, Ribosomal, Entamoeba, Entamoebiasis, Feces, Genotype, Macaca mulatta, Microsatellite Repeats, Monkey Diseases, Myanmar, Nepal, Phylogeny, RNA, Transfer, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Axenized, Entamoeba nuttalli, Genotyping, Locus, Myanmar, Rhesus macaque","Entamoeba nuttalli found in macaques is phylogenetically the closest species to Entamoeba histolytica and is potentially pathogenic. In this study, the prevalence of Entamoeba infections was examined in wild rhesus macaques by examining 73 and 90 fecal samples collected from two sites, Popa Taung Kalat (PTK) and Pho Win Taung (PWT), in Myanmar. The positive rates of E. nuttalli detected using PCR were 49% and 31% in PTK and PWT, respectively, but no infections of E. histolytica and E. moshkovskii were found. Entamoeba dispar was detected in 6% of samples only from PWT. Positive rates of E. chattoni and E. coli were both 70% in PWT and 67% and 79% in PTK, respectively. Six E. nuttalli strains from PTK and eight from PWT were obtained in the culture with xenic medium and then, one and two strains, respectively, were axenized and finally cloned. The genotypic analysis of serine-rich protein genes revealed two genotypes each in both sites. The genotypes found in five of six strains from PTK were similar to those from the strains found in Nepal, whereas the remaining one from PTK and two from PWT were similar to those obtained from macaques in China. The sequence of the 18S rDNA of strains with these four genotypes was identical to that of the strains from China. Six loci of tRNA-linked short tandem repeats were analyzed for further genotyping of the strains. Although there were two types in locus A-L in PTK isolates, one of each type for PTK and PWT was found in the other loci, including locus A-L in PWT strains. These results demonstrated that the E. nuttalli strains from Myanmar are closer to the strains from macaques in China rather than those from macaques in Nepal.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary parasitology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

This paper surveyed the presence of antibiotics, ARB, and ARGs in aquaculture waters and demonstrated their removal by ferrate (Fe(VI), FeO42-). Tetracyclines were the most prevalent antibiotics, followed by quinolones and β-lactam. The bacterial resistance rates to three antibiotics were ordered as follows: amoxicillin (AMX) > oxytetracycline (OTC) > enrofloxacin (ENR). Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla, while sul1 and sul2 were the predominant ARGs. sul2 was positively correlated with Proteobacteria. Water quality parameters significantly influenced the dissemination of tetracycline resistance genes in aquacultures due to high organic waste accumulation. The removal efficiency of antibiotics by Fe(VI) depended on the structural moieties of antibiotics, with phenol-containing antibiotics more thoroughly oxidized (i.e., OTC) than amine-containing (ENR and AMX) antibiotics. Greater removal of antibiotics in aquaculture waters suggested that the constituents of farming water enhances the efficacy of antibiotics removal by Fe(VI). An acidic pH environment enhanced Fe(VI) inactivation of ARB over the circumneutral pH. The presented results are intended to improve aquaculture managing practices to minimize the antibiotic proliferation in aquaculture waters and the environment.","genetics and molecular biology; prokaryotic genetics; prokaryotic biochemistryistryhemical genetics, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The success of covalent bond formation between PLA matrix and mTPS phase is clarified by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy with 1H–1H TOCSY mode. This chemically bound PLA with starch gives the remarkable compatibility in the PLA/mTPS film, with not only a decreased glass transition temperature (47 °C) but also an increased crystallinity of PLA (Χc of 50%). It consequently increases oxygen barrier significantly and also enhances the film flexibility as observed from the drastic increase of elongation at break (from 3% to 50%). Moreover, the PLA/mTPS 60/40 (w/w) film exhibits the accelerated degradation as compared with pure PLA film.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

First, the complexation between Cu(II) and 1,10-phenanthroline ligand was adsorptively accumulated onto a paper that is directly in contact with the diamond electrode and measured via square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the peak current was proportional to the concentration of Cu(II) in the range of 0.4–70 ng mL−1, and the detection limit was found to be 0.1 ng mL−1. Most importantly, this platform can be successfully applied to detect trace Cu(II) in different water samples (drinking water, tap water, groundwater and river water) with satisfactory results. Thus, the proposed d-PAD could be a highly efficient platform for trace Cu(II) determination in environmental samples.","water engineeringneering, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Electrochemistry"

The direct postgrafting of dithioglycol to the zinc complex node of ZIF-8 (ZF-SH) can increase the mesopore structures that enhance inner pore accessibility; this increase is a critical property required for excellent adsorption of I-THMs. The synergetic adsorptive interactions consist of Lewis acid-base interactions via the Zn-Zn complex, ion-dipole interactions involving the protonated hydroxyl and thiol groups, and hydrophobic interactions at the imidazole ring. In contrast to ZF-SH, the (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxy functionalized silica coating on ZIF-8 (ZF-Si-SH) causes a lower thiol moiety and a steric effect that is reflected in its lower adsorption capacity. In both single and mixed solutions, the small molecular size and hydrophobic nature of I-THMs can promote better adsorption capacity on all thiol-modified ZIF-8, while the minus dipole charge distribution of the I-THMs structure plays a more critical role in selective adsorption on pristine ZIF-8. Interestingly, the dehalogenation of triiodomethane to diiodomethane due to a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction can be accelerated by the thiol functionalized silica layer on ZIF-8.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

There was no scientific evidence reporting their antidiarrheal effect and underpinning mechanisms. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the anti-secretory activity of these two compounds in vitro. The inhibitory effect of BE and AT on cAMP-induced Cl- secretion was evaluated by Ussing chamber in human intestinal epithelial (T84) cells. Short-circuit current (ISC) and apical Cl- current (ICl-) were measured after adding indirect and direct cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel activator. MTT assay was used to determine cellular cytotoxicity. Protein-ligand interaction was investigated by in silico molecular docking analysis. BE, but not AT concentration-dependently (IC50 of ~1.05 µM) reduced cAMP-mediated, CFTRinh-172 inhibitable Cl− secretion as determined by transepithelial ISC across a monolayer of T84 cells. Potency of CFTR-mediated ICl- inhibition by BE did not change with the use of different CFTR activators suggesting a direct blockage of the channel active site(s). Pretreatment with BE completely prevented cAMP-induced ICl-. Furthermore, BE at concentrations up to 200 µM (24 h) had no effect on T84 cell viability. In silico studies indicated that BE could best dock onto dephosphorylated structure of CFTR at ATP-binding pockets in nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) 2 region.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of tobacco and alcohol co-consumption in Thailand, modelling the two behaviours jointly and identifying whether they complemented or substituted each other. Design and Methods: Data were extracted from the 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017 waves of the nationally representative Tobacco and Alcohol Consumption Survey in Thailand. A bivariate ordered probit model, under which the frequencies of tobacco and alcohol consumption were jointly estimated, was performed on the repeated cross-sectional sample as well as each of the cross-sectional samples. Results: Based on the repeated cross-sectional sample (n = 411 981), the analyses suggested that tobacco and alcohol consumption were complementary behaviours. The predicted conditional probabilities revealed that the more frequently one drank, the higher the likelihood that he/she also smoked at a higher frequency, and vice versa. Discussion and Conclusions: Given the complementary nature of tobacco and alcohol consumption in Thailand, tobacco- and alcohol-prevention strategies should be realigned and better co-ordinated for greater efficiency. The net impacts of a given tobacco or alcohol policy should be incorporated into the optimal policy design to avoid duplication of efforts. Also, future studies of tobacco and alcohol consumption should consider modelling the two behaviours together using a joint estimation approach.","medical, sociology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Health (social science)"

However, most drought-related studies on high-latitude boreal forests (>50°N) have been conducted in North America, with few studies quantifying the response in European and Eurasian boreal forests. Here, we tested how daily whole-tree transpiration (Q, Liters day−1) and Q normalized for mean daytime vapor pressure deficit (QDZ, Liters day−1 kPa−1) were affected by the historic 2018 drought in Europe. More specifically, we examined how tree species, size, and topographic position affected drought response in high-latitude mature boreal forest trees. We monitored 30 Pinus sylvestris (pine) and 30 Picea abies (spruce) trees distributed across a topographic gradient in northern Sweden. In general, pine showed a greater QDZ control compared to spruce during periods of severe drought (standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index: SPEI < −1.5), suggesting that the latter are more sensitive to drought. Overall, QDZ reductions (using non-drought QDZ as reference) were less pronounced in larger trees during severe drought, but there was a species-specific pattern: QDZ reductions were greater in pine trees at high elevations and greater in spruce trees at lower elevations. Despite lower QDZ during severe drought, drought spells were interspersed with small precipitation events and overcast conditions, and QDZ returned to pre-drought conditions relatively quickly. This study highlights unique species-specific responses to drought, which are additionally driven by a codependent interaction among tree size, relative topographic position, and unique regional climate conditions.","evaporation and transpiration, environmental","Global and Planetary Change, Environmental Chemistry, Ecology, Environmental Science (all)"

Existing assays have suboptimal sensitivity because of insufficient primer coverage of all possible rearrangements. Objective: Develop higher sensitivity clonality assays targeting the TRG, delta (TRD), and beta (TRB) loci in cats. Animals: Cats with histopathologically confirmed lymphoma (n = 89), non-lymphoma (n = 35), and possible hepatic small cell lymphoma (n = 31). Methods: Molecular clonality assay development utilizing our recently reported topology and expressed repertoire data of the T cell receptor loci in cats. Determination of clonality status of lymphoma, non lymphoma, and possible hepatic small cell lymphoma samples, and calculation of assay sensitivity and specificity. Results: The new multiplex TRG assay yielded the highest sensitivity (95.5%). All assays yielded 100% specificity except for the new multiplex TRG assay (97.3%). The combination of the new TRG and TRB assays yielded sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 97.0%. The new TRG assay detected clonality in 17/31 possible small cell lymphoma livers, whereas an existing TRG assay detected clonality in 6/31 livers. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The assessment of multiple T cell loci compensates for the potential shortcomings of individual assays. Using a combination of molecular clonality assays will increase the overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma in cats, especially intestinal, and hepatic small cell lymphoma. Hepatic small cell lymphomas detected by the new TRG assay utilized rarely expressed V and J genes not recognized by previous assays, likely indicating unique biology of hepatic small cell lymphoma in cats.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia is hence a common perioperative complication, and is associated with coagulopathy, increased surgical site infection, delayed drug metabolism, prolonged recovery, and shivering. However, surveys across the world have shown poor compliance to perioperative temperature management guidelines. Therefore, we evaluated the prevalent practices and attitudes to perioperative temperature management in the Asia–Pacific region, and determined the individual and institutional factors that lead to noncompliance. Methods: A 40-question anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to anesthesiologists and anesthesia trainees in six countries in the Asia–Pacific (Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, India and South Korea). Participants were polled about their current practices in patient warming and temperature measurement across the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods. Questions were also asked regarding various individual and environmental barriers to compliance. Results: In total, 1154 valid survey responses were obtained and analyzed. 279 (24.2%) of respondents prewarm, 508 (44.0%) perform intraoperative active warming, and 486 (42.1%) perform postoperative active warming in the majority of patients. Additionally, 531 (46.0%) measure temperature preoperatively, 767 (67.5%) measure temperature intraoperatively during general anesthesia, and 953 (82.6%) measure temperature postoperatively in the majority of patients. The availability of active warming devices in the operating room (p < 0.001, OR 10.040), absence of financial restriction (p < 0.001, OR 2.817), presence of hospital training courses (p = 0.011, OR 1.428), and presence of a hospital SOP (p < 0.001, OR 1.926) were significantly associated with compliance to intraoperative active warming. Conclusions: Compliance to international perioperative temperature management guidelines in Asia–Pacific remains poor, especially in small hospitals. Barriers to compliance were limited temperature management equipment, lack of locally-relevant standard operating procedures and training. This may inform international guideline committees on the needs of developing countries, or spur local anesthesiology societies to publish their own national guidelines.","anesthesiology, medical",Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine

Strategies for reducing the dielectric loss while keeping large dielectric constants are needed for various electrical applications of CCTO. This work aims to reduce the loss by means of doping preferentially oriented CCTO films with Fe3+ ions. Highly oriented undoped and Fe-doped calcium copper titanate (Fe-doped CCTO) thin films were fabricated by synthesizing CCTO on LaAlO3(1 0 0) and NdGaO3(1 0 0) substrates via a sol-gel spin casting method. The films with different Fe-doping concentrations (0, 1.6 and 2.6 wt%) were structurally and chemically characterized via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that our doped CCTO films had a cubic perovskite structure with well-defined preferential orientations of (h00) and (hh0) on LAO and NGO substrates, respectively. Preferentially oriented films having room temperature dielectric constants on the order of 1000 in conjunction with values of loss tangent smaller than 0.012 in the frequency range of 50 Hz-2 MHz were achieved.

We conducted a multi-site cross-sectional study among persons living with HIV (PLWH) to desrcibe technology use among PLWH in the US and the association between social media use and body-mass index (BMI). Our primary predictor variable was social media use. Our primary outcome was BMI measured through height and weight. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic profiles of the study participants and linear regression models were used to analyze associations between the outcome and predictor variables controlling for demographic characteristics. Study participants (N = 606) across 6 study sites in the United States were predominately 50–74 years old (67%). Thirty-three percent of study participants had a normal weight (BMI 18.5–25), 33% were overweight (BMI 25–30), and 32% were obese (BMI > 30). Participants used several social media sites with Facebook (45.6%) predominating. Social media use was associated with higher BMI in study participants (p <.001) and this effect persisted, although not as strongly, when limiting the analysis to those who only those who used Facebook (p =.03). Further consideration of social factors that can be ameliorated to improve health outcomes is timely and needed.","sociology, psychology, medical","Health (social science), Social Psychology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Historically, there has been a lack of pathobiological understanding of PTCL. With the exception of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, patients with PTCL have less favorable outcomes, with most patients relapsing shortly after conventional anthracycline-containing multi-agent chemotherapy. The standard management approach for PTCL involves induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL have dismal outcomes and limited treatment options despite the available novel agents, therefore remaining a critical unmet need. By virtue of advancement in cancer biology over the recent years, the treatment landscape of PTCL has gradually evolved from conventional chemotherapy based on solely morphological diagnosis toward more individualized therapies by integrating molecular attributes of PTCL to the traditional treatment paradigm. We are at the edge of witnessing a paradigm shift in PTCL management.",medical,"Oncology, Pharmacology (medical)"
Effect of compression ratio and original wood density on pressing characteristics and physical and mechanical properties of thermally compressed coconut wood,"Srivaro S., Lim H., Li M., Jantawee S., Tomad J.",2021-09-13,"Low density coconut wood, Lower density, Parallel to grain, Perpendicular to grain, Physical and mechanical properties, Pressing characteristic, Shears strength, Structural applications, Thermal compressions, Wood density, Low density coconut wood, Physical and mechanical properties, Pressing characteristics, Structural application, Thermal compression","This experimental study aims to improve the engineering properties of coconut wood by using a thermal compression method (TM). The effects of original wood density and compression ratio on the pressing characteristic as well as physical and mechanical properties of thermally densified coconut wood were evaluated. Coconut wood boards obtained from the plantation located in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand, were sorted into low-density (359 ± 36 kg/m3) and medium-density (532 ± 35 kg/m3) groups. They were compressed by 25%, 40%, 55%, and 70% of their original thicknesses under a clamping pressure of 19.6 MPa (pressure gauge), at a temperature of 140 °C for 15 min. The physical and mechanical properties of the densified specimens were measured and compared with the control group specimens. Low-density specimens could be compressed with a higher degree of densification without shape distortion. Thermal compression improved bending strength, modulus of elasticity, compressive strength parallel to grain, and perpendicular-to-grain shear strength up to 125%, 54%, 112%, and 129%, respectively, for low-density wood and 47%, 13%, 41%, and 58%, respectively, for medium density wood. However, the densification did not improve parallel-to-grain shear strength. When the low-density and medium-density wood were compressed to the same density, the densified specimens manufactured from the medium-density group showed more improved dimensional stability, shear strength, and bending properties than those manufactured from the low-density group, while their parallel-to-grain compressive strength properties were not significantly different. However, at the same density level, the natural wood mechanically outperformed the densified wood except for the perpendicular-to-grain shear strength, parallel-to-grain compressive strength, and bending strength perspectives. Thus, the experimental results indicate that the densified coconut wood can be used for structural applications where parallel-to-grain compressive strength or perpendicular-to-grain shear strength is critical.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

In this study, the efficiency of the new isolate Sporolactobacillus terrae SBT-1 for producing d-lactic acid under challenge conditions was investigated. The isolate SBT-1 exhibited superior activity in fermenting a very high glucose or sucrose concentration to d-lactic acid compared to the other S. terrae isolates previously reported in the literature; therefore, SBT-1 could overcome the limitations of effective lactic acid production. In batch cultivation using 360 g/L glucose, SBT-1 produced 290.30 g/L d-lactate with a sufficiently high glucose conversion yield of 86%, volumetric productivity of 3.02 g/L h, and optical purity of 96.80% enantiomer excess. SBT-1 could also effectively utilize 440 g/L sucrose as a sole carbon source to produce 276.50 g/L lactic acid with a conversion yield of 90%, a production rate of 2.88 g/L h, and an optical purity of 98%. d-Lactic acid fermentation by two other related producers, S. inulinus NRIC1133T and S. terrae NRIC0357T, was compared with fermentation by isolate SBT-1. The experimental data revealed that SBT-1 possessed the ability to ferment relatively high glucose or sucrose concentrations to d-lactic acid without obvious catabolite repression and byproduct formation compared to the two reference strains. In draft genome sequencing of S. terrae SBT-1, the results provided here can promote further study to overcome the current limitations for the industrial-scale production of d-lactic acid.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

The microplastic abundance ranged in 300–900 and 33–400 items/kg dry weight in the dry and the rainy seasons, respectively, indicating that the estuary is moderately contaminated with microplastics. The most abundant polymer types were rayon and polyester with colored fibers, suggesting that the microplastics deposited in this area originate mainly from washing effluents. Additionally, our findings show that the microplastic distribution is significantly governed by hydrodynamic energy in the estuary. This provides basic information for a better understanding of the fate of microplastics within estuary, and for management actions to address microplastics in urban estuary.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; estuarine, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

Decne. (GI), is an ethnomedicinal plant that has been used for diabetic treatment since ancient times. One of the anti-diabetic mechanisms is possibly related to the actions of triterpene glycoside, (3β, 16β)-16,28-dihydroxyolean-12-en-3-yl-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (GIA1) in decreasing carbohydrate digestive enzymes and intestinal glucose absorption in the gut system. Aims of the study: To observe the amount of GIA1 in GI leaf extracts obtained from different ethanol concentrations and to investigate the anti-hyperglycemic mechanisms of the extracts and GIA1. Materials and methods: The crude extracts were prepared using 50%v/v to 95%v/v ethanol solutions and used for GIA1 isolation. The anti-hyperglycemic models included in our study examined the inhibitory activities of α-amylase/α-glucosidase and intestinal glucose absorption related to sodium glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) using Caco-2 cells. Results: GIA1 was found about 8%w/w to 18%w/w in the GI extract depending on ethanol concentrations. The GI extracts and GIA1 showed less inhibitory activities on α-amylase. The extracts from 75%v/v and 95%v/v ethanol and GIA1 significantly delayed the glycemic absorption by lowering α-glucosidase activity and glucose transportation of SGLT1. However, the 50%v/v ethanolic extract markedly decreased the α-glucosidase activity than the SGLT1 function. Conclusion: Differences in the GIA1 contents and anti-glycemic properties of the GI leaf extract was dependent on ethanol concentrations. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the 75%v/v and 95%v/v ethanolic extracts on α-glucosidase and SGLT1 were relevant to GIA1 content.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Therefore, the detection method would be crucial to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus-infected patients. In this study, CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection was applied for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus, and influenza B virus which would be a practical and attractive application for screening of patients with COVID-19 and influenza in areas with limited resources. The limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B detection was 10, 103, and 103 copies/reaction, respectively. Moreover, the assays yielded no cross-reactivity against other respiratory viruses. The results revealed that the detection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 by using RT-RPA and CRISPR-Cas12a technology reaches 96.23% sensitivity and 100% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The sensitivity for influenza virus A and B detections was 85.07% and 94.87%, respectively. In addition, the specificity for influenza virus A and B detections was approximately 96%. In conclusion, the RT-RPA with CRISPR-Cas12a assay was an effective method for the screening of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 which could be applied to detect other infectious diseases in the future.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

The typical hydroxide materials are used as precursors for developing lithium-containing bulk NCM oxide compositions upon calcination with lithium salts at higher temperatures and used as viable cathodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, the lithium-deficient typical NCM oxide composite (LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2or NCM-523) with a disordered structure was found to have superior electrocatalytic activity than its intact original structure for the water splitting reaction. Herein, we have elaborately investigated the electrocatalytic activity of the typical NCM hydroxide materials without lithium for the two significant compositions, viz., NCM-523 and NCM-811, prepared by a simple co-precipitation method for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte for the first time. Interestingly, the NCM-811 composite exhibits improved catalytic activity with the lowest onset potential (∼1.5 V) and Tafel slope (∼91.7 mV dec-1) for better OER kinetics, whereas the NCM-523 composite exhibits a slightly higher onset potential (∼1.55 V) and Tafel slope (∼175.6 mV dec-1). The ideal composition showed a stable catalytic performance of 25 h continuous water electrolysis. This work can pave ways for the progress of plentiful multi-transition-metal-based hydroxides with virtually tunable compositions for cutting-edge affordable electrocatalytic materials.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

This is unsurprising as there is limited evidence on the benefit of routine spirometry in improving clinical decision making and/or outcomes for children. We hypothesised that using spirometry for children being evaluated for respiratory diseases impacts on clinical decision making and/or improves patient-related outcome measures (PROMs) and/or quality of life (QoL), compared with not using spirometry. Methods and analysis We are undertaking a randomised controlled trial (commenced in March 2020) that will include 106 children (aged 4-18 years) recruited from respiratory clinics at Queensland Children's Hospital, Australia. Inclusion criteria are able to perform reliable spirometry and a parent/guardian who can complete questionnaire(s). Children (1:1 allocation) are randomised to clinical medical review with spirometry (intervention group) or without spirometry (control group) within strata of consultation status (new/review), and cough condition (present/absent). The primary outcome is change in clinical decision making. The secondary outcomes are change in PROM scores, opinions regarding spirometry and degree of diagnosis certainty. Intergroup differences of these outcomes will be determined by χ 2 test or unpaired t-test (or Mann-Whitney if not normally distributed). Change in outcomes within the control group after review of spirometry will also be assessed by McNemar's test or paired t-test/Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Continuous application (Mode 1) and two modes of intermittent application (Mode 2 and Mode 3) were conducted for 10 weeks. The results indicated that while the final efficiencies of chloride extraction on three modes were approximate, the charge efficiency, which is the content of chloride removed per one unit charge applied, was much greater on samples using Mode 2 and Mode 3 than that in Mode 1. Portlandite content in concrete at the electrodes increased after the treatment. The decomposition of C-S-H was proportional to the cumulative applied charge number. By using a much less applied charge number, Mode 2 and Mode 3 caused less decomposition of C-S-H in concrete than that in Mode 1. The accumulation of NaOH in concrete near the steel reinforcement was observed. Intermittent applications can apparently alleviate the adverse impacts of ECE treatment on C-S-H. Furthermore, the total cumulative charge number employed should not exceed 800–900 A h/m2.","mixing and separation, engineering, Materials Science","Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

At the end of fermentation, the yield of 93% of ethanol was obtained. In situ transesterification of spent biomass for methyl ester production was performed using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as solvent and the optimum conditions were 5 mL DMC/g biomass, 12% (w/w) catalyst, 1% (w/w) water addition, 50 °C and 36 h. In addition to methyl ester as a main product, glycerol carbonate, glycerol dicarbonate and glycerol were also formed as by-products which have high industrial values. The study further compared the one-way method and the integrated method in which Botryococcus sp. showed higher efficiency on both bioethanol and methyl ester production using integrated method.

Because of their unique characteristics, these extended surfactant contains a carboxylate head group and together with ethylene oxide groups inserted between the alkyl tail and carboxylate head group. They tend to outperform with a low precipitation tendency at high brine conditions, which is an excellent property for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. Interestingly, the solution pH is a factor affecting the carboxylate surfactant's properties relating to change in the foam characteristics. In this study, the impacts of varying pH from 3 to 11 of the surfactant systems (0.5 wt%) with and without the presence of 100 ppm silica nanoparticles (SNPs) on the foam behavior were evaluated and discussed in terms of foamability, foam stability, apparent rates of liquid drainage, foam bubble size, and bubble size distribution at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). For a continuous-feed sand pack column, the foam system with the SNPs at pH of 9 had the highest foam stability as a result of the largest foam film thickness (102 μm) and the smallest bubble size (333 μm). This condition also resulted in the highest crude oil recovery, accounted for 53.8% of the oil recovery by foam flooding and about 96.3% in the total oil recovery. In addition, the carboxylate extended surfactant systems with SNPs showed a noteworthy result of lower adsorption onto Ottawa sand compared with the system without added SNPs at the same pH value due to the competitive adsorption onto the SNPs and sand surface. This led to the reduction in surfactant losses onto the sand, which is highly beneficial for surfactant foam flooding in enhanced oil recovery process.","oil field chemistryicals; enhanced recovery; surfactants, petroleum engineeringneering, hydrocarbons, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

The control objective is to minimize the operating cost and take into account of electrical load shaving and thermal comfort of users. To ensure that thermal comfort is well regulated, we utilize the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) as an indicator and determine an acceptable bound of a desired set-point temperature. The control design consists of two layers, namely, a supervisory control (SC) layer and a model predictive control (MPC) layer. For the SC layer, we explore a configuration for the SC layer including the choice of predesign controller, the analysis of steady-state response, and the analysis of the possible range of the set-point temperature. We incorporate the effect of set-point temperature, air velocity, outside air temperature, heat load inside zone onto the HVAC electrical power. Then, we search for an optimal profile of the set-point temperature that minimizes a weighted sum of a total operating cost (TOC) and a thermal comfort cost (TCC). Moreover, exploration of trade-off between TOC and TCC helps us to achieve both control objectives efficiently. For the MPC layer, we formulate the control design with the objective of tracking the optimal set-point temperature and minimizing the control inputs. We apply the proposed control design to a complex dynamical model of HVAC system with volumetric flow rate, electrical power of heat exchanger, and removed moisture as control variables. When the allowable PMV of the zone is specified within 0.5, the TOC of the proposed supervisory MPC is reduced by 12.46% compared with that of the nominal operation. The maximum electricity demand of HVAC system is reduced by 13.43% and the electrical power profile is smoothly shaved under the proposed control scheme. Furthermore, the zone relative humidity is well regulated which corresponds to the assumption in the supervisory control.","heat exchange, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

From the tensile testing results, elongation at break of the blends increased with an increase in the amount of triblock copolymer and with the length of the PLA end block. The blend without the copolymer showed elongation at break of 60.54%, whereas the blend with 3 wt% of PLA–NR–PLA prepared from pre-PLA with M¯ n of ~ 9700 g/mol showed elongation at break of 199.38%. This was about a 300% increase. The highest impact strength of 79.58 kJ/m2 (400% higher than neat PLA) was also found for the blend containing 3 wt% of PLA–NR–PLA with the longest PLA end block. A reduction in the diameter and well dispersion of the rubber particles in the PLA matrix were seen in micrographs taken with a scanning electron microscope. In general, after the addition of PLA–NR–PLA into a PLA/NR blend, the Tg of NR phase shifted to a higher temperature, whereas the Tg of the PLA phase decreased. The PLA–NR–PLA triblock copolymer with the longest PLA end block is possibly used as an effective compatibilizer for the PLA/NR blend.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The aim of this study was to assess whether the tiletamine/zolazepam/dexmedetomidine (ZD) combination effectively provides a surgical anesthesia plane comparable to tiletamine/zolazepam/dexmedetomidine with tramadol (ZDT) in a minor procedure in rats. Methods: Rats were induced with ZD or ZDT. After the loss of paw withdrawal, a small incision was made on the rats’ left thighs as a surgical stimulus. Rats were maintained under a surgical anesthesia plane by assessing the loss of the paw withdrawal reflex for 45 minutes, then atipamezole was administered. Monitored anesthesia parameters included: (a) physiological parameters – pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR), tissue oxygen saturation (%SpO2), and body temperature; (b) duration parameters – induction time, onset and duration of surgical anesthesia plane, onset of recovery, and recovery time. Results: PR was significantly lower at 10 minutes in ZD and 5 minutes in ZDT groups. No difference was observed for RR, %SpO2, and body temperature. Likewise, there were no differences for duration parameters: induction time was less than 3 minutes; onset and duration of surgical anesthesia plane were approximately 5 and 45 minutes, respectively; onset of recovery (time to move) was 51 minutes; and recovery time was 52 minutes, respectively. Conclusion: These data suggest the ZD combination provides a surgical anesthesia plane comparable to ZDT in a rat incisional pain model.","medical, biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science, Health Professions","Medicine (miscellaneous), Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Medical Laboratory Technology"
Distribution and genetic diversity of Enterovirus G (EV-G) on pig farms in Thailand,"Janetanakit T., Chaiyawong S., Charoenkul K., Tangwangvivat R., Chamsai E., Udom K., Jairak W., Amonsin A.",2021-12-01,"Aging, Animals, Enteroviruses, Porcine, Farms, Feces, Female, Genetic Variation, Male, Phylogeny, Swine, Swine Diseases, Thailand, Distribution, Diversity, Enterovirus G, Pigs, Thailand","Background: Enterovirus G (EV-G) causes subclinical infections and is occasionally associated with diarrhea in pigs. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of EV-G in pigs from 73 pig farms in 20 provinces of Thailand from December 2014 to January 2018. Results: Our results showed a high occurrence of EV-Gs which 71.6 % of fecal and intestinal samples (556/777) and 71.2 % of pig farms (52/73) were positive for EV-G by RT-PCR specific to the 5’UTR. EV-Gs could be detected in all age pig groups, and the percentage positivity was highest in the fattening group (89.7 %), followed by the nursery group (89.4 %). To characterize the viruses, 34 EV-G representatives were characterized by VP1 gene sequencing. Pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that Thai-EV-Gs belonged to the EV-G1, EV-G3, EV-G4, EV-G8, EV-G9 and EV-G10 genotypes, among which the EV-G3 was the predominant genotype in Thailand. Co-infection with different EV-G genotypes or with EV-Gs and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) on the same pig farms was observed. Conclusions: Our results confirmed that EV-G infection is endemic in Thailand, with a high genetic diversity of different genotypes.

Efficiency of microbially-induced calcite precipitation in natural clays for ground improvement,"Arpajirakul S., Pungrasmi W., Likitlersuang S.",2021-05-03,"Bacterial cultures, Calcite precipitation, Chemical compositions, Chemical conditions, Engineering properties, Precipitation patterns, Strength parameters, Unconfined compression tests, Clays, Ground improvement, Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), Microstructure, Small-strain stiffness, Unconfined compressive strength","Microbially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a promising technique to improve the engineering properties of soft soil in a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and energy saving manner. This study determined the suitable chemical condition to induce MICP activity from alkaliphilic urease-producing Sporosarcina pasteurii bacterium, and to explore the MICP activity's effectiveness in improving the mechanical properties of three types of natural fine-grained soils (Kaolin clay, Laterite, and Bangkok clay). Untreated and treated clays were evaluated by the free-free resonant frequency test, unconfined compression test, and their microstructures and chemical compositions. The results showed that a urea-Ca2+ input rate of 7.5 mmol/h efficiently promoted the precipitation of calcite by bacteria, as indicated by the highest degree of media clogging in sand column tests. A higher urea-Ca2+ input rate created soil samples that exhibited a high degree of supersaturation, which impacted the precipitation pattern at the microscale, resulting in less contact between soil particles; this was caused by the increase in salinity of the solution to a level that inhibited bacterial activity and retarded calcite precipitation. Once the optimal urea-Ca2+ input rate was determined, bacterial cultures were introduced into samples of each clay, and fed with the optimal chemical mixture while being maintained at room temperature (25–30 °C) for 7 d. Increases in the samples’ stiffness and shear strength coincided with increased amounts of precipitated calcite. Enhancements to each clay type's strength parameters were dependent on the natural characteristics of clay. Specifically, liquid media carrying the necessary nutrients for MICP activity could not efficiently permeate through the clayey soil with a high plasticity, resulting in a lower observable degree of MICP activity to improve the soil's characteristics.","mixing and separation, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

In many countries, fast spreading of water hyacinth in natural rivers and canals results in a drainage problem. Consequently, the municipal offices have to spend substantial annual budgets to get rid of the water hyacinth wastes. This research explores for the first time the development and use of water hyacinth wastes for producing fibre-reinforced polymer composite as a strengthening material to confine concrete. The water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite coupons were tested to obtain their tensile strength, ultimate strain, and elastic modulus. A series of compression tests were conducted on water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite confined concrete to investigate the improved strength and ductility performance. Both environmental and economic impact assessments were conducted to illustrate the potential of using water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite as a strengthening material, through comparing the water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite and other natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites and conventional fibre-reinforced polymer composites. It is concluded that the mechanical properties of water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite are acceptable for concrete strengthening purpose. More importantly, as compared to conventional fibre-reinforced polymer composites, use of water hyacinth fibre-reinforced polymer composite is rewarded by its environmental friendliness, which is the less water consumption during the production and the reduction of natural wastes.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

DPC is a bulky DNA lesion that blocks essential DNA transactions; thus, it poses a significant threat to genome integrity if left unrepaired. Discoveries of Wss1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and SPRTN in human as DPC proteases have demonstrated the importance of protease function in DPC repair. Our recent study revealed that Wss1 in C. albicans, an opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening infection in immunocompromised individuals, also promotes DPC tolerance similarly to both S. cerevisiae Wss1 and human SPRTN. However, its molecular mechanism and regulation are still poorly understood. Here, we briefly discuss the recent insights into C. albicans Wss1 based on the information from S. cerevisiae, as well as outline the aspect of this protein that could make it a potential target for antifungal drug development.","toxicology; toxic mechanisms and responses; carcinogenesis and mutagenesis, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry",Genetics
An approach to a repeated self-biting tongue injury in a toddler,"Pitak-Arnnop P., Auychai P., Subbalekha K., Malakul A., Meningaud J.-P., Neff A.",2021-10-01,"Bites, Human, Female, Humans, Infant, Lip, Self-Injurious Behavior, Tongue, Children, Recurrence, Surgery, Tongue injury","Background: Children with tongue injuries often visit the pediatric emergency department. The vast majority of cases can be conservatively treated, while some injuries require operative repair. The aim of this article was to demonstrate a “back-to-basics” approach to a refractory bifid tongue injury in a toddler. Case description: A 1-year-old toddler with a tongue injury was unsuccessfully treated three times within a week by a surgeon in another specialty; all reconstructions were mucosal only. The case was then referred to our maxillofacial unit for proper management. On examination, the recurrent injury seemed to occur because of the patient's self-biting habit. We performed the fourth reconstruction of the tongue muscles and mucosa, and because of no dental prosthetic laboratory available in our hospital, we used transparent adhesive drapes fixed by resorbable sutures to cover the patient's anterior teeth instead of bite guards. The toddler was fed via a nasogastric tube for 1 week under 2-day antibiotic prophylaxis and routine oral care. The patient was discharged without any complications 1 week later. Conclusions and practical implications: The causes of repeated orofacial injuries should be identified and require particular attention to establish a proper treatment. For intraoral injuries in pediatric patients, self-biting habits should not be overlooked. The application of materials in an operating theater can help the treating clinicians improve the treatment outcomes.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

The research employed a central composite design and response surface methodology. Three specific parameters were varied for the purposes of the experimental process, while a fixed pH value of 8 was used in all cases. The variables were hydrolysis temperature (set as 45 °C, 50 °C, or 55 °C), hydrolysis time (set as 60 min, 120 min, or 180 min), and the ratio of enzyme to substrate (set as 2%, 4%, or 6% w/v). The variables under investigation exert a significant influence upon degree of hydrolysis (DH) in addition to 2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity (p < 0.05). Fractionation of the hydrolysate was accomplished using molecular weight (MW) cut-off membranes, while the greatest radical-scavenging capability was observed in the < 0.65 kDa fraction. The MW < 0.65 kDa fraction underwent separation through RP-HPLC in order to create five sub-fractions. Among these, the greatest ABTS radical-scavenging capability was observed in the F5 sub-fraction, which was therefore chosen to undergo additional examination using quadrupole-time-of-flight-electron spin induction-mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing. Via this process it was possible to determine five antioxidant peptides. Furthermore, the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction was able to demonstrating cellular antioxidant activity in the context of a human intestinal cancer cell line (HT-29). The extent of this activity was shown to depend upon the concentration levels of the peptide.

Vector competence of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for DTMUV were investigated. Both Aedes mosquito species were orally infected with DK/TH/CU-1 strain of Thai DTMUV and isolated DTMUV from BALB/c mouse. Genomes of the viruses isolated from hosts and vectors were analyzed and compared with the positive virus. Findings showed that both Aedes mosquito species could serve as vectors for DTMUV with minimum viral titer in blood meal of 106 TCID50/mL. After taking blood meal with viral titer at 107 TCID50/mL, vector competence of the mosquitoes was significantly different from the lower titer in both species. Both Aedes species did not support development of the isolated viruses from mouse. A point mutation of nucleotide and amino acid was found in all isolated DTMUV from Ae. aegypti saliva, while other viruses were similar to the positive virus. Our findings demonstrated that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus had potential to transmit the virus and play important roles in the viral transmission cycle in mammalian hosts, while viral mutation occurred in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

However, minor inconveniences during the steps of adding reaction ingredients and lack of simple color results hinder point-of-care detection. We therefore invented a fluorometric paper-based LAMP by incorporating LAMP reagents, including a biotinylated primer, onto a cellulose membrane paper, with a simple DNA fluorescent dye incubation that demonstrated rapid and accurate results parallel to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. This technology allows for instant paper strip detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the laboratory and clinical samples. MRSA represents a major public health problem as it can cause infections in different parts of the human body and yet is resistant to commonly used antibiotics. In this study, we optimized LAMP reaction ingredients and incubation conditions following a central composite design (CCD) that yielded the shortest reaction time with high sensitivity. These CCD components and conditions were used to construct the paper-based LAMP reaction by immobilizing the biotinylated primer and the rest of the LAMP reagents to produce the ready-to-use MRSA diagnostic device. Our paper-based LAMP device could detect as low as 10 ag (equivalent to 1 copy) of the MRSA gene mecA within 36-43 min, was evaluated using both laboratory (individual cultures of MRSA and non-MRSA bacteria) and clinical blood samples to be 100% specific and sensitive compared to qPCR results, and had 35 day stability under 25 °C storage. Furthermore, the color readout allows for quantitation of MRSA copies. Hence, this device is applicable for point-of-care MRSA detection.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, physics","Bioengineering, Instrumentation, Process Chemistry and Technology, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

However, there is considerable concern regarding the subtherapeutic concentrations of the currently used doses and the development of drug resistance. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of oral levofloxacin in healthy volunteers and to evaluate the probability of target attainment (PTA) in an attempt to optimize the dosing regimens for MDR-TB therapy. Data of levofloxacin in healthy volunteers from a previous study were used to construct a PPK model. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to derive the PTAs of various regimens. A two-compartment model with linear elimination and transit absorption compartments best described the pharmacokinetics (PK) of levofloxacin. The estimated PK parameters (interindividual variability, %) were: apparent clearance 8.32 L h−1 (22.6%), apparent central volume of distribution 35.8 L (45.2%), apparent peripheral volume of distribution 39.7 L, intercompartmental clearance 40.6 L h−1 (43.8%), absorption rate constant 7.45 h−1 (150%), mean absorption transit time 0.355 h (52.4%), and total number of transit compartments 6.01 (131.9%). Monte Carlo simulations using levofloxacin 750–1000 mg yielded a probability of achieving a target free area under the concentration–time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 at greater than 90% for Mycobacterium tuberculosis with an MIC < 0.5 mg L−1, while a dose of 1500 mg was required for strains with an MIC of 1 mg L−1. A higher dose of levofloxacin might be needed to treat tuberculosis.

The catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated for low-temperature CO2 methanation. The Ni/CeO2 catalysts exhibited a superior CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity over METH®134, a commercial methanation catalyst. The following order of activity was experimentally found: Ni/CeO2-PH > Ni/CeO2-NR > Ni/CeO2-NP > Ni/CeO2-NC > METH®134. Among different CeO2 morphologies, the Ni/CeO2-NR catalyst exhibited the largest surface area and the highest reducibility, providing the high oxygen vacancies/oxygen storage capacity (OSC). Nevertheless, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Ni and Ce of the Ni/CeO2-NR catalyst determined by H2-TPR posed a negative impact on the CO2 conversion at low temperature. Unexpectedly, the Ni/CeO2-PH catalyst possessed a single crystalline CeO2 nanostructure of ca. 7.4 nm with relatively high surface area and high reducibility especially at low reduction temperature. Therefore, the Ni/CeO2-PH catalyst was found to be the optimum catalyst for low-temperature CO2 methanation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

However, gene delivery to primary DCs using traditional non-viral molecules has been a difficult challenge. Herein we have developed a gene delivery system to primary DCs using magnetic iron oxide nanocubes (MCs) coated with cationic polymer under the induction of a magnetic field. The MCs were coated with positively charged polymer, poly(2-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (MCs-PD) before the plasmid gene (pMAX-GFP) was adsorbed on their surfaces. Three different sizes (15, 40 and 90 nm) of MCs were synthesized, and subsequently, PDMAEMA was assembled onto the MC surfaces (MCs-PD). MCs-PD exhibited zeta potentials of +23 to +26 mV, and the obtained particles showed superparamagnetic character with saturation magnetization of 17–66 emu/g. The MCs-PD of 10–100 μg/mL showed low toxicity on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in MTT assay, and they were well taken up by BMDCs under a magnetic field. Moreover, the particles with small size exhibited the enhanced plasmid transfection efficiency without the activation of BMDCs. The MCs-PD could be a promising non-viral gene delivery system that helps to manipulate primary DCs in vitro, which will be beneficial for cell-based immunotherapy.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The performance analysis of integrated system is performed based on thermodynamic calculation through Aspen Plus simulator. The total of the Gibbs free energy minimization is used to determine product composition at equilibrium. The electrochemical model not only considers all voltage losses but also includes the effect of current leakage as a result from the electrolyte used. Considering the operating condition of steam reformer, it is found that the gas product contains the highest amount of hydrogen without the carbon formation when reformer is operated at 973 K with steam to carbon ratio of 1. In addition, the simulation results show that the SOFC–H+ operated at 973 K and 1 A/cm2 can provide a suitable compromise between system performances and exhaust gas composition. The use of glycerol reformate has the highest cell and system efficiencies and fuel utilization compared to the others. In addition, the integrated system fuelled by glycerol can release low CO amount whereas there is more heat provided to the surrounding. Therefore, it can be concluded that glycerol is suitable renewable fuel for SOFC–H+ integrated system.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Modulating Zn deposition via ceramic-cellulose separator with interfacial polarization effect for durable zinc anode,"Cao J., Zhang D., Gu C., Zhang X., Okhawilai M., Wang S., Han J., Qin J., Huang Y.",2021-11-01,"Anode, Cellulose separator, Cyclability, Dendrite-free, Interfacial polarization, Zinc anodes, Zinc-ion battery, Zn deposition, Zn$+2+$, ZrO$-2$, Anode, Cellulose separator, Dendrites-free, Zinc-ion batteries, ZrO2","The optimization strategies of electrode and electrolyte currently advocated for zinc dendrite suppression remain challenging for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their complex manufacturing processes and non-economic prices. Here, a cellulose nanofibers-ZrO2 composite (ZC) separator with easily-fabricated and cost-effective features is developed to stabilize the zinc anode. The ZC separator is designed to enable excellent ionic conductivity (4.59 mS cm−1) and high Zn2+ transfer number (0.69), and the ZrO2 particles with high dielectric constant (ε = 25) offer a directional electric field via the Maxwell-Wagner polarization effect, which regulates uniform zinc deposition, accelerate the Zn2+ ions diffusion kinetics and repel anions, thus stabilizing zinc anode and suppressing passivation reactions. As a result, ZC separator renders zinc anode with dendrite‐free plating/stripping behavior, high Coulombic efficiency (99.5%) and exceptional cyclability (2000 h under 0.5 mA cm−2). Additionally, this developed composite separator can be extended to other insulating ceramics, or even random combinations. Moreover, the rate capability and cyclability of the as-assembled Zn||ZnSO4||MnO2/graphite coin and pouch cells also can be significantly boosted via the ZC separator, accompanied by the remarkable flexibility and integration ability. The ceramics-cellulose separators offer an appealing strategy for constructing advanced zinc anode for large-scale energy storage.","mixing and separation, energy, Materials Science, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Expression of SOX2 and OCT4 in odontogenic cysts and tumors,"Phattarataratip E., Panitkul T., Khodkaew W., Anupuntanun P., Jaroonvechatam J., Pitarangsikul S.",2021-12-01,"Ameloblastoma, Humans, Odontogenic Cysts, Odontogenic Tumors, SOXB1 Transcription Factors, Stem Cells, Ameloblastic fibroma, Ameloblastoma, OCT4, Odontogenic Keratocyst, SOX2","Background: Aberrant expression of stem cell markers has been observed in several types of neoplasms. This trait attributes to the acquired stem-like property of tumor cells and can impact patient prognosis. The objective of this study was to comparatively analyze the expression and significance of SOX2 and OCT4 in various types of odontogenic cysts and tumors. Methods: Fifty-five cases of odontogenic cysts and tumors, including 15 ameloblastomas (AM), 5 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 5 ameloblastic fibromas (AF), 5 calcifying odontogenic cysts (COC), 10 dentigerous cysts (DC) and 15 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) were investigated for the expression of SOX2 and OCT4 immunohistochemically. Results: Most OKCs (86.7 %) and all AFs expressed SOX2 in more than 50 % of epithelial cells. Its immunoreactivity was moderate-to-strong in all epithelial cell types in both lesions. In contrast, SOX2 expression was undetectable in AOTs and limited to the ameloblast-like cells in a minority of AM and COC cases. Most DCs showed positive staining in less than 25 % of cystic epithelium. Significantly greater SOX2 expression was noted in OKC compared with DC or AM, and in AF compared with COC or AOT. OCT4 rarely expressed in odontogenic lesions with the immunoreactivity being mild and present exclusively in OKCs. Conclusions: SOX2 is differentially expressed in odontogenic cysts and tumors. This could be related to their diverse cells of origin or stages of histogenesis. The overexpression of SOX2 and OCT4 in OKC indicates the acquired stem-like property. Future studies should investigate whether the overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 contributes to the aggressive behaviors of the tumors.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Neurology (clinical)"
A study of the transition metal doped boron nitride nanosheets as promising candidates for hydrogen and formaldehyde adsorptions,"Thupsuri S., Tabtimsai C., Ruangpornvisuti V., Wanno B.",2021-10-01,"Adsorption energies, Boron nitride nanosheets, Density-functional theory calculations, Doping sites, Geometrical deformation, Metal-doped, Molecule adsorptions, Re-doping, Sensing abilities, Adsorption, Boron nitride nanosheet, Formaldehyde, Hydrogen, Transition metal","Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the adsorption and sensing of hydrogen (H2) and formaldehyde (CH2O) molecules on the pristine and transition metal (TM = V, Cr, Mn, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ta, W, or Re) doping on B or N site of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs). The obtained results reveal that the pristine BNNS shows weakly interaction with the H2 and CH2O molecules. The H2 and CH2O molecules can be strongly adsorption on the TM−doped BNNSs with appreciable adsorption energy, influenced by the geometrical deformation on the TM doping site. Also, the energy gap of the BNNS is dramatically decreased after TM doping, which is responsible for the increasing of sensing abilities for H2 and CH2O molecule adsorptions. Accordingly, the adsorption abilities of H2 and CH2O on BNNS could be significantly improved through TM doping. Thus, the TM−doped BNNSs could be used for designing novel materials for H2 and CH2O adsorption and sensing applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics"

The aim of this work is to investigate the variation in electric field frequency of the DEP force on the cell in different orientations and to clarify cell behavior during the transition between the positive and negative dielectrophoresis, which is important for on-chip cell manipulation. We use the boundary element method and apply the boundary condition of transmembrane potential on the cell membrane for calculation. The simulation results show that the DEP characteristics depend highly on the orientation and the position of the cell from electrode edge. The vertical and horizontal DEP forces change their directions at different values of field frequency. The re-orientation of red blood cells observed in the experiment is related to the calculated DEP behavior.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Varied temporal expression patterns of trigeminal TRPA1 and TRPV1 and the neuropeptide CGRP during orthodontic force-induced pain,"Thammanichanon P., Kaewpitak A., Binlateh T., Pavasant P., Leethanakul C.",2021-08-01,"Animals, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide, Pain, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Trigeminal Ganglion, TRPA1 Cation Channel, TRPV Cation Channels, Nociceptors, Orthodontics, Pain, Tooth","Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the temporal changes in inflammation and TRPA1, TRPV1 and CGRP expression in the trigeminal ganglion during force-induced orthodontic pain. Design: Orthodontic force was applied to both maxillary first molars in 8-week-old Wistar rats for 12 h, 24 h, 3 d or 7 d. The rat grimace scale (RGS) score and duration of face grooming were used to measure orthodontic pain. Western blotting was performed to assess TRPA1, TRPV1 and CGRP expression in trigeminal ganglia. NF-кB levels and colocalization of TRPA1, TRPV1 and CGRP were evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. Results: Application of continuous force significantly increased pain behaviours at 1 and 3 d. NF-кB significantly increased in periodontal ligament at 12 h until 3 d. TRPV1 was significantly elevated within 1 d; TRPA1 significantly increased from 1–3 d; CGRP expression significantly increased from 12 h to 3 d. The TRPV1/TRPA1 expression ratio was highest at 12 h; the TRPA1/TRPV1 ratio peaked at 3 d. The percentages of trigeminal neurons co-expressing TRPA1/TRPV1, TRPA1/CGRP, and TRPV1/CGRP significantly increased by 12 h and peaked at 24 h. CGRP expression had a stronger positive correlation with TRPV1 than TRPA1. Conclusions: Inflammation induced by application of orthodontic force sensitizes trigeminal TRPV1 and TRPA1; TRPV1 is primarily activated as an early response, whereas TRPA1 is activated as a late response. Activation of both nociceptors results in CGRP release. Thus, blocking both TRPV1 and TRPA1 may represent a primary therapeutic target for relief of orthodontic pain.","genergyal, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

The distribution of feline blood types, which varies geographically, can estimate the risks of mismatched transfusion reactions and NI due to random mating. Objectives: The objectives were to determine the frequency of feline AB blood types in Bangkok, Thailand, and surrounding vicinities and calculate the risks of transfusion reactions and NI in domestic shorthair (DSH) cats. Methods: A standard tube method was performed to analyze the A/B antigen on erythrocytes. Reverse typing was performed to confirm blood types B and AB. Results: Domestic shorthair (n = 229) and purebred (n = 91) cats were prospectively recruited from 39 districts in Bangkok and 11 districts in four nearby provinces. Overall, 97.5% and 2.5% of the cats were type A and type B, respectively. No cats were type AB. All DSH cats were type A. Type B blood was found in 17.1% of Persian and 4% of Scottish Fold cats. Due to the blood type frequencies in DSH cats, the potential risk of major transfusion reactions, minor transfusion reactions, or NI was 0%. Conclusions: This is a large study of feline blood types in Bangkok and vicinities. Type A blood was predominant in DSH cats and associated with a minimal risk for mismatched transfusion reactions and NI. Blood types A and B were found in Persian and Scottish Fold cats.

There are limited contemporary data on the incidence and outcomes of AKI in CA. Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, and the Cochrane from inception to November 2020. Observational studies that reported the incidence of AKI in CA survivors were included. Data from each study were combined using the random effects to calculate pooled incidence and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was short-term mortality and secondary outcomes included long-term mortality, incidence of AKI, and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Main results: A total of 25 observational studies comprising 8,165 patients were included. The incidence of AKI in CA survivors was 40.3% (range 32.9–47.8%). In stage 3 AKI, one-fourth of patients required RRT. AKI was associated with an increased risk of both short-term (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.74–2.96]; p < 0.001) and long-term mortality (OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.93–3.25]; p < 0.001). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses did not suggest any effect of hypothermia on incidence of AKI. Conclusion: AKI complicates the care of 40% of CA survivors and is associated with significantly increased short- and long-term mortality.","biochemistryistry, Health Professions, medical","Clinical Biochemistry, Health Information Management, Medicine (all)"
A robust design method for retrofit of industrial heat exchanger networks using modified stage-wise model,"Angsutorn N., Siemanond K., Chuvaree R.",2021-01-16,"Computational time, Feasible solution, Heat exchanger network, Mathematical difficulty, Retrofit design, Robust design methods, Solving method, Heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit, Industrial applications, Iterative optimization, Mathematical programming, Stage-wise model","For over 20 years, various heat exchanger network (HEN) retrofit methods based on mathematical programming have been studied and proposed. However, determining suitable heat exchanger network retrofit designs for industries still remains a challenge. Most retrofit methods have limitations in terms of computational time and feasibility, and their proposed solutions involve mostly heat exchanger modifications and relocations which could be impractical and uneconomical. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a robust heat exchanger network retrofit method for industrial applications which relies on mathematical programming under specific retrofit concepts and an effective solving strategy. The retrofit concepts reduce mathematical difficulties and provide heat exchanger networks that are practical for industries. The solving strategy provides a sustainable systematic solving method which guarantees good feasible solutions within a reasonable computational time. Finally, the performance of the proposed heat exchanger network retrofit method is illustrated and compared throughout three various scale examples.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, heat exchange, chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The present pilot study explored associations between OSA severity and metabolites in women with GDM. A total of 81 obese women with diet-controlled GDM had OSA assessment (median gestational age [GA] 29 weeks). The metabolic profile was assayed from fasting serum samples via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using an untargeted approach. Metabolites were extracted and subjected to an Agilent 1,290 UPLC coupled to an Agilent 6,545 quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS. Data were acquired using electrospray ionisation in positive and negative ion modes. The raw LC-MS data were processed using the OpenMS toolkit to detect and quantify features, and these features were annotated using the Human Metabolite Database. The feature data were compared with OSA status, apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), body mass index (BMI) and GA using “limma” in R. Correlation analyses of the continuous covariates were performed using Kendall’s Tau test. The p values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate correction. A total of 42 women (51.8%) had OSA, with a median AHI of 9.1 events/hr. There were no significant differences in metabolomics profiles between those with and without OSA. However, differential analyses modelling in GA and BMI found 12 features that significantly associated with the AHI. These features could be annotated to oestradiols, lysophospholipids, and fatty acids, with higher levels related to higher AHI. Metabolites including oestradiols and phospholipids may be involved in pathogenesis of OSA in pregnant women with GDM.

However, the impact on the predominantly CD4+ immunoregulatory invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells during AHI remains unknown. Here, iNKT cells from peripheral blood and colonic mucosa were investigated during treated and untreated AHI. iNKT cells in blood were activated and rapidly depleted in untreated AHI. At the time of peak HIV-1 viral load, these cells showed the elevated expression of cell death-associated transcripts compared to preinfection. Residual peripheral iNKT cells suffered a diminished responsiveness to in vitro stimulation early into chronic infection. Additionally, HIV-1 DNA, as well as spliced and unspliced viral RNA, were detected in iNKT cells isolated from blood, indicating the active infection of these cells in vivo. The loss of iNKT cells occurred from Fiebig stage III in the colonic mucosa, and these cells were not restored to normal levels after initiation of ART during AHI. CD4+ iNKT cells were depleted faster and more profoundly than conventional CD4+ T cells, and the preferential infection of CD4+ iNKT cells over conventional CD4+ T cells was confirmed by in vitro infection experiments. In vitro data also provided evidence of latent infection in iNKT cells. Strikingly, preinfection levels of peripheral blood CD4+ iNKT cells correlated directly with the peak HIV-1 load. These findings support a model in which iNKT cells are early targets for HIV-1 infection, driving their rapid loss from circulation and colonic mucosa.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

The study of gene expression, chemical profile, and bioactivity at different growth stages of callus was conducted to determine the most suitable stage of callus based on the production requirements and provided important data for further study of the biosynthetic pathway. In this study, green (G), yellow (Y), orange (O), and brown (B) callus cultures of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) were collected at 30, 45, 60, and 75 days after subculture, respectively, and their gene expression levels, chemical profiles, and bioactivities were compared. The complexity and amount of constituents increased with culture time and increasing daidzein and genistein levels until the O callus stage, which was correlated with the constitutive expression of genes involved in the general isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway at all growth stages. In contrast, the downstream biosynthetic genes encoding cytochrome P450 subfamily 81E and a putative prenyltransferase, which are responsible for diversifying the isoflavones to PM-specific secondary products, were significantly upregulated in the O callus. The observed color changes of the PM callus cultures were attributed to increases in daidzein and genistein levels. The callus cultures exhibited increased antioxidant activity with increasing age, reaching a highest half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.30 mg/mL in the O callus. The cultures also exhibited cytotoxic activity, with the O and Y callus extracts (each at 3.13 μg/mL) showing significant activity against HepG2 cells (43.3% cell death) and MDA-MD-231 cells (40.1% cell death). These findings demonstrate that age significantly affects the chemical profiles and bioactivities of PM callus cultures.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Horticulture
The key to catalytic stability on sol–gel derived SnOx/SiO2 catalyst and the comparative study of side reaction with K-PtSn/Al2O3 toward propane dehydrogenation,"Sricharoen C., Jongsomjit B., Panpranot J., Praserthdam P.",2021-09-01,"Catalyst stability, Catalytic stability, Coke deposition, Comparative studies, Hydrogen spill overs, Propane dehydrogenation, Propylene hydrogenation, Spillover effects, Coke, Hydrogen spillover, Propane dehydrogenation, PtSnK catalyst, Tin oxide silica","Side reactions competing with propane dehydrogenation were studied on K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2 catalysts. The results showed that hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, deep dehydrogenation, and coke formation occurred more pronouncedly on K-PtSn/Al2O3, contrasting with the catalytic cracking result. Because of the higher total acidity on SnOx/SiO2, measured by NH3-TPD, more catalytic cracking occurred on this catalyst. However, SnOx/SiO2 showed a lower coke deposition, although the acid site can promote the coke formation. This contrast was not due to the spillover effect, which can suppress coke formation on the acid site. Essentially, the propylene hydrogenation, H2-TPD, and FTIR results demonstrate that SnOx/SiO2 had a lower hydrogen spillover than that of K-PtSn/Al2O3. On the other hand, TPO results from propylene dehydrogenation and coke formation of propadiene illustrate that the key of distinguished SnOx/SiO2 catalyst stability was owing to a low ability of coke precursor generation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Bedroom environment and sleep quality of apartment building residents in urban Bangkok,"Kallawicha K., Boonvisut S., Chao H.J., Nitmetawong T.",2021-01-15,"Apartment buildings, Chi-square tests, Cross-sectional study, Indoor air temperature, Indoor environment, Logistic Regression modeling, Multiple logistic regression, Sleep disturbances, Bedroom environment, Cockroaches, Fungi, Indoor air pollution, Sleep quality","Sleep is essential because it promotes good health and increases productivity. People spend most of their time indoors, and much of that time is spent sleeping. Thus, indoor environments may affect sleep quality. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between sleep quality and bedroom characteristics among residents living in apartment buildings in urban Bangkok. The bedroom characteristics of the participants were collected through a questionnaire and sleep quality was assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Associations were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. Among the 93 participants, global PSQI scores ranged from 1 to 16, with a median of 5. In total, 58.1% of the participants had good sleep quality (PSQI score ≤ 5) and approximately 80% perceived their sleep quality to be fairly good to very good. A chi-square test revealed that sleep disturbance (i.e., breathing discomfort) was associated with a musty odor in the bedroom. A logistic regression model indicated that the presence of cockroaches and Aspergillus spp. was positively associated with poor sleep quality, with odds ratios (ORs) of 3.00 and 1.21, respectively. Perceived cold indoor air temperature also contributed to poor sleep quality (OR = 6.10). Regular cleaning to reduce indoor allergens, which can promote sleep quality, is recommended. Maintaining a comfortable indoor air temperature can also benefit sleep quality among apartment building residents in urban Bangkok.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering, sociology","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Geography, Planning and Development, Building and Construction"

Morphologies of SPIONs were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Herein the attachment of ZnCTPP on particles was studied using various techniques including infrared spectroscopy (IR) and UV–visible spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Moreover, the obtained particles showed superparamagnetic character with saturation magnetization in a range of 10 to 76 emu/g, depending on the size and shape of the SPIONs. The SPION-ZnCTPP showed high photocatalytic activity (52% yield) for amide synthesis between potassium ethanethioate and 4-methoxyaniline under irradiation with a 19 W LED lamp, and this heterogeneous catalyst could be well separated from a solution under the induction of an external magnetic field.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

The resulting Ni-FSM-16 catalyst showed a high reactivity and selectivity in decarboxylation of plant-based carboxylic acids to yield the corresponding linear alkenes and alkanes in up to 75 % yield and less than 5 % of undesired cracking products. In addition, lignin-derived vanillic acid was smoothly converted to guaiacol. A comparative investigation showed that both the support and the metal of the Ni-FSM-16 catalyst proved to be pivotal for the reactivity. Particularly, substituting Ni with Fe, Pd or Al or replacing the FSM-16 support with MCM-41 or SBA-15 led to lower reactivity and selectivity towards linear decarboxylated products. The superior catalytic performance of Ni-FSM-16 was driven by a higher and more even metal distribution, more acidic silanol-group and an electron-rich, thus softer Ni, that promote coordination by the carbon-carbon double-bond of the fatty acid.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Catalysis, Environmental Science (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

All samples exhibited a polycrystalline with wurtzite hexagonal phase, which wasn't altered and getting relaxed by Cu-doping. The grain size increased and changed its growth mode from c-axis growth to lateral one and the surface morphology was strongly influenced with increasing level of Cu doping. As x increased, the transparency of films was generally increased in the visible region and the band gap energy (Eg) presented a slight shrinking, indicating that the prepared films are suitable for use in opto-electronic applications. Ferromagnetic phase was adopted within density functional theory corrected by Hubbard method (DFT + LDA + U) to investigate the structural, electronic, magnetic and optical properties of pure and CZO structure. The closest Cu impurities gave the more stable configuration. Cu3d states were distributed around Fermi level inducing a major contribution to the magnetic moment. A mix of ionic and covalent bonding was remarked. DFT + LDA + U enhanced significantly the calculated Eg, which presented a narrowing with x. The imaginary part of the dielectric functions presented three main peaks and their static constants were slightly influenced by Cu doping.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

A polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) primer was used to enhance the initial anchoring of the ZIF-8 seed crystals on the PU surface. X-Ray diffraction confirmed that the three-step process (PEM primer, MOF seed adsorption, secondary growth) produced a dense and homogeneous coating of ZIF-8 crystals on the PU foam substrate. The thickness of the ZIF-8 coating was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and was found to increased from 270 nm to 420 nm when the PEM primer was used when compared to the PU surface deposition. The PU/PEMs/ZIF-8/ foams were tested for their photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light and displayed a 4 folds increase in methylene blue (MB) adsorbtion over ZIF-8/PU foam. The photodegradation of MB was also increased from 31% in ZIF-8/PU to 51% in ZIF-8/PEMs/PU foams. Finally, The superior efficiency of the PEMs anchored seeds displayed outstanding photocatalytic efficiency with reusability up to 4 cycles when compared to the without PEMs modified one that lost their performance after only 1 cycle of the photodegradation test.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Herein, we evaluated the ability of an integrated adsorption/ultrafiltration (UF) membrane filtration system to simultaneously remove phosphates and dissolved organic matter (DOM). When bare powdered activated carbon (PAC) and PAC impregnated with amorphous ferrihydrite (FHPAC) adsorbents were compared, FHPAC showed a greater adsorption rate and capacity for phosphate. FHPAC had a phosphate adsorption capacity of 2.32 mg PO43−/g FHPAC, even when DOM was present as a competing adsorbate. In a lab-scale hybrid FHPAC-UF system (i.e. integrated adsorption by FHPAC with UF membrane filtration), irreversible membrane fouling was ca. three times lower than that in a PAC-UF system. When membrane fouling in the PAC-UF system was described with pore blockage models, we found that the main cause of fouling was bacterial deposition on the membrane surface. CLSM analysis determined that the chemical composition of foulants in the PAC-UF system included higher proportions of proteins, nucleic acids, and alpha-polysaccharides than that in the FHPAC-UF system. Overall, FHPAC’s ability to undergo ligand exchanges with DOM helped to reduce the nutrients and bacteria that cause biofouling to accumulate on the membrane surface.","geobase; related topics, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"
Circulating growth differentiation factor-15 as a novel biomarker in heart transplant,"Tokavanich N., Sinphurmsukskul S., Kongruttanachok N., Thammanatsakul K., Sritangsirikul S., Ariyachaipanich A., Ongcharit P., Siwamogsatham S., Boonyaratavej S., Puwanant S.",2021-08-01,"Biomarkers, Graft Rejection, Growth Differentiation Factor 15, Heart Transplantation, Humans, Primary Graft Dysfunction, Biomarker, Growth differentiation factor-15, Heart transplant, Outcomes, Primary graft dysfunction","Aims: This study aimed to examine (i) whether circulating growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is associated with acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection (ACR); (ii) a longitudinal trend of GDF-15 after heart transplantation; and (iii) the prognostic value of GDF-15 in predicting a composite outcome of severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and 30 day mortality post-transplant. Methods and results: Serum samples were collected before heart transplantation and at every endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) post-heart transplantation in de novo transplant patients. A total of 60 post-transplant serum samples were matched to the corresponding EMBs. Seven (12%) were considered International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation Grade 1R ACR, and one (2%) was identified as Grade 2R ACR. GDF-15 levels in patients with ACR were not different from those in the non-rejection group (6230 vs. 6125 pg/mL, P = 0.27). GDF-15 concentration gradually decreased from 8757 pg/mL pre-transplant to 5203 pg/mL at 4 weeks post-transplant. The composite adverse outcome of PGD and 30 day mortality was significantly associated with increased post-operative GDF-15 (odds ratio: 40; 95% confidence interval: 2.01–794.27; P = 0.005) and high inotrope score post-transplant (odds ratio: 18; 95% confidence interval: 1.22–250.35; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Circulating GDF-15 concentration was markedly elevated in patients with end-stage heart failure and decreased after heart transplantation. GDF-15 was significantly associated with post-transplant PGD and mortality. A lack of association between ACR and GDF-15 did not support routine use of GDF-15 as a biomarker to detect ACR. However, GDF-15 may be potentially useful to determine heart transplant recipients at high risk for adverse post-transplant outcomes. We suggest that GDF-15 levels in recipient serum can provide risk stratification for severe PGD including death during post-operative period. This novel biomarker may serve to inform and guide timely interventions against severe PGD and adverse outcomes during the first 4 weeks after transplantation. Further studies to support the utility of GDF-15 in heart transplantation are required.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

The sigma-1 receptor (σ-1R) is a chaperone protein involved in signal transduction, neurite outgrowth, and plasticity, improving memory, and neuroprotection. Recent evidence shows that σ-1R can promote autophagy. Autophagy activation by the σ-1Rs along with other neuroprotective effects makes it an interesting target for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. AF710B, T-817 MA, and ANAVEX2-73 are some of the σ-1R agonists which have shown promising results and have entered clinical trials. These molecules have also been found to induce autophagy and show cytoprotective effects in cellular models. Areas covered: This review provides insight into the current understanding of σ-1R functions related to autophagy and their role in alleviating AD. Expert Opinion: We propose a mechanism through which the activation of σ-1R and autophagy could alter amyloid precursor protein processing to inhibit amyloid-β production by reconstituting cholesterol and gangliosides in the lipid raft to offer neuroprotection against AD. Future AD treatment could involve the combined targeting of the σ-1R and autophagy activation. We suggest that future studies investigate the link between autophagy the σ-1R and AD.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry"

We evaluated the incidence and patterns of irAEs in patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in Thailand. Methods: All solid tumor patients treated with ICIs were retrospectively reviewed in a multicenter analysis. The study aims to evaluate the incidence of irAEs and their characteristics, treatments, outcomes, and impact on survival. All irAEs were graded using the CTCAE version 4.0. Characteristics of irAEs including time to onset, duration of irAEs, specific treatments, and outcomes of irAEs were reviewed. The Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare variables. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by the log-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: irAEs of any grade were observed in 98 of 414 patients (24%), whereas grades 3–4 irAEs were observed in 5.6%. The majority of patients (78%) were treated with monotherapy ICI (anti-PD1/PD-L1 92%). The most common all-grade irAEs were hypothyroidism (7.5%), hepatitis (6.5%), and rash (4.8%). Median onset of overall irAEs was 63 days. Pancreatitis and pneumonitis had the earliest onset at 30 and 34 days, respectively. ICIs were rechallenged in 68 of 98 patients with irAE. Eleven of sixty-eight patients (11.2%) with initial irAE had reoccurrence after ICI rechallenge. Based on a multivariate analysis, pre-existing hypothyroidism, ICI used in a clinical trial setting, and combinations of ICI/ICI were independent factors predicting irAE occurrence. Patients with irAE had a statistically significant longer overall survival (OS) when compared to patients without irAE (p = 0.019). A multivariate analysis revealed that occurrence of irAE was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51–0.96; p = 0.028). Conclusion: irAE was commonly observed in Thai cancer patients treated with ICIs. Most irAEs were low-grade and manageable. Re-occurrence of irAE after re-challenging ICI was not uncommonly observed. Patients who experienced irAEs might have significantly longer OS compared to patients without irAEs. However, OS in this study should be interpreted with caution since it might be affected by various tumor types, treatment settings, dosing schedule, and ICI combinations.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Genetics, Cancer Research"

However, research to evaluate the responsiveness and MCIDs of the PROMS-29 scores in individuals with low back pain is limited.Methods.The study was conducted in physical therapy clinics in Thailand, using validated Thai versions of the study measures. One hundred and eighty-three individuals with chronic low back pain completed the PROMIS-29 at baseline and at 4-weeks follow-up. Perceived change in each domain assessed by the PROMIS-29 scales was assessed at 4 weeks using a 7-point measure of Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Responsiveness of the PROMIS-29 scale scores was evaluated by examining the effect sizes, the standardized response means (SRMs) for change over time, and examining these as a function of the GPE ratings. MCIDs for the scales were estimated by computing a half a standard deviation (SD) and standard error of measurement statistic for each scale.Results.The mean change scores, effect sizes, and SRMs increased as a function of the GPE ratings. Significant differences in change scores between those who reported that they were very much improved and those who did not improve were found for the PROMIS-29 Pain Intensity, Physical Function, and Anxiety scales. The correlations between changes scores and GPE ratings were mostly weak in magnitude. The MCID estimates computed as 0.50 of a SD unit and as a standard error of measurement showed similar values.Conclusion.The PROMIS-29 scale scores assessing pain intensity, physical function, and anxiety evidenced the most responsivity in the study sample. The results, when considered in light of the findings from other investigators, support 5.0 points as a reasonable MCID for most of the PROMIS-29 scales.

A 71-year-old female patient presented with a 4-day history of blurry vision in her left eye. Pertinent medical history included end-stage renal disease treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Previously, the patient's left eye was treated for primary angle-closure glaucoma by trabeculectomy. While this resulted in a low baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) of 2 to 7 mm Hg, the patient never developed any hypotony-related complications for the past 6 years. After examination, CD was diagnosed and treated with transscleral surgical drainage. The patient further developed 2 additional episodes of CD in the same eye. All episodes were also associated with bilateral pitting edema, weight gain, and hypoalbuminemia. Thus, the patient was recommended to take a protein supplement and limit her fluid intake. In addition, the dialysis treatment regimen was altered to achieve greater daily fluid removal. After 12 weeks, there was no recurrent episode of CD, and the patient was clinically stable with a final visual acuity of 20/30 and an IOP of 3 mm Hg. The serum albumin levels improved slightly, and there were no signs of hypervolemia. In this case of recurrent CD, a possible association between the development of CD, hypoalbuminemia, and hypervolemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is demonstrated. Clinicians should be aware that these systemic factors can be tied with recurrent CDs, especially among patients with a low baseline IOP.",medical,Ophthalmology

Molecular Cloning of Mouse Homologue of Enamel Protein C4orf26 and Its Phosphorylation by FAM20C,"Govitvattana N., Kaku M., Ohyama Y., Jaha H., Lin I.-P., Mochida H., Pavasant P., Mochida Y.",2021-10-01,"Amelogenesis, Amelogenesis Imperfecta, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Calcium-Binding Proteins, Casein Kinase I, Cloning, Molecular, Extracellular Matrix Proteins, Humans, Mice, Phosphorylation, Amelogenesis Imperfecta, Chromosome 4 open reading frame 26 (C4orf26), Enamel matrix protein, Extracellular localization, Gm1045, Phosphorylation, Splicing variant","It is widely accepted that cellular processes are controlled by protein phosphorylation and has become increasingly clear that protein degradation, localization and conformation as well as protein–protein interaction are the examples of subsequent cellular events modulated by protein phosphorylation. Enamel matrix proteins belong to members of the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) family clustered on chromosome 4q21, and most of the SCPP phosphoproteins have at least one S-X-E motifs (S; serine, X; any amino acid, E; glutamic acid). It has been reported that mutations in C4orf26 gene, located on chromosome 4q21, are associated with autosomal recessive type of Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI), a hereditary condition that affects enamel formation/mineralization. The enamel phenotype observed in patients with C4orf26 mutations is hypomineralized and partially hypoplastic, indicating that C4orf26 protein may function at both secretory and maturation stages of amelogenesis. The previous in vitro study showed that the synthetic phosphorylated peptide based on C4orf26 protein sequence accelerates hydroxyapatite nucleation. Here we show the molecular cloning of Gm1045, mouse homologue of C4orf26, which has 2 splicing isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the immunolocalization of Gm1045 is mainly observed in enamel matrix in vivo. Our report is the first to show that FAM20C, the Golgi casein kinase, phosphorylates C4orf26 and Gm1045 in cell cultures. The extracellular localization of C4orf26/Gm1045 was regulated by FAM20C kinase activity. Thus, our data point out the biological importance of enamel matrix-kinase control of SCPP phosphoproteins and may have a broad impact on the regulation of amelogenesis and AI.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Endocrinology"
Women's education and desire for additional children in Vietnam: Regional differences and the role of son preference,"Nguyen Y.T.H., Sukontamarn P.",2021-01-01,"Birth Rate, Child, Developing Countries, Educational Status, Family Characteristics, Female, Fertility, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Male, Nuclear Family, Vietnam, desire for additional children, son preference, Vietnam, Women's education","This paper investigates the relationship between women's education and desire for additional children across the six economic regions of Vietnam. The study employed data from the nationally representative Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2014. Probit regression results showed that for women with one child, higher levels of education were associated with higher fertility desire in two out of six regions. Similar results were found for women with two or more children. Children's sex composition played a role in the desire for additional children, reflecting both son preference and mixed-gender preference. In Vietnam overall, among women with at least one boy, those with lower levels of education were more likely not to want another child. The results, however, differed by region. The findings suggest that the social and economic context of each region, particularly sex ratio at birth and total fertility rate, should be taken into account when designing population policies in Vietnam.","sociology, medical","Social Sciences (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"
Thermally double coupled reactor coupling aqueous phase glycerol reforming and methanol synthesis,"Thirabunjongcharoen S., Bumroongsakulsawat P., Praserthdam P., Charojrochkul S., Assabumrungrat S., Kim-Lohsoontorn P.",2021-09-01,"Aqueous phase, Carbon dioxide conversions, Conventional reactors, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, Double-coupled, Glycerol conversions, Methanol synthesis, Temperature differences, Aqueous phase glycerol reforming, CFD, CO2 conversion, Hydrogen production, Methanol synthesis, Thermally double coupled reactor","This study proposes a novel thermally double coupled reactor (TDCR) coupling endothermic aqueous phase glycerol reforming (APGR) with exothermic methanol synthesis (MS), utilizing heat transfer between both channels. Hydrogen (H2) source and availability are known as barriers to carbon dioxide conversion to methanol via MS reaction. Waste glycerol could be a source of H2 through APGR reaction. The steady state TDCR model consists of two concentric channels: 1) an inner tube to which CO₂ and H₂ are fed as reactants for exothermic MS and 2) an outer annulus channel through which glycerol and steam are supplied for endothermic APGR. The TDCR could operate without external heat supply when two reactions were coupled. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was established to study this TDCR. APGR was assumed to be catalyzed by Pt/Al₂O₃ at 200−250 °C and 20−25 bar. MS was modeled with a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at 200−250 °C and 50−80 bar. Heat transfer from the exothermic channel to the endothermic channel helped increase glycerol conversion while methanol productivity is the same as conventional reactor. Cocurrent and countercurrent feed configurations were compared and it was found that the cocurrent configuration offered more uniform temperature distribution in the channel with a larger temperature difference between the two channels. On the other hand, hot spots and cold spots were observed in the countercurrent configuration. Effects of operating conditions of both channels: H2:CO2 and glycerol:steam ratios, inlet temperature, pressure, and total feed flow rate on reactor performance significantly affected the performance of TDCR.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

However, its hydrophobic nature and rapid metabolic rate lead to poor bioavailability. The aim of this research was to develop a thermoresponsive nanogel from hyaluronic acid (HA) for solubility and stability enhancement of AA. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) was conjugated onto HA using a carbodiimide reaction followed by1H NMR characterization. pNIPAM-grafted HA (HA-pNIPAM) nanogels were prepared with three concentrations of polymer, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.25% w/v, in water by the sonication method. AA was loaded into the nanogel by the incubation method. Size, morphology, AA loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were analyzed. In vitro cytocompatibility was evaluated in fibroblast L-929 cells using the PrestoBlue assay. Single-dose toxicity was studied using rats. HA-pNIPAM nanogels at a 4.88% grafting degree showed reversible thermo-responsive behavior. All nanogel formulations could significantly increase AA water solubility and the stability was higher in nanogels prepared with high polymer concentrations over 180 days. The cell culture study showed that 12.5 µM AA in nanogel formulations was considered non-toxic to the L-929 cells; however, a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect was observed at higher AA-loaded concentrations. In vivo study proved the non-toxic effect of AA loaded in HA-pNIPAM nanogels compared with the control. Taken together, HA-pNIPAM nanogel is a promising biocompatible delivery system both in vitro and in vivo for hydrophobic AA molecules.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

These include evidence of a hyperactive coagulation system with elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and microthrombi coupled with an activated and highly permeable vascular endothelium. Common immune abnormalities include progressive hypercytokinemia with elevated levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β, proinflammatory chemokines, activated macrophages and increased levels of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκB). Inflammasome activation and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is common to COVID-19, H1N1, and MAS but does not appear to be a feature of CRS. Elevated levels of IL-18 are detected in patients with COVID-19 and MAS but have not been reported in patients with H1N1 influenza and CRS. Elevated interferon-γ is common to H1N1, MAS, and CRS but levels of this molecule appear to be depressed in patients with COVID-19. CD4+ T, CD8+ and NK lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of CRS, MAS, and possibly H1N1 but are reduced in number and dysfunctional in COVID-19. Additional elements underpinning the pathophysiology of cytokine storms include Inflammasome activity and DAMPs. Treatment with anakinra may theoretically offer an avenue to positively manipulate the range of biochemical and immune abnormalities reported in COVID-19 and thought to underpin the pathophysiology of cytokine storms beyond those manipulated via the use of, canakinumab, Jak inhibitors or tocilizumab. Thus, despite the relative success of tocilizumab in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients already on dexamethasone and promising results with Baricitinib, the combination of anakinra in combination with dexamethasone offers the theoretical prospect of further improvements in patient survival. However, there is currently an absence of trial of evidence in favour or contravening this proposition. Accordingly, a large well powered blinded prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test this hypothesis is recommended.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Biochemistry, Hematology, Molecular Biology"

Diagnosis is usually made by microscopic examination; however, the method has several drawbacks such as requiring an experienced microscopist, being unreliable when parasitemia is low and being unable to accurately differentiate between co-infections from multiple parasite species. Therefore, the current extent of haemosporidian infections might be underestimated and neglected. We have developed a novel multiplex PCR assay to simultaneously detect and differentiate between four haemosporidian parasites: Leucocytozoon caulleryi, Leucocytozoon sabrazesi, Plasmodium juxtanucleare and Plasmodium gallinaceum. Primers in the present study specifically amplified the corresponding targets with no cross-species amplification detected. The multiplex PCR exhibited a significantly greater detection rate when compared with microscopic examination (p = 0.0001). The results demonstrate that the detection rate of multiplex PCR for L. sabrazesi, P. juxtanucleare, and P. gallinaceum are all greater than that of microscopic examination with p = 0.002, 0.0001 and 0.004, respectively. Co-infections were also detected more effectively by multiplex PCR. We applied the current method to field samples originating from Nan, Prachinburi, and Chachoengsao Provinces. The current study revealed that positive rates of haemosporidian parasites in chickens in the three study sites ranging from 39.5%–93.8%. The present assay offers a timesaving option for molecular diagnosis instead of using singleplex PCRs for detecting the parasites individually. Within a single reaction, this assay would be a useful tool for the detection of avian haemosporidian parasites either single or under co-infection conditions and for large-scale epidemiology studies.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary parasitology; diagnosis, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Parasitology, Veterinary (all)"

The proposed scheme consists of two sequential steps: detecting seizure episodes from long EEG recordings, and determining seizure onsets and offsets of the detected episodes. We introduce a neural network-based model called ScoreNet to carry out the second step by better predicting the seizure probability of pre-detected seizure epochs to determine seizure onsets and offsets. A cost function called log-dice loss with a similar meaning to the F1 score is proposed to handle the natural data imbalance inherent in EEG signals signifying seizure events. ScoreNet is then verified on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database in combination with several classifiers including random forest, convolutional neural network (CNN), and logistic regression. As a result, ScoreNet improves seizure detection performance over lone epoch-based seizure classification methods; F1 scores increase significantly from 16-37% to 53-70%, and false positive rates per hour decrease from 0.53-5.24 to 0.05-0.61. This method provides clinically acceptable latencies of detecting seizure onset and offset of less than 10 seconds. In addition, an effective latency index is proposed as a metric for detection latency whose scoring considers undetected events to provide better insight into onset and offset detection than conventional time-based metrics.","fluidex; related topics, medical, neuroscience, engineering","Internal Medicine, Neuroscience (all), Biomedical Engineering, Rehabilitation"

The CS-PVA@CuO composite was systematically characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, and EDX analysis. The pseudo-first order (PFO), pseudo-second order (PSO), and intra-particle diffusion kinetics equations were used to examine the kinetic data of the adsorption process. The adsorption kinetics confirms that the PSO model was a more exact fit. Thermodynamics study typically revealed that the uptake of AB25 by the adsorbent is spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Remarkably, the results reveal the highest adsorption capacity of the CS-PVA@CuO was 171.4 mg/g at 313 K.

The main therapy involves controlling pruritus with antihistamines. Although guidelines have promoted the use of corticosteroids in addition to H1 antihistamines, well-designed clinical trials evaluating this approach are scarce. Methods: Adult ED patients with acute urticaria and a pruritus score > 5 on a visual analog scale (VAS) were randomized into three groups: (i) IV chlorpheniramine (CPM) treatment, (ii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone (CPM/Dex) and (iii) IV CPM and IV dexamethasone with oral prednisolone as discharge medication for 5 days (CPM/Dex/Pred). The primary outcomes were self-reported pruritus VAS scores at 60 min after treatment. We also evaluated 1-week and 1-month urticaria activity scores for 7 days and adverse events. Results: Seventy-five patients (25 per group) were enrolled. The VAS scores of all groups decreased, but no significant difference was found in the VAS scores at 60 min after treatment between patients in the CPM group (n = 25) and those who received both CPM and dexamethasone (n = 50). At the 1-week and 1-month follow-ups, active urticaria (indicated by the urticaria activity score at 7 days) was more prevalent in the CPM/Dex/Pred group (n = 25) than in the control group. Conclusions: The present study did not find evidence that adding IV dexamethasone improves the treatment of severe pruritus from uncomplicated acute urticaria. Oral corticosteroid therapy may be associated with persistent urticaria activity. Due to the lack of clinical benefits and the potential for side effects, using corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment is discouraged.",medical,Emergency Medicine

Materials and methods: This retrospective study collected data from dental records. Patients under 5 years of age received dental treatment under GA or LA during 2007–2016, with at least one anterior or posterior tooth receiving a pulpectomy, were recruited. Pulpectomy was considered a failure if the tooth required extraction or retreatment due to pulp treatment failure. Survival analysis was used to assess the outcome. The cumulative survival probability was analyzed with the Kaplan–Meier estimator. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between tooth survival and possible prognosis factors; sex, age, dental arch (upper/lower), tooth type (anterior/posterior), molar type (first/second molar), molar location (upper/lower molar), root filling material type, restoration type, preoperative radiographic findings and presence of pathologic root resorption. Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven primary teeth were included. At the 5-year follow-up, the survival rates of the pulpectomized teeth treated under GA and LA were 81.4% and 87.4%, respectively, which were not significantly different (p ≥ 0.05). A radiolucency on the preoperative radiograph was the only factor associated with tooth extraction or retreatment following pulpectomy, with a hazard ratio of 3.88 (95% CI = 1.29–11.65). Conclusions: Pulpectomized primary teeth treated under GA and LA demonstrated high survival rates. Preoperative radiolucency is a possible associated factor that decreases tooth survival following pulpectomy.

Abstract: Trichosanthes cucumerina L. (TC) has been used as a medicinal plant in Thailand with various potential functions. Two major triterpenoids found in this plant, bryonolic acid and cucurbitacin B, are receiving increased attention for their activities. Here, we provide TC transcriptome data to identify genes involved in the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway through callus, where was previously suggested as a novel source for bryonolic acid production as opposed to leaf and fruit. A de novo assembly of approximately 290-thousand transcripts generated from these tissues led to two putative oxidosqualene cyclases: isomultiflorenol synthase (IMS) and cucurbitadienol synthase (CBS). TcIMS and TcCBS, genes that encode substrates for two characteristic triterpenoids in cucurbitaceous plants, were identified as isomultiflorenol synthase and cucurbitadienol synthase, respectively. These two genes were functionally characterised in mutant yeast Gil77 systems, which led to the productions of isomultiflorenol and cucurbitadienol. Moreover, the callus-specific gene expression profiles were also presented. These obtained information showed candidate cytochrome P450s with predicted full-length sequences, which were most likely associated with triterpenoid biosynthesis, especially bryonolic acid.

The identification of PM phytochemicals is crucial for the development of standardised botanical drugs of PM. MeI was purified from the root cortex of PM, and its structure was elucidated using NMR and mass spectrometry. The content of MeI in the root bark of the PM root was 2.1–6.5 × 10−3% (w/w). The oestrogenic potency of MeI was stronger than that of isomiroestrol but less than that of deoxymiroestrol and miroestrol. Therefore, MeI is a new oestrogenic biomarker for the effective chemical standardisation of the PM extract for health product development.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Plant Science, Organic Chemistry"

Nevertheless, the cell characteristics and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production ability of C. necator strain A-04 were different from those of C. necator H16. This study aimed to express PHA biosynthesis genes of C. necator strain A-04 in Escherichia coli via an arabinose-inducible expression system. In this study, the PHA biosynthesis operon of C. necator strain A-04, consisting of three genes encoding acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (phaAA–04, 1182 bp, 40.6 kDa), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaBA–04, 741 bp, 26.4 kDa) and PHB synthase Class I (phaCA–04, 1770 bp), was identified. Sequence analysis of the phaAA–04, phaBA–04, and phaCA–04 genes revealed that phaCA–04 was 99% similar to phaCH16 from C. necator H16. The difference in amino acid residue situated at position 122 of phaCA–04 was proline, whereas that of C. necator H16 was leucine. The intact phaCABA–04 operon was cloned into the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter and transformed into E. coli strains Top 10, JM109 and XL-1 blue. The results showed that optimal conditions obtained from shaken flask experiments yielded 6.1 ± 1.1 g/L cell dry mass (CDM), a PHB content of 93.3 ± 0.9% (w/w) and a productivity of 0.24 g/(L⋅h), whereas the wild-type C. necator strain A-04 accumulated 78% (w/w) PHB with a productivity of 0.09 g/(L⋅h). Finally, for the scaled-up studies, fed-batch cultivations by pH-stat control in a 5-L fermenter of E. coli strains XL1-Blue harboring pBAD/Thio-TOPO-phaCABA–04 and pColdTF-phaCABA–04 in MR or LB medium, leading to a PHB production of 31.4 ± 0.9 g/L at 54 h with a PHB content of 83.0 ± 3.8% (w/w), a CDM of 37.8 ± 1.2 g/L, a YP/S value of 0.39 g PHB/g glucose and a productivity of 0.6 g PHB/(L⋅h) using pColdTF-phaCABA–04 in MR medium. In addition, PHB production was 29.0 ± 1.1 g/L with 60.2 ± 2.3% PHB content in the CDM of 53.1 ± 1.0 g/L, a YP/S value of 0.21 g PHB/g glucose and a productivity of 0.4 g PHB/(L⋅h) using pBAD/Thio-TOPO-phaCABA–04 in LB medium. Thus, a relatively high PHB concentration and productivity were achieved, which demonstrated the possibility of industrial production of PHB.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

Methods: Patients with thyrotoxic HF were compared with age and gender-matched patients hospitalized for acute HF (controls). Thyr-HF was defined by the Framingham criteria for HF and clinical hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 55%. Results: Of 11 109 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute HF between 1 January 2002 and 1 January 2017, 92 patients (0.8%) had thyrotoxic HF. Clinical and echocardiographic data were available in 87 patients (age 51 ± 16 years; 74% female), representing the study population. Compared with controls, patients with Thyr-HF had a smaller body surface area (BSA), a higher LVEF, a lower LV end-diastolic diameter, a higher tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), higher blood pressure, higher heart rate, and were more likely to have right-sided HF at presentation (P < 0.01 for all). The survival rate among patients with thyrotoxic HF was higher than the control group (HR: 4.3; 95% CI: 2.1–9.5). Fifty-eight percent of patients with thyrotoxic HF had thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy. In multivariate analysis, TAPSE (OR = 46; 95% CI: 1.04–2008.20; P = 0.047) and leukocytosis (OR = 16; 95% CI 1.01–259.39; P = 0.049) correlated with thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy. LV recovery was observed in 69% of these patients. Conclusions: Thyrotoxic HF was uncommon among patients hospitalized for acute HF. However, after definitive therapy, these patients had a more favourable prognosis than those hospitalized for acute HF without thyrotoxic HF. Clinical phenotypes of thyrotoxic HF include small BSA, middle-aged female, HF-pEF, and right-sided HF.

Methods: A multicenter, randomized, active-control, open-labeled trial was conducted. PHIVA (aged 10-20 years) who were on stable cART were enrolled. Baseline LSBMD status was defined as low (z-score ≤-2) and normal (> -2). Eligible PHIVA were randomly assigned to receive standard-dose (400 IU/1200 mg/day) or high-dose (400 IU/1200 mg/day plus ergocalciferol 20 000 IU/week) VitD/Ca supplementation for 48 weeks (ratio 1:1, stratified by baseline LSBMD). Study outcomes were changes in LSBMD, LSBMD z-scores, and bone metabolism-related biomarkers (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH], C-terminal telopeptide [CTX], procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide [PINP]) from baseline to week 48. Results: Among 200 enrolled PHIVA, median age was 16 (IQR:14-18) years; 61% were on NNRTI-based cART. Median 25(OH)D level was 25.5 (IQR: 20.8-33.0) ng/mL. After 48-week VitD/Ca supplementation, LSBMD significantly increased in both treatment groups (high-dose: Median: +0.07 [IQR: +0.04 to +0.11] g/cm2; P<.001; standard-dose: +0.09 [+0.03 to +0.13] g/cm2; P<.001). Notably, the change in LSBMD z-scores was significantly greater in high-dose versus standard-dose groups (median: +0.4 [IQR: -0.1 to +0.9] vs +0.1 [-0.4 to +0.7]; P=.02). Levels of 25(OH)D increased, whereas iPTH, CTX, and PINP declined significantly in both groups (P<.05), but no between-group differences were demonstrated. Conclusions: Over 48-week VitD/Ca supplementation, significant increases in LSBMD, and significant decreases in bone metabolism-related markers were observed among our Thai PHIVA in both treatment groups. The improvement in LSBMD z-score was more enhanced with high-dose VitD/Ca supplementation than standard-dose. High-dose VitD/Ca supplementation might be considered to promote bone health in this population.

Two variants of the MMRP, namely the MMRP without setup times (MMRP-0) and the MMRP with setup times (MMRP-1), are herein explored based on mathematical formulations of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Music Rehearsal Problem (MRP). Extensive computational results on 120 generated instances and 78 benchmark instances indicate that the ALNS is greatly efficient as it can provide equivalent or better solutions than the exact method and a benchmark heuristic from the literature, with much less computational time. We also find that the ALNS tends to perform better in large and complicated MMRP settings, considering that it outperforms the time-restricted CPLEX in 34 out of 120 generated instances and successfully finds 4 new best-known solutions to 8 large benchmark instances.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The survival time in splenic HSA is short, probably due to the lack of proper biological markers allowing early detection. We investigated the serum angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) concentrations in 9 healthy dogs and 40 dogs with abnormal splenic masses. The Ang-2 concentration differences were further compared in healthy dogs, dogs with splenitis, splenic HA and HSA. The results showed that the Ang-2 level in healthy dogs was significantly lower than in the splenitis and splenic HA cases. Moreover, the Ang-2 level was significantly higher in splenic HA than in splenic HSA. Conversely, no significant differences in Ang-2 level were recorded between healthy and splenic HSA dogs, and between splenitis and splenic neoplasms (HA and HSA). No significant correlations were observed between the Ang-2 level and (i) the clinical stage, (ii) histological growth pattern, and (iii) median survival time of splenic HSA dogs. In conclusion, serum Ang-2 concentration is a potentially useful biological marker for the discrimination of dogs with splenitis and splenic HA, as well as for the differentiation of splenic HA from its malignant form, HSA.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

To support a task of drug repositioning, many in silico methods have been proposed for predicting drug-disease associations. A meta-path based approach, which extracts network-based information through paths from a drug to a disease, can produce comparable performance with less required information when compared to other approaches. However, existing meta-path based methods typically use counts of extracted paths and discard information of intermediate nodes in those paths although they are very important indicators, such as drug-and disease-associated proteins. Herein, we propose an ensemble learning method with Meta-path based Gene ontology Profiles for predicting Drug-Disease Associations (MGP-DDA). We exploit gene ontology (GO) terms to link drugs and diseases to their associated functions and act as intermediate nodes in a drug-GO-disease tripartite network. For each drug-disease pair, MGP-DDA utilizes meta-paths to generate novel profiles of GO functions, termed as meta-path based GO profiles. We train bagging and boosting classifiers with those novel features to recognize known (positive) from unknown (unlabeled) drug-disease associations. Consequently, MGP-DDA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and yields the precision of 88.6%. By MGP-DDA, the eminent number of new drug-disease associations with supporting evidence in ClinicalTrials.gov (37.7%) ensures the practicality of our method in drug repositioning.","biological Materials Sciencerials and tissue engineeringneering, fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Methods: Mathematical pharmacokinetic models were developed using published demographic and PK data in adult critically ill patients with known variability and correlations between PK parameters. CRRT modalities (continuous venovenous hemofiltration and continuous venovenous hemodialysis) with different effluent rates were modeled. Levetiracetam regimens from available clinical resources were evaluated on the probability of target attainment (PTA) using pharmacodynamics (PD) target of the trough concentrations and area under the time-concentration curve within a range of 6–20 mg/L and 222–666 mg × hour/L for the initial 72 hours of therapy, respectively. Optimal regimens were defined from regimens that yielded the highest PTA. Each regimen was tested in a group of different 10,000 virtual patients. Results: Our results showed the optimal levetiracetam dosing regimen of 750–1000 mg every 12 hours is recommended for adult patients receiving both CRRT modalities with two different effluent rates of 25 and 35 mL/kg/h. Child-Pugh class C cirrhotic patients undergoing CRRT required lower dosing regimens of 500–750 mg every 12 ours due to smaller non-renal clearance. Of interest, some of literature-based dosing regimens were not able to attain the PK and PD targets. Significance: Volume of distribution, non-renal clearance, CRRT clearance, and body weight were significantly correlated with the PTA targets. Dosing adaptation in this vulnerable population should be concerned. Clinical validation of our finding is absolutely needed.","genergyal, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Although there has been a rapid growth of studies on AI in the recent years, real-world adoption of AI is still rare. One reason may be because the data derived from economic evaluations of AI in health care, which policy makers used for adopting new technology, have been fragmented and scarce. Most data on economics of AI in ophthalmology are from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Few studies classified costs of AI software, which has been considered as a medical device, into direct medical costs. These costs of AI are composed of initial and maintenance costs. The initial costs may include investment in research and development, and costs for validation of different datasets. Meanwhile, the maintenance costs include costs for algorithms upgrade and hardware maintenance in the long run. The cost of AI should be balanced between manufacturing price and reimbursements since it may pose significant challenges and barriers to providers. Evidence from cost-effectiveness analyses showed that AI, either standalone or used with humans, was more cost-effective than manual DR screening. Notably, economic evaluation of AI for DR screening can be used as a model for AI to other ophthalmic diseases.",medical,Ophthalmology

Method: Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science were systematically searched using terms related to PCA, tAD, and cognitive testing. Seventeen studies were identified, including 441 PCA, 391 tAD, and 284 HC participants. Standardised effect sizes of mean scores were calculated to measure performance differences on cognitive tests for PCA versus tAD and PCA versus HC groups. Meta-analyses used a random effects model. Results: The most discriminating cognitive tests for PCA and tAD presentations were measures of visuospatial function and verbal memory. Large, significant effect sizes were produced for all measures of visuospatial function, most notably for Rey–Osterrieth Copy (Hedges' g = −2.79), VOSP Fragmented letters (Hedges' g = −1.73), VOSP Dot Counting (Hedges' g = −1.74), and VOSP Cube Analysis (Hedges' g = −1.98). For measures of verbal memory, the RAVLT delay and Digit Span Backwards produced significant medium effects (Hedges’ g = .62 and −.56, respectively). Conclusion: Establishing a common framework for testing individuals with PCA has important implications for diagnosis and treatment, and forms a practical objective for future research. Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that measures of visuospatial function and verbal memory would form an important part of this framework.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience"

Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45oBx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 °C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (ΔHret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis.

The matrix materials that have been widely used in TDDS are hydrogels. The dextran hydrogels were prepared by the solution casting using trisodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) as the crosslinking agent, and diclofenac sodium salt (Dcf) as the anionic model drug. Poly(2-ethylaniline) (PEAn) was successfully synthesized and embedded into the dextran hydrogel as the drug encapsulation host. The in-vitro release of Dcf from the hydrogels was investigated using a modified Franz-Diffusion cell in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at the pH of 7.4 and at 37 °C for a period of 24 h, under the effects of crosslinking ratios, dextran molecular weights, electric potentials, and the conductive polymer PEAn. The release mechanism of Dcf from the dextran hydrogels and the composite without electrical potential was the diffusion controlled mechanism or the Fickian diffusion. Under applied electrical potentials, the release mechanism was a combination between the Fickian diffusion and the matrix swelling. The Dcf diffusion coefficients from the dextran hydrogels without electrical potential increased with decreasing crosslinking ratio and molecular weight. Under electrical potentials, the corresponding diffusion coefficients were much higher due mainly to the electro-repulsive force between the negatively charged electrode and the negatively charged dextran and the induced dextran expansion. For the Dcf-loaded PEAn/dextran composite, the diffusion coefficient was enhanced by two orders of magnitude when the electric potential was applied, specifically illustrating the unique features of PEAn as an efficient drug encapsulation host without electric field, and as a drug release enhancer under electric field through the reduction reaction.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Biosensors for the detection of organophosphate exposure by a new diethyl thiophosphate-specific aptamer,"Swainson N.M., Aiemderm P., Saikaew C., Theeraraksakul K., Rimdusit P., Kraiya C., Unajak S., Choowongkomon K.",2021-09-01,"Colorimetric methods, Diethyl thiophosphates, Dithiophosphates, Electrochemical techniques, Exposure history, Limit of detection, Parent compounds, Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichments, Aptamers, Nucleotide, Biosensing Techniques, Calorimetry, Electrochemical Techniques, Humans, Molecular Docking Simulation, Organophosphates, Phosphates, SELEX Aptamer Technique, Sensitivity and Specificity, Aptasensor, Capillary electrophoresis, Cyclic voltammetry, Diethyl thiophosphate, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Organophosphate metabolites","Objective: An aptamer specifically binding to diethyl thiophosphate (DETP) was constructed and incorporated in an optical sensor and electrochemical techniques to enable the specific measurement of DETP as a metabolite and a biomarker of organophosphate exposure. Results: A DETP-bound aptamer was selected from the library using capillary electrophoresis-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX). A colorimetric method revealed that the aptamer had the highest affinity for DETP, with a mean Kd value (± SD) of 0.103 ± 0.014 µM. The docking results and changes in resistance showed that the selectivity of the aptamer for DETP was higher than that for the similar structures of dithiophosphate (DEDTP) and diethyl phosphate (DEP). The altered amplitude of cyclic voltammetry showed a linear range of DETP detection covering 0.0001–10 µg/ml with a limit of detection of 0.007 µg/ml. The recovery value of a real sample of pH 7 was 97.2%. Conclusions: The current method showed great promise in using the DETP-specific aptamer to detect the exposure history to organophosphates by measuring their metabolites, although degradation of organophosphate parent compounds might occur.","genergyal, electrochemistryistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Microplastics at the high-tide line from 25 beaches in 5 provinces were quantified. Observed amounts range from 20 to 273 (max. 5741) pieces/kg. Sheets were the most common shape and black the most common color of microplastics. Our study showed a significant, positive correlation between the number of microplastics and land-based sources (e.g., aquatic industries). While human activities were the dominant factor affecting microplastic concentrations, the newly designed surface circulation direction (SCD) index reflected relative changes in microplastic amounts. Our study identified several locations with substantial microplastic pollution which require a proper management system with appropriate laws and regulations, and a public awareness campaign about effects of microplastics on ecosystems.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; marine, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, coastal and ocean engineeringneering, regional and genergyal, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

This condition is unfortunately not uncommon in clinical practice, especially among the elderly. It is often overlooked because the P wave is small and abnormalities can be difficult to detect. An isolated IAB does not usually cause any abnormal symptoms and may not require any specific treatment. Nevertheless, a relationship between an IAB and other cardiovascular conditions including left atrial electromechanical dysfunction, atrial remodeling, atrial fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, and stroke has been reported.

However, multistep reagent manipulation usually restricts the performance of the device for end users. Herein, we developed a sequential ePAD for sequential immunosensing fluid delivery by integrating dual flow behaviors (fast-flow/delayed) within a single paper platform for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C core antigen (HCVcAg). In the present work, a fast-flow channel was used for the automated washing of unbound antigens, while a delayed channel was created to store a redox reagent for further electrochemical analysis with a single buffer loading (the analysis time can be completed within 500 s). Hence, the undesirable complex procedure of multi-step reagent manipulation is scarcely needed by the user. The detection limit of the proposed ePAD was as low as 18.2 pg mL−1 for HBsAg and 1.19 pg mL−1 for HCVcAg. In addition, this proposed ePAD was also proven to be effective in real clinical sera from patients to verify its biological applicability. The ePAD sensor shows high promise as an easy-to-use, portable, and extendable sensor for other multiplex biological assays.","biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

We, therefore, investigated the antimigratory effect of 3,4-dihydroxy-5,4'-dimethoxybibenzyl (DS-1) on human lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Cell viability and proliferation were examined by the 3-[4,5- dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Filopodia formation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth assays were performed to assess metastatic behaviors while EMT-related proteins, integrins, and FAK-RhoA pathway were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results: We found that DS-1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells compared to the control. The aggressive behavior of cancer cells, including migration and invasion, was significantly reduced by DS-1. Anchorage-independent growth analysis provided evidence that DS-1 suppressed the growth and survival of cancer cells in detached conditions as indicated by the significant reduction in size and number of colonies. With regard to the mechanisms involved, we found that DS-1-suppressed EMT, as indicated by the reduction of EMT markers, namely Ncadherin, SNAIL and SLUG, and increased levels of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin. In addition, DS-1 was shown to reduce the level of integrin β1 protein and FAK activation. Conclusion: DS-1 suppressed lung cancer metastasis via suppressing EMT, integrin β1 expression and FAK-related signaling.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

Fecal specimens collected before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment were analyzed using amplicon-based 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results: Sustained virological response rates in the monoinfection and coinfection groups were similar (98.4% vs 95.8%). Pretreatment bacterial communities in the patient groups were less diverse and distinct from those of healthy controls. Compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals showed comparable microbial alpha diversity but decreased Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratios. The improvement of microbial dysbiosis was observed in responders achieving sustained virological response across fibrosis stages but was not found in nonresponders. Responders with a low degree of fibrosis exhibited a recovery in alpha diversity to levels comparable to those in healthy controls. Reciprocal alterations of increased beneficial bacteria and reduced pathogenic bacteria were also observed in responders. Conclusions: This study indicates a short-term effect of direct-acting antivirals in restoration of microbial dysbiosis. The favorable changes in gut microbiota profiles after viral eradication might contribute toward the reduction of HCV-related complications among infected individuals.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Infectious Diseases"

Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from fetuses at gestational day 16.5 to study neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis. The expression of synaptic proteins, BDNF and TrkB receptor was determined in postnatal day 14 (PND14), adolescent and adult mice; memory tests were also conducted. MA exposure decreased axon length and diameter, and synaptic areas in the primary cultures. Presynaptic protein was decreased in the hippocampus of PND14 mice prenatally exposed to MA, while increases in postsynaptic protein (PSD-95) were found in MA-exposed adolescent and adult mice. BDNF expression was enhanced in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of MA-exposed PND14 mice. Memory impairment was observed in MA-exposed adolescent and adult mice compared to control mice.

However, access to nucleic acid testing to quantify HBV DNA, an essential test to examine treatment eligibility, remains severely limited. We assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as a low-cost (less than US $15/assay) alternative to nucleic acid testing to indicate clinically important high viremia in chronic HBV patients infected with different genotypes. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through June 27, 2018. Three reviewers independently selected studies measuring HBV DNA and HBcrAg in the same blood samples. We contacted authors to provide individual participant data (IPD). We randomly allocated each IPD to a derivation or validation cohort. We applied optimal HBcrAg cut-off values derived from the derivation set to the validation set to estimate sensitivity/specificity. Results: Of 74 eligible studies, IPD were obtained successfully for 60 studies (81%). Meta-analysis included 5591 IPD without antiviral therapy and 4806 treated with antivirals. In untreated patients, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimal cut-off values were as follows: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94) and 3.6 log U/mL to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater; and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) and 5.3 log U/mL for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively.

In accordance with this government policy, the Department of Land Transport has partnered with the business sector to provide 100% EV taxis to encourage greater use of EVs. Ensuring there are sufficient charging stations is one of the critical factors for the adoption of EVs. Utilizing qualitative research, this paper studies the EV situation in Thailand, the expansion of EV taxis in Thailand, and the optimal site selection criteria for the installation of EV taxi charging stations. Regarding the EV taxi situation in Thailand, it was found that the expansion of EV taxis in Thailand can be divided into 2 cases: by the private sector without government promotion or support and by the private sector with government promotions and support. EV Society is the first and only company to run an EV taxi service with 100 units, mainly operating out of Suvarnabhumi Airport. According to interviews with key stakeholders, the optimal locations for the installation of charging stations are airports, main roads, tourist routes, normal taxi routes, taxi garages or nearby areas, and LPG/NGV/gas stations. These locations require enough parking space, easy access, sufficient power supply, and appropriate facilities, while they should also be scattered throughout the city at strategic locations within optimal distances of each other. Moreover, this study found that the key success factor for optimal site selection involves location analysis of the busiest taxi commuter routes to identify the routes that are in highest demand. Previous installation programs have involved large-scale investment but the stations were inefficient and had little usage in return. The investment efficiency can be improved by conducting applicable site selection analysis before installing charging stations.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies were 35.1–41.8% and 6.8–8.0%, respectively, and were comparable to aquaponics. Next-generation sequencing was used to examine the microbial communities in digested chicken manure and plant roots in bioponics. Results showed that several microbial genera were associated with organic degradation (e.g., Nocardiopsis spp., Cellvibrio spp.), nitrification (Nitrospira spp.), phosphorus solubilization, and plant growth promotion (e.g., WD2101_soil_group, and Bacillus spp.). Nocardiopsis spp., Romboutsia spp. and Saccharomonospora spp. were found at high abundances and a high degree of co-occurrences among the microbiota, suggesting that the microbial organic decomposition to nitrogen and phosphorus release could be the key factors to achieve better nutrient recovery in bioponics.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

In addition, little is known about HIV and syphilis prevalence and incidence in clinic-based samples of TGW. Here we evaluate the uptake of a transgender-specific package of primary care services by TGW in Bangkok, Thailand and assess HIV and syphilis prevalence and incidence among them. Methods: Open cohort study of TGW attending services at the Tangerine Community Health Clinic from 2016 to 2019. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of routinely collected clinic data was performed to study trends in the number of clients, clinic visits and HIV and syphilis prevalence and incidence. Results: During the study period, 2947 TGW clients made a total of 5227 visits to Tangerine. The number of clients significantly increased from 446 in 2016 to 1050 in 2019 (p < 0.001) and the number of visits from 616 to 2198 during the same period (p < 0.001). Prevalence of HIV at first visit was 10.8% and of syphilis 9.8%. HIV incidence was 1.03 per 100 person years (PY) and of syphilis 2.06 per 100 PY of follow-up. From 2016 to 2019, significant decreases occurred in the annual prevalence of HIV from 14.6% to 9.9% (p < 0.01). The annual prevalence of syphilis significantly increased from 6.6% in 2016 to 14.6% in 2018, and then decreased to 7.3% in 2019 (p < 0.001). The annual HIV incidence decreased during 2016 to 2019, from 1.68 to 1.28 per 100 PY, but this reduction was not statistically significant. The annual incidence of treponemal test seroconversion significantly increased from zero in 2016 to 4.55 per 100 PY in 2019 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The increasing uptake of a transgender-specific package of services, including co-located gender affirmative hormone therapy, suggests this may be an effective model in engaging and retaining TGW in primary care. The decrease in HIV prevalence and low HIV incidence across calendar years point at a possible reduction of HIV acquisition among the TGW population served by Tangerine. The increasing prevalence of syphilis suggests ongoing high-risk sexual behaviour and underscores the need for screening and treatment for this infection at the time of delivery of HIV services.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Kinetic studies on such chemical reactions help in scaling up the process, simulation studies including designing of reactors. In the present study, waste cooking oil was subjected to conventional transesterification process catalyzed by methanol and 1% (w/v) catalyst sodium hydroxide under different temperatures (40–65 °C). Methanol-oil was taken in the ratio 6:1 and maximum yield of biodiesel obtained was found to be 90% at 60 °C. The activation energy Ea of transesterification reaction of WCO to biodiesel was calculated and found to be 27.24 kJ/mol. A linear Arrhenius plot and high value of R2 confirmed the irreversible pseudo-second order of the reaction. The biodiesel was characterized for various fuel properties such as calorific value, ash content and cetane number. Engine testing using lab scale internal combustion engine (ICE) revealed an increase in power output with lower fuel consumption with reduction of CO, CO2, NOx, HC emission. Hence this study concluded that the WCO could be a potential feedstock to produce biodiesel.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of natural resources-derived MAA-containing emulsions on mouse ear tissue exposed to UV irradiation. DBA/2CrSlc male mice were irradiated by UV light at 120 mJ/cm2/day for 9 days. MAA-containing emulsions were prepared using mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), shinorine (SHI), or porphyra-334 (P334) and applied to mice ears at a dose of 50 mg/ear/day. After that, collected ear skin tissues were subjected to the observation of melanocytes, investigation for antioxidative stress markers, and measurement of advanced glycation-end products (AGEs). In addition, the antiglycative effects of MAAs were investigated in vitro. MAA-containing emulsions prepared in this study upregulated the activities of total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in mouse ear tissue exposed to UV irradiation. Increased accumulation of copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) -SOD and/or CAT was also found in mouse ear tissue on which M2G- or P334-containing emulsion had been applied. Furthermore, P334 exhibited an antiglycative effect on elastin in vitro. Although MAA-containing emulsions have antioxidative effects as well as in vitro antiglycation, a protective effect by the accumulation of AGEs in mice ears exposed to UV was not observed. Thus, application of MAA-containing emulsions stimulated or protected the expression of antioxidant-associated proteins, thereby leading to upregulation of antioxidative activities in mouse ear skin samples tissues under UV irradiation. Additional optimization of MAA-containing emulsions, including composition, process, and dosage should be considered for further improvement of efficacy.","genergyal, physics, Health Professions, biochemistryistry, medical","Radiation, Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

In this study, a mathematical isothermal model is developed to investigate the effect of crossover of the vanadium ion on distributions of the electrolyte concentration, activation overpotential profiles, and cell potential. The chemical reactions of redox reaction between different oxidation states of vanadium ions are included in this model. The model is validated by fitting the charging and discharging curves with experimental data. The concentration distributions of different vanadium ions with and without crossover effect are presented and compared. Results show that distributions of concentration and potential are more uniform due to the balance for VO2+ being generated from VO2+ and reduced by V2+. Moreover, the Coulombic efficiency of the VRFB is reduced from 0.971 to 0.892. The voltage is decreased by 0.05 V at the SOC of 0.5 due to vanadium ion crossover.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

However, instability of the cathode during operation leads to rapid capacity fading and poor stability. Binders play a crucial role in keeping all components in the cathode intact during cycling. However, the impact of the binders’ chemical structure on the electrochemical reaction in ZIBs is not well understood. Herein, the effect of the chemical structure of a conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and green binders, that is, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and cellulose acetate (CA), on the performance, cyclability, and reaction of Zn/α-MnO2aqueous batteries is investigated. Results show that a cathode having a PVDF binder yields the highest specific capacity in a full battery. Besides, the CMC-based ZIB is seen to attain superior cycling stability through 500 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles having no irreversible products confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It is found that the Na+ion in the CMC structure plays a critical role in promoting prominent battery reactions. The CMC-based ZIB, therefore, is able to maintain its high ionic diffusivity obtained from the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) during prolonged operation. Moreover, the interaction between binders and α-MnO2has been investigatedviadensity-functional theory (DFT) to affirm the high stability of the ZIB/α-MnO2with the CMC binder. This work highlights the importance of the selection of functional groups on the binder not only to enhance stability but also to control the preferential reactions of batteries. Such findings are ultimate keys for the development of low-cost, stable, and eco-friendly energy storage devices.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The number of patients with AD is projected to reach 152 million by 2050. Donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine are the only four drugs currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for AD treatment. However, these drugs can only alleviate AD symptoms. Thus, this research focuses on the discovery of novel lead compounds that possess multitarget regulation of AD etiopathology relating to amyloid cascade. The ascorbic acid structure has been designated as a core functional domain due to several characteristics, including antioxidant activities, amyloid aggregation inhibition, and the ability to be transported to the brain and neurons. Multifunctional ascorbic derivatives were synthesized by copper (I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction (click chemistry). The in vitro and cell-based assays showed that compounds 2c and 5c exhibited prominent multifunctional activities as beta-secretase 1 inhibitors, amyloid aggregation inhibitors, and antioxidant, neuroprotectant, and anti-inflammatory agents. Significant changes in activities promoting neuroprotection and anti-inflammation were observed at a considerably low concentration at a nanomolar level.

Nonetheless, recently developed ZIBs still suffer from low cycling stability and high capacity fading. Such shortcomings are caused by the reversibility of both zinc (Zn) and the cathode host material, as well as hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, which are naturally protic solvents. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a polar aprotic solvent, is examined as an electrolyte for a ZIB. Zn stripping/plating in DMSO-based electrolytes shows excellent reversibility and dendrite-free morphology. During charging and resting modes, hydrogen evolution is effectively inhibited. Insertion/extraction of Zn ions in DMSO-based electrolytes into delta-type manganese dioxide (δ-MnO2) demonstrates high stability, achieving a decent initial capacity of 159 mAh/g at 50 mA/g and a nominal discharge voltage of 1.15 V. At 100 mA/g charge/discharge cycling, the ZIB, having the DMSO-based electrolyte, can pass 1000 cycles, displaying a capacity retention of 60%. Overall, the improved performance of ZIBs can be attained using DMSO-based electrolytes. Results pave the way towards the practical application of ZIBs.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Materials Science","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

It is necessary for business leaders to understand the forthcoming changes that will affect their businesses in order to prepare themselves for any uncertainties and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper identifies changes that are expected to have an impact on Thailand’s energy system in the next 30 years and explores plausible scenarios for Thailand’s energy sector under such changes. The study starts with an examination of global and local circumstances. The examination pinpoints a focal issue as “to achieve sustainable development goals (SDG) by 2050”. Then, STEEP analysis is implemented to identify business drivers in social (S), technological (T), economical (E), ecological (E), and political (P) aspects. Subsequently, consultations with stakeholders are arranged to finalize the critical uncertainties. Policy and technology are found to be two of the most powerful factors affecting energy business and are, therefore, used as fundamental frameworks for scenario development. Accordingly, four plausible scenarios are derived providing different possible prospects for Thailand’s energy businesses. The findings can further be used in the analysis of national energy balance with detailed sector-by-sector projections.

Economic cost of tobacco smoking and secondhand smoke exposure at home in Thailand,Komonpaisarn T.,2021-02-25,"Female, Health Expenditures, Humans, Male, Non-Smokers, Thailand, Tobacco Smoke Pollution, Tobacco Smoking, economics, secondhand smoke, smoking caused disease","Introduction Smoking is an important public health concern. This study is the first that attempts to estimate the economic cost of smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure at home in Thailand. Method A prevalence-based cost of illness approach following the guideline by WHO is employed. Result In 2017, the direct morbidity cost attributable to smoking and SHS exposure at home in Thailand was estimated to be at least US$265.97 million and US$23.66 million, respectively. Indirect morbidity costs from workday loss totalling US$25.04 million can be linked to smoking, while US$1.72 million was the result of SHS exposure at home. Smoking-attributable premature deaths resulted in an opportunity loss to the country equivalent to US$2.48 billion, while the figure was US$181.41 million for SHS exposure at home. Total years of life lost due to smoking and SHS-attributable premature deaths are estimated to have been at least 390 955 years for males and 82 536 years for females. The total economic cost from both types of tobacco exposure amounted to US$2.98 billion, equivalent to 17.41% of Thailand's current health expenditure or 0.65% of its gross domestic product in 2017. Conclusion Smoking imposed a substantial economic burden on Thailand in 2017. Seven per cent of this cost was imposed on non-smokers sharing a residence with smokers. Females bore 80% of this SHS-related cost. The findings call for prompt responses from public health agencies in Thailand to launch effective tobacco control policies.","sociology, medical","Health (social science), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Incidental findings are frequently encountered during lung cancer screening (LCS). Limited data describe the prevalence of suspected acute infectious and inflammatory lung processes on LCS and how they should be managed. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, radiologic reporting and management, and outcome of suspected infectious and inflammatory lung processes identified incidentally during LCS and to propose a management algorithm. METHODS. This retrospective study included 6314 low-dose CT (LDCT) examinations performed between June 2014 and April 2019 in 3800 patients as part of an established LCS program. Radiology reports were reviewed, and patients with potentially infectious or inflammatory lung abnormalities were identified and analyzed for descriptors of imaging findings, Lung-RADS designation, recommendations, and clinical outcomes. Using the descriptors, outcomes, and a greater than 2% threshold risk of malignancy, a follow-up algorithm was developed to decrease additional imaging without affecting cancer detection. RESULTS. A total of 331/3800 (8.7%) patients (178 men, 153 women; mean age [range], 66 [53–87] years) undergoing LCS had lung findings that were attributed to infection or inflammation. These abnormalities were reported as potentially significant findings using the S modifier in 149/331 (45.0%) and as the dominant nodule used to determine the Lung-RADS category in 96/331 (29.0%). Abnormalities were multiple or multifocal in 260/331 (78.5%). Common descriptors were ground-glass (155/331; 46.8%), tree-in-bud (56/331; 16.9%), consolidation (41/331; 12.4%), and clustered (67/331; 20.2%) opacities. A follow-up chest CT outside of screening was performed within 12 months or less in 264/331 (79.8%) and within 6 months or less in 186/331 (56.2%). A total of 260/331 (78.5%) opacities resolved on follow-up imaging. Two malignancies (2/331; 0.6%) were associated with these abnormalities and both had consolidations. Theoretic adoption of a proposed management algorithm for suspected infectious and inflammatory findings reduced unnecessary follow-up imaging by 82.6% without missing a single malignancy. CONCLUSION. Presumed acute infectious or inflammatory lung abnormalities are frequently encountered in the setting of LCS. These opacities are commonly multifocal and resolve on follow-up. Less than 1% are associated with malignancy. CLINICAL IMPACT. Adoption of a conservative management algorithm can standardize recommendations and reduce unnecessary imaging without increasing the risk of missing a malignancy.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Iodine, as an iodate ion or iodide ion, was simultaneously extracted and preconcentrated by gel electromembrane microextraction (G-EME) and analyzed for total iodine by ion chromatography. The total iodine was determined by combining the peak areas of both iodate and iodide ions. Under the optimized conditions, linear calibration for iodine using a mixture of iodate and iodide ions was obtained from 10 to 100 µg L–1 (r2 > 0.996). The detection limit was 7.0 µg L–1. Recoveries of spiked iodine (as iodate) in the samples were greater than 90%. The method was applied for the determination of iodine in dietary supplements and fortified food samples, i.e., iodine-enriched eggs. Our developed method could be directly applied for the determination of iodine in different matrix samples including eggs without a pretreatment step.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"

A sensitivity analysis of operating conditions, ratios, types and sizes of pellet catalysts were performed to determine the optimal parameters offering a maximum alkene yield. The most suitable pellet catalyst type was DMD. Depending on operating conditions, the optimal DMD had a core metathesis diameter of between 0.28 and 3.43 mm, with spherical particles between 1 and 7 mm in diameter. The optimal DMD showed increased alkene yield up to 43%, while alkene selectivity improved by 25–35% from the base case.

Methods: ACLF patients recruited from the APASL-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) were followed up till 30 days, death or transplantation, whichever earlier. Clinical details, including dynamic grades of HE and laboratory data, including ammonia levels, were serially noted. Results: Of the 3009 ACLF patients, 1315 (43.7%) had HE at presentation; grades I–II in 981 (74.6%) and grades III–IV in 334 (25.4%) patients. The independent predictors of HE at baseline were higher age, systemic inflammatory response, elevated ammonia levels, serum protein, sepsis and MELD score (p < 0.05; each). The progressive course of HE was noted in 10.0% of patients without HE and 8.2% of patients with HE at baseline, respectively. Independent predictors of progressive course of HE were AARC score (≥ 9) and ammonia levels (≥ 85 μmol/L) (p < 0.05; each) at baseline. A final grade of HE was achieved within 7 days in 70% of patients and those with final grades III–IV had the worst survival (8.9%). Ammonia levels were a significant predictor of HE occurrence, higher HE grades and 30-day mortality (p < 0.05; each). The dynamic increase in the ammonia levels over 7 days could predict nonsurvivors and progression of HE (p < 0.05; each). Ammonia, HE grade, SIRS, bilirubin, INR, creatinine, lactate and age were the independent predictors of 30-day mortality in ACLF patients. Conclusions: HE in ACLF is common and is associated with systemic inflammation, poor liver functions and high disease severity.

Cancer cell death was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and apoptosis-associated morphological changes were observed by phase contrast microscopy. Additionally, Western blotting was used to study protein expression following treatment with candidone, and transwell migration and invasion assays were used for observing cancer cell migration and invasiveness, respectively. The results suggest that candidone possesses potent inhibitory activity against HepG2 cells (concentration, 100 μM; 24 h treatment). Cancer cells treated with candidone exhibited apoptosis-associated changes, including detachment, cell shrinkage and death. Furthermore, candidone was shown to promote cell death by activating caspase-3 and -9, and decreasing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, including p65, induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death and survivin.

A better understanding of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) of BCM will increase the chance of success in applied projects, which is still not clearly identified. This study aims to fill in this gap. The potential success factors were identified by using the Delphi study with ten BCM experts. Then, they have been identified as four main categories and twenty sub-categories. According to this, a questionnaire was created and distributed to employees who have experience of involving with the BCM project in the research company. In total, 22 effective surveys were collected, and the response rate is 85%. Further, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to analyze the questionnaire survey. As a result of AHP, the consistency values (CR) of all categories were calculated less than 0.1, which reveals that the decisions made by all the employees were consistent. The results show that the BCM Capability is the most important category leading to the BCM success. In the BCM capability, the most influential sub-categories was identified as Competent BCM project manager, Mutual understanding among BCM team members, BCM expertise of BCM team members, Strong relationship and involvement of BCM team members, and Aligned BCM needs of team members, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Tree-ring analysis can provide important information for understanding long-term trends in carbon-fixation capacity under climate change. However, tree-ring studies in tropical regions are limited. We carried out a tree-ring analysis to investigate the dendrochronological potential of the tropical forest tree Choerospondias axillaris (Anacardiaceae) in east-central Thailand. Our study focused on growth-climate relationships and long-term growth trends. A chronology was constructed covering the period from 1932 to 2019. The tree-ring width index of C. axillaris was positively correlated with precipitation in June, July, and October. Furthermore, growth of C. axillaris was positively correlated with the Standard-ized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from July to October, indicating that growth of C. axillaris is mainly limited by moisture availability in the late monsoon season. Moving correlation analysis further revealed the consistency and temporal stability of the relationship of tree growth with monsoon season precipitation and SPEI during the period under study. There was a significant increasing trend in long-term growth from 1932 to 2002 (slope = 0.017, p < 0.001); however, long-term growth decreased from 2003 to 2019 (slope = −0.014, p < 0.001).

Mott) seedling pots. Furthermore, the influence of the enhancing agent on As uptake was compared with the addition of PO43- at levels of 0.7 (P1), 1.4 (P2), and 2.8 (P3) mmol/kg, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at levels of 2.5 (E1), 5 (E2), and 10 (E3) mmol/kg. The increase in the enhancing agent level resulted in a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decrease in aboveground biomass and SPAD values. This was due to the high levels of the enhancing agent inducing a high As concentration in the aboveground parts of the grass. The optimum level of P2 caused the labile As at the anode to form mainly in the charged species throughout the experiment. This caused P2 to have 2.62 μg/g of As in its aboveground parts, which was 38.93% of the total accumulated As. The optimum level of E1 returned a similar As concentration of 2.27 μg/g in the aboveground parts, which was 41.34% of the total accumulated As, corresponding to the highest translocation factor (TF). Moreover, As K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of mine tailings at the anodes of P2 and E1 indicated that the oxidation of As(-I) to As(V) increased. This caused As in mine tailings to be more phytoavailable and also enhanced the translocation of As from the underground to the aboveground parts of the grass.","fluidex; related topics, pollution and waste management - non-radioactive, environmental, coastal engineering, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Water Science and Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Waste Management and Disposal"

Globally, IrN4@G is a very promising bifunctional catalyst for both OER and ORR with the extremely low overpotentials of 0.30 and 0.26 V, respectively. Such outstanding electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ir and N. More importantly, by constructing 2D activity volcano plots, we obtained the limiting overpotentials of TMN4@G system with the values of 0.26 V for OER and 0.24 V for ORR. These findings open up new opportunities for further exploring graphene-based materials for highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

This system was designed using colorimetric reagents preadded to the agarose gel for the determination of the following two model analytes: iodide and hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)]. In this system, when a voltage was applied, the analytes were extracted and transferred from the sample solution (donor phase) to the gel (acceptor phase). The analytes then simultaneously reacted with the colorimetric reagents inside the gel, yielding blue and violet colors for iodide and Cr(VI), respectively. These colors were then analyzed using a portable spectrometer and could also be distinguished with the naked eye. Parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were studied and optimized for both analytes. The gel composition for iodide detection was 4% (w/v) agarose, 5% (v/v) H2O2, and 1% (w/v) starch in 2 mM HCl. The gel composition for Cr(VI) detection was 2% (w/v) agarose and 1% (w/v) DPC in 0.5 mM HNO3. Both analytes were extracted at an applied potential of 50 V, an extraction time of 15 min and a stirring rate of 600 rpm.

Finally, these systems were successfully applied to the determination of iodide in iodide food supplement samples and Cr(VI) in drinking water samples, showing a negligible matrix effect. This integration could also be extended to other analytes and detection systems to develop sensitive, on-site, and environmentally friendly sensing approaches.",chemistry,Analytical Chemistry

Owing to the wide distribution of CAs and their physiological functions in various tissues, systemic administration of CAIs may lead to unwanted side effects. Thus, exploration of drugs targeting the specific CA isoenzyme in ocular tissues and application of the same as topical eye drops would be desirable. However, the anatomical and physiological barriers of the eyes can limit drug availability at the site. The very low aqueous solubility of CAI agents can further hamper drug bioavailability, consequently resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Solubilization of drugs using cyclodextrin (CD) complexes can enhance both solubility and permeability of the drugs. The use of CD for such purposes and development and testing of topical CAI eye drops containing CD have been discussed in detail.

A novel method for fall risk assessment may provide more insight into preventable high-risk activities to reduce future falls. Objectives: To explore the prediction of falling in PD patients using a machine learning-based approach. Method: 305 PD patients, with or without a history of falls within the past month, were recruited. Data including clinical demographics, medications, and balance confidence, scaled by the 16-item Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-16), were entered into the supervised machine learning models using XGBoost to explore the prediction of fallers/recurrent fallers in two separate models. Results: 99 (32%) patients were fallers and 58 (19%) were recurrent fallers. The accuracy of the model to predict falls was 72% (p = 0.001). The most important factors were item 7 (sweeping the floor), item 5 (reaching on tiptoes), and item 12 (walking in a crowded mall) in the ABC-16 scale, followed by disease stage and duration. When recurrent falls were analysed, the models had higher accuracy (81%, p = 0.02). The strongest predictors of recurrent falls were item 12, 5, and 10 (walking across parking lot), followed by disease stage and current age. Conclusion: Our machine learning-based study demonstrated that predictors of falling combined demographics of PD with environmental factors, including high-risk activities that require cognitive attention and changes in vertical and lateral orientations. This enables physicians to focus on modifiable factors and appropriately implement fall prevention strategies for individual patients.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

For comparison purposes, the similar catalysts were also prepared by the conventional impregnation method. The FSP-made Fe/Al2O3 and Fe/Ce-Al2O3 with 3 and 5 wt % Ce exhibited the crystal structure mainly of FeAl2O4 spinel phase and small trace of alumina without the presence of other phases such as iron oxide or cerium oxide phases. However, addition of 7 wt % Ce, the additional peaks of both CeO2 and Fe2O3 were observed. The XPS and TPR results suggest the presence of Fe2O3 cluster on the FSP-made catalyst surface. The catalytic performance of the FSP-made catalysts in terms of both CO2 reaction rate and selectivity to hydrocarbon were much better than those prepared by impregnation method. Addition of Ce also promoted the CO2 hydrogenation rate and hydrocarbon selectivity. Improvement of catalytic properties of FSP-made catalysts was probably due to the high interaction of Fe and Al2O3, which led to the high dispersion of Fe2O3 on catalyst surface. Addition of Ce promoted the formation of iron carbide, which was the active site for hydrocarbon formation, however, excessive amount of Ce doping could resulted in the coverage of the active sites, resulting in the decrease of catalytic performances.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Methods: An anthropomorphic phantom representing an adult male (ATOM Max 711-HN, Norfolk, VA, USA) was scanned using the 3D Accuitomo 170 CBCT (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) using 11 FOVs. During each scan, half of the X-ray beam was blocked. Each scan was performed at three exposure settings with varying beam energy and equal radiation dose: 90 kV 5 mA, 77 kV 7.5 mA and 69 kV 10 mA. The SPR was estimated by measuring the grey values in the blocked and non-blocked regions of the RAW data. The effect of FOV on SPR was evaluated using Dunn's multiple comparison test, and the effect of the exposure settings was compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Larger FOVs showed increased scatter. FOVs with a shorter isocenter-detector distance showed a particularly high SPR. Most intercomparisons between FOVs were statistically significant. The largest difference was found between 17 × 12 cm and 6 × 6 cm (lower jaw), with the former showing a 4.9-fold higher SPR. The effect of beam energy was relatively small and varied between FOV sizes and positions. Conclusion: While the choice of FOV size and position is determined by the diagnostic region of interest, the image quality deterioration for large FOVs due to scatter provides another incentive to limit the FOV size as much as possible.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

Phosphorus owns excellent properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, anisotropic electronic properties, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, good electrochemical activity, and high surface area. The interlayer distance of black phosphorus (BP) (0.55 nm) is higher than that of graphene which makes facile ion transportation for supercapacitor application. The phosphorus-based electrode obtained with top-down approaches such as exfoliation and bottom-up approach such as pulsed laser deposition. The BP has been investigated due to its small electronegativity of P which is beneficial to improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode and its abundance nature makes it a desirable candidate for the fabrication of low-cost device.

This is the first review on phosphorus integrated supercapacitor devices. This review will give a brief idea about BP to researchers in search of outstanding supercapacitor configurations with different electrodes and electrolytes.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Enhanced α-olefins selectivity by promoted CO adsorption on ZrO2@FeCu catalyst,"Guo X., Guo L., Cui Y., Vitidsant T., Reubroycharoen P., Liu G., Wu J., Yoneyama Y., Yang G., Tsubaki N.",2021-09-01,"Bimetallic oxides, Catalytic performance, Characterization techniques, Nano sized, Precipitation methods, Structure-function relationship, Wetness impregnation, ZrO2, Bimetallic oxide, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, Nano-sized capsule, ZrO2, α-olefins","The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, as an alternative route to produce high-quality liquid fuels and chemicals, has received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, a nano-sized capsule catalyst (ZrO2@FeCu) with ZrO2 as a core and FeCu bimetallic oxide as a shell was fabricated by urea hydrolysis method. For comparison, FeCu@ZrO2 capsule catalyst was synthesized by the sequential precipitation method. FeCu + ZrO2 reference catalyst was obtained by physically mixing of FeCu and ZrO2 samples. Besides, these catalysts with potassium (K) modification were realized by wetness impregnation method, and the catalysts are denoted as ZrO2@FeCu-K, FeCu@ZrO2-K, and FeCu + ZrO2-K, respectively. The structure-function relationship of the obtained catalysts was systematically clarified by means of a series of characterization techniques, such as BET, XRD, H2-TPR, CO-TPD, XPS, SEM and EDS mapping. Among these catalysts after reduction, ZrO2@FeCu-K exhibited the most excellent catalytic performance with 97 % CO conversion and 49 % α-olefins selectivity by promoted CO adsorption.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Computational study on peptidomimetic inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease,"Somboon T., Mahalapbutr P., Sanachai K., Maitarad P., Lee V.S., Hannongbua S., Rungrotmongkol T.",2021-01-15,"Hydrogen-bond formation, Hydrophobic interactions, Molecular complexation, Molecular dynamics simulations, Rational drug designs, Residue decomposition, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Van Der Waals interactions, COVID-19, MD simulations, Peptidomimetic inhibitors, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro","The emergence outbreak caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received significant attention on the global risks. Due to itscrucial role in viral replication, the main protease 3CLpro is an important target for drug discovery and development to combat COVID-19. In this work, the structural and dynamic behaviors as well as binding efficiency of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 11a, 13b, and 14b) recently co-crystalized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were studied and compared using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvated interaction energy-based binding free energy calculations. The per-residue decomposition free energy results suggested that the key residues involved in inhibitors binding were H41, M49, L141–C145, H163–E166, P168, and Q189–T190 in the domains I and II. The van der Waals interaction yielded the main energy contribution stabilizing all the focused inhibitors. Besides, their hydrogen bond formations with F140, G143, C145, H164, E166, and Q189 residues in the substrate-binding pocket were also essential for strengthening the molecular complexation. The predicted binding affinity of the four peptidomimetic inhibitors agreed with the reported experimental data, and the 13b showed the most efficient binding to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. From rational drug design strategies based on 13b, the polar moieties (e.g., benzamide) and the bulky N-terminal protecting groups (e.g., thiazole) should be introduced to P1’ and P4 sites in order to enhance H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions, respectively. We hope that the obtained structural and energetic information could be beneficial for developing novel SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors with higher inhibitory potency to combat COVID-19.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The CU-TPD4 isolate was confirmed to be a S. cerevisiae by molecular analysis and to be an oleaginous yeast with more than 20% (w/w) of the cell dry weight (CDW) present in the form of lipids. The lipid content and lipid yield of CU-TPD4 (52.96 ± 1.15% of CDW and 1.78 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively) under optimized growth conditions were much higher than those under normal growth conditions (22.65 ± 1.32% of CDW and 1.24 ± 0.12 g/L, respectively). The major fatty acids produced by CU-TPD4 were oleic (C18:1), palmitoleic (C16:1), stearic (C18:0), and palmitic (C16:0) acids. Mathematical estimation of the physical properties of the biodiesel obtained by transesterification of the extracted lipid suggested it was suitable as biodiesel with respect to the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 international standards. Consequently, S. cerevisiae CU-TPD4 is expected to emerge as a promising alternative for biodiesel production.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The use of a bio-oil as a renewable and low-cost feedstock for an external reforming SOFC system can reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. From a technical perspective, high-purity hydrogen (H2) for SOFCs can be produced from the sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR). In this study, an economic analysis of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC integrated system (160 kW alternating current electricity production) is performed to evaluate the feasibility of the designed process. An economic comparison of the systems with different configurations, i.e., SESR-SOFC integrated systems with and without anode gas recirculation and a conventional reforming-based SOFC system (CON-SOFC), is presented in terms of their net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). According to the results, the SESR-SOFC system with anode gas recirculation is more favorable than the CON-SOFC system and SESR-SOFC system without recirculation. Nevertheless, it remains economically infeasible because its NPC in the 20th year is approximately 6.13% higher than that of the combined heat and power (CHP) system (a base case). However, it can attain economic equivalence with the CHP system when a carbon tax of at least $15 tCO2−1 is considered or when the SOFC capital cost, interest rate, and bio-oil cost are separately reduced by 14%, 21%, and 37%, respectively. In addition, an increase in feed-in tariff has the highest impact on the NPC reduction of the renewable bio-oil SESR-SOFC integrated system with recirculation.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Herein, a functional separator composed of cellulose nanofibers and graphene oxide (CG) is developed for dendrite-free and exceptionally stable ZIBs, realized by uniform hexagonal zinc deposits with manipulated crystallographic orientation (002) plane. This CG separator with negative surface charges and abundant zincophilic-O groups ensures the strong interaction between the separator and zinc species, simultaneously inducing Zn(002) deposition due to the low mismatch between (002)Zn and (002)GO, thus initiating the preferential orientation of the zinc growth along the horizontal direction due to strong Zn binding ability, and uniform interfacial charge of Zn(002) deposition. Furthermore, the CG separator can effectively promote the uniform nucleation of Zn2+ and eliminate side effects. Accordingly, extremely low polarization of 58 mV at 0.5 mA cm−2, and ultralong cycle life over 1750 h at 2 mA cm−2 and 400 h at 20 mA cm−2 are achieved for the zinc anode. Notably, the CG separator significantly boosts rate capability and cyclability of coin-type full batteries (Zn||Zn(CF3SO3)2||V2O5, Zn||ZnSO4+MnSO4||MnO2/graphite) and a flexible soft-packaged battery (Zn||MnO2). Therefore, this work introduces a sustainability consideration in to the design of separators for constructing dendrite-free ZIBs.","mixing and separation, energy, Materials Science","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all)"

We therefore investigated sleep difficulties in Thai children aged 3-16 years with ASD compared with age- and gender-matched TD children by using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)-Thai version. Methods: Sixty-five children with ASD (mean age 97.7, SD 44.5 months; boys 70.8%) and 65 TD individuals (mean age 98.5, SD 43.5 months) were enrolled at a university-based hospital in Bangkok. Background characteristics, sleep duration variables, and the CSHQ were completed by the participants' parents. The CSHQ subscales and total score between children with ASD and TD controls were then compared. Results: Children with ASD were more likely to have longer sleep latency than TD individuals for both weekdays and the weekend. Those with ASD had higher CSHQ subscales including bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep anxiety, and night waking in addition to the CSHQ total scores than TD controls. In the ASD group, those who took psychostimulants for treatment of ADHD had lower scores on the sleep duration subscale compared with unmedicated individuals. Conclusions: Sleep difficulties were more prevalent in children with ASD compared with TD individuals. Parents should be advised to be aware of sleep problems in individuals with ASD. As such, sleep disturbances will be identified early, resulting in appropriate management and improved quality of life, not only for those with ASD but also their families.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

This reversible thermochromic nanocomposite with magnetic properties is ideally suited for advanced applications requiring precise local thermal or pH sensing. For instance, the magnetothermally induced thermochromism of PDA could be implemented for real-time measurement of the local temperature (e.g., magnetic hyperthermia), visualization of the magnetic field, and many other related applications.

This process produced partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME) as a new type of high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), which is a potential source for formulating high blends of biodiesel fuel with petrodiesel. MCM-41 supports with various structural properties and morphologies were synthesized by self-assembly with different amounts of ammonia solution as a mineralizing agent. Bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 4 were stepwise impregnated on three MCM-41 supports, resulting in a series of Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity (0.89–1.79 cm3 g−1), average pore size (3.2–8.5 nm), and particle size (0.12–0.62 μm). The Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst prepared with the least amount of ammonia produced the best partial hydrogenation conversion of polyunsaturated FAME into mono-FAME, ascribed to nano-aggregation resulting in a dual-pore system containing large pores for fast molecular diffusion; a high turnover frequency (1920 h−1), larger k1 rate constant (0.60 gcat−1h−1), and smaller k2 rate constant (0.37 gcat−1h−1) were obtained. Furthermore, this Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited excellent sulfur resistance in the synthesis of H-FAME, even though the feedstocks contained approximately 5 ppm of sulfur contaminates.

The evaluation of non-anesthetic computed tomography for detection of pulmonary parenchyma in feline mammary gland carcinoma: a preliminary study,"Klaengkaew A., Sutthigran S., Thammasiri N., Yuwatanakorn K., Thanaboonnipat C., Ponglowhapan S., Choisunirachon N.",2021-12-01,"Anesthesia, Animals, Artifacts, Cat Diseases, Cats, Female, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Mammary Neoplasms, Animal, Pulmonary Atelectasis, Radiography, Thoracic, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Atelectasis, Cat, Computed tomography, Lung, Mammary gland carcinoma, Radiography","Background: Thoracic radiography in awake cats is a common procedure for the evaluation of pulmonary metastasis in feline mammary gland carcinoma (MGC). However, due to poor sensitivity, computed tomography (CT) is progressively taking its place. To perform CT in animals, general anesthesia is normally preferred but can cause lung atelectasis, affecting lung interpretation. Besides, MGC is often found in senile cats that are concurrently affected with other diseases, increasing anesthetic risk. Therefore, this study was aimed at comparing the effect of anesthesia on lung atelectasis observed through CT in clinically healthy cats and comparing the feasibility of non-anesthetic CT with non-anesthetic radiography in the detection of lung lesions in feline MGC. Thoracic CTs from anesthetized, clinically healthy cats and non-anesthetized either clinically healthy cats or MGC-affected cats were reviewed. In clinically healthy cats, motion artifacts and characteristics of lung atelectasis were observed and compared. In MGC-affected cats, motion artifacts were observed and compared to clinically healthy cats, and the number of MGC-affected cats, the number and characteristics of lung lesions were compared between non-anesthetic thoracic CT and radiography. Results: Anesthesia significantly increased lung CT attenuation (P = 0.0047) and was significantly correlated with lung atelectasis (OR = 15; CI 2.02–111.18; P = 0.0081), particularly of the cranial lung lobe. Nonetheless, significantly higher motion artifacts in the caudal thoracic area were found in non-anesthetized healthy cats (P = 0.0146), but comparable low motion artifacts were observed in anesthetized healthy and MGC-affected cats. Non-anesthetic CT revealed higher numbers of MGC-affected cats and pulmonary nodules with a significantly lower nodular diameter (P = 0.0041) than those observed on radiographs. The smallest nodular diameters detected on radiographs and CT were 2.5 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Furthermore, CT showed additional information such as intra-thoracic lymphadenopathy, that could not be seen on radiographs. Conclusions: Despite the motion artifacts, CT without anesthesia is a sensitive technique as it provides better lung inflation. Furthermore, compared to non-anesthetic radiography, non-anesthetic CT provided more information such as higher number of pulmonary nodules of a smaller size, including more distinct intra-thoracic lesions, such as lymphadenopathy, in MGC-affected cats.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
Effect of magnetic fields on the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in a dynamic fluid system,"Sittipol W., Sronsri C., U-yen K.",2021-11-20,"Dye solutions, Dynamic fluids, Effect of magnetic field, Exposed to, Fluid systems, Magnetic-field, Methylene Blue, Photocatalytic degradation, Ultraviolet irradiations, Zinc oxide catalyst, Dynamic fluid, Magnetic fields, Methylene blue, Photocatalytic degradation, Ultraviolet irradiation, Zinc oxide catalyst","Methylene blue dye can induce negative effects to aquatic life and the environmental system. So, it is important to remove it from water. Although, the photocatalytic degradation of dye solution during magnetic treatment (or static water process) can increase the dye degradation, but it cannot apply for a large wastewater. Therefore, the dynamic fluid system is required. This paper investigated the effect of magnetic fields (MFs) through dynamic fluid magnetization system on the degradation of dye solution. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation experiments were carried out in the presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) catalyst. The experiment was divided into two parts. First, the dye solution was exposed to MFs multiple times. In the second part, the dye solution was exposed to MFs continuously using a dynamic fluid system. The results indicated that the dye solution degraded faster when the exposure time to MFs under dynamic fluid system was long. At least 60% of the dye solution degraded within 3 min when the MF of strength 600 mT was applied. On the other hand, the dye solution degraded by only 24% in the absence of MFs. The degradation mechanism was observed to fit the pseudo-first-order kinetic reaction. The rate constant of the reaction was higher in the presence of MFs than that in the absence of MFs. This resulted in better degradation performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the photocatalytic degradation of the dye solution was enhanced when external MFs were applied to magnetize dye solution using dynamic fluid system.","energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

This study aims to formulate microemulsion-based washing solutions from mixed surfactants for cleaning SBE contaminated with crude rice bran oil using the hydrophilic–lipophilic deviation (HLD) concept. Binary nonionic-anionic surfactant mixtures consisting of System A (Dehydol LS3TH-Levenol WX), System B (Dehydol LS5TH-Levenol WX), and System C (Dehydol LS7TH-Levenol WX) were formulated for use as microemulsion-based washing formulations. A HLDmixed equation extended with the excess free energy term (GEX/RT) was developed and proposed for predicting the optimum salinity. The optimum salinities obtained from the HLDmixed equation were close to those obtained from the phase behavior. In the SBE washing study, the mixed-surfactant systems showed a washing efficiency of 90% with low surfactant adsorption capacity on bleaching earth (qmax = 0.01–0.03 mol g−1). The mixed surfactants showed improved washing performance compared to that of the single-surfactant system. This work highlights the utility of using the HLD concept in designing microemulsion-based washing formulations from surfactants for the removal of vegetable oil from SBE.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"
Molecular signature and colony morphology affect in vitro pluripotency of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells,"Setthawong P., Phakdeedindan P., Techakumphu M., Tharasanit T.",2021-08-01,"Animals, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, Cell Proliferation, Cellular Reprogramming, Gene Expression Regulation, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, Sus scrofa, cell reprogramming, fibroblast, induced pluripotent stem cells, morphology, porcine","Overall efficiency of cell reprogramming for porcine fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is currently poor, and few cell lines have been established. This study examined gene expression during early phase of cellular reprogramming in the relationship to the iPSC colony morphology and in vitro pluripotent characteristics. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Two different colony morphologies referred to either compact (n = 10) or loose (n = 10) colonies were further examined for proliferative activity, gene expression and in vitro pluripotency. A total of 1,697 iPSC-like colonies (2.34%) were observed after gene transduction. The compact colonies contained with tightly packed cells with a distinct-clear border between the colony and feeder cells, while loose colonies demonstrated irregular colony boundary. For quantitative expression of genes responsible for early phase cell reprogramming, the Dppa2 and EpCAM were significantly upregulated while NR0B1 was downregulated in compact colonies compared with loose phenotype (p <.05). Higher proportion of compact iPSC phenotype (5 of 10, 50%) could be maintained in undifferentiated state for more than 50 passages compared unfavourably with loose morphology (3 of 10, 30%). All iPS cell lines obtained from these two types of colony morphologies expressed pluripotent genes and proteins (OCT4, NANOG and E-cadherin). In addition, they could aggregate and form three-dimensional structure of embryoid bodies. However, only compact iPSC colonies differentiated into three germ layers. Molecular signature of early phase of cell reprogramming coupled with primary colony morphology reflected the in vitro pluripotency of porcine iPSCs. These findings can be simply applied for pre-screening selection of the porcine iPSC cell line.","cell and developmental biology; cell growth and division; cell growth; stem cells, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"
"Effects of air pollution, land-use type, and maternal mental health on child development in the first two years of life in the Greater Taipei area","Zou M.-L., Jiang C.-B., Chen Y.-H., Wu C.-D., Candice Lung S.-C., Chien L.-C., Kallawicha K., Yang Y.-T., Lo Y.-C., Chao H.J.",2021-06-01,"Air Pollutants, Air Pollution, Child, Child Development, Cohort Studies, Environmental Exposure, Female, Humans, Infant, Maternal Health, Mental Health, Nitrogen Dioxide, Particulate Matter, Pregnancy, Air pollutants, Fine motor, Gross motor, Language, Social adaptation behaviors","Introduction: Few studies have investigated the associations of child development with air pollution, land-use type, and maternal mental health simultaneously. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of exposure to air pollutants during several critical periods of life, with adjustment for land-use type and maternal mental status, on child development at 6, 12, and 24 months of age in the Greater Taipei area. Methods: Participants were selected from an ongoing Taiwanese birth cohort study. We analyzed the data of the participants who had been recruited from January 2011 to April 2014. Self-administered standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on sociodemographic factors, infant development and health, maternal mental status, etc. Air pollution levels in pre- and postnatal periods were estimated using a spatial interpolation technique (ordinary kriging) at children's residential addresses. Land-use types around participants' homes were evaluated using buffer analysis. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the relationships between child development delay and environmental factors. Results: In total, 228, 361, and 441 families completed child development forms at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, respectively. Our results indicated that prenatal exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm and O3 and postnatal exposure to NO2 were negatively associated with child development. Traffic-related land-use types, gas stations, and power generation areas around participants’ homes were also adversely correlated with child development. Moreover, poor maternal mental health was associated with child development delay. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure and postnatal exposure to air pollution were associated with development delay in children under 2 years of age, specifically those under 1 year of age, even after adjustment for land-use type and maternal mental status. Living environment is critical for the development of children under 2 years of age.","biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

In this review, we will explore several aspects and controversies of liver transplantation in patients with non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy including risks of cancer recurrence after liver transplantation and the ethical dilemma of the selection of liver transplantation candidates with non-hepatic malignancy. Methods: We performed a search in several online databases and reviewed published articles and ongoing clinical trials in the topics of transplantation and pre-existing malignancies. Results and Discussion: Liver transplantation can be safely performed in selected patients with pre-existing extrahepatic malignancies with low recurrence rate if they have an expected 5-year survival rate of at least 50%. The cancer-free period before transplantation depends on the type, stage, and location of cancer. A shorter or no wait-time may be considered in an early stage cancer or carcinoma in situ. The urgency and benefits of liver transplantation should also be taken into consideration when determining a reasonable wait-time. This is particularly important in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who cannot afford to wait a few years before they can undergo liver transplantation.",medical,Transplantation

However, oral administration of cordycepin has limited practical use due to its poor bioavailability in the intestine. Herein, we developed and demonstrated a hybrid nanocarrier system in the form of biloniosome-core/chitosan-shell hybrid nanocarriers (HNCs) in order to improve the bio-characteristics of cordycepin. In this study, HNCs were prepared by using a solvent (ethanol) injection method involving cordycepin as the biloniosome core and mucoadhesive chitosan biopolymer as a coating shell. Our results showed that the cordycepin-loaded HNCs were positively charged with enhanced mucoadhesive characteristics and highly stable in gastric fluid. The increased permeability of cordycepin-loaded HNCs compared with standard cordycepin was confirmed by in vitro intestinal permeation study across the human intestinal barrier. In addition, we demonstrated that the cordycepin-loaded HNCs are able to release their components in an active form resulting in enhanced anti-cancer activity in two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures as well as in three-dimensional (3D) multi-cellular spheroids of colon cancer cells. Further, quantitative real time PCR analysis of apoptotic gene expression revealed that cordycepin HNCs can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by negatively regulating the expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL). I Overall our results showed that the hybrid nanocarrier systems represent a promising strategy for improving the bio-characteristics of cordycepin which can be considered as a potential anti-cancer agent for colorectal cancer chemotherapy.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Herbal teas are well‐known to contain an abundance of polyphenol antioxidants and other ingredients, thereby implicating protection and treatment against various ailments, and maintaining overall health in humans, although their mechanisms of action have not yet been fully identified. Autophagy is a conserved mechanism present in organisms that maintains basal cellular homeostasis and is essential in mediating the pathogenesis of several dis-eases, including cancer, type II diabetes, obesity, and Alzheimer’s disease. The increasing prevalence of these diseases, which could be attributed to the imbalance in the level of autophagy, presents a considerable challenge in the healthcare industry. Natural medicine stands as an effective, safe, and economical alternative in balancing autophagy and maintaining homeostasis. Tea is a part of the diet for many people, and it could mediate autophagy as well. Here, we aim to provide an updated overview of popular herbal teas’ health‐promoting and disease healing properties and in-depth information on their relation to autophagy and its related signaling molecules.

In the current study, the effect of substrate temperature on binder-free undoped CuO and Cr-doped CuO (~4.5 at. %) thin-film electrodes prepared by radio frequency sputtering technique is reported for supercapacitor applications. X-ray diffraction studies revealed the formation of undoped CuO and Cr-doped CuO films with monoclinic structure, while field emission scanning electron microscopy showed a significant change in the shape and size of the grains as a function of the substrate temperature. X-ray mapping indicated a uniform distribution of the elements present in these films. Substitution of Cr of ~4.5 at. % has not altered the primary monoclinic structure of CuO, but the doped CuO thin-film electrodes showed an improved conductivity. The electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the thin-film electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in 1 M KOH. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the thin-film electrode of Cr-doped CuO electrode developed at the substrate temperature of 573 K exhibited the highest areal capacitance of 209 mF cm−2 at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1, which is five times higher than that of the pure CuO (38 mF cm−2) thin-film. Furthermore, the Cr-doped CuO thin-film electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability with the capacity retention of 88% for 3000 continuous CV cycles in 1 M KOH. These results suggested that the binder-free Cr-doped CuO film electrodes prepared at the substrate temperature of 573 K is an excellent candidate material for the supercapacitor applications.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The microenvironment surrounding mammary epithelium plays a critical role during the development and differentiation of the mammary gland, enabling the coordination of the complex multihormones and growth factor signaling processes. Progesterone/progesterone receptor paracrine signaling interactions in the microenvironment play vital roles in stem/progenitor cell function during normal breast development. In breast cancer, the female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, and growth factor signals are altered in the TME. Progesterone signaling modulates not only breast tumors but also the breast TME, leading to the activation of a series of cross-communications that are implicated in the genesis of breast cancers. This chapter reviews the evidence that progesterone and PR signaling modulates not only breast epitheliums but also the breast TME. Furthermore, crosstalk between estrogen and progesterone signaling affecting different cell types within the TME is discussed. A better understanding of how PR and progesterone affect the TME of breast cancer may lead to novel drugs or a therapeutic approach for the treatment of breast cancer shortly.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Methods: Dentists who treat children from 32 countries and all WHO regions were selected from a web-based survey of 1580 international dentists. Dentists were asked if their pediatric patients with current or future oral health concerns fit into the 4D of the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) construct. Proportions of all pediatric patients’ oral health problems and prevention needs were computed. Findings: Data from 101 dentists treating children only and 523 dentists treating children and adults were included. For 90% of pediatric patients, their current oral health problems fit well in the four OHRQoL dimensions. For 91% of oral health problems they intended to prevent in the future were related to these dimensions as well. Both numbers increased to at least 96% when experts analyzed dentists´ explanations of why some oral health problems would not fit these four categories. Conclusions: The study revealed the four fundamental components of dental patients, i.e., the four OHRQoL dimensions (Oral Function, Orofacial Pain, Orofacial Appearance, and Psychosocial Impact) are also applicable for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have current or future oral health concerns, and should be considered when measuring OHRQoL in the pediatric dental patient population.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Cell sizes are shrinking with every upcoming communication generation, which makes base station placement planning even more complex and cumbersome. In order tomake the next-generation cost-effective, it is important to design a network in such a way that it utilizes the minimum number of base stations while ensuring seamless coverage and quality of service. This paper aims at the development of a new simulation-based optimization approach using a hybrid metaheuristic and metamodel applied in a novel mathematical formulation of the multi-transmitter placement planning (MTPP) problem. We first develop a new mathematical programming model for MTPP that is flexible to design the locations for any number of transmitters. To solve this constrained optimization problem, we propose a hybrid approach using the radial basis function (RBF) metamodel to assist the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) by mitigating the associated computational burden of the optimization procedure.We evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm by simulating the MTPP model with two, three, four and five transmitters and estimating the Pareto front for optimal locations of transmitters. The quantitative results show that almost maximum signal coverage can be obtained with four transmitters; thus, it is not a wise idea to use higher number of transmitters in the model. Furthermore, the limitations and future works are discussed.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, Mathematics, engineering, computer science","Biomaterials, Modeling and Simulation, Mechanics of Materials, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The 3d-TM atoms are firmly trapped inside g-C3N4 which prevents the metal clustering and shows high thermodynamic stability. The dimetal-dioxygen adsorption configuration of the O2/TM2@g-C3N4 promotes electron transfer from catalyst to the adsorbed O2, which improves their catalytic performances over the O2/TM@g-C3N4. We observed the two different electron transfer mechanisms for O2 activation on TMn@g-C3N4, in which the double-metal acts as an electron donor while the single-metal acts as the bridge for electron transfer from the substrate to the adsorbed O2. Remarkably, the catalytic performance of the TMn@g-C3N4 for O2 dissociation has a strong correlation with the three factors, (i) the charge gained on adsorbed O2, (ii) the O2 adsorption energy, and (iii) the O-O distance. The Fe2@g-C3N4 as a low-cost and non-precious metal catalyst shows the best catalytic performance with the lowest activation energy barrier of 0.26 eV for O2 activation, and therefore, is predicted as a potential catalyst for O2 consuming reactions. Our finding provides useful information for further design and development of high efficient few-atom catalysts based 2D-carbon materials.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

NOM has a heterogeneous structure and can be divided into 6 fractions based on polarity and charges: hydrophobic acid (HPOA), hydrophobic base (HPOB), hydrophobic neutral (HPON), hydrophilic acid (HPIA), hydrophilic base (HPIB), and hydrophilic neutral (HPIN). The objective of this study was to evaluate the interactions between NOM fractions and NZVI using two approaches: 1) the interaction between NOM fraction isolates and NZVI and 2) bulk NOM fractionation before and after reaction with NZVI. Two sources of NOM—groundwater (GWNOM), Khon Kaen, Thailand and Suwannee River NOM (SRNOM), USA—were examined. The isolated NOM had more interactions with NZVI at pH 5 compared to pH 7 and 9 for both GWNOM and SRNOM. HPOA of GWNOM had the highest adsorption capacity (qe) of 6.95 mg/g (pH 5), and that was also the case for HPIA of SRNOM (18.66 mg/g, pH 5). HPIN of both GWNOM and SRNOM yielded the lowest qe among the six fractions. The adsorption capacities of NOM fractions were well correlated with specific ultraviolet absorbance. Fluorescence excitation–emission spectra revealed that protein-like components preferentially reacted with NZVI. The results of bulk NOM fractionation after reacting with NZVI indicated that NOM not only adsorbed on NZVI but also reacted with NZVI and transformed to become more hydrophilic and neutral. This study's findings suggest that different NOM fractions had varying interactions with NZVI. The acid fractions tended to interact more than the other fractions. This work provides a deeper understanding of the reactivity between NOM and NZVI.","genergyal, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The study used DPPH and ABTS assay to evaluate the antioxidant properties of the hydrolysates obtained from bee pollen. All of the tested hydrolysates demonstrated antioxidant activity, while hydrolysate based on Alcalase® offered a high value for IC50 and was therefore chosen for further separation into five sub-fractions via ultrafiltration. The greatest antioxidant activity was presented by the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction, which achieved an IC50 value of 0.39 ± 0.01 µg/mL in the DPPH assay and 1.52 ± 0.01 µg/mL for ABTS. Purification of the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction was completed using RP-HPLC, whereupon the three fractions from the original six which had the highest antioxidant activity underwent further examination through ESI-Q-TOF–MS/MS.

Selection of the surgical approach is an important key for success. In this study, the authors present an anatomical classification for PBLs that has been used by our group for over the past 26 years. The objective of this study is to investigate the benefits and applicability of this classification. Methods: Between 1994 and 2019, 117 patients treated for PBLs were retrospectively reviewed. Using the V3 and arcuate eminence as reference points, the petrous bone is segmented into 3 parts: petrous apex, rhomboid, and posterior. The pathological diagnoses, selection of the operative approach, and the extent of resection (EOR) were analyzed and correlated using this classification. Results: This series included 22 facial nerve schwannomas (18.8%), 22 cholesterol granulomas (18.8%), 39 chordomas/chondrosarcomas (33.3%), 6 trigeminal schwannomas (5.1%), 13 epidermoids/dermoids (11.1%), and 15 other pathologies (12.8%). PBLs were most often involved with the petrous apex and rhomboid areas (46.2%). The extradural subtemporal approach (ESTA) was most frequently used (57.3%). Gross total resection was achieved in 58.4%. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 92 patients (78.6%). Our results demonstrated a correlation between this classification with each type of pathology (p <.001), selection of surgical approaches (p < 0.001), and EOR (p = 0.008). Chordoma/chondrosarcoma, redo operations, and lesions located medially were less likely to have total resection. Temporary complications occurred in 8 cases (6.8%), persistent morbidity in 5 cases (4.3%), and mortality in 1 case. Conclusion: In this study, we proposed a simple classification of PBLs. Using landmarks on the superior petrosal surface, the petrous bone is divided into 3 parts, apex, rhomboid, and posterior. Our results demonstrated that chordoma/chondrosarcoma, redo operations, and lesions involving the tip of the petrous apex or far medial locations were more difficult to achieve total resection. This classification could help surgeons understand surgical anatomy framework, predict possible structures at risk, and select the most appropriate approach for each patient.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

This fault developed following a change from E-W to ENE-WSW extension during the Oligocene-earliest Miocene, to NNW-SSE transtension. The ABCFZ is interpreted to have formed subsequent to an extensional detachment translating the upper crust, including the extensional rift basins, to the west, leaving the ABCFZ to be developed on thinned, lower plate, lower continental crust. The ABCFZ was active during the Early and early Middle Miocene. A very extensive belt of ENE-WSW R′ shears up to 60 km wide, hundreds of kilometres in length (NNE-SSW direction), with faults spaced about every kilometer bounds both sides of the ABCFZ. R-shears occur more infrequently and predominantly occur close to the ABCFZ. The distinctive and unusual structural style of regionally dominant R′ shears is interpreted to be a result of NNW-SSE extension related to the northwards movement of the Indian Plate relative to SE Asia. The ABCFZ displays large-scale uplift (~100 km wavelength) on its eastern margin. If the uplift occurred at a restraining bend, then the nearest one requires at least 50 km of dextral displacement. Canyons mapped traversing this high provided pathways for gravity driven sediments to enter the deepwater area. The ABCFZ and the Sagaing Fault to the north are both associated with large basins whose depocentres lie parallel to the fault trace. They represent a different type of strike-slip basin from classic pull-apart basins, and are more laterally extensive than typical pull-apart basins. The East Andaman Basin margin shows regional variations in crustal thickness which have N–S trending contours related to Oligocene-age extension. The ABCFZ follows the location and trend of the necking zone within continental crust, suggesting this was a mechanically favourable location for development of the fault. The ABCFZ illustrates a type of strike-slip deformation and sedimentation pattern that can be expected on other hyper extended continental margins that have evolved from extension to highly oblique transtension.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences","Oceanography, Geophysics, Geology, Economic Geology, Stratigraphy"

The participants who agreed the concept-sharing approach was useful had signiﬁcantly higher ﬁnal assessment (P= 0.014) and end-of-course formative assessment scores (P= 0.001). The ﬁndings indicate that after experiencing this new teaching approach, medical students appreciate its utility and that students who engage with this approach are more likely to perform well in assessments. In summary, the concept-sharing approach is a simple teaching strategy which was favored by students and may promote academic performance.",biochemistryistry,Physiology

Several studies show that the naturally occurring antioxidant Lutein (Lut) can protect RPE cells from oxidative stress. However, the poor solubility and low oral bioavailability limit the potential of Lut as a therapeutic agent. In this study, lutein diglutaric acid (Lut-DG), a prodrug of Lut, was synthesized and its ability to protect human ARPE-19 cells from oxidative stress was tested compared to Lut. Both Lut and Lut-DG significantly decreased H2 O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protected RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced death. Moreover, the immunoblotting analysis indicated that both drugs exerted their protective effects by modulating phosphorylated MAPKs (p38, ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK) and downstream molecules Bax, Bcl-2 and Cytochrome c. In addition, the enzymatic antioxidants glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) and non-enzymatic antioxidant glutathione (GSH) were enhanced in cells treated with Lut and Lut-DG. In all cases, Lut-DG was more effective than its parent drug against oxidative stress-induced damage to RPE cells. These findings highlight Lut-DG as a more potent compound than Lut with the protective effects against oxidative stress in RPE cells through the modulation of key MAPKs, apoptotic and antioxidant molecular pathways.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Using organic biomass-based substrates has been shown to minimize environmental impacts due to the versatile production of high-value products under normal operating conditions that are practically achievable. However, the biohythane yield depends on different factors such as the biomass type, the organic loading rate, soluble metabolic products formed, the type of fermentation (single/dual stage) and the pretreatment strategy adopted for the biomass. Different pretreatment strategies based on physical, chemical and biological processes have been proposed in the literature. In this review, improvements in biohythane yield as a result of these pretreatment strategies, the need/effect of inoculum enrichment, the effects of pH, temperature, trace element addition and organic loading rate has been reviewed. Finally, the major developments of improving biohythane yield due to the addition of co-substrates and the current trends are discussed.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, the anionic–cationic surfactant mixtures are also prone to form other unique phases such as precipitates, gels, and coacervates in place of middle-phase microemulsions. Research summarized in this article demonstrates that asymmetric anionic–cationic surfactant mixtures have been shown to promote middle-phase microemulsions instead of these other phases, albeit with a slight decrease in synergism when using these asymmetric mixtures. The use of anionic–cationic surfactant mixtures also is shown to enhance or decrease surfactant adsorption depending on anionic–cationic surfactant ratios. Middle-phase microemulsion formation is demonstrated using anionic-rich or cationic-rich alcohol-free microemulsions by anionic–cationic ratio scans while also reducing or eliminating electrolyte requirement. Solubilization and adsolubilization are shown to increase for mixed anionic–cationic surfactant systems, especially for hydrophobic solutes. Thus, by exploiting these synergisms while avoiding phase separation, properly designed anionic–cationic surfactant mixtures can be advantageous for a wide range of applications.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Molecular characterization, ge nome analysis, and optimization were investigated to improve GABA production of a selected strain of lactic acid bacteria. Eleven isolates from plant materials were screened for GABA productivity and were identified based on phenotypic and geno typic characteristics. The most potent strain was chosen for genome analysis and GABA production optimization using the response surface methodol ogy (RSM). Each of the two strains was closely re lated to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Weissella cibaria, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides while each strain was similar to Lactobacillus pentosus, Enterococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. They produced GABA ranging from 0.036 ± 0.000 to 17.315 ± 0.171 g/L at72 h-cultivation. Among them, the most potent strain, SL9-6, showed the highest GABA production (17.315 g/L) when cultivated with 10% (v/v) inoculum for 48 h. The draft genome sequence of strain SL9-6 exhibited 96.90% average nucleotide identity value and 74.50% digital DNA-DNA hybridization to Lactobacillus brevis NCTC 13768T. This strain contained a glutamate decarboxylase gene system (gadA, gadB, and gadC). Optimal culture conditions were determined as 40.00 g/L glucose, 49.90 g/L monosodium glutamate, pH 5.94, and 31.10°C by RSM, giving maximum GABA production of 32.48 g/L. Results from RSM also indicated that monosodium glutamate concentration, pH, and temperature were significant variables.

These changes might have direct influences on the mangrove root sphere, which plays an important role in carbon dynamics and supports mangrove growth. We aimed to elucidate how the soil properties including salinity and nutrient budget affect the mangrove roots in the wet and dry seasons across the mangrove zonation (Avicennia, Rhizophora, and Xylocarpus zones). This area is in a secondary forest at the Trat River estuary, eastern Thailand. Root mass was observed at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths across all zones and the living roots were separated into diameter classes. The soil water salinity was measured at a 10 cm depth. We analyzed the nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon contents in the roots and soil. Spatiotemporal changes occurred due to the vegetation zonation and the variations in salinity and the content of soil available phosphorus that caused different root sphere conditions along the distance from the river. The highest root biomass was found in the riverward Avicennia zone, which was 4.8 times higher than that of the inland Xylocarpus zone in the wet season. The root necromass distribution along the zonation showed an opposite trend to that of biomass. Among seasons, the root size-class proportion differed, with high fine roots observed during the wet season. We confirmed that the root sphere showed both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Mangrove roots, especially fine roots, interacted with changing salinity, inundation regime, and biological processes evoked by microtopographic gradients as a consequence of mangrove zonation and seasonal rainfall. Our findings indicate how the root sphere differed by specific vegetation structure in this mangrove forest. Therefore, these might provide an ecological perspective for the mangrove rehabilitation plans to facilitate below-ground carbon stock.","the atmosphere, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Forestry
"Mechanisms of arsenic contamination associated with hydrochemical characteristics in coastal alluvial aquifers using multivariate statistical technique and hydrogeochemical modeling: a case study in Rayong province, eastern Thailand","Boonkaewwan S., Sonthiphand P., Chotpantarat S.",2021-01-01,"Arsenic, Environmental Monitoring, Groundwater, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Models, Theoretical, Multivariate Analysis, Thailand, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Wells, Arsenite, Coastal alluvial aquifer, Groundwater, Multivariate statistical techniques, PHREEQC, Thailand","Abstract: The rapid development of Rayong Province has resulted in increased demands on groundwater usage. This has potentially induced the release of contaminants such as arsenic (As), among others (i.e., NO3−, PO43−) from various land use types—especially in intensive agricultural areas and heavy industrial areas, including landfill sites. The objectives of this research are to investigate the As speciation and groundwater chemistry occurring due to different hydrogeological settings and the influence of human activities and to explain the mechanism of As release in the coastal alluvial aquifers in Rayong Province using multivariate statistical techniques and hydrogeochemical modeling (PHREEQC). Six major water facies, mainly consisting of Ca–Na–HCO3–Cl and Ca–Na–Cl, were included in the hydrochemical analysis. Arsenic levels were inversely correlated with NO3−, SO42−, DO, and ORP, confirming the reducing environment in the groundwater system. The results from the PHREEQC model show that most wells were strongly under-supersaturated with respect to arsenorite, scorodite, and arsenic pentoxide. Arsenic (As) is probably derived from the dissolution of Fe oxide and hydroxide (i.e., Fe(OH)3, goethite, maghemite, and magnetite). The multivariate statistical techniques revealed that the As species mainly consisted of As(III), governed by the reducing environment, while As(V) may be desorbed from Fe oxide and hydroxide as the pH increases. Anthropogenic inputs and intensive pumping may enhance the reducing environment, facilitating the release of As(III) into the groundwater. The knowledge gained from this study helps to better understand the mechanisms of As contamination in coastal groundwater aquifers, which is useful for groundwater management, including the optimum pumping rate and long-term monitoring of groundwater quality.

However, their poor proliferation ability, inability to adhere to surfaces without Matrigel coating and tendency to spontaneously differentiate in vitro hinder the application of hiPSCs in these fields. Here we study the ability to culture hiPSCs inside 200 ​nL droplets on the droplet microarray (DMA) platform. We demonstrate that (1) hiPSCs can attach to the Matrigel (MG)-free surface of DMA and show good viability after 24 h culture; (2) hiPSC do not spontaneously differentiate when cultured on the MG-free surface of DMAs; (3) culturing of hiPSCs in 200 ​nL as compared to 2 ​mL culture leads to higher expression of the Nanog pluripotency marker. Overall, the results demonstrate the possibility to culture undifferentiated hiPSCs in 200 ​nL droplets on DMA, thereby opening the possibility for high-throughput screenings of hiPSCs with various factors without compromising the results through the involvement of animal-derived materials, such as Matrigel.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

The GINA guideline does mention the use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids in the treatment of asthmatic exacerbation, it provides little practical guidance on the use of nebulized corticosteroid. Objective: To review and recommend the practical considerations in the use of nebulized corticosteroid in children with acute asthmatic exacerbation. Methods: This consensus was developed by a group of expert pediatricians in respiratory and allergy fields in Thailand. The recommendations were made based on a review of published studies and clinical opinions. The eligible studies were confined to those published in English, and randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving nebulized corticosteroids in asthmatic exacerbation in children aged between 1-18 years. Results: There were 13 randomized controlled-trial studies published from 1998 to 2017. Nine of the 13 studies compared nebulized with systemic corticosteroid conducted in moderate to severe exacerbation, while the remaining four compared nebulized corticosteroid with placebo conducted in mild to severe exacerbation. The admission rate was significantly lower in severe exacerbation (one study) and pooled four mild to severe exacerbation studies comparing with placebo (p 0.022). Other clinical parameters were significantly improved with nebulized corticosteroid such as clinical scores, systemic corticosteroid/bronchodilator use, or shorter ER stays. Only one study used fluticasone, while the other 12 studies conducted by budesonide (92.31%). Conclusion: Nebulized corticosteroid may offer an effective therapeutic option for the management of acute exacerbation of asthma in all severities.

Pharmacological studies indicated the involvement of KATP in pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy, but the alteration of pore-forming subunits, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, at membranes and subcellular fractions is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the distribution and levels of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in rat cardiomyocytes responding to chronic pressure overload. Male Wistar rats were separated into a sham-operated group (sham) and a pressure overload or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) group. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac structure and functions at the 4th month after operation. Ventricular cardiomyocytes in both groups were isolated and then subjected to extract protein into cytoplasm, organelle membrane, and plasma membrane fractions. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques were performed to detect and measure Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 protein levels. Echocardiographic parameters showed left ventricular hypertrophy with hypercontractility in TAC rats. The immunoblotting showed the presence of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 at plasma membranes and only Kir6.1 at organelle membranes. Significantly, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 levels were decreased in the plasma membrane fraction of the TAC group (n = 8 and 6 for Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, respectively), whereas Kir6.1 in the organelle membrane fraction tended to be higher in TAC but did not reach statistical significance (n = 7). These results seemed to relate to a left ventricular immunohistochemistry study, which showed the trend of decreased staining of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in pressure overload left ventricular tissue. In conclusion, both Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 plasma membrane subunits were decreased significantly in pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Physiology, Pharmacology"

Traditional enzymatic assays for the identification of 3CLPro inhibitors rely on peptide-based colorimetric or fluorogenic substrates. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has limit or delay access to these substrates, especially for researchers in developing countries attempting to screen natural product libraries. We explored the use of the fluorescent probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) as an alternative assay for inhibitor identification. Fluorescence enhancement upon binding of ANS to 3CLPro was observed, and this interaction was competitive with a peptide substrate. The utility of ANS-based competitive binding assay to identify 3CLPro inhibitors was demonstrated with the flavonoid natural products baicalein and rutin. The molecular nature of ANS and rutin interaction with 3CLPro was explored with molecular modeling.

On adjusted analysis, sidedness was not associated with rate of recurrence or overall survival; however, sidedness was associated with worse recurrence patterns and survival after recurrence. Background: Right-sided primary tumor location is associated with worse prognosis in metastatic colon cancer, but the effect of sidedness on recurrence and prognosis for non-metastatic disease is less understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sidedness, recurrence, and survival among patients with localized colon cancer. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of colon cancer (2006-2013) were identified from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Risk for recurrence, overall survival, and survival after recurrence (SAR) were compared between left- and right-sided tumors using the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: We evaluated 673 patients (347 right-sided). There was no difference in overall recurrence rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.55; P =.75) or overall survival (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75-1.97; P =.42) between right- and left-sided primary tumors. However, right-sided tumors were more likely to develop multi-focal and poor prognostic site recurrence (P =.04). Among the 71 patients who developed recurrence, those with right-sided tumors had significantly lower SAR (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.42-10.62; P =.008). Conclusions: Among patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection, tumor sidedness was not associated with recurrence risk. However, among patients who developed recurrence, right-sidedness was associated with unique recurrence patterns and inferior SAR. For patients presenting with localized disease, treatment stratification should not be based on tumor sidedness alone.",medical,"Oncology, Gastroenterology"

From 2013 to 2020, the total number of malaria cases have decreased, from 37,741 to 4474 (an 88.1% reduction). However, infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, a monkey malarial pathogen that can also infect humans, have been increasingly observed. This study focused on the molecular analysis of P. knowlesi parasites causing malaria in Thailand. Methods: Under Thailand’s integrated Drug Efficacy Surveillance (iDES), which includes drug-resistance monitoring as part of routine case-based surveillance and responses, specimens were collected from malaria patients (n = 966) between 2018 and 2020. Thirty-one mono P. knowlesi infections (3.1%), most of which were from eastern and southern Thailand, were observed and confirmed by nested PCR assay and DNA sequencing. To evaluate whether these pathogens were from different lineages, cluster analysis based on seven microsatellite genotyping markers and the merozoite surface protein 1 (pkmsp1) gene was carried out. The P. knowlesi pyrimethamine resistance gene dihydrofolate reductase (pkdhfr) was sequenced and homology modelling was constructed. Results: The results of analysing the seven microsatellite markers and pkmsp1 sequence demonstrated that P. knowlesi parasites from eastern Thailand were of the same lineage as those isolated in Cambodia, while the parasites causing malaria in southern Thailand were the same lineage as those isolated from Malaysia. The sequencing results for the pkdhfr genes indicated the presence of two mutations, Arg34Leu and a deletion at position 105. On analysis with homology modelling, the two mutations were not associated with anti-malarial drug resistance. Conclusions: This report compared the genetic populations of P. knowlesi parasites in Thailand from 2018 to 2020 and have shown similar lineages as those isolated in Cambodia and Malaysia of P. knowlesi infection in Thailand and demonstrated that the P. knowlesi parasites were of the same lineages as those isolated in Cambodia and Malaysia.

Herein, the investigations for disease pathogenesis were performed in the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model. The hiPSCs carrying a gain-of-function GP1BA p.M255V mutation which was described in platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) were generated using CRISPR/Cas9. The GP1BA-null hiPSCs were previously derived from a Bernard–Soulier syndrome (BSS) patient. After full megakaryocyte differentiation in culture, both hiPSC mutations showed large proplatelet tips under fluorescence microscopy and yielded fewer but larger platelets compared with those of wild-type cells. The Capillary Western analyses revealed the lower ERK1/2 activation and higher MLC2 (Myosin light chain 2) phosphorylation in megakaryocytes with mutated GPIb. Adding a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitor to wild-type hiPSCs recapitulated the phenotypes of GPIb mutations and increased MLC2 phosphorylation. Notably, a ROCK inhibitor which could inhibit MLC2 phosphorylation rescued the macrothrombocytopenia phenotypes of both GPIb alterations and wild-type hiPSCs with a MAPK inhibitor. In conclusion, the genetically modified hiPSCs can be used to model disorders of proplatelet formation. Both loss- and gain-of-function GPIb reduced MAPK/ERK activation but enhanced ROCK/MLC2 phosphorylation resulting in dysregulated platelet generation.",medical,Hematology

This study aims to perform a clinicopathologic analysis on the diagnosis of PLCs at a tertiary referral hospital in Thailand using traditional morphologic studies. Methods: A 5-year retrospective analysis of pathologically diagnosed PLCs was conducted. Pathological features and clinical characteristics of cHCC-CCA and other PLCs with the histopathologic resemblance to cHCC-CCA were studied. The pathological diagnosis was rendered based on histomorphological context rather than immunoreactivity. A literature review containing diagnostic pitfalls of cHCC-CCA was carried out. Results: PLCs from a total of 295 patients were retrieved, and cHCC-CCA accounted for 1.4% (n = 4) of the malignancies. Histomorphological evaluation is the most reliable diagnostic modality for cHCC-CCA. Extremely uncommon variants of iCCA (i.e., mucinous iCCA and adenosquamous iCCA) and iCCA arising with hepatocellular nodular lesions (i.e., iCCA with nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and iCCA in cirrhosis) could have a histomorphologic resemblance to that of cHCC-CCA. Conclusions: Although there has been an exceedingly high incidence of iCCA in Thailand, such a commonness is not valid for cHCC-CCA in our series. Rare forms of iCCA could have a morphologic resemblance to that of cHCC-CCA. Regardless of the differentiation and immunophenotype, iCCA without a distinct HCC component should never be diagnosed as cHCC-CCA.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

More than 400 million people worldwide are affected by this genetic condition. Testing for G6PD deficiency before drug administration is essential for patient safety. Rapidly ascertaining the G6PD status of a person is desirable for proper treatment. The device described in this study, the G6PD diaxBOX, was developed to quantify G6PD deficiency using paper-based analytical devices (PADs) and a colorimetric assay. The G6PD diaxBOX is a straightforward, affordable, portable, and instrument-free analytical system. The major components of the G6PD diaxBox are a banknote-checking UV fluorescent lamp and camera that are easy to access and analysis software. When NADPH is generated, it absorbs at UV 340 nm and emits colored light that is detected with the camera. The determined Pearson's coefficient shows that the color intensity measured from the G6PD diaxBOX correlated with G6PD activity level. Also, a Bland-Altman analysis indicated that more than 95% of the measurement error was in the upper and lower boundaries (±2 SD) and the error from the severe and moderate deficiency group was less than ± 1 SD. Therefore, the error from G6PD diaxBOX was within the limit boundary and the overall accuracy was more than 80%. The G6PD diaxBOX facilitates the effective and efficient quantification of G6PD deficiency and as such represents a clinically well-suited, rapid point-of-care test.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Reaction mechanisms of nitrosamine conformer conversion to N2 and H2O on the CSL, BNSL, BeOSL, and AlPSL cages, and their energetic profiles were obtained. The nitrosamine conversion to N2 and H2O on the CSL cage, one reaction path of three steps, was found. Reaction mechanisms of nitrosamine conversion to N2 and H2O on the BNSL, BeOSL, and AlPSL cages have two reaction steps: adsorption and conversion steps, respectively. All the nanocages, CSL, BNSL, BeOSL, and AlPSL, can be used as catalysts in the conversion reaction of nitrosamine (toxic gas) to N2 and H2O (non‒toxic gases).","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics"
Interaction Between Dendritic Cells and Candida krusei β-Glucan Partially Depends on Dectin-1 and It Promotes High IL-10 Production by T Cells,"Dinh T.T.H., Tummamunkong P., Padungros P., Ponpakdee P., Boonprakong L., Saisorn W., Leelahavanichkul A., Kueanjinda P., Ritprajak P.",2021-01-22,"beta-Glucans, Candida albicans, Dendritic Cells, Humans, Interleukin-10, Lectins, C-Type, Pichia, T-Lymphocytes, Candida krusei, dectin-1, dendritic cells, immune modulation, T cells, β-glucan","Host-Candida interaction has been broadly studied during Candida albicans infection, with a progressive shift in focus toward non-albicans Candida species. C. krusei is an emerging multidrug resistant pathogen causing rising morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, understanding the interplay between the host immune system and C. krusei is critically important. Candia cell wall β-glucans play significant roles in the induction of host protective immune responses. However, it remains unclear how C. krusei β-glucan impacts dendritic cell (DC) responses. In this study, we investigated DC maturation and function in response to β-glucans isolated from the cell walls of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei. These three distinct Candida β-glucans had differential effects on expression of the DC marker, CD11c, and on DC maturation. Furthermore, bone-marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) showed enhanced cytokine responses characterized by substantial interleukin (IL)-10 production following C. krusei β-glucan stimulation. BMDCs stimulated with C. krusei β-glucan augmented IL-10 production by T cells in tandem with increased IL-10 production by BMDCs. Inhibition of dectin-1 ligation demonstrated that the interactions between dectin-1 on DCs and cell wall β-glucans varied depending on the Candida species. The effects of C. krusei β-glucan were partially dependent on dectin-1, and this dependence, in part, led to distinct DC responses. Our study provides new insights into immune regulation by C. krusei cell wall components. These data may be of use in the development of new clinical approaches for treatment of patients with C. krusei infection.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

To control the size regularity of PANI, a micelle-based method using ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) as a reducing agent was employed in the polymerization process. The Anti-AMH antibodies were readily immobilized onto PANI via peptide bond to enhance the sensor specificity and sensitivity. This sensor was applied for the detection of AMH, an ovarian response indicator in female related to residual eggs during a woman's monthly cycle. The sensor performances were systematically investigated by differential pulse voltammetry. The anodic peak current decreases with the increase of AMH concentration owing to blocking of electron transfer by AMH. Under the optimal conditions, this sensor offers high sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.1 ng mL−1 and a wide linear range of 0.1–4 ng mL−1, which is sensitive enough to indicate the ability to produce eggs during a woman's monthly cycle. Furthermore, this system requires lower sample volume (5 μL), while offers the simple fabrication with low cost and no synthetic challenge and faster analysis compared with a standard ELISA. Ultimately, this sensor was successfully applied for the detection of AMH in human serum with satisfactory results. Thus, it might be an alternative tool for AMH screening in clinical setting.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Yet, looking for optimization methods with the less-computational cost is an open issue in engineering control systems. This paper aims to propose an effective adaptive optimization approach by integrating Kriging surrogate and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this method, a novel iterative adaptive approach is utilized using two sets of training samples including initial training and adaptive sample points. The initial training points are designed by space-filling design, while the adaptive points are generated using a new jackknife resampling approach. The proposed approach can effectively convergence towards the global optimal point using a small number of function evaluations. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using the optimal design of the fractional-order PID (FOPID) controller for some benchmark transfer functions. Then, the introduced approach is applied for tuning the parameters and the sensitivity analysis of the FOPID controller for a dynamic production-inventory control system. The results are in good agreement with the results reported in the literature, while the proposed approach is executed with a lower computational burden.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Feasibility and effectiveness studies with oral vaccination of free-roaming dogs against rabies in Thailand,"Chanachai K., Wongphruksasoong V., Vos A., Leelahapongsathon K., Tangwangvivat R., Sagarasaeranee O., Lekcharoen P., Trinuson P., Kasemsuwan S.",2021-04-01,"Administration, Oral, Animals, Animals, Wild, Disease Eradication, Dogs, Female, Male, Rabies, Rabies Vaccines, Vaccination, Dog, Oral vaccination, Rabies, Thailand","(1) Background: Thailand has made significant progress in reducing the number of human and animal rabies cases. However, control and elimination of the last remaining pockets of dog-mediated rabies have shown to be burdensome, predominantly as a result of the large numbers of free-roaming dogs without an owner that cannot be restrained without special efforts and therefore remain unvaccinated. To reach these dogs, the feasibility, and benefits of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) as a complementary tool has been examined under field conditions. (2) Methods: ORV of dogs was tested in five study areas of four provinces in Thailand. In these areas, sites with free-roaming dogs were identified with the support of local municipal workers and dog caretakers. ORV teams visited each of five study areas and distributed rabies vaccine (SPBN GASGAS) in three bait formats that were offered to the dogs using a hand-out and retrieval model. The three bait types tested included: egg-flavored baits, egg-flavored baits pasted with commercially available cat liquid snack, and boiled-intestine baits. A dog offered a vaccine bait was considered vaccinated when the discarded sachet was perforated or if a dog chewed vaccine bait at least 5 times before it swallowed the bait, including the sachet. (3) Results: A total of 2444 free-roaming dogs considered inaccessible for parenteral vaccination were identified at 338 sites. As not all dogs were approachable, 79.0% were offered a bait; of these dogs, 91.6% accepted the bait and subsequently 83.0% were considered successfully vaccinated. (4) Conclusion: Overall, 65.6% of the free-roaming dogs at these sites were successfully vaccinated by the oral route. Such a significant increase of the vaccination coverage of the free-roaming dog population could interrupt the rabies transmission cycle and offers a unique opportunity to reach the goal to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies in Thailand by 2030.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Inspired by the traditional electrodeposition technology, we report a fast self-etching electrodeposition method to construct copper-incorporated three-dimensional Ni-Cu coated on copper sheets as a superior bifunctional catalyst. During the electrodeposition process, the copper substrate was corroded to form ammonium copper ions by ingenious design of the concentration of electrolyte, including ammonium chloride and sodium chloride. Meanwhile, we observe that the ratio of Ni to Cu could be changed via varying the current density. The optimized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials are 76 mV and 290 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively, which outperform the most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts until now. The calculation further demonstrates that the theoretical hydrogen desorption energy and OER overpotential of Ni-Cu are better than those of pure Ni and Cu. The prepared Ni-Cu electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable stability, especially in the HER reaction process stability test up to 50 h. The successful preparation of Ni-Cu electrocatalyst provides more possibility in the traditional electrodeposition synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

This release contains measurements for 3669 unique galaxies, combining 2108 Green Bank Telescope observations with an updated crossmatch of the MaNGA sample with the ALFALFA survey. We combine these data with MaNGA spectroscopic measurements to examine relationships between H i-to-stellar mass ratio (MHI/M∗) and average ISM/star formation properties probed by optical emission lines. MH, IM ∗ is very weakly correlated with the equivalent width of H α, implying a loose connection between the instantaneous star formation rate and the H i reservoir, although the link between MHI M∗ and star formation strengthens when averaged even over only moderate time-scales (∼30 Myr). Galaxies with elevated H i depletion times have enhanced [O i]/H α and depressed H α surface brightness, consistent with more H i residing in a diffuse and/or shock-heated phase that is less capable of condensing into molecular clouds. Of all optical lines, MHI M∗ correlates most strongly with oxygen equivalent width, EW(O), which is likely a result of the existing correlation between MHI/M∗ and gas-phase metallicity. Residuals in the MHI M∗-EW(O) relation are again correlated with [O i]/H α and H α surface brightness, suggesting they are also driven by variations in the fraction of diffuse and/or shock-heated gas. We recover the strong anticorrelation between MHI/M∗ and gas-phase metallicity seen in previous studies. We also find a relationship between MHI M∗ and [O i]6302/H α, suggesting that higher fractions of diffuse and/or shock-heated gas are more prevalent in gas-rich galaxies.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

We evaluated the performance of AEHI diagnostic criteria from a prospective study of early ART initiation. Methods: AIDS Clinical Trials Group A 5354 enrolled adults at 30 sites in the Americas, Africa, and Asia who met any 1 of 6 criteria based on combinations of results of HIV RNA, HIV antibody, Western blot or Geenius assay, and/or the signal-To-cutoff (S/CO) ratio of the ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo or GS HIV Combo Ag/Ab EIA. HIV status and Fiebig stage were confirmed by centralized testing. Results: From 2017 through 2019, 195 participants were enrolled with median age of 27 years (interquartile range, 23-39). Thirty (15.4%) were female. ART was started by 171 (87.7%) on the day of enrollment and 24 (12.3%) the next day. AEHI was confirmed in 188 (96.4%) participants after centralized testing, 4 (2.0%) participants were found to have chronic infection, and 3 (1.5%) found not to have HIV discontinued ART and were withdrawn. Retrospectively, a nonreactive or indeterminate HIV antibody on the Geenius assay combined with ARCHITECT S/CO ≥10 correctly identified 99 of 122 (81.2%) Fiebig II-IV AEHI cases with no false-positive results. Conclusions: Novel AEHI criteria that incorporate ARCHITECT S/CO facilitated rapid and efficient ART initiation without waiting for an HIV RNA result. These criteria may facilitate AEHI diagnosis, staging, and immediate ART initiation in future research studies and clinical practice.

The PS-MPTMS-nTiO2 was synthesised via in situ differential microemulsion polymerization. The PS-MPTMS-nTiO2 exhibited a core–shell morphology with diameter of 45.3 nm. The addition of unmodified nTiO2 to the HIPS caused a reduction in the impact strength, tensile strength, and elongation at break, but an increase in the Young’s modulus. Meanwhile, the inclusion of the PS-MPTMS-nTiO2 was found to enhance the impact and tensile strength, Young’s modulus and thermal stability of the nanocomposites, while the elongation at break was deteriorated compared to that of the pure HIPS. This was due to the PS shell that hindered the agglomeration of the nTiO2 particles, leading to a better dispersion of the PS-MPTMS-nTiO2 particles in the HIPS matrix. Moreover, the Tg of HIPS in all nanocomposites was slightly affected by the nanoparticles.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Since bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known endocrine disruptor, can cross through the placenta from mother to fetus and bind with estrogen receptors, cell popula-tions in the neonatal anterior pituitary gland could be the target cells affected by this chemical. The present study treated maternal rats with 5000 µg/kg body weight of BPA daily throughout the preg-nancy period and then investigated the changes in ECM-producing cells, i.e., pericytes and follicu-lostellate (FS) cells, including their ECM production in the neonatal anterior pituitary at Day 1. We found that pericytes and their collagen synthesis reduced, consistent with the increase in the number of FS cells that expressed several ECM regulators—matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family. The relative MMP9/TIMP1 ratio was extremely high, indicating that the control of ECM homeostasis was unbalanced. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy showed the unorganized cell cluster in the BPA-treated group. This study revealed that although the mother received BPA at the “no observed adverse effect” level, alterations in ECM-producing cells as well as collagen and the related ECM balancing genes occurred in the neonatal anterior pituitary gland.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Herein, the suppressive effect of jorunnamycin A, a bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone isolated from Thai blue sponge Xestospongia sp., on cancer spheroid initiation and self-renewal in the CSCs of human lung cancer cells is revealed. The depletion of stemness transcription factors, including Nanog, Oct-4, and Sox2 in the lung CSC-enriched population treated with jorunnamycin A (0.5 µM), resulted from the activation of GSK-3β and the consequent downregulation of β-catenin. Interestingly, pretreatment with jorunnamycin A at 0.5 µM for 24 h considerably sensitized lung CSCs to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by upregulated p53 and decreased Bcl-2 in jorunnamycin A-pretreated CSC-enriched spheroids.

Here we review our recent findings indicating that the gold-standard methods to assess PMS, including ACOG, provide a high degree of false-negative findings. We propose a new case definition of the Menstrual Cycle-Associated Syndrome (MCAS), which is characterized by increased DRSP scores during the menstrual cycle and symptom that increases the week prior to the menses. The MCAS case definition was externally validated by diverse biomarkers including plasma levels of progesterone and estradiol, chemokines (e.g. CCL2, CCL5 and CCL11), epidermal growth factor, hydroperoxides, paraoxonase 1 activity and complement C4. These biomarkers as well as IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria are significantly associated with the DRSP and its subdomains including depression, anxiety, and physiosomatic symptoms(fatigue, pain). In conclusion, we propose, a) to use the MCAS diagnosis as an indicant of menstrual cycle-related symptoms; and b) to examine the associations of the time series in the DRSP and its subdomains and those in biomarkers including distributed lag models. Aberrations in the uterine-chemokine-brain-axis underpin the pathophysiology of MCAS whereby suboptimal pre-ovulatory follicular development coupled with a relative corpus luteum insufficiency may drive increased chemokine production, lowered antioxidant defenses, neuro-oxidative stress pathways, and increased bacterial translocation. As such, we have delineated new drug targets for the treatment of MCAS.

Results: Plasma glypican-3 levels were significantly lower in OA patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.03), whereas synovial fluid glypican-3 levels were remarkably greater than in paired plasma samples of OA patients (P < 0.001). Subsequent analysis demonstrated that plasma and synovial fluid glypican-3 levels were inversely associated with the radiographic severity of knee OA (r = −0.691, P < 0.001; r = −0.646, P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between plasma and synovial fluid glypican-3 levels in knee OA patients (r = 0.515, P < 0.001). Additionally, overexpression of glypican-3 mRNA was observed in inflamed synovium of OA patients (P = 0.021). Conclusions: The present study revealed that plasma and synovial glypican-3 levels were negatively associated with radiographic severity of knee OA. Glypican-3 could emerge as a potential biomarker for reflecting the severity of knee OA and might play a plausible role in the pathophysiology of degenerative joint disease.","medical, engineering, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Biomedical Engineering, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

The present work investigated the hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil catalyzed by unsupported nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) sulfide synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The effects of the operating parameters, such as the reaction time (0.5–3 h), temperature (280–320 °C), oil concentration (5–15%) on the n-alkane yield were evaluated. A longer reaction time and higher temperature promoted the reaction via decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. Under the appropriate condition (300 °C, 2 h, and initial H2 pressure of 30 bar), the yield of C14–18 alkanes was 75.3 wt%, while the selectivity of n-C15, n-C16, n-C17, and n-C18 alkanes was 21.8, 19.7, 29.6, and 28.1%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed n-alkenes, alcohols, and esters as byproducts. Characterization of catalyst revealed it had a sandwich structure consisting of weakly coupled layers, rim sites and Ni edges, which catalyzed the reaction efficiently. The catalyst could be reused for at least four cycles of palm oil hydrodeoxygenation with retention of a good performance with the decreased 17–25% alkane yield (2nd to 4th cycle with 50.8–57.3% n-C14–18 yield).","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Some phe-nanthrene compounds have antiplatelet aggregation activities via undefined pathways. This study aims to determine the inhibitory effects and potential mechanisms of lusianthridin on platelet ag-gregation. The results indicated that lusianthridin inhibited arachidonic acid, collagen, and adeno-sine diphosphate (ADP)‐stimulated platelet aggregation (IC50 of 0.02 ± 0.001 mM, 0.14 ± 0.018 mM, and 0.22 ± 0.046 mM, respectively). Lusianthridin also increased the delaying time of arachidonic acid‐stimulated and the lag time of collagen‐stimulated and showed a more selective effect on the secondary wave of ADP‐stimulated aggregations. Molecular docking studies revealed that lusian-thridin bound to the entrance site of the cyclooxygenase‐1 (COX‐1) enzyme and probably the active region of the cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) enzyme. In addition, lusianthridin showed inhibitory effects on both COX‐1 and COX‐2 enzymatic activities (IC50 value of 10.81 ± 1.12 μM and 0.17 ± 1.62 μM, respectively). Furthermore, lusianthridin significantly inhibited ADP‐induced suppression of cAMP formation in platelets at 0.4 mM concentration (p < 0.05). These findings suggested that possible mechanisms of lusianthridin on the antiplatelet effects might act via arachidonic acid‐throm-boxane and adenylate cyclase pathways.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In Asia, serological evidence indicated that CHIKV first emerged in 1954. From the 1950’s to 2005, sporadic CHIKV infections were attributed to the Asian genotype. However, the massive outbreak of CHIKV in India and the Southwest Indian Ocean Islands in 2005 has since raised chikungunya as a worldwide public health concern. The virus is spreading globally, but mostly in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. The emergence of the CHIKV East/Central/South African genotype-Indian Ocean lineage (ECSA-IOL) has caused large outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia affected more than a million people over a decade. Notably, the massive CHIKV outbreaks before 2016 and the more recent outbreak in Asia were driven by distinct ECSA lineages. The first significant CHIKV ECSA strains harbored the Aedes albopictus-adaptive mutation E1: A226V. More recently, another mass CHIKV ECSA outbreak in Asia started in India and spread beyond South and Southeast Asia to Kenya and Italy. This virus lacked the E1: A226V mutation but instead harbored two novel mutations (E1: K211E and E2: V264A) in an E1: 226A background, which enhanced its fitness in Aedes aegypti. The emergence of a novel ECSA strain may lead to a more widespread geographical distribution of CHIKV in the future. This review summarizes the current CHIKV situation in Asian countries and provides a general overview of the molecular virology, disease manifestation, diagnosis, prevalence, genotype distribution, evolutionary relationships, and epidemiology of CHIKV infection in Asian countries over the past 65 years. This knowledge is essential in guiding the epidemiological study, control, prevention of future CHIKV outbreaks, and the development of new vaccines and antivirals targeting CHIKV.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Molecular Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

With this methodology, reservoir pressure is obtained without requiring the well to be shut in; it is therefore superior to the static material balance method since there is no loss of production. However, the technique requires iterative calculations and numerical integration of gas pseudotime and is quite complex to implement in practice. A simpler and equally accurate methodology is proposed in this study. It requires only production and PVT data and also does not rely on a shut-in pressure survey. In addition, it requires neither iterative calculations nor numerical integration of gas pseudotime. The results of the analysis include gas initially-in-place and gas productivity index, and can easily be extended to production forecasting. Gas initially-in-place is evaluated with a high degree of reliability. The methodology is successfully tested with two simulated cases and one field case, giving high-accuracy results.","petroleum engineeringneering, earth sciences, energy","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Energy (all)"

Methods: The dose to a small water volume and the sensitive volume of the RPLGD and the IBA-CC01 were determined for 6-MV, 100-cm SAD, 10-cm depth using egs_chamber user-code. The RPLGD in perpendicular and parallel orientations to the beam axis were studied. The field output correction factors of each detector for 0.5 × 0.5 to 10 × 10 cm2 field sizes were determined. These field output correction factors were validated by comparing field output factors against data determined from IAEA-AAPM TRS-483 code of practice. Results: The field output correction factors of all detectors were within 5% for field sizes down to 0.8 × 0.8 cm2. For 0.5 × 0.5 cm2, the field output correction factors of CC01, RPLGD in perpendicular and parallel orientations differed from unity by 14%, 19%, and 5%, respectively. The percentage difference between field output factors determined using RPLGD and CC01 data, corrected using the field output correction factors determined in this work and measurements with CC01 data corrected using TRS-483, was less than 3% for all field sizes, except for the smallest field size of RPLGD in perpendicular orientation and the CC01. Conclusions: The field output correction factors of RPLGD and CC01 are reported. The validation proves that RPLGD in parallel orientation combined with the field output correction factors is the most suitable for determining the field output factors for the smallest field used in this study.","biochemistryistry, medical, physics","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Physics and Astronomy (all)"

The experimental parameters are the corrosion degree (0%, 12%, and 17%) and the steel fiber volume in the SFRC (1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%). The test results reveal that corrosion degree significantly affects the shear resistance of the beams. The shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 17% was higher than that of the uncorroded beam, whereas the shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 12% was lower than that of the uncorroded beam. The shear efficiency of damaged beams can be recovered by repairing them using SFRC that contains a reasonable amount of steel fibers. In addition, two methods to estimate the shear capacity of the repaired beams are developed using the modified truss analogy and strut-and-tie models. The estimated shear capacity of the beam using the modified truss analogy model agrees well with the experimental data.","corrosion, engineering",Computational Mechanics

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes using various irrigation indices such as: Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), Percentage Sodium (%Na), Magnesium Hazards (MH), Permeability Index (PI), Potential Salinity (PS), Residual Sodium Bicarbonate (RBSC), Kelly's Ratio (KR), Synthetic Harmful Coefficient (K), and Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP). A total of 30 samples were collected from the bore well of agricultural farmland and analysed for cations and anions. MH reveal that 53.33 % of samples exceed the permissible level. PS shows that 43.33 % of samples are marginally affected and 33.33 % of samples are unsuitable for use in irrigation. About 76 % of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation and the remainder require treatment before use. Automatic Linear Modelling (ALM) is used to predict the major influence parameter for MH and PS are RBSC, RSC and K value of groundwater. ALM shows that excess magnesium concentration and salinity are the primary factors that affect the suitability of groundwater for irrigation use. This integrated technique showed that water from approximately 25 % of the sample locations would require treatment before use. This study will improve the pattern of irrigation, identify sources of contamination and highlight the importance of organic fertilizers to develop and enhance the sustainable practices in the study region.","Agricultural and Biological Sciencesculture, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Zeolite rock, laterite rock, and pumice rock were modified by adding ferric chloride. Fenton-like reactions yielded more than 50 % of antibiotic removal at a neutral pH. The modified zeolite exhibited the highest antibiotic removal efficiency. The heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction could be indicated by the simultaneous detection of Fe(II) and Fe(III) on the surface of the modified zeolite. Leaching iron was also observed to reduce the antibiotics with homogeneous Fenton-like reaction. The co-existing organic matter expressed by the COD below 400 mg/L did not have a considerable adverse impact on antibiotic removal. An H2O2 concentration as low as 20 μM was sufficient to react with the modified zeolite and degraded more than 70 % of the antibiotics at a neutral pH. The modified zeolite could be reused at least three times, with a removal efficiency of at least 80 %. The antibiotic degradation efficiencies in real treated swine wastewater were above 75 %.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention had estimated that from 1 October 2018 to 4 May 2019, there have been about 40 million flu patients, in which about 50 thousand cases have died. Many subtypes of influenza have developed drug resistance due to high mutation rates. Neuraminidase (NA) is the glycoprotein on the virus particle surface. Its function is to cleave the glycosidic bond with the sialic acid, leading the new virus to be able to infect other uninfected cells. Therefore, it is a promising protein target for drug design and development. The E276D and R292K NA mutations in the H10N4 influenza virus have been reported to cause drug resistance. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations were applied to study the source of oseltamivir resistance in E276D, R292K, and E276D/R292K NA strains. The obtained results suggested that all studied mutants reduced the number of contact atoms, interaction energies, H-bonds, per-residue interaction energies, and total binding free energies towards the oseltamivir binding, resulting in a lower susceptibility. Only the interactions at residues 118, 119, and 371 were maintained in stabilizing the oseltamivir. The opening at 150- and 430-loops in E276D and double mutations caused the drug unbinding from the active site, increasing water accessibility into the binding pocket of NA enzyme.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Protection of electricity transmission infrastructure from sinkhole hazard based on electrical resistivity tomography,"Arjwech R., Ruansorn T., Schulmeister M., Everett M.E., Thitimakorn T., Pondthai P., Somchat K.",2021-11-01,"Agricultural activities, Cavity, Electrical resistivity tomography, Electricity transmission, Environmental problems, Power transmission tower, Sinkhole collapse, Sinkhole formation, Sinkhole hazard, Subsurface structures, Cavity, Electrical resistivity tomography, Power transmission towers, Sinkhole collapses","Sinkhole formation induced by limestone quarrying has the potential to cause severe environmental problems that impact agricultural activities and damage property. Moreover, sinkholes present a stability hazard to critical infrastructure such as power transmission towers. Field investigations in northeast Thailand found surface expressions of potentially dangerous sinkholes adjacent to a limestone quarry. 2D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles were deployed across previously mapped fractures that are located near power lines in order to detect the presence of subsurface structures and cavities in the carbonate bedrock. A 3D ERT survey was conducted near the base of power transmission tower T1 to precisely determine variations in subsurface material and structures. The ERT results were combined to delineate possibly hazardous cavities and continuous fractures. The surficial collapse features were generally observed to be in alignment with interpreted subsurface cavities and fractures. Water-table declines, quarry dewatering, and quarry blasting are possible triggers for the formation of the sinkholes. Additional sinkhole collapses could intensify along specific air-filled cavity zones in the near surface. Professional evaluations and regulatory action may be necessary to limit further quarry dewatering activities and prevent additional sinkhole collapses and further risk to the power infrastructure.","electricity, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"
EFFECT OF INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION TRAINING PROGRAM ON CHILD’S IMMUNIZATION AMONG MOTHERS LIVING IN KEBBI STATE OF NIGERIA,"Basheer S.A., Kumar R., Viwattanakulvanid P., Yaha M.B., Somrongthong R.",2021-01-01,"Child, Health Communication, Health Education, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Immunization Programs, Mothers, Nigeria, Vaccination, Effectiveness, Immunization, Interpersonal communication skills, Knowledge, training","Background: Sharing of information through health education training of mothers on child vaccination has proved an effective intervention for better outcome and increased immunization coverage. This study aimed to examine the effect of interpersonal communication (IPC) training program on mothers’ knowledge of child’s vaccination and routine childhood immunization uptake in local government areas (LGAs) of Kebbi State, Nigeria. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two local government areas in Kebbi State, from October 2016 to March 2017. Four hundred twenty mothers participated in the study and were allocated equally (210) in both intervention and control group (n=210) and data were collected on vaccination status of the children after intervention from children’s vaccination cards and mother’s verbal reports. Independent t test and Chi-square were used to test the effect of intervention on mother’s knowledge of child’s vaccination and routine childhood immunization uptake between intervention and control group. Study was ethically approved from the review board of Ministry of Health, Nigeria. Results: Mean knowledge scores has improved in the intervention group (M = 5.42, SD = 3.35) and control group (M=1.96, SD=2.37) after intervention with p<0.001. Routine childhood immunization uptake fully immunized (53.8% vs. 9.5%), partially immunized (16.6% vs. 32.8%) and un-immunized (29.5% vs. 57.6%) in both group after intervention with p<0.001. Approximately fifty-four percentages of children in the intervention group were fully immunized after intervention. However, there was minimal change of 2% has been observed in control group. Percentage of unimmunized children was high in both groups at pre-intervention (66%) but this decreased to 29.5% in the intervention group and 57.6% in the control group. Conclusion: This study concludes that, IPC skill is an effective intervention and a sustainable service for improving the knowledge and uptake of mother’s face-to-face education, social mobilization and reminder services about routine childhood immunization within entire population.",medical,Medicine (all)

Undrained stability of plane strain active trapdoors in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays,"Keawsawasvong S., Ukritchon B.",2021-01-01,"Anisotropic strength, Conic quadratic optimization, Direct simple shears, Finite element limit analysis, Non-linear regression analysis, Optimization problems, Plane strain condition, Second-order cone programming, Active failure, Anisotropy, Lower bound, Non-homogeneity, Trapdoor","Despite a large number of studies on the active failure of trapdoors conducted in the literature, there are very limited studies examining the combined influences of undrained strength anisotropy and non-homogeneity of clays on the problem. This paper presents the new lower bound solutions of the active failure of plane strain trapdoors in clays with linearly increasing anisotropic strengths. To achieve this purpose, the lower bound (LB) finite element limit analysis (FELA) of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming (SOCP) is developed to investigate the undrained stability of the problem under plane strain conditions. The anisotropic strengths of clays are modelled by employing an elliptical strength envelope requiring strengths in plane strain compression, extension and direct simple shear. The LB FELA is formulated by using a discrete form of the LB theorem of classical plasticity and a resulting optimization problem of anisotropic clay is cast and solved using the framework of conic quadratic optimization. A dimensionless technique is adopted to express the undrained stability of the problem in terms of adhesion factors of trapdoor roughness, cover-depth ratios, strength gradient ratios, and anisotropic strength ratios. The effects of these parameters on the trapdoor stability factor and associated failure mechanisms of trapdoors are also examined and discussed. Employing a nonlinear regression analysis to the computed LB solutions, the new design equations for the estimation of the undrained stability of trapdoors are proposed, where the effects of strength anisotropy and non-homogeneity as well as width and depth of trapdoor and its roughness can be considered for practical stability applications.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Its efficient application as filler/additives incorporates the improvement in concomitant properties within materials, e.g., strength, which involves interactions between talc particles and aqueous/nonaqueous matrices. Successful property enhancement imposes ideal mixing and homogenous adhesion within a talc particle, but they are limited by the coexistence of face and edge surfaces of talc, which exhibit different level of hydrophobicity. Here, using atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy, we showed that although hydrophilic talc particles obtained from acid treatment or aminosilanization better adhered with materials representing a matrix, the anisotropic characters of the two surface types persisted. Conversely, the degree of talc's surface anisotropy reduced with the surface hydrophobization by aliphatic methylsilanization, but followed by the decrease in adhesion. With ten-fold difference in Hamaker constants of the probe/talc surface interacting pairs, we showed that the adhesions resulted from van der Waals interactions that suggested the influence of surface polarity. The insight from this work would provide grounds for strategies to modulate talc's adhesion, hydrophobicity and surface uniformity.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10–12 of the human airways are applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 are applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 μg⋅m−3 and 80 μg⋅m−3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume is assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations are proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combine to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models has higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy one. Higher DEs arise in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increase the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways’ walls.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

These structures initially require visual inspection to identify and prioritize maintenance processes based on the damage severity deteriorating the structural strength of the bridge. However, owing to the limitations concerning field inspector resources and budget management efficiency, automation technology is introduced to support field inspectors for developing faster defect detection and inspection processes with high accuracy on a large scale. It has advantages in utilizing the limited number of field inspectors more efficiently and preventing the development of defect severity, which requires more time and budget resources for maintenance. This paper describes the complete development of a deep learning-based visual defect-inspection system for reinforced concrete bridge substructures. The system consists of four main components. The first part involves the image acquisition. The second part aims to detect images with defects using a modified ResNet-50 CNN, improved from our previous research. The third part is defect classification, where different types of defects, such as cracking, erosion, honeycomb, scaling, and spalling, are classified using a previous modified ResNet-50. The last part considers the severity prediction using ANN. As a result, the inspection accuracy rate for defect detection, classification accuracy, and severity prediction are 90.4%, 81%, and 78%, respectively. The promising results of this study were acceptable by Thailand’s Department of Highways for practical use. Finally, this study could support Thailand’s Department of Highways and surrounding construction industries as a standard strategy toward digital transformation.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Methods: 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT scans of patients with BCR between July 2017 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All suspicious lesions were recorded. The reference standard was histopathology or combinations of histopathology, imaging, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) follow up, defined as composite reference standard. DR was calculated as the proportion of PSMA PET- positive patients to all patients independent of the reference standard, whereas the CDR was the percentage of patients who had at least 1 true-positive PSMA PET lesion localized that corresponded with the reference standard. The PPV was defined as the proportion of patients who had true-positive to all positive findings. The correlation between DR and patient characteristics was evaluated. Results: A total of 532 patients with a median PSA level of 0.97 ng/mL (interquartile range: 0.41-2.46 ng/mL) were included. Of these, 162 patients had composite follow-up at a median duration of 5.6 mo (range: 1.1-14.2 mo). The proportion of patients who had no lesion visualized on PET/CT, localized disease, and any distant metastases (M1) were 20%, 43%, and 37%, respectively. PET DR among all patients was 80%. On a per-patient basis, the PPV of 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT in the composite cohort was 88%, and the CDR was 70%. The PPV in the histopathology- proven cohort was 91%, and the CDR in this subgroup was 73%. In patients with PSA levels ≥1 ng/mL the DR and PPV were 90% and 91%, respectively, resulting in a CDR of 82%. In patients with PSA levels , 1 ng/mL, the DR and PPV were 69% and 85%, respectively, resulting in a CDR of 59%. There was a significant positive correlation between 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT detection efficacy and stratified PSA levels (P = 0.005), as well as PSA nadir after prostatectomy (P < 0.001).

Unlike the standard Degroot framework, noisy information frameworks destroy consensus formation. On the other hand, noisy opinion dynamics converge to the equilibrium distribution that encapsulates correlations among agents’ opinions. Interestingly, such an equilibrium distribution is also a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) with a non-zero probabilistic current loop. Thus, noisy information source leads to a NESS at long times that encodes persistent correlated opinion dynamics of learning agents. Our model provides a simple realization of NESS in the context of social learning. Other phenomena such as synchronization of opinions when agents are subject to a common noise are also studied.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics, Statistics and Probability"

The purity of bottom layer products of continuous jig was lower than those of batch jig because of light particle entrainment induced by the screw-type extractor. To minimize entrainment, a new discharge system consisting of a vertical restraining wall and a screw-type extractor was developed. The restraining wall was installed close to the “product-end” to separate the jig chamber into two and allow particles to transfer from one part to the other via the gap under the wall. The experimental results showed that this proposed discharge system could improve the purity of heavy particles in bottom layer products because of two reasons: (1) higher material mass ratio of heavy plastic close to product-end, and (2) changes in the flow of water and particles. Moreover, the purity of bottom layer products during continuous jig separation was influenced by the difference of material mass ratio in feed; that is, purity was higher when the ratio of heavy plastic was high. In addition, an estimation procedure based on multi-step treatment using separation curves is proposed to achieve the target purity of bottom layer products.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences","Control and Systems Engineering, Chemistry (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanical Engineering"

Design: Rat dental follicle stem cells were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium supplemented with ADH. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, Alizarin Red S staining, MTT assay and RT-qPCR was used to examine ADH's impact on cell mineralization, viability, and osteogenic gene expression. Real-time calcium imaging analysis was performed to identify the ADH receptor and its mechanism of action. Results: ADH supplementation to the osteogenic differentiation medium inhibited cell mineralization without compromising cell viability and downregulated the expression of key osteogenic genes: DCN (Decorin), RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) and BSP (Bone sialoprotein). Real-time calcium imaging analysis revealed that ADH (1−1000 nM) increased intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with V2255, a V1a receptor blocker, inhibited the calcium signals, but not with the V1b (Nelivaptan) or V2 (Tolvaptan). V2255 also reversed the inhibitory effect of ADH on osteogenesis. Furthermore, U73122, a Phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, 2-APB, an Inositol Triphosphate (IP3) receptor blocker, and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores abolished the calcium signals by ADH. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that ADH activates V1a receptors and the PLC-IP3 pathway to stimulate intracellular calcium signals, which inhibits cell mineralization and osteogenic gene expression. These findings uncovered a novel function for ADH as a negative regulator of osteogenesis in dental follicle stem cells. The role of ADH in the pathogenesis of bone diseases remains to be determined.","medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

This study aimed to determine if ACB with iPACK block was noninferior to ACB with periarticular injection (PAI) when combined with postoperative multimodal analgesia regimen. Methods: Seventy-six patients were randomized to receive either ACB + iPACK block and continuous ACB (CACB) (ACB + iPACK group) or PAI and CACB (ACB + PAI group). Noninferiority was concluded for the primary outcome if the adjusted mean between-group difference in pain on movement at 12 postoperative hours was within 1.3 points on a visual analog pain scale. Pain scores, morphine consumption, functional performance, and adverse events were the secondary outcome measures assessed for superiority. Results: Adjusted mean differences, (ACB + iPACK) − (ACB + PAI), in anterior and posterior knee pain scores on movement at 12 postoperative hours were −0.66 (−1.86, 0.54) and −0.19 (−1.36, 0.99), respectively. The upper limit of 95% confident interval was lower than the prespecified noninferiority limit. The mean visual analog scale pain scores were low and no clinically significant differences between groups. However, morphine requirement at 48 postoperative hours was significantly higher (P <.05) and showed greater reduced quadriceps strength at 0 and 45 degrees on postoperative day 0 (P =.006 and.04, respectively) in the ACB + iPACK group.

The reproductive tract of a single animal was also analysed for CRISP2 and CRISP3 protein expression and localization by immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that both CRISP2 and CRISP3 are expressed in the seminal plasma and spermatozoa derived from Malayan tapirs. CRISP expression was positively correlated with semen quality, especially ejaculate volume, number of motile sperm, and acrosomal integrity. In addition, CRISP2 and CRISP3 protein expression were slightly high in males that had recently sired an offspring. The results suggest that CRISP proteins may serve as biomarkers for ejaculate quality and fertility in male Malayan tapirs. These findings may have significant implications for planning future breeding and re-introduction efforts for this species.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Snail Soothing and Repairing (SSR) cream, containing several glycoproteins with potential antimicrobial and antioxidant effects, may benefit skin hydration promotion after the laser treatment. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSR cream in skin hydration promotion after AFCO2 resurfacing. Method: The study was a double-blinded, split-face, placebo-controlled trial in participants aged 18-50 years with atrophic acne scars on both cheeks. After AFCO2 resurfacing, participants applied the product or placebo on either cheek twice daily for 14 days. Corneometry, TEWL, colorimetry, and clinical assessments (edema, erythema, crusting, pruritus, and tightness score) were evaluated at baseline, day 7, and day 14 after AFCO2 resurfacing. Results: From 22 participants in the study, the SSR cream-treated sides showed significantly higher corneometry levels than placebo-treated sides at day 14 (p = 0.033), while TEWL and colorimetry levels were not different at any study visits. Pruritus and tightness scores of the SSR side were lower, but not significant, than the placebo. Other clinical assessments (edema, erythema, and crusting) showed similar results. No significant adverse events took place. Conclusion: The SSR cream significantly improved skin hydration, highlighting skin barrier restoration after AFCO2 resurfacing, with a good safety profile.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Physiology, Pharmacology, Dermatology"

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a major aromatic plastic and herein, the conversion of PET back into arenes was demonstrated in a one-pot reaction combining depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over a Co/TiO2 catalyst. The effectiveness of the Co/TiO2 catalyst in HDO and the underlining reaction pathway were established using the PET monomer terephthalic acid (TPA) as the substrate. Quantitative TPA conversion together with 75.2 mol% xylene and toluene selectivity under 30 bar initial H2 pressure at 340 °C was achieved after 4 h reaction. More encouragingly, the catalyst induced both depolymerization and HDO reaction via C−O bond cleavage when PET was used as a substrate. 78.9 mol% arenes (toluene and xylene) was obtained under optimized conditions.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, Materials Science, energy","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Energy (all)"

Data from two studies were pooled to evaluate more definitively whether the addition of minocycline to standard treatment for major depressive disorder leads to an improvement of depressive symptoms when compared with placebo. Methods: Both studies were multi-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of minocycline 200 mg/day added to treatment as usual during a 12-week period. The primary outcome measure was change in depressive symptoms (Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale in Dean et al. and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in Husain et al.). Secondary outcomes were change in depression severity (Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale for Dean et al. and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in Husain et al.), anxiety severity (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale in Dean et al. and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale in Husain et al.) and functional status, which were also evaluated as potential mediators on the primary outcome. Results: A total of 112 participants were included in the pooled data (Dean et al., n = 71; Husain et al., n = 41). A significant change from baseline to week 12 was noted in depressive symptoms – differential change (Placebo vs Minocycline): 9.0, 95% confidence interval = [4.2, 13.9], Cohen’s D (95% confidence interval): 0.71 [0.29, 1.14], p < 0.001 – anxiety severity – differential change (Placebo vs Minocycline): 0.38, confidence interval = [0.00, 0.75], Cohen’s D (95% confidence interval): 0.41 [0.00, 0.82], p = 0.050) and functional status – differential change (Placebo vs Minocycline): 1.0, 95% confidence interval = [0.4, 1.5], Cohen’s D (95% confidence interval): 0.76 [0.34, 1.19], p = 0.001). Duration of illness, current use of benzodiazepine and pain medication were identified as moderators, whereas functional status as a mediator/predictor. Conclusion: The improvement of depressive symptoms, anxiety severity and functional status is promising and suggests that minocycline has potential as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. However, further studies are warranted to confirm therapeutic effects of minocycline in major depressive disorder.

Identifying factors associated with suicidality (suicidal ideation [SI]/suicidal behavior) could increase our understanding of the pathophysiological underpinnings of suicide and improve its prevention. Methods: We conducted a systematic review (PubMed/PsycInfo/Cochrane databases, up to September 2020) and random-effect meta-analysis including observational studies comparing peripheral C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in suicidal versus non-suicidal patients affected by any psychiatric disorder and healthy controls (HC). Primary outcome was the CRP standardized mean difference (SMD) between patients with high suicidality versus those with absent or low suicidality. Secondary outcomes were SMD of CRP levels between those with suicide attempt versus no suicide attempt, as well as between those with (high) versus low or absent SI. Quality of included studies was measured with Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Out of initial 550 references, 21 observational studies involving 7682 subjects (7445 with mood disorders or first-episode psychosis, 237 HC) were included. A significant association of CRP levels with suicidality (SMD 0.688, 95% CI 0.476–0.9, p < 0.001) emerged. CRP levels were higher in individuals with high SI (SMD 1.145, 95% CI 0.273–2.018, p = 0.010) and in those with suicide attempt (SMD 0.549, 95%CI 0.363–0.735, p < 0.001) than non-suicidal individuals (either patients or HC). Main analyses were confirmed in sensitivity analysis (removing HC), and after adjusting for publication bias. The cross-sectional design of included studies, and the high heterogeneity of diagnosis and treatment limit the generalizability of these results. Median quality of included studies was high. Conclusion: CRP is associated with higher suicidality in patients with mental disorders. Large cohort studies longitudinally monitoring CRP levels are needed to explore its longitudinal association with suicidality.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

Past taxonomic characterizations of surface microbiota (epimicrobiota) of free-living Nostoc sampled from freshwater systems employed 16S rRNA genes, typically amplicons. We compared taxa identified from 16S, 18S, 23S, and 28S rRNA gene sequences filtered from shotgun metagenomic sequence and used microscopy to illuminate epimicrobiota diversity for Nostoc sampled from a wetland in the northern Chilean Altiplano. Phylogenetic analysis and rRNA gene sequence abundance estimates indicated that the host was related to Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102. Epimicrobiota were inferred to include 18 epicyanobacterial genera or uncultured taxa, six epieukaryotic algal genera, and 66 anoxygenic bacterial genera, all having average genomic coverage ≥90X. The epicyanobacteria Geitlerinemia, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, and an uncultured taxon were detected only by 16S rRNA gene; Gloeobacter and Pseudanabaena were detected using 16S and 23S; and Phormididesmis, Neosynechococcus, Symphothece, Aphanizomenon, Nodularia, Spirulina, Nodosilinea, Synechococcus, Cyanobium, and Anabaena (the latter corroborated by microscopy), plus two uncultured cyanobacterial taxa (JSC12, O77) were detected only by 23S rRNA gene sequences. Three chlamydomonad and two heterotrophic stramenopiles genera were inferred from 18S; the streptophyte green alga Chaetosphaeridium globosum was detected by microscopy and 28S rRNA genes, but not 18S rRNA genes.

Methods: We recruited 30 patients with early-and advanced-stage of PD according to Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. Participants were classified as early-stage PD if they were treatment-naïve or had no motor complications and had been diagnosed with PD within the previous 6 years. Advanced PD was defined as a disease duration equal to or >6 years with or without motor complications. Results: There was significantly shorter REM sleep latency in early as compared to the advanced stage of PD. We found that the sleep Innsbruck Barcelona (SINBAR) EMG index and tonic EMG activity of the mentalis muscle in advanced-stage PD were significantly higher than in early-stage PD with a trend in phasic EMG activity of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The SINBAR EMG index, tonic and any EMG activity of the mentalis muscle, and phasic EMG activity of flexor digitorum superficialis muscles significantly correlated with disease duration. Conclusions: This study analyzed RWA using the SINBAR EMG montage in early-and advanced-stage of PD and showed higher RWA in mentalis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles and SINBAR EMG index in advanced-PD patients compared to patients in the early stage.

Using ChEP and DamID-seq, we now uncover a Piwi/Nxf2-dependent target association with nuclear lamins. Hi-C analysis of Piwi or Nxf2-depleted cells reveals decreased intra-TAD and increased inter-TAD interactions in regions harboring Piwi–piRNA target TEs. Using a forced tethering system, we analyze the functional effects of Piwi–piRNA/Nxf2-mediated recruitment of piRNA target regions to the nuclear periphery. Removal of active histone marks is followed by transcriptional silencing, chromatin conformational changes, and H3K9me3 and H1 association.

Recently, flavones have shown anti-dengue activities by interfering with viral translation and replication. However, the molecular target is still elusive. Here we chemically mod-ified apigenin by adding an alkyne moiety into the B-ring hydroxyl group. The alkyne serves as a chemical tag for the alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction for subcellular visualization. The compound located at the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after infection. Interestingly, the compound signal started shifting to vesicle-like structures at 6 h and accumulated at 24 and 48 h after infection. Moreover, the compound treatment in dengue-infected cells showed that the compound restricted the viral protein inside the vesicles, especially at 48 h. As a result, the dengue envelope proteins spread throughout the cells. The alkyne-tagged apigenin showed a more potent efficacy at the EC50 of 2.36 ± 0.22, and 10.55 ± 3.37 µM, respectively, while the cytotoxicities were similar to the original apigenin at the CC50 of 70.34 ± 11.79, and 82.82 ± 11.68 µM, respectively. Molecular docking con-firmed the apigenin binding to the previously reported target, ribosomal protein S9, at two binding sites. The network analysis, homopharma, and molecular docking revealed that the estrogen receptor 1 and viral NS1 were potential targets at the late infection stage. The interactions could attenuate dengue productivity by interfering with viral translation and suppressing the viral proteins from trafficking to the cell surface.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Colostrum (n = 347) and milk (n = 272) samples from sows were employed in this assay. Indirect ELISA based on three coating antigens was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with a virus neutralization (VN) test as a reference method, and the cutoff value for calculating DSe and DSp was determined. S12-ELISA showed higher DSe and DSp of IgG and IgA detection compared to N- and WV-ELISA in both colostrum and milk samples. Moreover, S12-ELISA showed perfect agreement and a high correlation with the VN test, which was better than the N- and WV-ELISA for both IgG and IgA detection in colostrum and milk. In contrast, N-ELISA showed lower DSe and DSp compared to S12- and WV-ELISA, along with a correlation with VN and substantial agreement with the VN test. Nevertheless, our developed ELISAs have accuracy for repeatability in both inter- and intra-assay variation. Overall, this research demonstrates that S12-ELISA is more suitable than WV- and N-ELISA to detect IgG and IgA antibodies against PEDV from both colostrum and milk samples.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

However, distinct mechanisms involved in cisplatin-induced autophagy in human lung cancer cells are still unclear. Results: Herein, role of autophagy in cisplatin resistance was indicated by a decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in lung cancer H460 cells pre-incubated with wortmannin, an autophagy inhibitor, prior to treatment with 50 µM cisplatin for 24 h. The elevated level of hydroxyl radicals detected via flow-cytometry corresponded to autophagic response, as evidenced by the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in cisplatin-treated cells. Interestingly, apoptosis resistance, autophagosome formation, and the alteration of the autophagic markers, LC3-II/LC3-I and p62, as well as autophagy-regulating proteins Atg7 and Atg3, induced by cisplatin was abrogated by pretreatment of H460 cells with deferoxamine, a specific hydroxyl radical scavenger. The modulations in autophagic response were also indicated in the cells treated with hydroxyl radicals generated via Fenton reaction, and likewise inhibited by pretreatment with deferoxamine. Conclusions: In summary, the possible role of hydroxyl radicals as a key mediator in the autophagic response to cisplatin treatment, which was firstly revealed in this study would benefit for the further development of novel therapies for lung cancer.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

In this study, a total of 141 sand samples were collected from the shore-normal ridge-swale topography and analyzed for layers of candidate storm deposits, revealing at least 21 candidate coastal storm events. The grain size distribution of beach sediments was, in general, unimodal, while the candidate storm sediments revealed a mixed combination of multimodal, bimodal and unimodal distributions. Plots of mean grain size against skewness and kurtosis and of skewness against kurtosis could differentiate storm deposits from shore-normal beach sediments. Sedimentary structures preserved in the ancient coastal storm deposits included parallel and inclined landward laminations, mud rip-up clasts, layers of shell fragments, a pebble grain, normal and reverse grading and sharp lower and upper contacts. Candidate storm layers overlain on a dry beach ridge intervened with mud in a swale showed a finer and thinner landward deposit. Marine shell fragments, smaller foraminifers, ostracod and scaphopod (tusk shell), were well preserved.

In this study, the authors aimed to compare outcomes of pediatric sepsis resuscitation with different types of crystalloid. They randomly assigned pediatric sepsis patients requiring fluid bolus into three groups to receive either normal saline solution (NSS), Ringer lactate solution (RLS), or Sterofundin as fluid bolus therapy. Forty-two patients were included in the study. Median age was 29 mo and, weight 13 kg. After fluid bolus, the complications were not different among groups. However, in the RLS group, the patients who received large dose of the fluid showed significant reduction in urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) level. It is concluded that fluid bolus therapy with different types of crystalloid solution did not result in different outcomes but large dose of RLS was associated with greater reduction of uNGAL level, compared to other fluids.

This creates an additional challenge in medical waste management, particularly in developing countries. Improper managing of medical waste may have serious public health issues and a significant impact on the environment. There are currently three disinfection technologies, namely incineration, chemical and physical processes, that are available to treat COVID-19 medical waste (CMW). This study focuses on thermochemical process, particularly pyrolysis process to treat the medical waste. Pyrolysis is a process that utilizes the thermal instability of organic components in medical waste to convert them into valuable products. Besides, the technique is environmentally friendly, more efficient and cost-effective, requires less landfill capacity, and causes lower pollution. The current pandemic situation generates a large amount of plastic medical wastes, which mainly consists of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, and nylon. These plastic wastes can be converted into valuable energy products like oil, gas and char through pyrolysis process. This review provides detailed information about CMW handling, treatment, valuable product generation, and proper discharge into the open environment.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The as-synthesized Al-MCM-41 possessed hexagonal mesoporous silica with a surface area of 436 m2/g and a mesopore of 3.8 nm, allowing the incorporation of Ni and Ce into the Al-MCM-41 structure. In a fixed-bed tubular reactor, the catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalyst was evaluated in terms of CO2 conversion, CH4/CO selectivity, CH4 yield, reaction rates per catalyst mass (rm), and catalyst surface (rs), TOF, activation energy, and the deactivation rates of its corresponding activities at 250–550 °C and 1 atm. As the Ce content increased, the catalytic activity greatly improved due to the improved Ni dispersion and higher CO2 adsorption, although the porosity of the catalyst significantly decreased. With the optimum Ce content, 100% CH4 yield was achieved at 350 °C and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 20,000 mL g−1 h−1. The optimum catalyst also exhibited high stability with a deactivation rate of −0.072% YCH4 g−1 h−1 over 76 h, attributed to the strong interaction between Ce and Al in Al-MCM-41.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Previously, the crystal structure of the first alternansucrase from Leuconostoc citreum NRRL B‐1355 was successfully elucidated; it showed that alternansucrase might have two acceptor subsites (W675 and W543) responsible for the formation of alternating linked glucan. This work aimed to investigate the primary acceptor subsite (W675) by saturated mutagenesis using Leu-conostoc citreum ABK‐1 alternansucrase (LcALT). The substitution of other residues led to loss of overall activity, and formation of an alternan polymer with a nanoglucan was maintained when W675 was replaced with other aromatic residues. Conversely, substitution by nonaromatic residues led to the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Mutations at W675 could potentially cause LcALT to lose control of the acceptor molecule binding via maltose–acceptor reaction—as demonstrated by results from molecular dynamics simulations of the W675A variant. The formation of α‐(1,2), α‐(1,3), α‐ (1,4), and α‐(1,6) linkages were detected from products of the W675A mutant. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme strictly synthesized α‐(1,6) linkage on the maltose acceptor. This study examined the importance of W675 for transglycosylation, processivity, and regioselectivity of glucansucrases. Engineering glucansucrase active sites is one of the essential approaches to green tools for carbohydrate modification.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Previous studies reported detection of the virus in multiple organs of the infected fish; however, little is known about the in-depth localization of the virus in the central nervous system. Herein, we determined the distribution of TiLV in the entire brain of experimentally infected Nile tilapia. In situ hybridization (ISH) using TiLV-specific probes revealed that the virus was broadly distributed throughout the brain. The strongest positive signals were dominantly detected in the forebrain (responsible for learning, appetitive behaviour and attention) and the hindbrain (involved in controlling locomotion and basal physiology). The permissive cell zones for viral infection were observed mostly to be along the blood vessels and the ventricles. This indicates that the virus may productively enter into the brain through the circulatory system and widen broad regions, possibly through the cerebrospinal fluid along the ventricles, and subsequently induce the brain dysfunction. Understanding the pattern of viral localization in the brain may help elucidate the neurological disorders of the diseased fish. This study revealed the distribution of TiLV in the whole infected brain, providing new insights into fish–virus interactions and neuropathogenesis.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

Twelve client-owned healthy diestrous bitches were used in the study. The single dose of aglepristone (Alizine®, 10 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously 5 days before ovariohysterectomy in the treatment group (n = 6); bitches without treatment served as a control group (n = 6). Uteri were collected for histomorphometric analysis, ERα and PR gene, and protein expressions studies. The mRNA expressions of ERα and PR were determined by RT-qPCR. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the ERα and PR protein expressions using an H-score in five parts of the uterus. The results demonstrated glandular epithelium height significantly decreased (p <.05) and ERα mRNA increased (p <.01) in treated dogs. Of the treated bitches, lower expression levels of ERα were observed in the luminal epithelium, crypt and glandular epithelium, with higher expression in the endometrial stroma and myometrium (p <.05); however, PR expression decreased in the luminal epithelium, crypt and glandular epithelium (p <.01). In conclusion, reduction of the uterine glandular epithelium and ERα mRNA upregulation together with changes in ERα and PR expressions were observed in the treated bitches. However, changes in uterine ERα and PR expressions in the treated bitches depended on tissue layers. The treatment had no effect on serum oestradiol and progesterone levels.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

In order to minimize membrane fouling, three different reactor configurations of R1:No media (anaerobic baffled MBR), R2:FF (Fixed Film AnBB-MBR) and R3:FF + MVB (Fixed Film and Moving Bed AnBB-MBR) were evaluated at the same operating hydraulic retention time of 3 days. The specific fouling rates of the ceramic membranes were 0.98, 0.84 and 0.5 kPa/L/m2 for R1:No media, R2:FF and R3:FF + MVB, respectively. The R2:FF and R3:FF + MVB reactors could mitigate the membrane fouling rates by 14.1% and 48.9%, compared to R1:No media due to biomass retention in the fixed film and mechanical scouring of the MVB. From the microbial community analysis, higher relative abundances of Methanosaeta were found in the biofilm whereas more Methanobacterium was found in the suspended sludge. Moreover, higher accumulations of humic and fulvic substances in the system could inhibit the methanogenic activity.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial symbioses and other interactions; biofilms, geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

Self-assembly hydrophobic silica particle (SAHS) containing water was fabricated by abruptly incorporation of water into R812S. Five different weight percent of R812S were investigated in terms of the ability to form SAHS including their physical stability. The lowest ratio of 1% was not able to form SAHS. More than 2 up to 5% of R812S yielded core-shell structure of SAHS in the dry solid form. The smaller size of SAHS would be the result of higher level of R812S used. The finer the water droplet the more consume the silica particle used in order to gain stable SAHS. In terms of stability, they disclosed unacceptable qualities at 6 months of storage due to either remarkable phase separation or squeezing out of inner water core. It should be due to the thermodynamic driven forces that accelerated the movement of both water and silica shell to coalesce. In conclusion, the stable SAHS comprised of sufficient amount of R812S (more than 2% by weight) with water. It could be kept within short term period with acceptable properties.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)

One of the methods to improve oxidation stability is partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME). The present research studied the novel production technique of H-FAME derived from soybean FAME using non-thermal parallel-plate dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. This green hydrogenation method does not require a catalyst and can be performed under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. The reaction using DBD plasma could effectively initiate the hydrogenation reaction, and the results showed similar performance to catalysis technique. The optimized process parameters for 35 mL of FAME were 25% H2, 5.5 hours of reaction time, and ambient temperature. This condition exhibited the highest conversion of polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2 and C18:3) and the highest yield of C18:1. DBD plasma hydrogenation resulted in the reduction of iodine value from 128 to 67.4. The oxidation stability was enhanced from 2.13 to 10 hours while the cloud point increased from −1°C to 11°C (still within the ASTM D6751 standard).

Influence of the Spatial Variability of Soil Shear Strength on Deep Excavation: A Case Study of a Bangkok Underground MRT Station,"Nguyen T.S., Likitlersuang S.",2021-02-01,"Ground surface settlements, Mohr Coulomb model, Random field theory, Soil shear strength, Spatial variability, Stability analysis, Strength reduction, Undrained shear strength, Deep excavation, Factor of safety, Random finite-element method, Statistical analysis, Strength parameters","This paper investigates the effects that the spatial variability of a soil's undrained shear strength has on lateral wall movements and ground surface settlements when performing a deep excavation stability analysis. A random finite-element method is employed to statistically assess a deep excavation. A case study based on an actual deep excavation project in Bangkok's subsoils was used to validate the methodology. The two-dimensional spatial variability of the undrained shear strength in the clay layers of Bangkok's subsoil is simulated using the random field theory and Monte Carlo simulation. The Mohr-Coulomb model is used to predict lateral wall movements and ground surface settlements, while the stability analysis of the deep excavation is evaluated by the factor of safety using the strength reduction approach. The results show that spatial variability highly affects the distribution of lateral wall movements and ground surface settlements, as well as the scatter of the factor of safety corresponding to progressing stages of excavation.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Soil Science
Schizophrenia phenomenology revisited: Positive and negative symptoms are strongly related reflective manifestations of an underlying single trait indicating overall severity of schizophrenia,"Almulla A.F., Al-Hakeim H.K., Maes M.",2021-08-01,"Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Psychological, Patient Acuity, Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, Symptom Assessment, Deficit schizophrenia, inflammation, neuroimmune, phenomenology, symptom domains","Background To examine whether negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism (PHEM symptoms), formal thought disorders (FTD) and psychomotor retardation (PMR) are interrelated phenomena in major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP) or deficit schizophrenia and whether those domains belong to an underlying latent vector reflecting general psychopathology. Methods In this study, we recruited 120 patients with MNP or deficit schizophrenia and 54 healthy subjects and measured the above-mentioned symptom domains. Results In MNP, there were significant associations between negative and PHEM symptoms, FTD and PMR. A single latent trait, which is essentially unidimensional, underlies these key domains of schizophrenia and MNP and additionally shows excellent internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and predictive relevance. Confirmatory Tedrad Analysis indicates that this latent vector fits a reflective model. The lack of discriminant validity shows that positive (and PHEM or psychotic) and negative symptoms greatly overlap and probably measure the same latent construct. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) shows that MNP (diagnosis based on negative symptoms) is better modeled using PHEM symptoms, FTD, and PMR than negative symptoms. Conclusions In stable phase MNP, which is a restricted sample of the schizophrenia population, negative and PHEM symptoms, FTD and PMR belong to one underlying latent vector reflecting overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS). The bi-dimensional concept of positive and negative symptoms cannot be validated and, therefore, future research in stable phase schizophrenia should consider that the latent phenomenon OSOS as well as its reflective manifestations are the key factors of schizophrenia phenomenology.",medical,"Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Data on neurological outcomes after modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy are scarce. Materials and methods: Case records of consecutive T4 NPC patients who received definitive IMRT in two tertiary oncology centers in 2004–2019 were reviewed. Patterns of cranial neuropathies at disease presentation were recorded. Time to neurological recovery and the rate of subsequent re-palsy were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical predictors were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. Results: During the study period, 257 T4 NPC patients presented with 504 individual cranial neuropathies. The median time from neuropathy onset to NPC diagnosis was two months (IQR, 1–4 months). Cranial nerves (CN) VI (56.4%), V2 (47.9%), and V3 (29.2%) were most frequently involved. At a median follow-up of 6.4 years, the crude partial and full recovery rates of neuropathies were 111 (22%) and 289 (57.3%), respectively. CN III, IV, and VI had the highest 5-year full recovery rate (72.7%), followed by CN V1-3 (60.3%), XII (48.6%), and II (18.2%) (p < 0.001). Positive smoking history, optic nerve involvement, and longer duration of neuropathy were independent negative predictors for neurological recovery. After full recovery, re-palsy was observed in 6.9% (20/289) of the nerves, 60% of which co-occurred with local NPC recurrences. Conclusion: Durable recovery of most cranial neuropathies in advanced T4 NPC was observed in the era of modern IMRT and effective systemic chemotherapy. Both patient and disease factors affected the chance of neurological recovery. Re-palsy of recovered nerves should prompt careful evaluation for local recurrence.",medical,"Hematology, Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

In order to reduce the consumption of natural aggregates, the granite waste sourced from the stone industry was used as fine aggregates for making geopolymer concrete cured at room temperature. Natural river sand was replaced with the granite waste at 25% and 50% by weight. The effect of moisture conditions of fine aggregates on the properties of the geopolymer concrete were also investigated. The fine aggregates were prepared in three different moisture states: saturated surface dry (SSD), air-dry (AD) and oven-dry (OD). It was found that the slump flow of the geopolymer concrete increased with the increasing proportion of the granite waste in the mixture. Meanwhile, the initial and the final setting times were not influenced by the inclusion of the granite waste except when the fine aggregates were saturated. The presence of angular shaped particles enhanced the early compressive strength of geopolymer concrete with 50% replacement of natural sand by the granite waste. Furthermore, the fire test results showed that the geopolymer concrete with the granite waste had a similar spalling behavior to the one made entirely with the natural sand, but tended to show inferior post-fire residual strengths, particularly when the oven-dried aggregates were used.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

Therefore, when a fault occurs, the system restoration should have the fastest. The purpose of this article is to develop an algorithm to classify the cause of faults in Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA.) distribution systems in southern area 2 of Thailand with waveform characterization and compares the performance of the supervised machine learning (SML) and the artificial neural network (ANN) technique to reduce the outage duration. The characteristic signature of voltage and current waveform i.e., voltage dip, rate of change of current and voltage, neutral current and voltage, temporary or permanent fault, fault type, and evolving fault were extracted, provided to SML and ANN to classify the cause of faults focusing on animals, tree contact, and equipment failure. Accuracy testing of the algorithm by real testing was performed with the distribution system of PEA in the central-southern area of Thailand. The result shows that when the group of fault events is correctly classified, the proposed method can provide the high accuracy of identifying fault cause with the lowest ML accuracy of 81.21% and the lowest ANN accuracy of 62.50%. Consequently, In the condition of this paper, the SML can classify more accurately than the ANN.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Instrumentation"

By investigating the key thermomechanical and tribological characteristics displayed by the composite materials, the underlying structure-properties relationships were deconvoluted. Composite friction materials with higher thermomechanical and wear resistance properties were obtained from polybenzoxazines with relatively high crosslink densities. In contrast, polybenzoxazines with relatively low crosslink densities afforded composite friction materials with an improved coefficient of friction values and specific wear rates.","lubrication, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Hydrophobic side chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and methionine) were experimented together with 5.56 mol% THF on the hydrate formation kinetics and morphology at 293.2 K and 8 MPa in an unstirred reactor. Results show that all hydrophobic side chain amino acids affected the hydrate formation kinetics by increasing the formation rate at the same extent as surfactants. In addition, the presence of amino acids resulted in almost five times higher formation rate than with only 5.56 mol% THF. However, there were no significant difference hydrate formation rate with different amino acid concentrations. Surprisingly, the formation with certain hydrophobic side chain amino acids, leucine and methionine, showed multiple-step hydrate growth profiles, which resulted in the high methane uptake as compared to 5.56 mol% THF. The hydrate formation morphology in the presence of hydrophobic side chain amino acids illustrated different hydrate growth patterns from the THF solution and was totally different for each of the amino acid. Moreover, the presence of hydrophobic side chain amino acid did not affect the methane hydrate dissociation.","petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

The main objectives of this study include updating the prevalence of endoparasitism in client-owned cats, status of retroviral infections and determining the association between feline hookworm infection and possible risk factors. A total of 509 fecal samples were collected from client-owned cats in 2014–2015 and examined by a wet fecal mount technique. If additional sample remained, a PBS-ethyl acetate sedimentation was done (n = 229), and ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation was also performed if there was sufficient remaining sample (n = 105). At least one parasite was observed in 32.0% (163/509) of cats, with Ancylostoma being the most common intestinal parasite detected in 21.6% (110/509) of cats. Other parasitic infections detected by fecal examinations included Toxocara (6.9%; 35/509), Platynosomum (3.7%; 19/509), Cystoisospora (3.5%; 18/509), Taenia (2.9%; 15/509), Spirometra (1.6%; 8/509), Dipylidium (0.4%; 2/509), and Opisthorchis-like trematode (0.2%; 1/509). Examination for Giardia infection was conducted with the SNAP® Giardia Test, a coproantigen test, on a subset of the fecal samples (233/509) and revealed a positive result on 3.9% (9/233) of samples. Plasma samples were analyzed using the SNAP® Triple Test detecting antigens of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) and Dirofilaria immitis while also detecting antibodies to Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV). Antigens of FeLV and antibodies to FIV were found in 7.1% (19/269) and 5.2% (14/269) of cats, respectively. None of the cats were found to have circulating antigen of Dirofilaria immitis using this test. No association between retroviral and endoparasitic infections was found. From multivariable logistic regression examining associated factors, the ability of cats to access the outdoors (adjusted OR = 3.22, 95% CI; 1.42–7.87) and having tapeworm segments or adult helminths in feces (adjusted OR = 3.31, 95% CI; 1.34–8.21) were significantly associated with the finding of hookworm eggs in feces. This work presents the most up-to-date data on enteric feline parasite prevalence in the metropolitan Bangkok area from which fecal samples were directly collected from cats. Consequently, this study emphasizes that diagnosis of parasitic infections and the routine use of antiparasitic medications should be encouraged by veterinarians and to owners in order to reduce the reservoir of potentially zoonotic parasites.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Parasitology, Veterinary (all)"

The optimal solution was determined by an optimisation solver in the MathCAD Prime 4 program. The sensitivity of the objective function with respect to the parameters in the optimisation problem evaluated at the optimal solution was also determined. The sensitivity and linearity of the designed ring gauge is in the range of commercial gauges. The accuracy of the ring gauge was better than 0.1%, complying with ASTM standard E1820. Performance of the ring gauge, i.e. its linearity, hysteresis, and repeatability, was better than the DCB gauge reproduced from the standard.

An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. Method: A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings. Results: A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition. Conclusion: All the evidence provided suggest that these dressings provide clinicians with an evidence-based option for the management of chronic wounds; that the TLC-NOSF dressings are beneficial in promoting the healing process, reducing healing times, enhancing patients' HRQoL, and in allowing a more cost-effective procedure.",Nursing,"Fundamentals and Skills, Nursing (miscellaneous)"

Here, we measure responses of root border cells (1 day, ± 60 mM NaCl) and apply multi-logistic quantification of growth variables (21 days, ± 60 mM NaCl) to two rice varieties, salt-sensitive IR29 and tolerant Pokkali. Thus, logistic models determine the maximum response velocities (Vmax) and times of half-maximum (T0) for root border cell (RBC) and growth parameters. Thereof, seven variables show logistic models (0.58 < R ≤ 1) and monotonous responses in both Pokkali and IR29: root to shoot ratio by water content, primary root length, shoot water, adventitious root number, shoot dry and fresh weight, and root dry weight. Moreover, the regression to lognormal distribution (R = 0.99) of these seven Vmax fractionated by T0 represents the rice variety’s comprehensive response. Its quotient IR29/Pokkali is peaking at 98-fold higher velocity of IR29, thus capturing the variety’s sensitivity. Consequently, our finding of 66-fold higher Vmax of primary root length response of IR29 indicates an essential salt sensor in the root, including RBC. Finally, the effects of salt stress on RBC confirm multi-logistic quantification, showing 36% decrease of RBC mucilage layer in IR29, without change in Pokkali. Inversely, RBC number of Pokkali increases 43% without change in IR29. Briefly, this suggests both RBC and multi-logistic quantification for the screening for salt tolerance in two thousand rice varieties.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Plant Science, Cell Biology"

Self-collection for CT/NG testing is recommended for men who have sex with men. However, the information on acceptability and clinical performance to support a recommendation for transgender women is lacking. We aimed to determine the acceptability and satisfaction towards self-collection for CT/NG testing among Thai transgender women. Methods: Thai transgender women who attended Tangerine Clinic (a transgender-led, integrated, gender-affirming care and sexual health services clinic in Bangkok, Thailand) between May and July 2020 and had condomless sexual intercourse within the past six months were offered to collect urine and perform self-swabs of pharyngeal, rectal, and if applicable, neovaginal compartments for pooled nucleic acid amplification testing for CT/NG infections. Participants received a diagram, video and oral instructions about how to perform self-collection procedure. Those who accepted self-collection were also offered to receive provider collection to evaluate the performance between the two methods. Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess satisfaction. Results: Among 216 transgender women enrolled, 142 (65.7%) accepted self-collection. All who accepted had pharyngeal, rectal and urine samples collected. Of 31 transgender women who had undergone genital surgery, 28 (90.3%) accepted neovaginal self-swab. The acceptance rate increased from 46.2% in May to 84.5% in July 2020. One participant had an invalid result. All transgender women who accepted self-collection could perform it without assistance, and 82.8% were highly satisfied with the method. None reported dissatisfaction. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provider collection services were discontinued early, and only eight transgender women were able to perform both methods for performance evaluation. The performance agreement was 100%. Conclusions: Thai transgender women had high acceptability and satisfaction towards self-collection for CT/NG testing. The performance was promising compared to provider collection. Our results support the implementation of self-collection to the sexually transmitted infection services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic where physical distancing is the new normal. A larger study is warranted to determine the performance of self-collection for CT/NG testing in each anatomical compartment and confirm the performance between self-collection and provider collection.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical","Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

We find that Mg2Si and Mg2Ge readily mix with each other leading to formation of a single-phase random solid solutions of Mg2Si1−xGex across the entire composition range from the temperature of about 50 K and above. At 0 K, Mg2Si1−xGex exhibits a weak energy preference toward local phase segregation into Mg2Si and Mg2Ge without forming any ordered patterns of Si and Ge atoms. Through a comparison with the mixing thermodynamics of Mg2Sn with Mg2Si or Mg2Ge, a small lattice misfit between Mg2Si and Mg2Ge of less than 1 % is responsible for the formation of stable Mg2Si1−xGex random solid solutions at such a low temperature. Besides their thermodynamic stability, our prediction reveals that the random solid solutions of Mg2Si1−xGex are dynamically and mechanically stable. These findings justify the uses of structural models of Mg2Si1−xGex, assuming a random distribution of Si and Ge atoms in the previous theoretical studies, and also provide an insight into the complete solubility of Mg2Ge in Mg2Si and vice versa at all temperature where the atomic diffusion is activated.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Preventive therapy for latent TB infection (LTBI) is an adjunctive strategy to control TB. However, LTBI data in Thai prisoners is limited. This study assessed the prevalence of LTBI and feasibility of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among prisoners in Klong Prem Central Prison, Bangkok. Participants were screened for active TB by questionnaire and chest X-ray. LTBI was evaluated by Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFTP) among subgroup. Participants with positive TST or QFTP were considered to have LTBI. Participants with LTBI were offered IPT. Results: From August 2018–November 2019, 1002 participants were analyzed. All participants were male with a median age of 38 (IQR 32–50) years. LTBI identified by either TST/QFTP was present in 466 (46.5%) participants. TST was positive in 359 (36%) participants. In the subgroup of 294 participants who had both TST and QFTP results, 181/294 (61.6%) tested positive by QFTP. Agreement between TST and QFTP was 55.1% (Kappa = 0.17). The risk factors associated with LTBI were previous incarceration (aOR 1.53, 95%CI, 1.16–2.01, p = 0.002), history of prior active TB (aOR 3.02, 95%CI, 1.74–5.24, p < 0.001) and duration of incarceration ≥10 years (aOR 1.86, 95%CI, 1.24–2.79, p = 0.003). Majority of LTBI participants (82%) agreed to take IPT. Three hundred and 56 (93%) participants completed treatment whereas 27 (7%) participants discontinued IPT due to the side effects of INH. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate the prevalence of LTBI and feasibility of IPT among Thai prisoners. LTBI prevalence in male prisoners in Thailand is high.

Zerumbone, a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene, was previously found to possess anti-asthmatic effect by modulating Th1/Th2 cytokines. However, the protective role of zerumbone on epithelial barrier function remains to be fully explored. Objective: To investigate the effect of zerumbone on HDM extract-induced airway epithelial barrier dysfunction. Materials and methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE14o- were incubated with 100 μg/mL HDM extract and treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of zerumbone (6.25 μM, 12.5 μM, and 25 μM) for 24 h. The epithelial junctional integrity and permeability were evaluated through transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-Dextran permeability assays, respectively. The localization of junctional proteins, occludin and zona occludens (ZO)-1, was studied using immunofluorescence (IF) while the protein expression was measured by western blot. Results: Zerumbone inhibited changes in junctional integrity (6.25 μM, p ≤.05; 12.5 μM, p ≤.001; 25 μM, p ≤.001) and permeability (6.25 μM, p ≤.05; 12.5 μM, p ≤.01; 25 μM, p ≤.001) triggered by HDM extract in a concentration-dependent manner. This protective effect could be explained by the preservation of occludin (12.5 μM, p ≤.01 and 25 μM, p ≤.001) and ZO-1 (12.5 μM, p ≤.05 and 25 μM, p ≤.001) localization, rather than the prevention of their cleavage. Discussion and conclusion: Zerumbone attenuates HDM extract-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction which supports its potential application for the treatment of inflammation-driven airway diseases such as asthma.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Toxicology, Pharmacology"
Size effects in two-dimensional layered materials modeled by couple stress elasticity,"Wongviboonsin W., Gourgiotis P.A., Van C.N., Limkatanyu S., Rungamornrat J.",2021-04-01,"Couple stress elasticity, Displacement field, Generalized continuum theories, Internal length scale, Material microstructures, Material mismatch, Mechanical response, Substrate stiffness, Cosserat, layered materials, microstructure, size effects","In the present study, the effect of material microstructure on the mechanical response of a two-dimensional elastic layer perfectly bonded to a substrate is examined under surface loadings. In the current model, the substrate is treated as an elastic half plane as opposed to a rigid base, and this enables its applications in practical cases when the modulus of the layer (e.g., the coating material) and substrate (e.g., the coated surface) are comparable. The material microstructure is modeled using the generalized continuum theory of couple stress elasticity. The boundary value problems are formulated in terms of the displacement field and solved in an analytical manner via the Fourier transform and stiffness matrix method. The results demonstrate the capability of the present continuum theory to efficiently model the size-dependency of the response of the material when the external and internal length scales are comparable. Furthermore, the results indicated that the material mismatch and substrate stiffness play a crucial role in the predicted elastic field. Specifically, the study also addresses significant discrepancy of the response for the case of a layer resting on a rigid substrate.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture"
Human amniotic fluid stem cells attenuate cholangiocyte apoptosis in a bile duct injury model of liver ductal organoids,"Chusilp S., Lee C., Li B., Lee D., Yamoto M., Ganji N., Vejchapipat P., Pierro A.",2021-01-01,"Amniotic Fluid, Apoptosis, Bile Ducts, Humans, Liver, Organoids, Stem Cells, Amniotic fluid stem cell, Bile duct injury, Cell apoptosis, Fibrogenic cytokine","Purpose: Biliary atresia (BA) is a fibro-obliterative cholangiopathy that involves both extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts in infants. Cholangiocyte apoptosis has an influence on the fibrogenesis process of bile ducts and the progression of liver fibrosis in BA. Human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) are multipotent cells that have ability to inhibit cell apoptosis. We aimed to investigate whether hAFSCs have the potential to attenuate cholangiocyte apoptosis and injury induced fibrogenic response in our ex vivo bile duct injury model of liver ductal organoids. Methods: The anti-apoptotic effect of hAFSCs was tested in the acetaminophen-induced injury model of neonatal mouse liver ductal organoids (AUP #42681) by using direct and indirect co-culture systems. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. Expression of fibrogenic cytokines was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with post hoc test. Results: In our injury model, liver ductal organoids that were treated with hAFSCs in both direct and indirect co-culture systems had a significantly smaller number of apoptotic cholangiocytes and decreased expression of fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Moreover, hAFSCs increased cholangiocyte proliferation in injured organoids. Conclusion: hAFSCs have the ability to protect the organoids from injury by decreasing cholangiocyte apoptosis and promoting cholangiocyte proliferation. This protective ability of hAFSCs leads to inhibition of the fibrogenic response in the injured organoids. hAFSCs have high therapeutic potential to attenuate liver fibrogenesis in cholangiopathic diseases such as BA.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Surgery"

Momordica charantia L. (MC) has been widely known for its nutraceutical and health-promoting properties. To date, the effect of MC for the prevention and handling of PAHs-induced neurotoxicity has not been reported. In the current study, the neuroprotective effects of MC and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22); moreover, in silico analysis was performed with the phytochemicals MC to decipher their potential function as neuroprotectants. MC was demonstrated to possess neuroprotective effect by reducing reactive oxygen species’ (ROS’) production and down-regulating cyclin D1, p53, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein expressions, resulting in the inhibition of cell apoptosis and the normalization of cell cycle progression. Additionally, 28 phytochemicals of MC and their competence on inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1) functions were resolved. In silico analysis of vitamin E and stigmasterol revealed that their binding to either CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 was more efficient than the binding of each positive control (alizarin or purpurin). Together, MC is potentially an interesting neuroprotectant including vitamin E and stigmasterol as probable active components for the prevention for PAHs-induced neurotoxicity.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Herein, a one-stone-two-birds strategy of La3+ incorporation (La-V2O5) is developed to motivate Zn2+ insertion/extraction kinetics and stabilize vanadium species for V2O5. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal the incorporated La3+ ions in V2O5 can not only serve as pillars to expand the interlayer distance (11.77 Å) and lower the Zn2+ migration energy barrier (0.82 eV) but also offer intermediated level and narrower band gap (0.54 eV), thus accelerating the electron/ion diffusion kinetics. Importantly, the steadily doped La3+ ions effectively stabilize the V-O bonds by shortening the bond length, thereby inhibiting vanadium species dissolution. Therefore, the resulting La-V2O5-ZIBs deliver an exceptional rate capacity of 405 mA h g-1 (0.1 A g-1), long-term stability with 93.8% retention after 5000 cycles (10 A g-1), and extraordinary energy density of 289.3 W h kg-1, outperforming various metal-ions-doped V2O5 cathodes. Moreover, the La-V2O5 pouch cell presents excellent electrochemical performance and impressive flexibility and integration ability. The strategies of incorporating rare-earth-metal ions provide guidance to other well-established aqueous ZIBs cathodes and other advanced electrochemical devices.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Encapsulation of α-tocopherol in large-ring cyclodextrin containing 26 α-D-glucopyranose units: A molecular dynamics study,"Kerdpol K., Nutho B., Krusong K., Poo-arporn R.P., Rungrotmongkol T., Hannongbua S.",2021-10-01,"Antioxidant activities, Antitumor property, D-glucopyranose, Dynamic studies, Inclusion complex, Large rings, Large-ring cyclodextrin, Molecular dynamic, Vitamin-E, Α-tocopherol, Inclusion complex, Large-ring cyclodextrin (LR-CD), Molecular dynamics (MD), Vitamin E, α-Tocopherol","α-Tocopherol is the most biologically active form of vitamin E (VE) exhibiting various biological activities such as strong antioxidant activity, antitumor properties and antiaging effects. However, the low water solubility of α-tocopherol has limited its prospective use in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry. One of the promising strategies to tackle such issue is the use of a supramolecular complex with cyclodextrins (CDs). In this study, the encapsulation of α-tocopherol with six different initial un-complexed states into the large-ring CD containing 26 α-D-glucopyranose units (CD26) was studied by means of 400-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate their host–guest association process and the preferential binding efficiency upon complexation at low concentration of α-tocopherol. The MD results show that α-tocopherol spontaneously interacted with CD26 within 20 ns and formed a stable inclusion complex during 150–400 ns. From all six independent simulations, the inclusion complexes can be divided into two groups, which were fully and partly encapsulated inside the cavity of CD26. The α-tocopherol of the first group was covered by 13–14 subunits of CD26, while α-tocopherol in another group was attached by 6–10 subunits of CD26. In addition, α-tocopherol was surrounded by one- or two-turn helix of one half-ring of CD26, leaving the rest of cavities for forming complexation with a larger number of α-tocopherol molecules. Therefore, CD26 can be used as a solubility and stability enhancer for α-tocopherol through inclusion complexation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The thickness of the oil film between drops decreases and ruptures. As a consequence, the drops coalesce together. However, if the electric field is too high, the resultant drop deforms and disintegrates, reducing the efficiency of the electrocoalescence process. In this work, a multiple-physic simulation is performed to determine the critical electric field that causes the disintegration of an aqueous drop. The configuration is an aqueous drop, located on a grounded electrode in an insulating oil under an electric field. We numerically analyze the deformation and disintegration of a drop under the applied electric field using the finite element method. We use the level set method to track the interface between the aqueous drop and the insulating oil. The results show that the aqueous drop elongates due to the electric force and starts to deform under 0.36 kV/mm electric field. The elongation and the deformation of drop increase with the electric field. Eventually, the aqueous drop completely loses its stability at the critical field value, which is equal to 0.9 kV/mm. An experiment is conducted to observe the disintegration of drop. The experimental results demonstrate that the drop disintegration occurs at the average electric field of 1.02 kV/mm, slightly higher than the critical field obtained from the simulation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed cylindrical glass reactor in the temperature range of 250–700 °C and achieved the product yield of 22.4 wt% bio-oil, 18.9 wt % pyrolysis gases, and 58.7 wt% biochar at 500 °C optimum temperature. The chemical composition of bio-oil was investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy and fourier transformation infrared techniques. The ASTM standard procedures were used to assess the fuel qualities of bio-oil, and they were found to be satisfactory. Bio-oil has a greater H/C ratio (3.49) and a lower O/C ratio (1.10), indicating that it is suitable for engine use. The gas chromatographic analysis of pyrolysis gases confirmed the presence of 41.16 wt % combustible gases, making it suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. X-ray fluorescence analysis of biochar showed that it had a good amount of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with some micro-and macro-nutrient which proves its potential to utilize as organic manure in the agriculture sector. In addition, the data obtained from the TGA analysis during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was applied to calculate kinetic parameters via the Coats-Redfern method.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; energygy, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Unlike the gold standard testing method, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), CRISPR diagnostics have recently become a more appealing alternative as they are proven to be faster, simpler, and more affordable. However, the current CRISPR diagnostic readouts are typically non-quantitative, making them error-prone and lacking crucial information of viral load. To further improve the CRISPR diagnostic method, we have developed a custom computer vision algorithm that works in complement to common transilluminators to process fluorescence images of the diagnostic samples, quantify their fluorescence signals, and assign the test results. Our analysis showed that the quantified fluorescence intensity was directly correlated to the sample viral load, useful information for transmissibility and disease severity. Verified through laboratory and clinical samples, our algorithm accurately discriminated the samples with the viral RNA as low as 6.25 copies/uL, and correctly classified nasopharyngeal swab (NP swab) samples with 100% accuracy. Our work serves as a potential technique to improve the accuracy of CRISPR diagnostics of COVID-19 and promote rapid testing vital to the containment of the ongoing pandemic.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Signal Processing, Acoustics and Ultrasonics"

The major limitation of biodiesel production is the immiscibility of reactants resulting in the slow reaction rate. The development of an intensification reactor is the main purpose to eliminate the limitation and to increase the production capacity. The present research explored the state of the art for the hydrodynamic regime inside the rotating tube reactor (RTR) to enhance the biodiesel production rate using alkali-catalyzed transesterification based on the design specification. The influence of operating conditions in terms of methanol-to-oil molar ratio, NaOH loading, total flowrate, rotational speed using two dimensionless numbers, i.e. rotating Reynolds number (Rer) and Taylor number (Ta), as well as torque, were originally proposed to determine the optimal operating condition for biodiesel production in this RTR. This was interesting to report that the modulated wavy vortex flow is required to promote biodiesel yield in the RTR. The increment values of Rer, Ta and torque associated with the turbulent Taylor vortex flow regime allowed the high reaction temperature which can generate excessive heat raising the methanol vaporization rate, leading to reduced biodiesel yield. Therefore, the optimal operating condition of this RTR was found to be 6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, total flowrate of 30 mL/min, rotational speed of 1000 rpm at room temperature giving the highest yield of 97.5% with yield efficiency of 3.75×10−3 g/J and the quality of biodiesel met the ASTM specification.",energy,"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

However, maintaining statin therapy is difficult and may be impeded further in PLHIV due to the risk of antiretroviral therapy (ART)/statin interactions. We estimated rates of statin discontinuation and reinitiation, and the percentage of days covered by statin use among PLHIV on ART, and investigated factors associated with these outcomes.Design:Observational cohort study.Methods:Clinical data from individuals attending the HIV-NAT Centre in Bangkok, Thailand between 2001 and 2020 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, competing-risk regression, and generalized estimating equations. Discontinuation was defined as statin cessation lasting 90 days.Results:Data on 318 PLHIV were included. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 22.3, 50.8, and 61.1% had discontinued statin use, respectively. Among those who discontinued (n=178), 52.0% reinitiated statin use within 5 years. Factors associated with statin discontinuation were low education level, fewer concomitant medications, and lack of ASCVD. Factors associated with statin reinitiation were older age, diabetes, and high levels of LDL cholesterol. The adjusted mean percentage of days covered by a statin was 86.7, 61.1, and 58.1% in the 6 months prior to 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, respectively.Conclusion:Maintenance of statin therapy is poor among PLHIV on ART but is not associated with using contraindicated antiretroviral/statin combinations. A better understanding of statin use in PLHIV will aid clinicians treating individuals and policy makers designing interventions for population-level ASCVD risk reduction.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

We included 6 meta-analyses of RCTs, 30 published RCTs, 11 conference abstracts, and 62 ongoing RCTs. An evidence map was created to demonstrate the treatment effects of 49 therapeutic modalities for NASH. Only six interventions (6/49, 12.24%) met the histological surrogate endpoints for potential conditional FDA approval. Obeticholic acid is the only therapy demonstrating positive benefits in ≥1-point improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH in a phase 3 trial. The other therapies were all phase 2 studies. ≥1-point improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH was shown in patients treated with cenicriviroc. NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was shown in patients treated with liraglutide, semaglutide and resmetirom. Lanifibranor achieved both surrogate histological endpoints. Five ongoing RCTs (5/62, 8.06%) will investigate histological progression to cirrhosis, death, or liver-related clinical outcomes.

To identify PRA genetic variants, three affected and 15 unaffected Shih Tzu and 20 non-Shih Tzu were recruited. Dogs underwent ophthalmologic examination and electroretinography, revealing hallmark retina pathological changes and an abnormal electroretinography in all affected dogs but not in unaffected dogs. WGS was performed. Non-synonymous homozygous variants were searched in coding regions of genes involved in retinal diseases/development; the criterion was that variants should only be present in affected dogs and should be absent in both unaffected and 46 genomes of dogs (from an available evolutionary database). Only one out of the 109 identified variants is predicted to harbor a high-impact consequence, a nonsense c.452A>C (p.L151X) in the JPH2 gene. The genotype of JPH2 variant in all 38 dogs was determined with Sanger sequencing. All three affected dogs, but none of the 35 unaffected, were homozygous for the nonsense variant. JPH2 has been previously found to be expressed in several excitable cells/tissues including retina photoreceptors.

However, it can cause severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. The pathomechanism of co-trimoxazole–induced SCAR remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to investigate the genetic predisposition of co-trimoxazole–induced SCAR. Methods: We conducted a multicountry case-control association study that included 151 patients with of co-trimoxazole–induced SCAR and 4631 population controls from Taiwan, Thailand, and Malaysia, as well as 138 tolerant controls from Taiwan. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for the patients and population controls from Taiwan; it further validated the results from Thailand and Malaysia. Results: The whole-genome sequencing study (43 case patients vs 507 controls) discovered that the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs41554616, which is located between the HLA-B and MICA loci, had the strongest association with co-trimoxazole–induced SCAR (P = 8.2 × 10−9; odds ratio [OR] = 7.7). There were weak associations of variants in co-trimoxazole–related metabolizing enzymes (CYP2D6, GSTP1, GCLC, N-acetyltransferase [NAT2], and CYP2C8). A replication study using HLA genotyping revealed that HLA-B∗13:01 was strongly associated with co-trimoxazole–induced SCAR (the combined sample comprised 91 case patients vs 2545 controls [P = 7.2 × 10−21; OR = 8.7]). A strong HLA association was also observed in the case patients from Thailand (P = 3.2 × 10−5; OR = 3.6) and Malaysia (P =. 002; OR = 12.8), respectively. A meta-analysis and phenotype stratification study further indicated a strong association between HLA-B∗13:01 and co-trimoxazole–induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (P = 4.2 × 10−23; OR = 40.1).

Culturally informed psychotherapy in Asian consultation-liaison psychiatry,"Della C.D., Teo D.C.L., Agiananda F., Nimnuan C.",2021-03-01,"Asia, Culturally Competent Care, Humans, Mental Disorders, Psychotherapy, Referral and Consultation, collectivism, consultation-liaison psychiatry, culture, psychotherapy, religion","Psychotherapy provides substantial benefits for patients with medical illness. Western-based psychotherapies are commonly practiced by consultation-liaison psychiatrists in Asia. Although such interventions benefit Asian patients, they are limited by their cultural applicability. Sociocultural factors shape the meaning, expression, and treatment of medical illnesses. In helping patients with medical problems, it is imperative that psychiatrists be mindful of the value of culture in their clinical work. The concept of the self, religion, spirituality, adaptation, coping, and defense mechanisms are all culturally determined. This article discusses how these concepts impact the practice of psychotherapy in the Asian consultation-liaison psychiatry setting. Currently, there is a dearth of systematic research about this subject matter. Most studies describe the application of Western-based psychotherapies for patients with medical illness with little input as to cultural modifications or implications of such interventions. The authors of this article identify culturally consonant psychotherapeutic techniques in the Asian consultation-liaison psychiatry context. Furthermore, they also propose general guidelines in the cultural adaptation of psychotherapy interventions or development of indigenous psychotherapies.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health
Photolytic fate of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water and treated wastewater exposed to sunlight,"Martin M.A., Sivaguru J., McEvoy J., Sonthiphand P., Khan E.",2021-06-01,"Breast Neoplasms, Female, Humans, Sunlight, Tamoxifen, Waste Water, Water, Cancer drug, Fate, Phototransformation by-products, Sunlight, Toxicity","Endoxifen is the main active metabolite of a common cytostatic drug, tamoxifen. Endoxifen has been recently detected in the final effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants. The antiestrogenic activity of endoxifen could bring negative effects to aquatic life if released to the water environment. This study elucidated the fate and susceptibility of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen (2 μg mL−1, 1:1 wt ratio between the two easily interchangeable isomers) in wastewater and receiving surface water to sunlight. Phototransformation by-products (PBPs) and their toxicity were determined. Sunlight reduced at least 83% of endoxifen concentration in wastewater samples, whereas in surface water samples, 60% of endoxifen was photodegraded after 180 min of the irradiation. In ultrapure water samples spiked with endoxifen, PBPs were mainly generated via con-rotatory 6π-photocyclization, followed by oxidative aromatization. These PBPs underwent secondary reactions leading to a series of PBPs with different molecular weights. Eight PBPs were identified and the toxicity analysis via the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool revealed that seven of these PBPs are more toxic than endoxifen itself. This is likely due to the formation of poly-aromatic core in the PBPs due to exposure to sunlight. Therefore, highly toxic PBPs may be generated if endoxifen is present in water and wastewater exposed to sunlight. The presence, fates and activities of these PBPs in surface water especially at locations close to treated wastewater discharge points should be investigated.","genergyal, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"
Multi-objective worker allocation optimisation in a multiple U-line system,"Chutima P., Chimrakhang J.",2021-01-01,"Design/methodology/approach, Differential evolutionary, Mathematical computation, Multi objective evolutionary algorithms, Non-dominated Sorting, Operational modes, Solution techniques, Worker allocations, Multi-objective optimisation, Multiple U-line, Pareto optimal, Worker allocation, Worker’s fatigue","Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate two operational modes of the worker allocation problem (WAP) in the multiple U-line system (MULS). Five objectives are optimised simultaneously for the most complicated operational modes, i.e. machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking. Besides, the benefits of using multiline workstations (MLWs) are investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The elite non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III (ENSDE III) algorithm is developed as a solution technique. Also, the largest remaining available time heuristic is proposed as a baseline in determining the number and utilisation of workers when the use of MLWs is not allowed. Findings: ENSDE III outperforms the cutting-edged multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III, under two key Pareto metrics, i.e. generational distance and inverted generational distance, regardless of the problem size. The best-found number of workers from ENSDE III is substantially lower than the upper bound. The MULS with MLWs requires fewer workers than the one without. Research limitations/implications: Although this research has extended several issues in the basic model of multiple U-line systems, some assumptions were used to facilitate mathematical computation as follows. The U-line system in this research assumed that all lines were produced only a single product. Besides, all workers were well-trained to gain the same skill. These assumptions could be extended in the future. Practical implications: The implication of this research is the benefits of multiline workstations (MLWs) used in the multiple U-line system. Instead of leaving each individual line to operate independently, all lines should be working in parallel through the use of MLWs to gain benefits in terms of worker reduction, balancing worker’s workload, higher system utilisation. Originality/value: This research is the first to address the WAP in the MULS with machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking modes. Worker’s fatigue due to standing and walking while working is incorporated into the model. The novel ENSDE III algorithm is developed to optimise the multi-objective WAP in a Pareto sense. The benefits of exploiting MLWs are also illustrated.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Both the mean NTCP and difference in the mean NTCP (ΔNTCP) between two treatment plans of different radiotherapy modalities were further evaluated and their CIs were assessed. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed in 322 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 215) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 107) treated with photon therapy. Dose-volume histograms of normal liver were reduced to mean liver dose (MLD) based on the fraction size-adjusted equivalent uniform dose. The most predictive variables were used to build the model based on multivariable logistic regression analysis with bootstrapping. Internal validation was performed using the cross-validation leave-one-out method. Both the mean NTCP and the mean ΔNTCP with 95% CIs were calculated from computationally generated multivariate random sets of NTCP model parameters using variance-covariance matrix information. RILD occurred in 108/322 patients (33.5%). The NTCP model with three clinical and one dosimetric parameter (tumor type, Child-Pugh class, hepatitis infection status and MLD) was most predictive, with an area under the receiver operative characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84). In eight clinical subgroups based on the three clinical parameters, both the mean NTCP and the mean ΔNTCP with 95% CIs were able to be estimated computationally. The multivariable NTCP model with the assessment of 95% CIs has potential to improve the reliability of the NTCP model-based approach to select the appropriate radiotherapy modality for each patient.","fluidex; related topics, medical",Medicine (all)

These features can be used as indicators of fluid expulsion through unconsolidated sediments within sedimentary basin-fills. The Great South Basin, New Zealand, is one such basin where paleo-pockmarks are observed at around 1,500 m below the seabed. This study aims to describe the characteristics of paleo-pockmarks in the Great South Basin. Numerous paleo-pockmarks are identified and imaged using three-dimensional seismic reflection data and hosted by fine-grained sediments of the Middle Eocene Laing Formation. The paleo-pockmarks are aligned in a southwest to northeast direction to form a fan-shaped distribution with a high density of around 67 paleo-pockmarks per square kilometre in the centre of the study area. The paleo-pockmarks in this area have a similar shape, varying from sub-rounded to a rounded planform shape, but vary in size, ranging from 138 to 481 m in diameter, and 15–45 ms (TWT) depth. The origin of the fluids that contributed to the paleo-pockmark formation is suggested, based on seismic observations, to be biogenic methane. The basin floor fan deposits beneath the interval hosting the paleo-pockmark might have enhanced fluid migration through permeable layers in this basin-fill. This model can help to explain pockmark formation in deep water sedimentary systems, and may inform future studies of fluid migration and expulsion in sediment sinks.","petroleum engineeringneering, tertiary, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

The roles of Notch signaling in proinflammatory macrophages are well characterized, whereas its involvement, if any, in IL-4-stimulated macrophages (M(IL-4)) is still unclear. We observed that Notch signaling is functional in human M(IL-4). We performed transcriptome analysis of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC1)-overexpressing human monocytic cell line THP-1 with or without IL-4 stimulation to understand the global impact of Notch signaling in M(IL-4). The results revealed that NIC1-overexpressing THP-1 upregulated proinflammatory-associated genes and target genes of IL-4 signaling. We identified serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as one of the genes increased by NIC1 overexpression in M(IL-4). To dissect the signaling pathway leading to SGK1 upregulation, we pretreated THP-1-derived macrophages with specific inhibitors of Notch (DAPT), AKT (LY294002) or ERK (U0126). Among these inhibitors, only LY294002 decreased the SGK1 mRNA levels in M(IL-4), indicating that the AKT pathway plays a key role in SGK1 transcription in M(IL-4). Furthermore, treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages with the SGK1 inhibitor (GSK650394) suppressed AKT phosphorylation, but not STAT6, in response to IL-4, indicating that SGK1 positively regulates AKT pathway in M(IL-4). Finally, GSK650394 treatment of human M(IL-4) increased the levels of PPARG mRNA and its protein, indicating a negative role of SGK1 in M(IL-4) function. Overall, we report that the Notch signaling and AKT pathways cooperatively regulate SGK1 expression in M(IL-4) where SGK1, in turn, plays an important role in suppressing IL-4-induced PPARγ expression.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; cells of the Immunologyne system; macrophages, mononuclear phagocytes, medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. Results: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001).

The acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper via reductive alkylation between the amine and the aldehyde groups. The fluorescence-based detection was performed by monitoring the fluorescence signal response of a fluorescent dye that selectively binds to the single-strand region of the DNA target over the PNA probe employing a custom-made portable fluorescent camera gadget in combination with a smartphone camera. Under the optimal conditions, a linear relationship between the fluorescence change in the green channel and the amount of HCV DNA from 5 to 100 pmol with a correlation coefficient of 0.9956, and the limit of detection of 5 pmol were obtained for short synthetic oligonucleotides. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over the single-base-mismatched, two-base-mismatched, and non-complementary DNA targets. Benefitting from the signal amplification achieved through the numerous binding sites for the dye provided by the overhanging tail of long ssDNA target sequences, this system was successfully applied to detect the HCV complementary DNA (cDNA) obtained from clinical samples with satisfactory results. The proposed fluorescent paper-based sensor demonstrated a great potential to be used as a low-cost, simple, label-free, sensitive, and selective DNA sensor for point-of-care applications.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

"Factors affecting technology selection, techno-economic and environmental sustainability assessment of a novel zero-waste system for food waste and wastewater management","Sakcharoen T., Ratanatamskul C., Chandrachai A.",2021-09-10,"Anaerobic co-digestion, Anaerobics, Building wastewater, Environmental sustainability, Food waste, MBBR-MBR, Techno-economics, Technology selection, Waste systems, Zero waste, Anaerobic digestion, Building wastewater, Food waste, MBBR-MBR, Sustainability, Zero-waste","To provide food waste energy recovery, sludge management and building wastewater recycling with the primary goal of achieving zero-waste discharge, a novel integrated single-stage anaerobic co-digestion and moving bed biofilm reaction membrane bioreactor system has been developed. The acceptability of the technology and the sustainability of the zero-waste system were assessed by a proposed stepwise evaluation approach that included the factors affecting its usage, technical performance, environmental sustainability and economic feasibility. Based on the three experimental cases of the system prototype, the anaerobic co-digestions of food waste and wastewater sludge (Cases 2 and 3) provided slightly higher methane generation rates than was achieved from the mono-digestion of food waste (Case 1). Average methane yields from the anaerobic co-digestion (Cases 2 and 3) were in the range of 0.352–0.353 L/g TVS. The ratios of VFA/Alk of all the experimental cases were lower than 0.25, indicating the stable anerobic co-digestion performances. The MBBR-MBR was able to achieve ammonia removal rate in the range of 0.34–0.77 g NH4/m2-day. The co-treatment of combined wastewater was able to provide good reclaimed water that was suitable for landscape use. Life cycle assessment results showed that the proposed zero-waste system could reduce the impacts of climate change, eutrophication, acidification, and fossil resource depletion compared to conventional waste treatment. The economic Internal Rate of Return, Net Present Value, and Benefit/Cost of the system were around 9%, 2222 USD, and 1.44, respectively. The challenges and opportunities from implementing the system were discussed.","energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Changing look AGN Mrk 590: Broad-line region and black hole mass from photometric reverberation mapping,"Mandal A.K., Schramm M., Rakshit S., Stalin C.S., Vijarnwannaluk B., Rujopakarn W., Poshyachinda S., Kouprianov V.V., Haislip J.B., Reichart D.E., Sagar R., Mathew B.",2021-12-01,"Accretion discs, Black hole mass, Broad line region, Continuum emission, Galaxies active, Galaxy:seyfert, Photometrics, Quasars: emission line, Red-shifted, Reverberation mapping, galaxies: Active, galaxies: Seyfert, quasars: emission lines","We present the results of photometric reverberation mapping observations on the changing look active galactic nucleus Mrk 590 at z = 0.026. The observations were carried out from 2018 July to December using broad-bandB-,R-, and narrow-band H α and S ii filters. The B band traces the continuum emission from the accretion disc, the R band encompasses both the continuum emission from the accretion disc and the redshifted H α line from the broad-line region (BLR), the S ii band contains the redshifted H α emission and the H α band traces the continuum emission underneath the S ii band. All the light curves showed strong variation with a fractional root-mean-square variation of 0.132 ± 0.001 in the B band and 0.321 ± 0.001 in H α line. From cross-correlation function analysis, we obtained a delayed response of H α line emission to the opticalB-band continuum emission of $21.44^{+1.49}_{-2.11}$ d in the rest frame of the source, corresponding to a linear size of the BLR of 0.018 pc. This is consistent with previous estimates using H β. By combining the BLR size with the H α line full width at half-maximum of 6478 ± 240 km s-1 measured from a single-epoch spectrum obtained with the Subaru telescope, we derived a black hole mass of $1.96^{+0.15}_{-0.21}\times 10^8 {\rm M}_{\odot }$.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

To design a fertilizer formula to boost its nutritional value, this research simultaneously studied the effects of significant cations among the macronutrients for plant growth (K, Mg and Ca) and the effects of the electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution on phenolic compound production and mass productivity of hydroponically grown red lettuce. RESULTS: Red lettuce grown under the control treatment provided the highest mass productivity (under low-stress conditions). The highest antioxidant content, measured as milligrams of phenolic compounds per gram dry weight (at a high-stress condition) via both Folin–Ciocalteu and HPLC analyses, was observed in growth media containing 100 ppmK : 20 ppm Mg : 70 ppm Ca (with EC equal to 1241 μS cm−1). It was found that EC within the range of this examination had no significant effect on the mass productivity or on phenolic compound productivity. The phenolic compound productivity, defined as the amount of phenolic compounds produced per unit of planting area per unit of time, was optimized with the optimum formula for maximum phenolic compound productivity of 90 ppm K : 29 ppm Mg : 77 ppm Ca, or a corresponding EC of 1307 μS cm−1. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that health-promoting nutrient production in red lettuce could be stimulated in a practical manner by adjusting the cation concentrations in fertilizer solution. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Biotechnology, Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Aim: To compare the anti-androgenic effects between spironolactone and cyproterone acetate as the component of feminizing hormone therapy among transgender women population. Methods: The study was single-blinded randomized controlled trial involved 52 transgender women from two transgender health clinics. Each participant received oral estradiol valerate 4 mg/day combined with anti-androgen, spironolactone 100 mg/day or cyproterone acetate 25 mg/day, depending on which group they were randomized to. Clinical and biochemical variables were obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks of feminizing hormone therapy. Main Outcome Measures: The change of testosterone level from baseline. Other changes including free testosterone, estradiol, prolactin and lipid profile after the therapy. Results: After a 12 weeks of feminizing hormone therapy, the change of testosterone level in the cyproterone acetate group [558.0 ng/dL (IQR 352.0 to 783.3)] was significantly higher than the spironolactone group [226.2 ng/dL (IQR,-4.3 to 480.1)](p value <0.001). Testosterone and calculated free testosterone in the cyproterone acetate group were significantly lower than the spironolactone group. Consequently, a proportion of the participants who achieved the female range testosterone (<50 ng/dL) was significantly higher in cyproterone acetate group (90%) compared to the spironolactone group (19%). Serious adverse effects observed in cyproterone acetate users were drug-induced liver injury and asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Clinical Implications: The data on the differences between the two anti-androgen could be benefit for the transgender health-care providers in medication selection and adverse-effects counseling. Strengths & Limitations: The study design was randomized controlled trial and controlled the estrogen component by prescribed the same type and dose for each participant. However, the study was suffered from the confound feminizing effects from previous hormone therapy and the high drop-out rate. Conclusion: For feminizing hormone therapy, cyproterone acetate had a higher testosterone suppression efficacy than spironolactone. Burinkul S, Panyakhamlerd K, Suwan A, et al.

Nanosilver reinforced Parmelia sulcata extract efficiently induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferative signalling in MCF-7 cells,"Gandhi A.D., Miraclin P.A., Abilash D., Sathiyaraj S., Velmurugan R., Zhang Y., Soontarapa K., Sen P., Sridharan T.B.",2021-08-01,"Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Humans, MCF-7 Cells, Metal Nanoparticles, Mice, NIH 3T3 Cells, Parmeliaceae, Plant Extracts, Silver, Anticancer activity, Apoptosis, Parmelia sulcata, Phenolic compounds, Silver nanoparticles","The Lichen, Parmelia sulcata synthesizes various secondary metabolites, in which phenolic based compounds received much attention due to their importance in biomedical application. Especially the phenolic compound was effective against the cancer treatment. An effective administration of such plant natural product can represent a significant conventional management of cancer in terms of chemoprevention. The nanomedicines are group of agents that selectively interfere the cancer cells which leads to reduction of side effect thereby reducing the doses. Silver nanoparticles is a promising antitumor agent, however, the conventional production of silver nanoparticles have many drawbacks which led to increase in need of eco-friendly biological production methods. In this study, we made an attempt to synthesise a nano silver (Ps-AgNPs) from phenolic extract of lichen Parmelia sulcata extract. The Ps-AgNps was applied for anticancer activity using MCF-7 cells and the effect was characterised by western blotting method. The FTIR, XRD, UV and TEM results confirms the presence of silver nanoparticles in phenolic extract of lichen Parmelia sulcata. The cytotoxicity assay shows that the Ps-AgNPs is toxic against cancer cells (MCF-7) but not to normal cells (NIH3T3), which confirm the selective induction of cell death (apoptosis) against cancer cells. The Western blot analysis also clearly indicates the down regulation of inflammatory genes (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and cell cycle genes (PCNA and Cyclin-D1) thus promoting intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The results suggest that Ps-AgNPs can effectively kill cancer cells and can be used as an alternative therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

The oxidation resistance tests of those specimens were carried out at 1173 K in air for 360 ks. The 5 wt.-% Cr-added specimen resulted in the best oxidation resistance with the lowest oxidation rate constant of 1.54 × 10-7 kg2 × m-4 × s-1. The oxidation products which formed inside the pores and on the surfaces of all specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectroscopic (SEM/ EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis techniques. The results show that the oxides forming on both inside pores and surfaces were identified as Cr2O3, Fe2O3, (Fe0.6Cr0.4)2O3, NiFe2O4 and NiCr2O4 in all tested conditions. The measured hardness of the modified specimens was in the range of 87-92 HRB, compared to the hardness of the 316 L specimen, which was 93 HRB.

The effect of the new nano-filler on the properties of resultant nanocomposites was determined from the characterization of mechanical properties, morphology, crystallinity, thermal stability, barrier properties, hydrophilicity, conductivity, antibacterial property, and biodegradability. The results showed that MPBAT nanocomposites had stronger mechanical properties, better barrier properties, and higher electrical conductivity than PBAT nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy illustrated that MWCNT-ZnO had better compatibility with MPBAT than with PBAT. At 0.2% MWCNT-ZnO, the MPBAT/MWCNT-ZnO nanocomposite film exhibited the greatest mechanical properties (17.74% increase in tensile strength, 22.17% in yield strength, and 14.29% in elongation at break). When the MWCNT-ZnO content was 0.4%, the nanocomposite film demonstrated the best water vapor barrier ability (an increase of 30.4%). The MPBAT/MWCNT-ZnO film with 0.6% MWCNT-ZnO turned out to have the best oxygen barrier performance (an increase of 130% relative to pure PBAT). It was shown from the results of antibacterial evaluation that the new nanomaterial could impart PBAT and MPBAT with antibacterial activity. The biodegradability tests indicated that an MWCNT-ZnO content of 0.2% could slightly reduce the biodegradability, and when the content was higher than 0.2%, the weight loss rate would increase.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The skin is the most commonly involved organ in GVHD. Elafin, a protease inhibitor overexpressed in inflamed epidermis, was previously identified as a diagnostic biomarker of skin GVHD; however, this finding was restricted to a subset of patients with isolated skin GVHD. The main driver of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in HCT recipients is gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD. Two biomarkers, Regenerating islet-derived 3a (REG3α) and Suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 (ST2), have been validated as biomarkers of GI GVHD that predict long-term outcomes in patients treated for GVHD. We undertook this study to determine the utility of elafin as a prognostic biomarker in the general population of acute GVHD patients in whom GVHD may develop in multiple organs. We analyzed serum elafin concentrations as a predictive biomarker of acute GVHD outcomes and compared it with ST2 and REG3α in a large group of patients treated at multiple centers. A total of 526 patients from the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) who had received corticosteroid treatment for skin GVHD and who had not been previously studied were analyzed. Serum concentrations of elafin, ST2, and REG3α were measured by ELISA in all patients. The patients were divided at random into equal training and validation sets, and a competing-risk regression model was developed to model 6-month NRM using elafin concentration in the training set. Additional models were developed using concentrations of ST2 and REG3α or the combination of all 3 biomarkers as predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the validation set to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model and to stratify patients into high- and low-risk biomarker groups. The cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM, overall survival (OS), and 4-week treatment response were compared between the risk groups. Unexpectedly, patients in the low-risk elafin group demonstrated a higher incidence of 6-month NRM, although the difference was not statistically significant (17% versus 11%; P = .19). OS at 6 months (68% versus 68%; P > .99) and 4-week response (78% versus 78%; P = .98) were similar in the low-risk and high-risk elafin groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.55 for elafin and 0.75 for the combination of ST2 and REG3α. The addition of elafin to the other 2 biomarkers did not improve the AUC. Our data indicate that serum elafin concentrations measured at the initiation of systemic treatment for acute GVHD did not predict 6-month NRM, OS, or treatment response in a multicenter population of patients treated systemically for acute GVHD. As seen in previous studies, serum concentrations of the GI GVHD biomarkers ST2 and REG3α were significant predictors of NRM, and the addition of elafin levels did not improve their accuracy. These results underscore the importance of GI disease in driving NRM in patients who develop acute GVHD.","medical, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Molecular Medicine, Hematology, Cell Biology, Transplantation"

However, there are no reports on the effects of andrographolide on the human suprapatellar fat pad of osteoarthritis patients. In the present study, our goal was to evaluate the innovative effects of andrographolide on viability and Tri-lineage differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells from suprapatellar fat pad tissues. The results revealed that andrographolide had no cytotoxic effects when the concentration was less than 12.5 µM. Interestingly, andrographolide had significantly enhanced, dose dependent, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis as evidenced by a significantly intensified stain for Alizarin Red S, Toluidine Blue and Alcian Blue. Moreover, andrographolide can upregulate the expression of genes related to osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, including Runx2, OPN, Sox9, and Aggrecan in mesenchymal stem cells from human suprapatellar fat pad tissues. In contrast, andrographolide suppressed adipogenic differentiation as evidenced by significantly diminished Oil Red O staining and expression levels for adipogenic-specific genes for PPAR-γ2 and LPL. These findings confirm that andrographolide can specifically enhance osteogenesis and chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells from human suprapatellar fat pad tissues. It has potential as a therapeutic agent derived from natural sources for regenerative medicine.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Two plasma gases (oxygen and argon), two grafting chloroalkylsilanes (methyltrichlorosilane [MTCS] and trimethylchlorosilane [TMCS]), and a range of grafting times (0.5–4 h) were investigated. Hydrophobicity enhancement was influenced by the modification conditions including the type of plasma gas, the applied voltage and pressure, the number of plasma treatment shots, and the grafting agent and duration. The results revealed that oxygen-plasma activation was more effective than argon plasma for functionalizing MTCS for hydrophobicity enhancement. The hydrophobicity increased with MTCS grafting but not with TMCS grafting. Successful membrane modification using MTCS was confirmed by the presence of silicon using FT-IR and EDX analysis. Modifying membranes greatly increased the water contact angle, from 74.7° to 125.3° after activation by 2 shots of oxygen plasma under 10 kV/0.3 mbar followed by grafting with MTCS for 4 h. The duration of the exposure of the membranes to ozone determined the membrane properties. The modified membrane also had a higher and more stable ozone flux than the original membrane. Using the modified membrane, DB 71 decolorization by ozonation with membrane contactor was almost complete after 90 min. COD and TOC removals were 63% and 20%, respectively. This study demonstrates that membrane modification via PICP grafted with MTCS has the potential to improve hydrophobicity and membrane contactor applications.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; chemistryical, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biochemistry, Materials Science (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

Additionally, the IT-OHI program's protective effect was more substantial among the male participants at 12 weeks post-intervention (odds ratio = 0.094, P =.027) than among the females. Conclusion: The IT-OHI program had partial effectiveness in improving gingival health and reducing dental plaque accumulation in a group of Thai people with physical disabilities; however, the long-term impact remains unclear.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
Patient dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA I&T in metastatic prostate cancer treatment: the experience in Thailand,"Chatachot K., Shiratori S., Chaiwatanarat T., Khamwan K.",2021-11-01,"Humans, Male, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, Radiometry, 177Lu-PSMA I&T, MIRD scheme, Radionuclide therapy, Theranostics","Purpose: This study aimed to determine the radiation dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA imaging and therapy (I&T) in Thai patients who were treated for metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: Whole-body planar images acquired at immediately, 4 and 24 h after 177Lu-PSMA I&T injection (range 4.44–8.51 GBq) were collected from 12 treatment cycles of 8 prostate cancer patients. Region of interests (ROIs) were manually contoured on the whole-body, liver, spleen, urinary bladder, lacrimal glands, parotid, and submandibular glands to determine time-integrated activity (TIA) in source organs and fitted time-activity curves using mono-exponential extrapolation. The S values calculated utilizing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) computational phantoms were extracted from the OLINDA/EXM v. 2.0 to calculate the absorbed dose coefficient in target organs according to the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) scheme. The absorbed doses to bone marrow were estimated using the planar two-compartment image-based method by separating the high-uptake and low-uptake compartment. The spherical model was used to calculate the lacrimal gland absorbed doses. Results: Mean absorbed dose coefficients to the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, urinary bladder, spleen, lacrimal glands, parotid, and submandibular glands were 0.81 ± 0.24, 0.02 ± 0.01, 0.13 ± 0.10, 0.27 ± 0.25, 0.16 ± 0.07, 3.62 ± 1.78, 0.21 ± 0.14, and 0.09 ± 0.07 Gy/GBq, respectively. Dose constraints for the kidneys (23 Gy) and bone marrow (2 Gy) were not reached in any patients. The absorbed dose in lacrimal glands calculated by the NURBS computational phantoms was slightly lower than the calculation based on the Cristy–Eckerman computational phantoms using OLINDA/EXM v. 1.0 by 6.37 ± 0.14%. Conclusion: Dosimetry results in this study suggested that 177Lu-PSMA I&T treatment with higher activities and more cycles is possible without the risk of damaging normal organs in prostate cancer patients.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

We describe a 19-year-old mother with untreated syphilis who delivered a male neonate with low birth weight, skin desquamation, and pneumonia. Placenta examination showed the expected changes for syphilis but unexpectedly, also showed MPFD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MPFD associated with placental syphilis, thus expanding the list of etiologies that may be related to MPFD/MFI. It is postulated that the syphilis infection in our case led to a hypercoaguable state, eventually resulting in MPFD. In the right clinical setting, syphilis might be considered in the differential diagnosis when MPFD/MFI is observed on placental examination. The recurrence risk of MFPD/MFI associated with infections is believed to be lower than idiopathic cases and, by extrapolation, this lower risk should apply to syphilis as well.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Pathology and Forensic Medicine"

Material and Methods: Sixty dentin discs were randomly assigned into 3 groups, then brushed for 1 min with CSPS, arginine, or fluoride (control) dentifrices. To test acid tolerance, each disc was soaked in 6% citric acid for 1 min. Dentin permeability was measured before, following brushing, and acid challenge. Ten discs per group were similarly treated and evaluated for tubule occlusion following a single dentifrice application, while other five discs per group were employed in an acid tolerance assay. Results: The percentage reduction in dentin permeability was 39.26%, 32.27%, and 21.71% in the arginine, CSPS, and control groups, respectively. The differences in dentin permeability reduction between the arginine and CSPS groups following brushing and acid challenge were not significant (p = 0.398 and p = 0.211, respectively). The arginine dentifrice demonstrated a significant reduction in permeability compared with the control (p = 0.011). In addition, the occlusion exhibited by the arginine and CSPS dentifrices was more resistant to acid challenge compared with that of the control (p < 0.001). From SEM analysis, dentinal tubule occlusion was observed after a single application in all groups. Some open dentinal tubules were detected in the test groups, while almost all of the orifices were open in the fluoride group following acid challenge. Conclusions: There is no significant difference between arginine and CSPS dentifrices in reducing dentin permeability following a single application and acid challenge. Following acid challenge, the reduced permeability generated by arginine and CSPS was more stable compared with the fluoride dentifrice.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

No studies investigated the association between the enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and DS and its phenomenology. Methods In this case-control study, Thai women and men, aged 18 to 65 years, were divided in DS (n = 40) and NDS (n = 40) and were compared to controls (n = 40). PON1 activities against 4-(chloromethyl)phenyl acetate (CMPA) and phenylacetate were determined. Moreover, subjects were genotyped for their PON1 Q192R polymorphism and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels responses directed to Gram-negative bacteria were measured. Results DS is significantly associated with the QQ genotype and the Q allele as compared with NDS and controls. PON1 activities are significantly and inversely associated with negative symptoms, formal thought disorders, psychomotor retardation, excitation and DS. The presence of the Q allele is associated with increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas putida as compared with RR carriers. Conclusions The PON1 Q allele and lower PON1 activities especially against CMPA are associated with DS, indicating lowered quorum quenching abilities as well as lowered defenses against lipoperoxidation and immune activation. It is suggested that lowered PON1 activity in DS constitutes an impairment in the innate immune system which together with lowered natural IgM may cause lower immune regulation thereby predisposing toward greater neurotoxic effects of immune-inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative pathways and Gram-negative microbiota.",medical,"Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Due to its toxic effects on the organisms, it has been classified as the highest priority pollutant. It has been observed that DBP can leach out from the landfill and other related sites. This plasticizer ultimately reaches the soil, entering the food chain. Although phthalate esters biodegradation have been reported for different bacteria. But bacteria from the genus Acinetobacter have various advantages as compared to others. They are much more efficient in removal of organic pollutants from the contaminated environments. Therefore, Acinetobacter sp.33F have been selected in the study. This study is focused on DBP biodegradation kinetics by Acinetobacter sp.33F in pristine agricultural soils. The study also compared the results with DBP biodegradation kinetics in minimal media. Biodegradation kinetics studies were performed at 100–2000 mg/L. To model DBP biodegradation kinetics, non-linear models were used. Monod paradigm was used to explain DBP degradation kinetics in minimal medium. The observed values for μmax and Ks were 0.0083 (mg/L/h) and 30.57 mg/L. Non-linear Haldane inhibition model was used to explain DBP degradation kinetics in the agricultural soils. μmax, Ks, and Ki were 0.02008 ± 0.002 (mg/L/h), 176.5 ± 2.3 mg/L and 433.7 ± 3.0 mg/L. This study also demonstrated that Acinetobacter sp.33F could utilize diethyl phthalate (DEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-octyl phthalate (DIOP), and di-decyl phthalate (DIDP) as sole carbon source. The above properties make Acinetobacter sp. 33F a promising candidate for phthalate esters removal from the contaminated agricultural sites.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Science (all), Soil Science, Plant Science"

Molecular characteristics of DOM removed by adsorbents were investigated semiquantitatively and unknown disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potentials were also investigated. Adsorbents were modified using ferric nitrate to increase the magnetic property. The XRD pattern showed Fe-containing crystalline structures in the modified adsorbent (M-CF). The M-CF possessed higher mesopore volume, which enhanced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiency to 74.50% (compared to 32.12% in the unmodified CF adsorbent). The kinetics experiment showed that both adsorbents were better fitted to pseudo-second orders than pseudo-first orders. The initial rate constant was higher in M-CF (1.40 mg/g min) than in CF (0.02 mg/g min) treatments due to the higher mesopore volume in M-CF. M-CF removed almost 700 carbon‑hydrogen‑oxygen based DOMs (CHO features), 300 more CHO features than CF. CF selectively adsorbed only higher-molecular-weight (MW) CHO features (more CH2 groups), while the mesopores in M-CF removed DOM with lower MW (fewer CH2 groups) that were refractory to CF. The low MW DOM removed only by M-CF mesopore exhibited more oxidized (positive carbon oxidation state, Cos) and saturated characters (negative oxygen-subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon, (DBE-O)/C). After chlorination, over 50 unknown DBPs were detected, 33 of which were commonly found in all samples. M-CF decreased unknown formation potential more than CF. However, adsorption of M-CF and CF before chlorination resulted in different remaining precursors to water chlorination and formed unique DBPs from those precursors.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a well-known antioxidant that can exert growth or inhibitory biological effects in normal or pathological tissues leading to disease prevention. The effects of EGCG in the various SG epithelial compartments are poorly understood during homeostasis and upon radiation (IR) injury. This study aims to: (1) determine whether EGCG can support epithelial proliferation during homeostasis; and (2) investigate what epithelial cells are protected by EGCG from IR injury. Ex vivo mouse SG were treated with EGCG from 7.5–30 µg/mL for up to 72 h. Next, SG epithelial branching morphogenesis was evaluated by bright-field microscopy, immunofluorescence, and gene expression arrays. To establish IR injury models, linear accelerator (LINAC) technologies were utilized, and radiation doses optimized. EGCG epithelial effects in these injury models were assessed using light, confocal and electron microscopy, the Griess assay, immunohistochemistry, and gene arrays. SG pretreated with EGCG 7.5 µg/mL promoted epithelial proliferation and the development of pro-acinar buds and ducts in regular homeostasis. Furthermore, EGCG increased the populations of epithelial progenitors in buds and ducts and pro-acinar cells, most probably due to its observed antioxidant activity after IR injury, which prevented epithelial apoptosis. Future studies will assess the potential for nanocarriers to increase the oral bioavailability of EGCG.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Cannabinoids are one of the potential agents under investigation. The present study aimed to examine the evidence concerning the effectiveness of cannabinoids for the treatment of dementia. Methods: We undertook a systematic review complying to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were searched including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO. Results: Five studies evaluated the use of cannabinoids for anorexia and agitation in dementia. One study used dronabinol 5 mg/day to target anorexic symptoms of dementia which positively impacted on weight. Results of two trials investigating the effectiveness of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 1.5–4.5 mg/day for the treatment of agitation indicated no significant differences between THC and placebo. The most recent trial reported significant improvement in agitation using nabilone at 1–2 mg/day. However, levels of evidence of these agents were rated as low and very low because of low sample size and methodology issues. No studies were available that investigated the use of cannabinoids to moderate cognitive symptoms in dementia. Conclusions: Findings from a few robust randomized controlled trials suggest that nabilone might be useful for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, but there is no convincing evidence for THC. Additional studies are needed to further clarify and assess the benefits of these treatments. Clinical Implications: There were no randomized controlled trials investigating the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of cognitive decline in dementia. Studies on THC reported no significant improvement in agitation. It may be too early to postulate that cannabinoids have any effect on dementia symptoms or their progression.","psychology, sociology, Nursing, medical","Social Psychology, Health (social science), Clinical Psychology, Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

The use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is a proven and cost-effective intervention preventing malaria among pregnant women. The present study aimed to explore predictors of knowledge and use of LLINs among pregnant women in Pakistan. Methods: This was part of a quasi-experimental study of 200 pregnant women conducted in a rural district of Sindh province in Pakistan. Data were collected using Malaria Indicator Survey questionnaires developed by Roll Back Malaria Partnership to end Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group. Pregnant women and mothers with newborns of six months of age were interviewed in their homes. Results: The age of the women was from 18 to 45, two thirds of the respondents (72.5%) were uneducated and married (77%). Majority (92%) of the women had received antenatal care during pregnancy, and 29.5% women had received counseling on malaria during their antenatal care visits. Multiple linear regression showed that the type of latrine was the most significant (β = 0.285, p < 0.001) determinant of knowledge about malaria among pregnant women followed by the death of a newborn (β = 0.271, p < 0.001). The use of mobile phone was the most significant (β = 0.247, p < 0.001) predictor of usage of LLINs among pregnant women followed by the death of a newborn (β = 0.232, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Maternal education, type of latrine, use of mobile phone, malaria during previous pregnancy and newborn death were strong predictors of knowledge and use of LLINs in pregnant women in Pakistan. There is a need to scale-up programmes that aim to create awareness regarding malaria among pregnant women. Mobile phone technology can be used to implement awareness programmes focusing on malaria prevention among women.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

PLA-grafted-maleic anhydride (PLA-g-MA) synthesized via reactive maleation and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) were used as compatibilizers for these blends. Improvements in the toughness, phase morphology and thermal behavior of the PLA/PBAT/TEC (PBT) blend films were evaluated in terms of compatibilization effect. The compatibilized PBT blends showed noticeably superior tensile strength, elongation, and tensile-impact toughness compared with uncompatibilized ones due to the greater compatibility of PLA and PBAT phases. Well dispersed PBAT particles and many elongated fibrils were observed on the fracture surface of the film after compatibilization. Both TDI and PLA-g-MA were effective compatibilizers for the blend at an appropriate level. The addition of PLA-g-MA to the plasticized blends not only significantly enhanced mechanical properties and phase adhesion, but also accelerated cold crystallization and formed crystal perfection, a result of improvements in chain mobility and packing efficiency. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed changes in Tg and melting behavior of the blends from influences of compatibilization. The different types and levels of compatibilizer affected the thermal stability of the PLA phase but did not affect char remaining.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Odoo is an open-source ERP software that brings together necessary modules for various business management and a Python web framework which allows developers to develop a module to extend the capability of Odoo. In recent years, software development on Odoo usually requires time to learn due to the complexity of the framework. Therefore, a platform developed using low-code development-a concept of software creation with less code writing-was proposed. This platform is a web-based application tool that generates codes for developers to assist them in creating modules with less concern about errors and more focus on the logical side of programming. Developers can also use this application as a tool to validate and generate a source code for a ready-to-use module. This application was tested with non-Odoo users, Odoo users, and Odoo developers with various models containing various fields. Time efficiency between three types of users was compared, as well as time efficiency between generating a module using the conventional method and using the low-code concept module generator. The result revealed that using this application could reduce time by 20% on average.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics, sociology","Decision Sciences (miscellaneous), Automotive Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization, Transportation"

Methods: A prospective, randomised trial of EI versus IB of PTZ was conducted in children aged 1 month to 18 years. The PTZ dose was 100 mg/kg intravenously every 8 h. Patients were randomly assigned to receive EI (4-h infusion) or IB (30-min infusion). The primary outcome that was measured was plasma piperacillin Cmid. Results: Ninety patients with a median age (IQR) of 48 months (16–127) were enrolled. The most common indication for PTZ use was pneumonia (32.2%). Geometric mean (95% CI) plasma piperacillin Cmid of EI versus IB was 51.9 mg/L (40.6–66.6) versus 6.0 mg/L (4.2–8.6) (P < 0.01).

One of the drawbacks is that their codes are confined to vendor-specific primitives. It is inefficient to implement a PicoBlaze processor on non-Xilinx FPGA devices. In this paper we propose a systematic approach that transforms primitive-level designs (firm-cores) to vendor independent designs (soft-cores), while modularising them during the process. This makes modification and implementation of designs on any FPGA devices possible. To demonstrate the idea, our soft-core version of PicoBlaze is implemented on a Lattice iCE40LP1k FPGA device and is shown to be fully compatible with the original PicoBlaze macro. Rigorous verification mechanisms have been employed to ensure the validity of the porting process; therefore, the quality of transformation matches the industry expectation.","logic elements, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Hardware and Architecture"

However, applying surfactants in excess concentrations could make oil recovery difficult. Moreover, residual surfactants in soil are toxic to microorganisms and plants. Thus, it is crucial to identify a suitable surfactant concentration for soil washing applications. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil minerals (quartz and kaolin) and organic matter (OM) on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of polyethoxylated sorbitan ester surfactants (Tween 20, 40, 60, and 80) and its effect on diesel removal from diesel-contaminated soil by soil washing. The results showed that Tween surfactants with shorter carbon chain lengths required higher CMC for diesel removal from quartz, while those with longer chains needed higher CMC for kaolin cleanup. FTIR results illustrated that oxygenated functional groups of Tween surfactants played an important role in their adsorption on quartz, while alkyl chains of Tween surfactants were responsible for their adsorption on kaolin. At a certain OM concentration, quartz and OM exhibited antagonistic effects, resulting in CMC reduction. In soil washing application, maximum diesel removal could be achieved from kaolin, in the presence of which surfactants exhibited the highest CMC. Based on FTIR results, the adsorbed surfactant could reduce the hydrophobicity of the kaolin surface, thus preventing the re-deposition of detached diesel.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Even though a demand for 2AP has been continuously increasing in global markets, its instability is a significant problem for commercial and food applications. Beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) has been extensively used to improve the stability, solubility, and sensorial properties of many hydrophobic and volatile compounds via an encapsulation process into its hydrophobic inner cavity. In this work, molecular complexation between 2AP and βCDs (hydroxypropyl (HP) and methyl (M) analogs) was theoretically and experimentally investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area-based free energy calculation, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Triplicate 500 ns MD simulations revealed that, among six studied βCDs, only 6-HPβCD and 2,6-DMβCD derivatives could stably form inclusion complexes with 2AP, driven mainly by van der Waals interactions. The pyrroline ring of 2AP was preferentially embedded in the hydrophobic interior of 2,6-DMβCD, whereas the pyrroline and acetyl moieties of 2AP were freely rotated inside 6-HPβCD along the simulation times. The binding affinity, the compactness, and the number of atomic contacts of 2AP/2,6-DMβCD complex were higher than those of 2AP/6-HPβCD system, in good agreement with the highest remaining 2AP in the 2AP/2,6-DMβCD complex from GC–MS result. Altogether, the obtained theoretical and experimental data demonstrated the good potentiality of 2,6-DMβCD as suitable host molecule for 2AP encapsulation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Recently, oXiris® haemofilter (Baxter, IL, USA) has been introduced as a novel haemofilter to mitigate inflammatory response during sepsis-associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. In the present case series, the researchers retrospectively reviewed critically ill patients with septic shock with the use of at least one oXiris haemofilter during continuous renal replacement therapy between June 2015 and December 2017. The timing for oXiris initiation was at the nephrologists’ discretion. The impact of oXiris haemofilter was evaluated on mean arterial pressure, vasopressor dosage, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, lactate and base excess during 72 h after treatment. Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the study. An improvement of haemodynamic status was found, shown by increased mean arterial pressure by 6.1% (p = 0.35), decreased norepinephrine dose by 45.9% (p = 0.02), inotropic score by 26.4% (p = 0.02) and vasopressor dependency index by 40.5% (p = 0.01). Cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores significantly decreased over 72 h (p = 0.02). Blood lactate levels and base excess also showed statistically significant improvements. The median filter lifetime was 23 (interquartile range = 14–36) hours. The intensive care unit mortality was 82.9%. Treatment with oXiris was safe and well-tolerated with no device-related adverse events. In conclusion, continuous renal replacement therapy with oXiris haemofilter is safe and may improve haemodynamic parameters in septic patients with severe renal dysfunction. Nonetheless, these findings were drawn from a retrospective analysis without a control group, and therefore cannot be generalised. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.","fluidex; related topics, medical, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Medicine (miscellaneous), Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

As the production process of alpha methyl ester sulfonate involves several chemical reactions at a high-temperature condition, the energy used in this process is considerably high. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to increase heat recovery of the alpha methyl ester sulfonate process and to find an optimal process condition subjecting to product properties. Models based on Aspen Plus and further developed with the Aspen Energy Analyzer program have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of a heat transfer process. A heat exchange process has been proposed to reduce energy consumption and to recover the heat lost with additional heat exchanger network. In addition, this work has studied production process conditions with different coolant conditions, varying sulfur flow rates, and different airflow ratios.

Over 60% of world copper output comes from porphyry copper ores while E-waste(s) is globally the largest copper-bearing waste category since the 1980s. They also contain critical elements for low-carbon technologies essential in the clean energy transition's success. In this review, a critical analysis of ore distribution/processing, metal extraction, E-waste generation and E-waste recycling is presented, focusing on identifying challenges and how to address them with emerging technologies and sustainable socio-environmental strategies. Access to ore deposits is a major hurdle for mine development while the absence of a consistent E-waste classification and legislation, including poor collection rates, remains serious problems in E-waste recycling. As lower grade porphyry ores are exploited, difficulties in processing/extraction due to mineralogical complexities, very fine particles and the generation of “dirty” concentrates will become more prevalent. For E-wastes recycling, current trends are to develop smaller, more mobile, and eco-friendly hydrometallurgical alternatives to pyrometallurgy that can handle localised compositional and feed variabilities. Finally, more sustainable mine waste management strategies, including better LCIA tools with spatial and temporal dimensions, are needed to limit socio-environmental impacts of resources exploitation and maintain the sector's SLO.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Economics","Waste Management and Disposal, Economics and Econometrics"

We aimed to explore the relationship between weather variables and dengue and to analyse transmission hotspots and coldspots at the district-level. Poisson probability distribution of the generalized linear model (GLM) was used to examine the association between the monthly weather variable data and the reported number of dengue cases from January 2002 to December 2018 and geographic information system (GIS) for dengue hotspot analysis. Results showed a significant association between the environmental variables and dengue incidence when comparing e the seasons. Temperature, sea-level pressure and wind speed had the highest coefficients, i.e. β=0.17, β= –0.12 and β= –0.11 (P<0.001), respectively. The risk of dengue incidence occurring during the rainy season was almost twice as high as that during monsoon. Statistically significant spatial clusters of dengue cases were observed all through the province in different years. Nabon was identified as a hotspot, while Pak Phanang was a coldspot for dengue fever incidence, explained by the fact that the former is a rubber-plantation hub, while the agricultural plains of the latter lend themselves to the practice of pisciculture combined with rice farming.

A phase II trial enrolled 36 HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive participants in Thailand to receive standard-of-care antiretroviral therapy (ART), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/efavirenz (Atripla), with 100 or 200 mg of BIT225 or placebo (daily) for 12 weeks. Combined treatment with BIT225 and ART was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with antiviral efficacy comparable to that of ART alone. The secondary end point-soluble CD163, a marker of monocyte/macrophage inflammation-was noted to be significantly decreased in the BIT225 arm. Plasma-derived activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and interleukin 21 were increased in those treated with BIT225. These findings are consistent with inhibition of the known effects of HIV Vpu and may reflect clinically important modulation of inflammatory and immune function. Further clinical study is planned to both confirm and extend these important findings in treatment-naive, and treatment-experienced individuals. Clinical Trials Registration.

Hyperglycemia and the imbalance of hormones are factors that contribute to the molecular link between DM and carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Hyperglycemia alone or in combination with hyperinsulinemia are key factors that promote cancer aggressiveness. Many preclinical studies suggest that high glucose induces abnormal energy metabolism and aggressive cancer via several mechanisms. As evidenced by clinical studies, hyperglycemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients who have comorbid DM. The prognoses of cancer patients with DM are improved when their plasma glucose levels are controlled. This suggests that high glucose level maybe be involved in the molecular mechanism that causes the link between DM and cancer and may also be useful for prognosis of cancer progression. This review comprehensively summarizes the evidence from recent pre-clinical and clinical studies of the impact of hyperglycemia on cancer advancement as well as the underlying molecular mechanism for this impact. Awareness among clinicians of the association between hyperglycemia or DM and cancer progression may improve cancer treatment outcome in patients who have DM.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Drug Discovery, Genetics (clinical)"

scintillator (LS) for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 t LS sample was produced in a pilot plant at Daya Bay. The optical properties of the new LS in various compositions were studied by replacing the gadolinium-loaded LS in one antineutrino detector. The concentrations of the fluor, PPO, and the wavelength shifter, bis-MSB, were increased in 12 steps from 0.5 g/L and <0.01 mg/L to 4 g/L and 13 mg/L, respectively. The numbers of total detected photoelectrons suggest that, with the optically purified solvent, the bis-MSB concentration does not need to be more than 4 mg/L. To bridge the one order of magnitude in the detector size difference between Daya Bay and JUNO, the Daya Bay data were used to tune the parameters of a newly developed optical model. Then, the model and tuned parameters were used in the JUNO simulation. This enabled to determine the optimal composition for the JUNO LS: purified solvent LAB with 2.5 g/L PPO, and 1 to 4 mg/L bis-MSB.","fluidex; related topics, physics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics, Instrumentation"

Recent studies link urinary EVs (uEV) to diverse processes such as infection and rejection after kidney transplantation. This, and the unmet need for biomarkers diagnosing kidney transplant dysfunction, has led to the current high level of interest in uEV. uEV provide non-intru-sive access to local protein, DNA, and RNA analytics without invasive biopsy. To determine the added value of uEV measurements for detecting allograft dysfunction after kidney transplantation, we systematically included all related literature containing directly relevant information, with the addition of indirect evidence regarding urine or kidney injury without transplantation. According to their varying characteristics, uEV markers after transplantation could be categorized into kidney-specific, donor-specific, and immune response-related (IR-) markers. A few convincing studies have shown that kidney-specific markers (PODXL, ion cotransporters, SYT17, NGAL, and CD133) and IR-markers (CD3, multi-mRNA signatures, and viral miRNA) could diagnose rejection, BK virus-associated nephropathy, and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity after kidney transplantation. In addition, some indirect proof regarding donor-specific markers (donor-derived cell-free DNA) in urine has been demonstrated. Together, this literature review provides directions for exploring novel uEV markers’ profiling complications after kidney transplantation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Properties of fresh and hardened composites were measured, and tests were conducted to determine their microstructure characteristics. Highlighted properties including slump flow, bleeding, unit weight, unconfined compressive strength, and resilience modulus were reported. The results indicated that the inclusion of 10%-30% slag resulted in a stronger CLSM with a higher Ca/Si ratio in the cementitious matrix of its microstructure. Higher slag content in the CLSM also shortened setting time and led to a lower bleeding rate. A mixture containing slag up to 20% of fly ash was recommended for pavement applications. Finally, the economic and environmental impacts were also preliminarily studied.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"

The causes and consequences of this lipid paradox are explored. Circulating activated neutrophils can release inflammatory molecules such as myeloperoxidase and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Since activated neutrophils are associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it seems reasonable to hypothesise that the inflammatory molecules released by them may act as mediators of the link between systemic inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis in neuroprogressive disorders. This hypothesis is tested by considering the association at a molecular level of systemic inflammation with increased LDL oxidation; increased small dense LDL levels; increased lipoprotein (a) concentration; secretory phospholipase A2 activation; cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation; increased platelet activation; decreased apolipoprotein A1 levels and function; decreased paroxonase-1 activity; hyperhomocysteinaemia; and metabolic endotoxaemia.

Carbetocin is a long-acting oxytocin-like compound that has been introduced to domestic animal obstetrics. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of carbetocin administration during the mid-period of parturition on farrowing duration as well as colostrum and milk production and its side effects on neonatal piglet characteristics in hyperprolific sows. The study included 89 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows and 1534 piglets. Sows were randomly distributed into two groups: CONTROL (n = 46), where sows were allowed to farrow naturally, and TREATMENT (n = 43), where sows were administered 0.5 μg/kg carbetocin intramuscularly after the birth of the 7th piglet. In each litter, the piglets were classified into two groups according to birth order: 1–7 and ≥8. The colostrum yield of sows and the colostrum intake of each individual piglet were calculated. Litter weight gain of the piglets from 3 to 5 days of lactation was used to estimate milk yield. Farrowing duration tended to be reduced from 338.4 ± 35.2 min in the CONTROL group to 255.3 ± 36.4 min in the TREATMENT group (P = 0.105). However, the colostrum yield in the TREATMENT group was lower than that in the CONTROL group (3828 ± 149 and 3041 ± 158 g, respectively, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, milk yield during 3–5 days of lactation in the TREATMENT group did not differ significantly compared to that in the CONTROL group (7.53 ± 0.01 and 7.54 ± 0.01 kg/day, respectively, P = 0.643). The incidence of stillbirths in the TREATMENT group was not significantly different from that in the CONTROL group (8.3 and 7.4%, respectively, P = 0.944). However, the incidence of piglets born with umbilical cord rupture in the TREATMENT group with birth order ≥8 was higher than that in the CONTROL group in the same birth order (16.6 and 5.7%, P < 0.001). Across groups, colostrum intake of piglets born with birth order ≥8 was lower than that of piglets born in the birth orders 1–7 (187.4 ± 8.7 and 241.5 ± 9.0 g, P < 0.001). Interestingly, the colostrum intake of piglets with birth orders 1–7 in the TREATMENT group was also lower than that of piglets with the same birth order in the CONTROL group (214.9 ± 12.9 and 268.1 ± 12.5 g, respectively, P = 0.003). Colostrum intake was lowest in the piglets with birth order ≥8 in the TREATMENT group (159.6 ± 12.3, P < 0.001). Carbetocin administration after the birth of the 7th piglet reduced the birth interval of piglets but increased the incidence of piglets born with umbilical rupture and reduced colostrum intake. Therefore, colostrum supplementation and care of the newborn piglets immediately after birth are strongly recommended after carbetocin administration.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

A maximum of 100 per hundred rubbers (phr) of rice husk ashes (RHAs) could be integrated in NR matrix without phase separation. Mechanical properties of the composite films were considerably enhanced, compared to the neat NR film. The composite films reinforced with WRHA demonstrated relatively better mechanical properties than those reinforced with BRHA, whereas the composites filled with BRHA demonstrated higher elongation at break. The crosslinking by CaCl2 improved the film tensile strength but lowered the film elasticity. The reinforcement strongly improved chemical resistance of the composite films in toluene. The films are biodegradable in soil, with weight loss of 7.6–18.3% of the initial dry weight after 3 months. Dielectric constant and dielectric loss factors of the composite films were enhanced with RHAs loading. According to the obtained properties, the composites offer potential for further development as stretchable conductive substrate or semiconducting polymer films for electronic applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The loss of one or many critical links of the network often leads to increased traffic congestion. Therefore, quantitative models are necessary to identify these critical assets so that actions can be taken by decision makers to mitigate the impact of disruptions. This paper proposes an optimisation model to identify the set of arcs that, when lost, results in the worst congestion under user equilibrium traffic. The model is formulated as a bi-level non-linear problem. The challenging formulation is solved via a customised version of Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic. Computational experiments are run on a dataset of artificial grids and managerial insights are provided based on popular Sioux and Berlin network case-studies.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, Business, decision sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Strategy and Management, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Management Science and Operations Research"

This rapid growth has been accompanied by an increased energy demand per capita. Ground source heat pumps could be a solution to improve energy efficiency. However, there are several concerns with the introduction of this technology. Unlike in four-season countries, where a seasonal balance between cooling and heating demand exists, the use of ground source heat pumps in Southeast Asia is primarily for cooling. The temperature difference between the ground and air is also small. In this paper, we evaluate the first thermal response test results ever performed in Southeast Asia at sites in Bangkok and Hanoi. Borehole heat exchanger models were established on the basis of the apparent thermal conductivities according to the thermal response test results. The borehole heat exchanger models were then used to evaluate the five-year performance of a ground source heat pump in a typical small-sized detached office building under specific climatic conditions. The increasing borehole heat exchanger temperature is unavoidable because of the absence of heat extraction. Consequently, the coefficient of performance decreasing, along with the increasing power consumption, over time. Yet, the results indicating that the ground source heat pump can still provide good thermal performance. We also evaluated the effect of the number of boreholes on the ground source heat pump performance. The results indicate that the maximum coefficient of performance can be relatively improved by 16.1% and 14.9% in Bangkok and Hanoi, respectively, using 10 instead of 6 boreholes.",energy,Energy (all)

Because of its historical high abundance, this species was never considered of conservation concern. In this study, the authors revealed that mahseers are very limited to upstream areas in mountains facing the Gulf of Thailand and are now solely confined to habitats within protected areas. The fish were sampled below seven waterfalls in four national parks. All individuals were analysed using a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene and eight nuclear microsatellite DNA loci to uncover spatial genetic patterns. Cytochrome b data showed very low genetic diversity but indicated strong genetic differentiation between the most distant Klong Kaeo (KK) population and the other populations. The more variable microsatellite DNA markers showed moderate level of genetic diversity compared to other mahseers but revealed limited gene flow among all locations (overall FST = 0.25, P < 0.05). In addition, significant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances (P < 0.05). Genetic bottleneck analyses provided an insight into evolutionary history in N. soroides that may have experienced past reduction in population size. As eastern Thailand is a relatively heavily populated region, habitat modification in lowland areas is inevitable, and it will have consequences for species that prefer fast-flowing and clear water. Protected areas therefore provide valuable sanctuaries for N. soroides in headwater streams.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Aquatic Science"
An analysis of the factors responsible for the shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta (Thailand),"Bidorn B., Sok K., Bidorn K., Burnett W.C.",2021-05-15,"Charcoal production, Coastal sediments, Dam construction, Groundwater withdrawal, Low-lying structures, Riverine sediments, Sediment accumulation, Shoreline erosion, Chao Phraya Delta, Dams, Mangroves, Sediment flux, Shoreline retreat, Subsidence","Deltas are inherently low-lying structures and thus subject to large threats due to sea level rise, erosion and other coastal processes. The shorelines in many deltas around the world are now retreating and most cases appear to result from a decreasing sediment supply as a consequence of upstream dam construction. We present here results of an investigation of riverine sediment fluxes, coastal retreat, and coastal sediment accumulation in the Chao Phraya River and Delta (Thailand). This deltaic shoreline has one of the highest rates of shoreline retreat in the world. Surprisingly, our results show that in spite of the construction of two large storage dams, one on the Ping River (Bhumibol Dam, 1964) and the other on the Nan River (Sirikit Dam, 1972) that merge to form the Chao Phraya, sediment accumulation in the delta was actually higher over the last several decades than prior to dam construction. The recent higher rates of sediment accumulation, based on 210Pb dating, appear to be the result of increased sediment supply in the lower reaches of the river relating to expansion of aquaculture and other activities in the delta beginning in the 1970s. We also show that mangrove removal, in order to further develop shrimp farming, charcoal production, and other pursuits, was not responsible for most of the shoreline erosion. Rather, subsidence, mainly induced by groundwater withdrawal, together with worldwide sea level rise appears to be the main factor affecting the very rapid shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental exploitation; land use and environmentalronmental impact assessment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"
Cracking Behavior of Corroded Beams Repaired in Flexure by Steel Fiber-Reinforced Concrete,"Van Hong Bui L., Jongvivatsakul P., Stitmannaithum B., Nguyen P.T., Nguyen Y.T.H., Van Nguyen N., Cao T.N., Nguyen T.-T.",2021-01-01,"Corrosion degree, Corrosion process, Cracking behavior, Cracking properties, Deformation mechanism, Reinforced concrete beams, Repaired beams, Test specimens, Corrosion, Cracking, Reinforced concrete, Repair, Steel fiber-reinforced concrete","This study investigated cracking behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams repaired in flexure by steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) composite. The deformation mechanism of the members subjected to a corrosion process was first examined. SFRC materials were then fabricated to rehabilitate deteriorated zone of corroded RC beams. Afterward, the bending tests were monitored to investigate cracking properties of repaired beams. The load–crack width response, effects of steel fiber volume in SFRC, and corrosion degree on the test specimens were assessed to achieve new findings as follows. The shear behavior of corroded beams changed beam action to arch action. The members subjected to 17%-corrosion degree furnished smaller crack width than that for members with 12%-corrosion degree. Increasing load, the SFRC-repaired beams failed primarily by the detachment of SFRC to old parts (concrete and steel). The load capacity of the beam leveled by 17% of corrosion degree and repaired using SFRC contained 1.5%-steel fibers was approximately 10% greater than load-carrying capacity of the other tested beams. Additionally, the beams subjected to high corrosion degree repaired by large fraction of steel fibers in SFRC resisted maximally the crack opening.","corrosion, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering
How Many Maneuvers Should We Do for Maximal Inspiratory and Expiratory Muscle Pressure Testing in Children: A Retrospective Review in Children with Cystic Fibrosis,"Boonjindasup W., Chang A.B., Marchant J.M., Irons J.Y., McElrea M.S.",2021-04-01,"Adolescent, Child, Cystic Fibrosis, Female, Humans, Male, Maximal Respiratory Pressures, Muscle Strength, Reproducibility of Results, Respiratory Muscles, Retrospective Studies, Singing, Child, Cystic fibrosis, Maximal respiratory pressures, Respiratory function tests, Respiratory muscles","Objectives: Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) could be useful clinical parameters in monitoring many conditions including cystic fibrosis (CF). However, current protocols for undertaking the measurements lack standardization including the number of repeated attempts to achieve best values. We aimed to (a) determine the optimum number of attempts to achieve best MIP/MEP values, and (b) evaluate if the number of attempts is consistent across two different test days. Methods: We analyzed data of a previous randomized controlled trial involving the effect of singing on respiratory muscle strength in 35 children with CF. On two different days (T1, T2) children performed MIP/MEP with at least ten attempts each to achieve < 10% repeatability. Results: All children achieved repeatable MIP/MEP values within 10–11 attempts with 24 (68.6%) and 26 (74.3%) of these achieving best values of MIP and MEP, respectively, at attempts 6–11. Median values of the pressures by three, five, eight and all attempts significantly increased with more attempts (all p < 0.05). At T2, 56% required fewer attempts to achieve best values, but 32% required more attempts, indicating that the number of attempts required was inconsistent between test days. Conclusion: It is likely that at least ten attempts (best two within < 10% variability) is required to achieve best and reliable MIP/MEP in children with CF. A larger sample size in children with CF and various conditions is required to consolidate these findings.",medical,Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine
Effects of electrolytes and fractionated dissolved organic matter on selective adsorption of pharmaceuticals on terephthalic acid-based metal-organic frameworks,"Sompornpailin D., Ratanatawanate C., Chantanavorakunchai N., Punyapalakul P.",2021-05-01,"Adsorption, Metal-Organic Frameworks, Pharmaceutical Preparations, Phthalic Acids, Adsorption, Dissolved organic matter, Electrolyte, Metal-organic framework, Pharmaceutical residue","In this study, we investigated the synergetic effects of coexisting electrolytes and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Ciprofloxacin (CIP) adsorption on the 1D flexible structure of MIL-53(Al) and 3D rigid structure of UiO-66(Zr). The effects of electrolytes on the adsorption of CBZ and CIP on 1D flexible framework of MIL-53(Al) were more significant than those observed from the 3D framework of UiO-66(Zr). The presence of sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate anions indicates high potential to promote the adsorption of CBZ and CIP onto MIL-53(Al) and UiO-66(Zr) because of the decrease of solubility and strengthening of electrostatic interactions by substitution of oxo-anions at the metal complex node via covalent bonding. The lower hydration energy of the potassium ion enhanced CBZ adsorption on MIL-53(Al), while the higher hydration energy of calcium and magnesium ions reduced the adsorption capacity of CBZ and CIP on MIL-53(Al) and UiO-66(Zr). CBZ interacted with fractionated humic acid better than CIP. High-density carboxylic and aromatic functional groups on humic acid ensured that only humic acid larger than 1KDa was adsorbed by MIL-53(Al). Tryptophan-like and humic acid-like DOM were both detected in real hospital effluent, and their effects on CIP and CBZ adsorption onto MIL-53(Al) were investigated. The presence of tryptophan did not affect CBZ adsorption on MIL-53(Al) (except when coexisting with calcium ions). Conversely, tryptophan interfered with CIP adsorption. The presence of humic acid lower than 1KDa promoted the adsorption of CBZ and CIP by increasing the breathing effect of MIL-53(Al)'s 1D flexible framework. The presence of humic acid with molecular size greater than 1KDa enhanced both CBZ and CIP adsorption via a multilayer adsorption mechanism.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Previous retrospective studies reported that EUS-FNA is feasible on peritoneal and omental lesions, however, EUS-FNA provided a limited amount of tissue for immunohistochemistry stain (IHC). Aim: This pilot study aims to prospectively determine the effectiveness of EUS-FNB regarding adequacy of tissue for IHC staining, diagnostic rate and the avoidance rate of diagnostic laparoscopy or percutaneous biopsy in patients with these lesions. Methods: From March 2017 to June 2018, patients with peritoneal or omental lesions identified by CT or MRI at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were prospectively enrolled in the study. All Patients underwent EUS-FNB. For those with negative pathological results of EUS-FNB, percutaneous biopsy or diagnostic laparoscopy was planned. Analysis uses percentages only due to small sample sizes. Results: A total of 30 EUS-FNB passes were completed, with a median of 3 passes (range 2–3 passes) per case. For EUS-FNB, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of EUS-FNB from peritoneal lesions were 63.6%, 100%, 100%, 20% and 66.7% respectively. Adequate tissue for IHC stain was found in 25/30 passes (80%). The tissues from EUS results were found malignant in 7/12 patients (58.3%). IHC could be done in 10/12 patients (83.3%). Among the five patients with negative EUS results, two underwent either liver biopsy of mass or abdominal paracentesis, showing gallbladder cancer and adenocarcinoma. Two patients refused laparoscopy due to advanced pancreatic cancer and worsening ovarian cancer. The fifth patient had post-surgical inflammation only with spontaneous resolution. The avoidance rate of laparoscopic diagnosis was 58.3%. No major adverse event was observed. Conclusions: EUS-FNB from peritoneal lesions provided sufficient core tissue for diagnosis and IHC. Diagnostic laparoscopy can often be avoided in patients with peritoneal lesions.",medical,Gastroenterology

Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by two different coating methods, slurry suspension (SUS), and sol-gel method (SG). Catalysts were coated on microreactor walls and tested for the deoxygenation of palm oil to BHD at 325 °C, 3.4 MPa, H2/feed molar ratio of 96. The coated catalysts were characterized by several techniques, including 3D-optical profiler, SEM-EDX, XRD, BET, and adhesion test. The experimental results show that SUS method provided a homogeneous catalyst layer, while the SG method gave a non-homogeneous cracked coating. In terms of catalytic activity, Pd/TiO2 (SG) exhibited the highest space-time yield (STY) of BHD (g BHD g-1 catalyst h-1), which could be due to its unique characteristics of pure anatase phase and strong metal-support interaction for hydrogen spillover mechanism.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biochemistry, Chemistry (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

Methods: EDI-OCT images of eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis were retrospectively reviewed and binarized using ImageJ software. Choroidal parameters including CVI, total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), stromal area (SA), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT) were measured and compared between baseline and follow-up visits among eyes with active and quiescent intermediate uveitis. Results: Thirty-eight eyes from 21 patients with active intermediate uveitis and 30 eyes from 17 patients with quiescent intermediate uveitis were included. CVI in eyes with active intermediate uveitis significantly increased from baseline (66.50% ± 3.40%) with resolution of inflammation on follow-up (68.82%±3.90%; P<0.001). In eyes with quiescent intermediate uveitis at baseline eyes, CVI did not significantly change after follow-up (66.34% ± 3.19% to 66.25% ± 3.13%; P = 0.850). Conclusions: CVI significantly increased when active inflammation in intermediate uveitis resolved while CVI remained unchanged at follow-up in quiescent intermediate uveitis. Translational Relevance: CVI may be a useful noninvasive tool to monitor treatment response in intermediate uveitis. Our findings also highlight the involvement of choroidal vasculature in uveitic eyes without any clinical evidence of choroiditis.","engineering, medical","Biomedical Engineering, Ophthalmology"

Background: Myocardial fibrosis on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has emerged as important risk marker in patients with DCM. Methods: In total, 85 patients (age 56 ± 15 years, 45% women) with DCM underwent serial CMR (median interval 1.5 years) for assessment of LVEF and fibrosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcome was a composite of heart failure hospitalization, aborted sudden cardiac death, left ventricular (LV) assist device implantation, or heart transplant. Results: On CMR-1, fibrosis (median 0.0 [interquartile range: 0% to 2.6%]) of LV mass was noted in 34 (40%) patients. On CMR-2, regression of fibrosis was not seen in any patient. Fibrosis findings were stable in 70 (82%) patients. Fibrosis progression (increase >1.8% of LV mass or new fibrosis) was seen in 15 patients (18%); 46% of these patients had no fibrosis on CMR-1. Although fibrosis progression was on aggregate associated with adverse LV remodeling and decreasing LVEF (40 ± 7% to 34 ± 10%; p < 0.01), in 60% of these cases the change in LVEF was minimal (<5%). Fibrosis progression was associated with increased hazards for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 3.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 7.9]; p < 0.01) and heart failure–related complications (hazard ratio: 3.5 [95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 8.1]; p < 0.01) after adjustment for clinical covariates including LVEF. Conclusions: Once myocardial replacement fibrosis in DCM is present on CMR, it does not regress in size or resolve over time. Progressive fibrosis is often associated with minimal change in LVEF and identifies a high-risk cohort.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

For dominant native point defects, the Al vacancy (VAl), O vacancy (VO), and Al interstitial (Ali) defects are considered, and it is found that only VAl defect provides the absorption line in the visible light region. Regarding Ti-doped or Fe-doped sapphire, it is found that their colors should be related to intra-atomic d–d transitions. For the Ti–Fe pair, it is found that the ground-state configuration is TiIII–FeIII, and its binding energy is very high, indicating that this pair can exist in high concentration. The calculated optical absorption energy associated with Ti–Fe pair is ≈1.92 and 1.84, which is appropriate for sapphire to be blue. It is, therefore, suggested that the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) mechanism is the cause of blue color in blue sapphire.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

This study aims to develop flexible nanocomposite films by combining a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT). Epoxidized castor oil (ECO) was also used as a compatibilizer to improve compatibility between the PLA matrix and the PBAT dispersion phase. The compatible PLA/PBAT blend’s elongation at break increased by up to 33%. To enhance the dielectric constant, transition metal cations, such as manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel cations, were doped in a porous clay heterostructure (PCH). The biodegradable nanocomposite film’s dielectric constant increased by almost four times (at 1 kHz) because of our efforts. Based on these findings, PLA/PBAT blends with transition metal cation-doped PCH can be employed as biodegradable polymer film capacitor alternatives.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

Twenty-two cases developed preeclampsia (5.0%) and seven of these preeclamptic cases had early-onset preeclampsia (1.6%). Pregnant women with preeclampsia had higher mean PI of the uterine artery (1.34 ± 0.52 vs 0.98 ± 0.28, p = 0.004), higher detection rates of diastolic notching (45.5% vs 11.2%, p < 0.001), and lower median serum micro RNA-210 level (22.86 vs 795.78, p < 0.001) than pregnant women without preeclampsia. Using abnormal serum micro RNA-210 level, abnormal mean PI or uterine artery diastolic notches to predict for preeclampsia, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 95.5%, 54.9%, 10.0%, and 99.6%, respectively. For early-onset preeclampsia prediction, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 100.0%, 53.2%, 3.3%, and 100.0%, respectively. This study demonstrated that a combination of serum micro RNA-210 and uterine artery Doppler is effective in predicting preeclampsia in the second trimester.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

All samples were extracted using acetonitrile for protein precipitation and analyzed using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) system. Chromatography separation was carried out using a Hypersil GOLD™ aQ C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, particle size 1.9 µm) with a C18 guard column (4 × 3 mm) flowed with an isocratic mode of methanol, water, and acetonitrile in an optimal ratio at 0.4 mL/min. The retention times of 5,6-PQ and PQ in plasma and urine were 0.8 and 1.6 min, respectively. The method was validated according to the guideline. The linearity of the analytes was in the range of 25–1500 ng/mL. The matrix effect of PQ and 5,6-PQ ranged from 100% to 116% and from 87% to 104% for plasma, and from 87% to 89% and from 86% to 87% for urine, respectively. The recovery of PQ and 5,6-PQ ranged from 78% to 95% and form 80% to 98% for plasma, and from 102% to from 112% to 97% to 109% for urine, respectively. The accuracy and precision of PQ and 5,6-PQ in plasma and urine were within the acceptance criteria. The samples should be kept in the freezer (−80◦C) and analyzed within 7 days due to the metabolite stability. This validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was beneficial for a pharmacokinetic study in subjects receiving PQ.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Estimating the preferences and willingness-to-pay for colorectal cancer screening: an opportunity to incorporate the perspective of population at risk into policy development in Thailand,"Phisalprapa P., Ngorsuraches S., Wanishayakorn T., Kositamongkol C., Supakankunti S., Chaiyakunapruk N.",2021-01-01,"Adult, Colorectal Neoplasms, Early Detection of Cancer, Humans, Policy Making, Risk Factors, Thailand, colorectal cancer screening, discrete choice experiment, Preferences, Thailand, willingness-to-pay","Aims: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the public health burdens that can be lowered by early detection. This study aims to examine the preferences and willingness-to-pay of a population at risk for CRC screening in Thailand. Understanding the preferences for these individuals at risk would help Thailand, as an example of LMICs, to design effective population-based CRC screening programs. Materials and methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted among screening-naïve adults aged 50–75 years, who were at risk of CRC, in the out-patient department of a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. A DCE questionnaire was developed from six CRC screening attributes. Each questionnaire was composed of six choice sets and each contained two alternatives described by the different levels of attributes and an opt-out alternative. Participants were asked to choose one alternative from each choice set. A multinomial logit model was developed to determine the relative preference of each attribute. The willingness-to-pays for all attributes and screening modalities and the estimated preferred choices of the annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), 10-yearly colonoscopy, 5-yearly double-contrast barium enema (DCBE), 5-yearly computed tomographic colonography (CTC), 5-yearly flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), and no screening was calculated and compared. Results: Four hundred participants were included. All attributes, except pain and less bowel preparation, were statistically associated with the participants’ preference (p <.05). They preferred screenings with a high-risk reduction of CRC-related mortality, no complication, 5-year interval, and lower cost. The estimated preferred choices of FIT, colonoscopy, DCBE, CTC, and FS were 38.2%, 11.4%, 14.6%, 9.2%, and 11.4%, respectively. The willingness-to-pays for each screening modality was US$251, US$189, US$183, US$154, and US$142 (8,107, 6,105, 5,911, 4,974, and 4,587 THB) per episode, respectively. Conclusions: The risk reduction of CRC-related mortality, complication, screening interval, and cost influenced the CRC screening preferences of Thai adults. FIT was the most preferred. Policymakers can develop a successful CRC screening campaign using these findings, incorporating the perspective of the population at risk in policy formulation to accomplish their goals.",medical,Health Policy

In this study, we evaluated the capacity of HNS as an additive in modified polypropylene (MPP). According to X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystallinity, tensile strength, and thermal stability of MPP/HNS nanocomposite containing 0.1phr HNS approached maximum values. Moreover, the nanocomposite had the best performance in terms of water vapor barrier and oxygen resistance. The reasons for the improvement in barrier performance were discussed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HNS at a low content dispersed well in MPP. In conclusion, the synthesized HNS can be used as an additive in barrier materials, and it would have potential applications in the fields of food packaging films and storage containers or materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the intraoperative awareness incidents that occurred across Thailand between January to December, 2015. METHODS: Observational data was collected from 22 hospitals throughout Thailand. The awareness category was selected from incident reports according to the Perioperative Anesthetic Adverse Events in Thailand (PAAd Thai) study database and descriptive statistics were analyzed. The awareness characteristics and the related factors were recorded. RESULTS: A total of nine intraoperative awareness episodes from 2000 incidents were observed. The intraoperative awareness results were as follows: experience of pain (38.1%), perception of sound (33.3%), perception of intubation (9.5%) and feeling of paralysis (14.3%). The observed factors that affect intraoperative awareness were anesthesia-related (100%), patient-related (55.5%), surgery-related (22.2%) and systematic process-related (22.2%). The contributing factors were situational inexperience (77.8%) and inappropriate patient evaluation (44.4%). An awareness of anesthetic performer (100%) and experience (88.9%) were defined as incident-mitigating factors. The suggested corrective strategies were quality assurance activity (88.9%), improved supervision (44.4%) and equipment utilization (33.3%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Nine intraoperative awareness incidents were observed, however the causes were preventable. The anesthetic component seems to be the most influential to prevent these events.","genergyal, medical","Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Curcumin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, possesses diverse biological and pharmacological effects but has not yet been approved as a drug due to its low bioavailability. In order to overcome this limitation, we synthesized a potential ester prodrug of curcumin, curcumin diethyl diglutarate (CurDDG). In this study, we evaluated the pharmacological advantages of CurDDG over curcumin in a mouse model of chronic constriction injury (CCI), and the anti-inflammatory effect of CurDDG in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells was accessed to clarify the underline mechanism. Mice were treated with various oral doses of curcumin (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, daily for 14 days) or equimolar doses of CurDDG. CurDDG at all doses tested significantly attenuated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia compared with the CCI-control group. CurDDG at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg demonstrated significantly greater efficacy on both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities compared to that of curcumin. The effect of CurDDG correlated well with the inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 levels in both the sciatic nerve and the spinal cord, as compared to its respective control groups. Similarly, in the in vitro study, CurDDG significantly reduced the LPS-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, CurDDG significantly decreased COX-2 and iNOS levels and attenuated p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared to the curcumin-treated cells. Altogether, this study demonstrated the improved pharmacological effects of curcumin by its diglutarate conjugate, CurDDG.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

This study aimed to investigate anti-melanogenic activity and underlying mechanism of cajanin, an isoflavonoid ex-tracted from Dalbergia parviflora Roxb. (Leguminosae) in human melanin-producing cells. Culture with 50 µM cajanin for 48–72 h significantly suppressed proliferation in human melanoma MNT1 cells assessed via MTT viability assay. Interestingly, cajanin also efficiently diminished melanin content in MNT1 cells with the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 77.47 ± 9.28 μM. Instead of direct inactivating enzymatic function of human tyrosinase, down-regulated mRNA and protein expression levels of MITF and downstream melanogenic enzymes, including tyrosinase, TRP-1 and Dct (TRP-2) were observed in MNT1 cells treated with 50 μM cajanin for 24–72 h. Correspondingly, treatment with cajanin modulated the signaling pathway of CREB and ERK which both regulate MITF expression level. Targeted suppression on MITF-related proteins in human melanin-producing cells strengthens the potential development of cajanin as an effective treatment for human hy-perpigmented disorders.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. Results: 15 International publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients’ COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. Conclusions: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing the use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop natural scaffolds that were environmentally friendly, low cost, and easily produced, using natural agents and a physical crosslinking technique. These scaffolds were prepared from agarose and sericin using the freeze-drying method (D) or freeze-thawing together with the freeze-drying method (TD). Moreover, plasticizers were added into the scaffold to improve their properties. Their physical, mechanical, and biological properties were investigated. The results showed that scaffolds that were prepared using the TD method had stronger bonding between sericin and other compounds, leading to a low swelling ratio and low protein release of the scaffolds. This property may be applied in the development of further material as a controlled drug release scaffold. Adding plasticizers, especially glycerin, into the scaffolds significantly increased elongation properties, leading to an increase in elasticity of the scaffold. Moreover, all scaffolds could activate cell migration, which had an advantage on wound healing acceleration. Accordingly, this study was successful in developing natural scaffolds using natural agents and simple and green crosslinking methods.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

HA-NPs were synthesized by hydrothermal method, and surface-modified with two cationic functional groups 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (HA-NPs-APTES) and poly2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (HA-NPs-PDMAEMA). The particles were visualized under a transmission electron microscope and then characterized for their physical properties, cell compatibility, and efficiency of miRNA binding. The FitC-tagged particles internalized in human mandibular osteoblasts (HMOBs) demonstrated insufficient miRNA binding and internalization of the unmodified particles. HA-NPs-APTES particles were in 150–200 nm elongated shape and demonstrated positive surface charge with the highest miRNA binding efficiency. HA-NPs-APTES was highly internalized in HMOBs without significantly changing cell metabolism. In contrast, PDMAEMA-modified particles demonstrated an increase in size and surface charge, and are thus potentially toxic to cells. The level of delivered miRNA in total RNA was determined by qPCR, and the HA-NP delivery system was analyzed. The HA-NP delivery system efficiently delivered miRNA, and the miRNA-targeted GAPDH expression was diminished by three- to tenfold. The GAPDH level was suppressed after 50 μg/mL or 100 μg/mL HA-NPs-APTES, significantly lower than the effect by Dharmafect. In conclusion, HA-NPs-APTES demonstrates optimal efficiency in miRNA delivery and gene regulation in the osteoblast in vitro model.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, physics, chemistry, Mathematics, Materials Science","Bioengineering, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Chemistry (all), Modeling and Simulation, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

We hypothesized that the SSNB would manage pain better on ambulation 24 hours postoperatively compared to periarticular infiltration (PAI), when combined with postoperative continuous ACB. Methods: Seventy-two patients undergoing elective TKA under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to either SSNB (SSNB group) or intraoperative PAI (PAI group). All patients received postoperative multimodal analgesia, including continuous ACB. The primary outcome was pain on ambulation 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included rest and dynamic numerical rating scale pain score, intravenous morphine requirement, functional performance measures, adverse events, satisfaction, and length of stay. Results: There was no difference in pain score during movement between the groups (mean difference −0.48 [−1.38 to 0.42], p = 0.3) and other immediate overall pain scores 24 hours postoperatively. Patients in the SSNB group had significantly lower intravenous morphine requirement than the PAI group for 48 hours postoperatively (0 [0, 0] vs. 0 [0, 2]; p = 0.008). There was no intergroup difference in the performance-based measures, satisfaction, and length of stay. Conclusions: The SSNB did not provide superior postoperative analgesia, or improvement in immediate functional performance.

Excessive heat exposure and dehydration among agricultural workers have been reported to reduce kidney function and lead to chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). Objective. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess heat exposure, factors related to dehydration and the relationship between dehydration and biomarkers of kidney function among sea salt workers in Thailand. Material and methods. Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) was used at the time workers started work outdoors on salt farms. Urine-specific gravity, urine osmolarity, and serum creatinine were collected from 50 workers after work. Results. The results showed that more than 50% of the participants were dehydrated after work. The maximum hours spent working per day was 10. The average water intake was 1.51 L. Urine specific gravity was highly significant correlated with urine osmolality (rs = 0.400, p<0.01), and urine osmolality was significantly correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (rs = 0.349, p<0.05).

From our previous work, aromatic furan (2,3-dihydrobenzofurn) was mainly produced from fast pyrolysis of BG-lignin and Comm-OS at 400–600 °C while alkyl phenol and phenol are more favorable at 700 °C. However, more thermal fragmentation was simultaneously redundant which results in low aromatic selectivity. In this work, aromatic production from lignin with molecular sieve ZSM-5 catalysts was studied using Py-GCMS instrument with biomass to catalyst ratio (B:C) of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. Aromatic furan and monolignol (H-unit, G-unit, and S-unit) were transform to hydrocarbon species with addition of ZSM-5 catalyst according to elimination of side chain by demethoxylation, dehydroxylation, and dealkylation reactions. Maximum aromatic production was found at B:C of 1:10 for both Comm-OS and BG-lignin of 87.31% and 88.22%, respectively, while aliphatic hydrocarbon was more abundant for BG-lignin of 43.21% (1:5). Moreover, ZSM-5 exhibit instinctive performance on MAHs and PAHs production especially at B:C of 1:5 and 1:10. Nevertheless, polymerization between MAHs results in PAHs also observed for both Comm-OS and BG-lignin. From the result, transformation of aromatic furan could be limited by introduction of molecular sieve ZSM-5 which enhance the oxygen elimination from phenol derivative and favorable for aromatic and BTX production.","mixing and separation, energy",Energy (all)

Kenaf cellulose fibers (KF) were chemically extracted from locally grown kenaf plants and used as reinforcement. Moreover, the KF was then treated with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), so-called KFs, to improve the compatibility between the fibers and PLA matrix. Also, the plasticizers (polyethylene glycol) were incorporated to enhance the flowability and processability of the biocomposites. The melt viscosities of the biocomposites increased as the solid KF and KFs were loaded. However, they were significantly decreased with the addition of plasticizers. The combined use of the plasticizers and TEOS treatment improved tensile strength, Young’s modulus and elongation of the biocomposites compared to the neat PLA. The obtained PLA/KFs biocomposite materials are proved to be a mechanical-improved material that could offer the opportunity for rapid production of 3D fully degradable biocomposite prototypes for applications in sustainable textiles and apparel, personalized prostheses and some medical devices that require high strength and elongation.

Farnesoid X receptor agonist for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: A safety study,"Erken R., Andre P., Roy E., Kootstra N., Barzic N., Girma H., Laveille C., Radreau-Pierini P., Darteil R., Vonderscher J., Scalfaro P., Tangkijvanich P., Flisiak R., Reesink H.",2021-12-01,"Animals, Antiviral Agents, DNA, Viral, Hepatitis B e Antigens, Hepatitis B Surface Antigens, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis B, Chronic, Humans, Mice, Pharmaceutical Preparations, cccDNA transcription, farnesoid X receptor, HBV therapy, phase Ib, Vonafexor","The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid homeostasis and is a drug target for metabolic liver diseases. FXR also plays an important role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA transcription. In vitro and in mice, FXR agonist treatment leads to inhibition of viral replication and a decline in viral proteins, pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and HBV DNA levels. We aimed to translate this to a clinical use by primarily evaluating the safety and secondary the anti-viral effect of Vonafexor, a FXR agonist, in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. In total, 73 CHB patients were enrolled in a two-part Phase Ib double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive oral Vonafexor (100, 200 and 400 mg once daily, or 200 mg twice daily), placebo, or entecavir (Part A, n = 48) or to receive Vonafexor (300 mg once daily or 150 mg twice daily), or placebo, combined with pegylated-interferon-α2a (Part B, n = 25) for 29 days. Patients were followed up for 35 days. Enrolled CHB patients were mostly HBeAg-negative. Vonafexor was overall well tolerated and safe. The most frequent adverse events were moderate gastrointestinal events. Pruritus was more frequent with twice-daily compared with once-daily regimens (56%–67% vs. 16%, respectively, p < 0.05). Vonafexor monotherapy of 400 mg once daily decreased HBsAg concentrations (–0.1 log10 IU/mL, p < 0.05), and Vonafexor/pegylated-IFN-α2a combination therapy decreased HBcrAg and pgRNA. In conclusion, Vonafexor was safe with a decline in HBV markers observed in CHB patients suggesting a potential anti-viral effect the therapeutic potential of which has to be evaluated in larger trials.","medical, Immunology","Hepatology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Herein, we developed a hybrid electrolyte with graphene oxide as an additive with the functions of promoting the uniform distribution of the electric field and reducing the nucleation overpotential of Zn2+, displaying a smooth zinc electrodeposition layer and reaction kinetics. The resultant zinc symmetric battery with graphene oxide additive affords a stable zinc anode which provided service for more than 650 h at 1 mA cm-2 and an exceptional cycle life of 140 h even at 10 mA cm-2. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the deposition of zinc dendrites through the glass fiber separator was the reason for the battery short circuit. It is believed that the graphene oxide additive can remarkably improve the Coulombic efficiency (99.16%) of the batteries via stabilizing the Zn plating/stripping behavior and facilitating Zn2+ nucleation. Consequently, the full battery with graphene oxide electrolyte additive exhibited remarkable enhancements in rate performance and cyclability compared to the additive-free electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte containing solid particles opens a chapter for designing advanced and durable zinc-ion batteries.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The clinical outcomes (of DENV) can vary from a flu-like illness called dengue fever (DF), to a more severe form, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The underlying innate immune mechanisms leading to protective or detrimental outcomes have not been fully elucidated. Helper innate lymphoid cells (hILCs), an innate lymphocyte recently discovered, functionally resemble T-helper cells and are important in inflammation and homeostasis. However, the role of hILCs in DENV infection had been unexplored. Methods: We performed flow cytometry to investigate the frequency and phenotype of hILCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DENV-infected patients of different disease severities (DF and DHF), and at different phases (febrile and convalescence) of infection. Intracellular cytokine staining of hILCs from DF and DHF were also evaluated by flow cytometry after ex vivo stimulation. Further, the hILCs were sorted and subjected to transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the febrile and convalescent phase samples in DF and DHF. Selected differentially expressed genes were then validated by quantitative PCR. Results: Phenotypic analysis showed marked activation of all three hILC subsets during the febrile phase as shown by higher CD69 expression when compared to paired convalescent samples, although the frequency of hILCs remained unchanged. Upon ex vivo stimulation, hILCs from febrile phase DHF produced significantly higher IFN-γ and IL-4 when compared to those of DF. Transcriptomic analysis showed unique hILCs gene expression in DF and DHF, suggesting that divergent functions of hILCs may be associated with different disease severities. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that hILCs function both in cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity during the febrile phase of DENV infection. Conclusions: Helper ILCs are activated in the febrile phase of DENV infection and display unique transcriptomic changes as well as cytokine production that correlate with severity. Targeting hILCs during early innate response to DENV might help shape subsequent immune responses and potentially lessen the disease severity in the future.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Attributed to high carbon content of eucalyptus oil, CNTs with substantial yield could be produced within a pyrolyzing temperature (Tp) range of 800−900 °C and different molar ratios of eucalyptus oil to ferrocene (Rof) including 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. Typical FESEM analyses of as-produced CNTs revealed that CNTs with agglomeration of amorphous carbon could be produced at low Tp and low Rof. Meanwhile higher Tp and Rof could provide CNTs with lower content of amorphous carbon. TGA analyses could confirm the superior thermal stability of the resultant CNTs which were produced at high Tp and Rof. The highest CNT yield of about 45 % was obtained at Tp of 850 °C and Rof of 1:1. It could be confirmed that Tp of 900 °C and Rof of 3:1 was the optimal condition for production of high quality CNTs from valorizable eucalyptus oil.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

The developed impactor consisted of four stages with a backup filter stage for collection of the aerosol samples. The aerosol cut points were set for 10, 2.5, 1, and 0.5 μm at a sampling rate of 4 L min−1. Five CR-39 chips were used as alpha detectors for each stage. To separate the alpha particles emitted from radon and thoron progeny, the CR-39 detectors were covered with aluminium-vaporized Mylar films. The thickness of each film was adjusted to allow alpha particles emitted from radon and thoron progeny to reach the surface of the CR-39 detectors. The particle cut-off characteristics of each stage were determined by mono-dispersive aerosols with particle sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1.23 μm from the collection efficiency curve. The test results showed that the respective cut-off size of stages 3 and 4 were close to the designed cut-points. Validation of the technique by comparison with two commercial devices confirmed that the developed technique could provide the necessary information to estimate the activity size distribution of attached radon and thoron progeny for dose assessment, especially, in a field survey where direct electric power is not available.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that are associated with higher prevalence of depression. The main component leading to the change in functioning, in the form of apathy, anhedonia, lack of motivation and sleep disturbances, is stress. This is the factor that in recent decades—due to the civilization speed, dynamic technological development as well as competitiveness and competition in relationships—significantly affects the psychophysical condition, which results in an increase in the prevalence of civilization diseases, including depression. To understand the mechanism of susceptibility to this disease, one should consider the significant role of the interaction between immune and nervous systems. Their joint development from the moment of conception is a matrix of later predispositions, both associated with the mobilization of the proinflammatory pathways (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6) and associated with psychological coping with stress. Such an early development period is associated with epigenetic processes that are strongly marked in prenatal development up to 1 year of age and determinate the characteristic phenotype for various forms of pathology, including depression. Regarding the inflammatory hypothesis of depression, interleukin 17 (IL-17), among other proinflammatory cytokines, might play an important role in the development of depressive disorders. It is secreted by Th17 cells, crossed the placental barrier and acts on the brain structures of the fetus by increasing IL-17 receptor levels and affecting the intensity of its signaling in the brain.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

The problem came from the proportion of total alkaline (T.Al) lower than the lower control limit (LCL) which was set at 18.2 points during February-May 2020. This resulted in the low values of Cp and Cpk, i.e. 0.83 and 0.51, respectively. To remedy the problem, Six Sigma (DMAIC) was applied to improve the process stability. The cause and effect matrix was used to analyse the potential causes of problems and prioritise the causes to solve. It was found that four (causes) factors were solved by auto titration and feeding controller installation to reduce variance and increase stability. Another one factor, quality of water, was improved by adding a check item to monitor and collect data during the initial implementation stage.

However, the potential effects of extended engagement with of smartphones on cognitive ability and academic achievement are not well understood. In this research we compared problematic self-report smartphone use in two groups of undergraduate students (STEM and humanities). The groups had very similar demographics in terms of age and sex, and similar mean GPA scores. However, there was a strong negative association between problematic smartphone use and GPA in the STEM students, which was not seen in the humanities students. Furthermore, this association in the STEM students was found to be related to self-reported executive functions- impulse control and sustained attention. We speculate that problematic smartphone use may cause academic problems disproportionately for STEM students because it reduces cognitive resources, which are particularly important to achieve higher grades in fields such as science technology engineering, and medicine.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, sociology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous), Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Computer Science (miscellaneous), Information Systems and Management, Engineering (miscellaneous), Education"

Urrets-Zavalia syndrome results in complaints of glare, halo, and photophobia. Retention of the viscoelastic agent during Implantable Collamer Lens implantation can result in postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure and Urrets-Zavalia syndrome. However, reversibility of pupillary dilatation is possible in some cases. Case presentation: A 20-year-old Thai man with myopic astigmatism in both eyes underwent Implantable Collamer Lens implantation in the right eye. The preoperative slit-lamp examination of both eyes was normal, and no ectatic changes were detected from corneal tomography. One hour after the uncomplicated surgery of the right eye, intraocular pressure increased to 48 mmHg and was immediately controlled with antiglaucoma medications. Postoperative pupillary dilatation was detected, presumably due to effect of preoperative application of mydriatic drops. At postoperative day 1, the right pupil remained dilated but still reactive to light and pilocarpine 2% eye drops. Two weeks later, the left eye underwent the Implantable Collamer Lens implantation and showed neither postoperative increase in intraocular pressure nor postoperative pupillary dilatation. Two months after surgery, the dilatation of the right pupil partially reversed. Conclusions: The findings of the right eye suggested diagnosis of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome. Compared with former reports, we noted an association between immediate control of elevation of postoperative intraocular pressure, light reactivity of the dilated pupil, and reactivity to pilocarpine 2% eye drops as potential predictors for reversibility of Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.",medical,Medicine (all)

However, arterial complications of filler injections at this site have been continually reported during recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the arterial locations and their anastomotic pathways related to filler injection sites in the NLF. Materials and methods: Thirty hemi-faces of 15 embalmed Thai cadavers were dissected. Three anatomical landmarks of NLFs were assigned: the inferior margin level (NLF1), the mid-philtral horizontal line level (NLF2), and the inferior alar level (NLF3). Ten hemi-faces of five soft embalmed Thai cadavers underwent a modified Sihler's staining procedure to investigate the arterial anastomoses. Results: The artery closest to all of the landmarks was the facial artery. It was located inferomedial to NLF1 in 28%, and the mean distances along the X- and Y-axes were 3.53 ± 2.11 mm and 3.53 ± 1.75 mm, respectively. It was also located medial to NLF2 in 52.1% with an X-axis distance of 4.93 ± 1.53 mm. Several arteries were located close to NLF3, including the facial (33.3%), lateral nasal (33.3%), and infraorbital (30.0%) arteries. Anastomoses of the nasolabial arteries served to connect both the external–external and internal–external carotid systems. Conclusions: Several arteries are located close to NLF1–NLF3. To prevent arterial injury, the locations and anastomotic pathways, as possible sources of severe complications, should be recognized prior to NLF filler injection.",medical,"Anatomy, Histology"

In the experimental program, one beam was tested in an as-built condition. The other two beams were strengthened using natural hybrid FRP layers in different configurations. The natural hybrid FRP composite was developed by using natural jute FRP and basalt FRP. One of the most appealing advantages of natural fiber is its beneficial impact on the environment, which is necessary for the sustainability recognition as an alternative to synthetic FRP. The hybrid FRP was applied to the bottom concrete surface in one beam, while a U-shaped strengthening pattern was adopted for the other beam. The flexural behavior of each beam was assessed through strain measurements. Each beam was incorporated with conventional strain gages, as well as the Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analysis (BOTDA) technique. BOTDA has its exclusive advantages due to its simple system architecture, easy implementation, measurement speed, and cross-sensitivity. The experimental results revealed that the beam strengthened with the U-shaped hybrid FRP composite pattern had a better flexural response than the other counterpart beams did both in terms of peak loads and maximum bottom longitudinal steel bar strains. Beams B-01 and B-02 exhibited 20.5% and 28.4% higher energy dissipation capacities than the control beam did, respectively. The ultimate failure of the control beam was mainly due to the flexural cracks at very low loads, whereas the ultimate failure mode of FRP composite-strengthened beams was due to the rupture of the hybrid FRP composite. Further, strain measurements using BOTDA exhibited similar patterns as conventional strain gage measurements did. However, it was concluded that BOTDA measurements were substantially influenced by the bottom flexural cracks, ultimately resulting in shorter strain records than those of conventional strain gages. Nonlinear structural analysis of the beams was performed using the computer program ATENA. The analytical results for the control beam specimen showed a close match with the corresponding experimental results mainly in terms of maximum deflection. However, the analytical peak load was slightly higher than the corresponding experimental value.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The healthy subjects had significantly decreased V RCp (L) (p < 0.05) during scaption (0.14 ± 0.07) and abduction (0.15 ± 0.06) than during flexion (0.18 ± 0.07) and no significantly different TAA between UAEs. The COPD group had no significantly different V RCp between UAEs, had significantly increased TAA (p < 0.05) during scaption (31.1°±9.5°) and abduction (32.3°±9.9°) than during flexion (29.7°±9.1°); and had significantly worse V RCp (p = 0.007), TAA (p = 0.0001), ventilatory demands (p < 0.05), dyspnea ((p = 0.03), and arm fatigue (p = 0.002). Conclusions: In patients with COPD, UAE in different planes similarly restricted the upper chest wall volume. Shoulder scaption and abduction significantly impaired TAA, ventilation, dyspnea, and arm fatigue compared with flexion. These results may help to select the appropriate UAE during physical activities.",Health Professions,"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"
Topical 0.5% Timolol Maleate Significantly Enhances Skin-Barrier Restoration After Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Treatment for Acne Scars,"Kimwattananukul K., Noppakun N., Asawanonda P., Kumtornrut C.",2021-07-01,"Acne Vulgaris, Carbon Dioxide, Cicatrix, Humans, Laser Therapy, Lasers, Gas, Timolol, Treatment Outcome, ablative fractional carbon-dioxide laser, timolol, wound healing","Background and Objectives: Skin barrier is often compromised following ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser (AFCO2) therapy for acne scarring. The resultant downtime, even of a few days' duration, can be of significant concern to patients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of topical 0.5% timolol maleate (TM) for its role in short-term restoration of the skin's biophysical properties after laser treatments. Study Design/Materials and Methods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included participants aged 18–50 years with atrophic acne scars for at least 3 months. After undergoing laser therapy, they applied 0.5% TM to one cheek and normal saline to the contralateral cheek (control) for 7 days. Corneometry, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement, colorimetry, and clinical outcome parameters (erythema, edema, crusting, pruritus, and tightness scores) were evaluated at baseline and 48, 96, and 168 hours after AFCO2 treatment. Results: Twenty-five healthy participants completed the study. Most participants had Fitzpatrick skin phototype IV. The TM-treated side showed statistically higher corneometry values and lower TEWL than the control side at every follow-up visit (P < 0.001). The crusting score at 96 hours post-AFCO2 treatment was also significantly better on the TM side. No adverse events occurred during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Application of topical 0.5% TM twice daily improves the skin-barrier function and might promote re-epithelialization after laser procedures. Lasers Surg.

However, there are still lack of questionnaire to evaluate the treatment outcome from the patient’s aspect. The objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Patient’s Denture Assessment-Thai version (PDA-T), then use this questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with complete denture treatment outcome also investigates the factors involving their satisfaction. Methods: The subjects comprised 120 edentulous adult patients (49 men/71 women; average age 70 years-old) from the Prosthodontic and the Geriatric Dentistry and Special Patients Care Clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University during 2019 March‒2020 March. The patients were divided into two groups: the group experienced (Exper) (n = 54) with wearing complete dentures, and the non-experienced (NonExper) group (n = 66). The patients used the validated PDA-T to self-assess their treatment at different times. The Exper group completed the questionnaire at t0 (during treatment), t0.5 (2‒8-weeks after t0), and t1 (final follow-up). The NonExper group completed the questionnaire only at t1. Results: In the Exper group, Cronbach’s α and average inter-item correlation was 0.95 (range 0.76‒0.95) and 0.47 (range 0.57‒0.83), respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients (n = 18, 95% confidence interval) were 0.98 overall. The paired t-test (p < 0.05) between t0 and t1 indicated a significant difference between t0 and t1 in every PDA-T topic, and the effect size was 1.71. In the NonExper group, the Pearson correlation analysis indicated no significant correlation between the patients' demographics and masticatory function. Conclusion: The reliability and validity of the PDA-T indicate it is a valuable tool for evaluating complete denture treatment. Treatment success affected the patients' satisfaction but was not associated with the type of doctors, genders, ages, or educational level.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Guidelines suggest anticoagulation may be more effective than antiplatelets in preventing stroke in patients with ESUS and PFO when interventional closure is not performed. Methods: Patients with ESUS randomized to dabigatran (150/110 mg BID) or aspirin (100 mg QD) from the RE-SPECT ESUS study (Randomized, Double-Blind, Evaluation in Secondary Stroke Prevention Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of the Oral Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran Etexilate Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) were included. The rate of recurrent stroke (primary end point) and ischemic stroke was reported for patients with and without baseline PFO. A meta-analysis comparing the effects of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy on ischemic stroke in patients with PFO was updated to include RE-SPECT ESUS. Results: PFO was present in 680 of 5388 (12.6%) patients with documented PFO status. The risk of recurrent stroke with dabigatran versus aspirin was similar in patients with and without PFO (P for interaction, 0.8290). In patients with PFO, the meta-analysis found no statistically significant difference between anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy (odds ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.43-1.14]) for ischemic stroke. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to recommend anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy for patients with ESUS and a PFO. More data are needed to guide antithrombotic therapy in this population. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We undertook a retrospective chart review of AS patients seen in 8 sarcoma academic centers across Asia. Patients with complete clinical, treatment, and follow-up data were enrolled. Overall, 276 advanced AS patients were included into this study; 84 (30%) of the patients had metachronous metastatic AS. The median age was 67 y; primary sites of AS was cutaneous in 55% and visceral in 45% of patients. In total, 143 (52%) patients received at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy. The most common first-line chemotherapy regimen used was paclitaxel (47.6%) followed by liposomal doxorubicin (19.6%). The median overall survival (OS) was 7.8 mo. Significant prognostic factors for OS included age > 65 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.54, P =.006), male gender (HR 1.39, P =.02), and a cutaneous primary AS site (HR 0.63, P =.004). The median progression-free survival (PFS) for first-line chemotherapy was 3.4 mo. PFS for single vs combination or paclitaxel vs liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy regimens were comparable. This study provides an insight into the treatment patterns and prognostic factors of advanced AS patients in Asia. Prognosis of advanced AS remains poor.

However, some diabetic patients have trypanophobia, so they often avoid insulin injections resulting in life-threatening conditions. Therefore, this study aims to develop microneedle patches for transdermal insulin delivery to reduce pain from insulin injection and extend the shelf-life of insulin stored at room temperature. The insulin microneedle patches were fabricated by coating a mixture of insulin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on plastic microneedle patches. A histological section showed that the microneedles had excellent mechanical strength to penetrate porcine cadaver skin. The stability test using the insulin Elisa kit indicated good stability of the insulin/PVA coated on the microneedle patches stored at room temperature whereas its biological activity was higher than 90% after 30 days of storage.","fluidex; related topics, Business, energy, engineering, medical, sociology","Strategy and Management, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Biomedical Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Building and Construction, Health Policy, Health (social science)"

Design: Single-blinded sham-controlled study. Setting: Rehabilitation center. Participants: SCI patients with NDO (N=17) were recruited. Fifteen patients (mean age, 40±18y) completed the study. Most of the patients had chronic incomplete SCI. Interventions: UDM was performed 3 times. The first UDM was performed after taking anticholinergics for 1 hour to assess the effects of medication. After stopping anticholinergics for a 5 half-lives, the second UDM was performed immediately after a 20-minute sham TTNS (switch on for 30s at the beginning, switch off for 20min, and switch on for 30s before stopping). The third UDM was performed immediately after a 20-minute bilateral TTNS. Main Outcome Measures: Reflex volume (mL), cystometric capacity (mL), maximum pressure detrusor (mmH2O), and bladder compliance (mL/mmH2O). Results: UDM tracings were interpreted by 2 blinded assessors. This study used per-protocol analysis and repeated measures Analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis. When compared with sham stimulation, bilateral TTNS and anticholinergics produced greater increases in reflex volume (136.1±99.88, 212.2±112.82, and 226.3±111.52 mL; P<.001), cystometric capacity (218.3±137.66, 319.1±143.74, and 350.7±163.43 mL; P<.001), and compliance (5.8±6.81, 7.9±6.74, 9.7±8.12 mL/cmH2O; P=.02). No significant differences were found in reflex volume, cystometric capacity, or compliance between bilateral TTNS and anticholinergics (P>.05). The maximum pressure detrusor was not significantly different between groups (P>.05). Conclusion: Bilateral TTNS may be an effective short-term intervention to improve UDM parameters in SCI with NDO. Further study is necessary to determine the long-term effects and benefits of combined bilateral TTNS with anticholinergics.","Health Professions, medical","Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation"

In invertebrates, the functions of fibrinogen-related proteins (FrePs) are of importance to innate immunity. In this study, a FreP in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was identified and characterized. The PmFreP cDNA is 1,007 bp long with a 921 bp-open reading frame that encodes for 306 amino acids. The deduced PmFreP sequence consists of a signal peptide, an unknown region and the FreD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PmFreP was clustered with fibrinogen-like proteins in crustaceans which was separated from vertebrate ficolin-like proteins. The deduced fibrinogen-like domain contains four conserved cysteine residues (Cys96, Cys127, Cys249, and Cys262) that are responsible for the formation of disulfide bridges. Gene expression analysis shows that Pmfrep is mainly expressed in the intestine and the expression is significantly upregulated after Vibrio harveyi and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. Recombinant PmFreP (rPmFreP) were successfully expressed and purified, and forms a trimeric structure as judged by native-PAGE. Bacterial binding assay showed that the rPmFreD can bind and agglutinate Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of calcium (Ca2+) ions. Moreover, the rPmFreP facilitates the clearance of V. harveyi in vivo. Overall, our results suggested that the PmFreP may serve as pattern recognition receptors implicated in shrimp innate immunity.","environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Global diversity of the gene encoding the Pfs25 protein—a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine candidate,"Sookpongthai P., Utayopas K., Sitthiyotha T., Pengsakul T., Kaewthamasorn M., Wangkanont K., Harnyuttanakorn P., Chunsrivirot S., Pattaradilokrat S.",2021-12-01,"Antigens, Protozoan, Genetic Variation, Haplotypes, Humans, Malaria Vaccines, Malaria, Falciparum, Plasmodium falciparum, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Protozoan Proteins, Staphylococcal Protein A, Diversity, Haplotype, Malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, Transmission-blocking, Vaccine","Background: Vaccines against the sexual stages of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum are indispensable for controlling malaria and abrogating the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Pfs25, a surface antigen of the sexual stage of P. falciparum, is a leading candidate for transmission-blocking vaccine development. While clinical trials have reported that Pfs25-based vaccines are safe and effective in inducing transmission-blocking antibodies, the extent of the genetic diversity of Pfs25 in malaria endemic populations has rarely been studied. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the global diversity of Pfs25 in P. falciparum populations. Methods: A database of 307 Pfs25 sequences of P. falciparum was established. Population genetic analyses were performed to evaluate haplotype and nucleotide diversity, analyze haplotypic distribution patterns of Pfs25 in different geographical populations, and construct a haplotype network. Neutrality tests were conducted to determine evidence of natural selection. Homology models of the Pfs25 haplotypes were constructed, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD), and analyzed in terms of flexibility and percentages of secondary structures. Results: The Pfs25 gene of P. falciparum was found to have 11 unique haplotypes. Of these, haplotype 1 (H1) and H2, the major haplotypes, represented 70% and 22% of the population, respectively, and were dominant in Asia, whereas only H1 was dominant in Africa, Central America, and South America. Other haplotypes were rare and region-specific, resulting in unique distribution patterns in different geographical populations. The diversity in Pfs25 originated from ten single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci located in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and anchor domain. Of these, an SNP at position 392 (GGA/GCA), resulting in amino acid substitution 131 (Gly/Ala), defined the two major haplotypes. The MD results showed that the structures of H1 and H2 variants were relatively similar. Limited polymorphism in Pfs25 could likely be due to negative selection. Conclusions: The study successfully established a Pfs25 sequence database that can become an essential tool for monitoring vaccine efficacy, designing assays for detecting malaria carriers, and conducting epidemiological studies of P. falciparum. The discovery of the two major haplotypes, H1 and H2, and their conserved structures suggests that the current Pfs25-based vaccines could be used globally for malaria control.

In order to infer how sex-linked loci have been differentiated undergoing frequent hybridization and admixture, we examined 17 whole-genome sequences of seven species representing the genus Macaca, which shows frequent inter-specific hybridization and predominantly female philopatry. We found that hybridization and admixture were prevalent within these species. For three cases of suggested hybrid origin of species/subspecies, Macaca arctoides, Macaca fascicularis ssp. aurea, and Chinese Macaca mulatta, we examined the level of admixture of X chromosomes, which is less affected by male-biased migration than that of autosomes. In one case, we found that Macaca cyclopis and Macaca fuscata was genetically closer to Chinese M. mulatta than to the Indian M. mulatta, and the admixture level of Chinese M. mulatta and M. fuscata/cyclopis was more pronounced on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Since the mitochondrial genomes of Chinese M. mulatta, M. cyclopis, and M. fuscata were found to cluster together, and the mitochondrial genome of Indian M. mulatta is more distantly related, the observed pattern of genetic differentiation on X-chromosomal loci is consistent with the nuclear swamping hypothesis, in which strong, continuous male-biased introgression from the ancestral Chinese M. mulatta population to a population related to M. fuscata and M. cyclopis generated incongruencies between the genealogies of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Genetics"

For this, it will first take the training data as an input from the camera of the device, then train the model based on the input and detect the face according to the training. Training will be done using LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) model which uses the concept of sliding window and applies the LBP operation on the image, which includes calculating pixel values of the image, finding threshold and then convert the image into binary. By doing so, all the important features of the image are extracted. Then it makes histograms for face recognition. In addition to this, after detecting the person’s face, this algorithm will also classify the gender and gives a prediction about the age of the person. The primary advantage of this model is it makes use of a library called OpenCV for image capturing, which makes the implementation very simple as compared to the one’s that use neural networks. Moreover, this algorithm can be used for a variety of purposes such as face lock gender and age classifier.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, patients with such, if refract to radioiodine treatment, increase recurrent and mortality rates. Tumor aggressiveness in primary tumor of PTC expresses CXCR4 chemokine receptor. Thus, CXCR4 expression of the tumor may predict response to radioiodine treatment. Materials and methods Retrospective review of seventy-four PTC patients, treated with total/near-Total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2007 to 2013, were classified as non-radioiodine-refractory (non-RAIR) or RAIR treatment response.

The scores were compared between primary tumour and adjacent normal thyroid tissue as well as between the tissue of non-RAIR and that of RAIR. Factors determining type of RAI response were analyzed. Results CXCR4 immunostaining scores of PTC is significantly higher than normal thyroid [2.03 (0.52) and 1.48 (0.75)] [mean (SD)] (P = 0.0001). CXCR4 immunostaining scores in RAIR are potentially higher than non-RAIR [1.95 (0.54) and 2.13 (0.47) (P = 0.149)]. Odds ratio of CXCR4 immunostaining score for predicting RAIR treatment is 1.99 (P = 0.150). CXCR4 immunostaining scores positively associate with tumor size (R = 0.298, P = 0.01); whereas no significant association with other clinicopathologic factors. Conclusion Our data support the notion that CXCR4 are significantly expressed in PTC tumor over normal thyroid tissues. However, there is no clinical association with radioiodine treatment response.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Several marine sponges and their associated microorganisms have been known to produce cytotoxic natural products on several cancer cell lines via DNA damage mechanisms. These marine cytotoxic substances might be one of the factors that cause the low quantity and quality of DNAs during the DNA extraction from its living origin. Therefore, the extraction of DNA of a Thai blue marine sponge Xestospongia sp. with sufficient purity and quantity for molecular study can be challenging. In this study, we developed an efficient extraction method to prepare DNAs from a Thai blue marine sponge Xestospongia sp. which accumulated a highly potent cytotoxic alkaloid with DNA-damaging activity, named Renieramycin M (RM), as a major constituent in high quantity. We demonstrated that removal of RM from the sponge samples by a simple methanolic extraction before DNA extraction dramatically increased the yield and purity of DNAs compared to the RM-unremoved sponge samples. High molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA was obtained from sponge samples with 8 times of RM elimination by using modified NaOAc salting-out extraction method. The quantity and quality of the prepared DNAs were comparatively determined via spectrophotometry, electrophoresis, and 16S rRNA gene amplification. Our result suggests that the removal of DNA-damaging constituents from the samples is a crucial step and must be seriously taken as the necessary consideration for the practical protocol of DNA extraction.","mixing and separation, biotechnology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Aquatic Science"

The stress relaxation behaviors of various filled samples were characterized by the novel temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR) technique to elucidate the state and degree of filler dispersion based on initial relaxation modulus, bound rubber, and thermal stability. The incorporation of CNT/GP hybrid filler in NR matrix improved relaxation modulus, bound rubber, and thermal stability of the nanocomposites. The CNT particles in the hybrid composites prevented the re-agglomeration of dispersed GP after mixing by a thermodynamic effect. It was found that a combination of 3 phr CNT and 30 ph GP gave superior properties to NR vulcanizates. That is, good dispersion and distribution of CNT and GP in the NR matrix provided further significant improvements in electrical conductivity and dielectric constant of the nanocomposites. The NR nanocomposites with high conductivity and low dielectric constant seems to be a semi-conductive substrate to be used in many electrical devices.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

Adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIVA) should be a focus for treatment failure given their poorer outcomes compared to children and adults. Methods: Data (2014-2018) from a regional cohort of Asian PHIVA who received at least 6 months of continuous cART were analyzed. Treatment failure was defined according to World Health Organization criteria. Descriptive analyses were used to report treatment failure and subsequent management and evaluate postfailure CD4 count and viral load trends. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare the cumulative incidence of death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) by treatment failure status. Results: A total 3196 PHIVA were included in the analysis with a median follow-up period of 3.0 years, of whom 230 (7.2%) had experienced 292 treatment failure events (161 virologic, 128 immunologic, 11 clinical) at a rate of 3.78 per 100 person-years. Of the 292 treatment failure events, 31 (10.6%) had a subsequent cART switch within 6 months, which resulted in better immunologic and virologic outcomes compared to those who did not switch cART. The 5-year cumulative incidence of death and LTFU following treatment failure was 18.5% compared to 10.1% without treatment failure. Conclusions: Improved implementation of virologic monitoring is required to realize the benefits of virologic determination of cART failure. There is a need to address issues related to accessibility to subsequent cART regimens, poor adherence limiting scope to switch regimens, and the role of antiretroviral resistance testing.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Many investigational adoptive immunotherapy regimens utilizing natural killer (NK) cells require the administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15, but these cytokines cause serious dose-dependent toxicities. To reduce or preclude the necessity for IL-2 use, we investigated whether genetic engineering of NK cells to express the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) or thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (c-MPL) could be used as a method to improve NK cell survival and function. Viral transduction of NK-92 cells to express EPOR or c-MPL receptors conveyed signaling via appropriate pathways, protected cells from apoptosis, augmented cellular proliferation, and increased cell cytotoxic function in response to EPO or TPO ligands in vitro. In the presence of TPO, viral transduction of primary human NK cells to express c-MPL enhanced cellular proliferation and increased degranulation and cytokine production toward target cells in vitro. In contrast, transgenic expression of EPOR did not augment the proliferation of primary NK cells. In immunodeficient mice receiving TPO, in vivo persistence of primary human NK cells genetically modified to express c-MPL was higher compared with control NK cells. These data support the concept that genetic manipulation of NK cells to express hematopoietic growth factor receptors could be used as a strategy to augment NK cell proliferation and antitumor immunity.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Epithelial cells and stem cells can be isolated from HOFF. However, information regarding stem cells derived from HOFF is still lacking. The objectives of the present study were to isolate, characterize, and differentiate cells derived from HOFF. HOFF was collected during the routine aspiration of oocytes in an assisted fertilization program and subjected to cell isolation, characterization, and in vitro culture. After 24 h of culture, different cell morphologies including epithelial-like-, neural-like- and fibroblast-like cells were observed. Immunocytochemistry reveals the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4), epithelial marker (CK18), FSH- and LH-receptor. For in vitro culture, the isolated cells were continuously cultured in a growth medium; alpha MEM containing 10% FBS and epidermal growth factor (EGF). After 2 weeks of in vitro culture, cells with fibroblast-like morphology dominantly grow in the culture vessels and resemble mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). HOFF-derived cells exhibited MSC expression of CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146, and STRO-1, and were capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. After induction of neural differentiation, HOFF-derived cells formed spheroidal structures and expressed neural stem cell markers including Nestin, β-tubulin III, and O4. Besides, the oocyte-like structure was observed after prolonged culture of HOFF. In conclusion, cells derived from follicular fluid exhibited stem cell characteristics, which could be useful for regenerative medicine applications and cell-based therapies.","cell and developmental biology; cell growth and division; cell growth; stem cells, biochemistryistry","Cell Biology, Cancer Research"

Maintaining a balance between electricity supply and demand is difficult, and the frequency fluctuation due to mismatch is a concern. Therefore, we proposed a mobile vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system that maintains the balance between supply and demand. This is possible because of the ""battery"" used in electric vehicles (EVs), which are expected to be introduced in considerable numbers in the future. The mobile V2G microgrid is composed of a power supply vehicle, EVs, photovoltaic (PV) power systems, and residential loads. In the proposed method, we assume that an accident causes a fault in the upper section of the distribution system, the proposed V2G can be employed when power cannot be transmitted from other feeders. The EVs actively move from bus-to-bus to charge or discharge during the emergency operation of the distribution system. Therefore, the mobile V2G microgrid can restore and sustainably supply power to sections which cannot be restored with only one power supply vehicle using conventional methods.

The objective of this study was to estimate the radiation doses to the ovaries and uterus for different treatment techniques of breast cancer irradiation using radio-photoluminescent glass dosimeters (RPLDs). Methods: A Farmer-type ionisation chamber (IBA FC-65G) and RPLDs were used to measure in- and out-of-field radiation doses in a solid water phantom. The field sizes were set to 10 × 10 cm2 and 8 × 17 cm2 with the central axis at out-of-field measurement distances of 30 or 50 cm. The Rando phantom’s left breast was planned using four different techniques: two tangential standard fields with and without electronic tissue compensator (E-comp) techniques, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The radiation doses in the ipsilateral ovary, contralateral ovary and uterus were measured using RPLDs. Results: The percentage ratio of out of field to in field was affected by distance from the central axis to the point of measurement, in addition to the field sizes associated with collimator scatter. Advanced techniques such as IMRT and VMAT produced higher doses to the ovaries and uterus. The estimated results of the worst-case scenario for the ipsilateral ovary, contralateral ovary and uterus were 0.84% (42 cGy), 0.62% (31 cGy) and 0.76% (38 cGy), respectively, for a 5000 cGy prescription dose. Conclusion: The lowest to highest out-of-field radiation doses to the ovarian and uterine organs from breast irradiation were the two tangential field techniques, VMAT and IMRT. These advanced techniques yielded higher radiation leakage, which potentially contributed to the out-of-field radiation dose.","Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The FTIR spectrum showed characteristic peaks of carboxymethyl groups and its salt at the wavenumbers of 1585 (C=O) and 1412 (C-O) cm−1. The TGA results of CMC exhibited the loss of carbon dioxide at ca. 260 – 300 °C. Moreover, a higher ash yield of the obtained CMC indicated the substitution of carboxymethyl in the structure. The CMC product structure was confirmed using 13C- and HMBC 2D-NMR. The HMBC 2D-NMR results indicated a correlation between carbonyl and methylene carbons of carboxymethyl groups and protons of pyranose ring, implying that pyranose ring was substituted successfully by monocholoroacetic acid (MCA). The optimal conditions were obtained by using 4.11 ml of 30%w/v NaOH and 1.4 g of MCA in 40 ml of isopropanol at ambient temperature.

Among the most widely recognized etiological models, immunopathogenesis is a predominant one. Numerous studies have demonstrated aberrant levels of inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain of patients with MDD. Multiple studies including meta-analyses have reported increased peripheral levels of acute phase proteins, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in MDD. Postmortem brain studies similarly demonstrated upregulated expressions of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. This along with evidence of monocytic, lymphocytic and microglial activation, suggest an activated inflammatory response system (IRS) in MDD. A few studies show increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines or defective inflammatory pathways and a deficit in T cell maturation and responses in MDD patients. This suggests the presence of a Compensatory Immune Response System (CIRS), which can counterbalance the effects of IRS in major depression. More recently, simultaneously increased levels of both the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines are reported in the brain of MDD patients; this indicates activity of both the IRS and CIRS in MDD. The IRS and CIRS are the evolutionarily conserved and integral elements of an overarching system. The relevance of a dysregulated IRS-CIRS system in the neurobiological construct of MDD is just beginning to be understood. Speculation is rife that the disrupted IRS-CIRS elements might determine the onset, episodes, neuroprogressive processes, treatment response as well as recovery of patients with MDD. Notably, the signatures of an activated IRS-CIRS might emerge as potential biomarkers of MDD. Herein, an attempt has been made to highlight the biology and pathobiological relevance of IRS-CIRS activation in MDD and provide an insight into the role of these components in pharmacological therapy.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single-center tertiary institution. Patients: Four-hundred twelve consecutive adult patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from 2009 to 2017. Results: Fifty-five patients (13.3%) had a CNS complication confirmed by CT or MRI, including ischemic stroke (7.0%), intracerebral hemorrhage (3.4%), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (3.6%), and spinal cord injury (1.2%). CNS complication rates in the venoarterial, venovenous, and veno-pulmonary artery extracorporeal membrane oxygenation subgroups were 18.0%, 4.6%, and 13.6%, respectively. Neurologic complications were independently associated with the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p = 0.002) and renal replacement therapy (p = 0.04). Sixty-five percent of patients with a neurologic complication died during their hospital admission compared with 32% of patients without this complication (p < 0.001). Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support were also associated with hospital mortality and remained so after adjustment in a multivariable regression model (p = 0.01, p < 0.001, and p = 0.003, respectively). Conclusions: CNS complications appear to occur more frequently in patients requiring circulatory as opposed to respiratory support on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and are independently associated with mortality.

This study evidenced the strong social hydrological linkages that exist in Cambodia, which allowed for presenting a broader understanding of water resources challenges to better formulate and connect policies at the local and national levels. Models are often not developed with household-or community-level input, but rather with national-or coarse-level datasets. The method used in this study consisted of linking qualitative and quantitative social analysis with a previously developed technical water planning model. The results from the social inequalities analysis were examined for three water use types: domestic, rice production, and fishing in three parts of the watershed, namely, upstream, midstream, and downstream. Knowledge generated from the social analysis was used to refine previous water planning modeling. The model results indicate that without household data to consider social inequalities, the technical analysis for the Stung Chinit watershed was largely underrepresenting the shortages in irrigation supply seen by groups in the most downstream sections of the irrigation system. Without adding social considerations into the model, new policies or water infrastructure development suggested by the model could reinforce existing inequalities.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

Using whole-exome sequencing, both were found to be heterozygous for c.737G>A (p.Arg246Gln) in LMX1B. The diagnosis of LMX1B-associated nephropathy has led to changes in the treatment plan with appropriate genetic counseling. The previously reported cases with this particular mutation were also reviewed. Most children with LMX1B-associated nephropathy had nonnephrotic proteinuria with normal renal function. Interestingly, our pediatric case presented with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at 8 years old and progressed to ESRD requiring peritoneal dialysis at the age of 15 years. Our report emphasized the need of genetic testing in CKDu for definite diagnosis leading to precise management.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Nephrology, Physiology (medical), Urology"

However, a survival benefit of LMWH over warfarin for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE has not been established. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results and Medicare linked database from 2007 through 2016, we identified Medicare beneficiaries (aged ≥66 years) who were: (1) diagnosed with primary gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, ovarian, or brain cancer; (2) diagnosed with cancer-associated VTE; and (3) prescribed LMWH or warfarin within 30 days. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Patients were matched 1:1 using exact matching for cancer stage and propensity score matching for cancer diagnosis, age, year of VTE, and time from cancer diagnosis to index VTE. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: A total of 9706 patients were included. Warfarin was associated with a significant improvement in OS compared with LMWH (median OS, 9.8 months [95% CI, 9.1–10.4] vs. 7.2 months [95% CI, 6.8–7.8]; HR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.83–0.90; p <.001). The survival advantage was most pronounced in pancreatic (HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74–0.90], p <.001) and gastric cancers (HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.98], p =.03). The observed differences in survival were consistent across subgroups including cancer stage, age, comorbidity burden, and year of VTE. Conclusions: In this population-based study, warfarin was associated with improved OS compared with LMWH for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE.",medical,Hematology
Histone Deacetylase 4 Controls Extracellular Matrix Production in Orbital Fibroblasts from Graves' Ophthalmopathy Patients,"Ekronarongchai S., Palaga T., Saonanon P., Pruksakorn V., Hirankarn N., Van Hagen P.M., Dik W.A., Virakul S.",2021-10-01,"Cell Proliferation, Cells, Cultured, Extracellular Matrix, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression, Graves Ophthalmopathy, Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, Histone Deacetylases, Humans, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Orbit, Repressor Proteins, RNA, Small Interfering, extracellular matrix, Graves' ophthalmopathy, histone deacetylases, orbital fibroblasts, platelet-derived growth factor-BB","Background: Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is an autoimmune eye disease with the characteristic symptoms of eyelid retraction and proptosis. Orbital fibroblast activation induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) stimulation plays a crucial role in GO pathogenesis, leading to excessive proliferation and extracellular matrix production by orbital fibroblasts. Currently, GO treatment options remain limited and novel therapies including targeted drugs are needed. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with the development and progression of several cancers and autoimmune diseases by epigenetically controlling gene transcription, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) may have therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, the role of HDACs in orbital fibroblasts from GO is unknown. Therefore, we studied the expression of HDACs as well as their contribution to extracellular matrix production in orbital fibroblasts. Methods: Orbital tissues were obtained from GO patients (n = 18) who underwent decompression surgery with approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine (Protocol number 401/61), Chulalongkorn University (Bangkok, Thailand). Furthermore, orbital tissue was obtained from control patients (n = 3) without inflammatory or thyroid disease who underwent surgery for cosmetic reasons. Orbital fibroblast cultures were established from the orbital tissues. HDAC mRNA and protein expression in orbital fibroblasts was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. PDGF-BB-activated orbital fibroblast and orbital tissues were treated with HDACis or HDAC4 small-interfering RNA. Results: PDGF-BB-stimulated orbital fibroblasts had upregulated HDAC4 mRNA and protein expression. HDAC4 mRNA expression was significantly higher in GO compared with healthy control orbital fibroblasts. Histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) decreased upon PDGF-BB stimulation. Treatment with HDAC4i (tasquinimod) and HDAC4/5i (LMK-235) significantly decreased both proliferation and hyaluronan production in PDGF-BB-stimulated orbital fibroblasts. HDAC4 silencing reduced mRNA expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), Ki67, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), as well as hyaluronan production in PDGF-BB-stimulated orbital fibroblasts. Tasquinimod significantly reduced HAS2 and α-SMA mRNA expression in whole orbital tissue. Conclusion: Our data indicated, for the first time, that altered HDAC4 regulation along with H3K9 hypoacetylation might represent a mechanism that contributes to excessive proliferation and extracellular matrix production by orbital fibroblasts in GO. HDAC4 might represent a novel target for GO therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

The disease is associated with characteristic lesions in the mucosa of affected fish, particularly their skin and gills. Vaccines delivered via the mucosa are therefore of great interest to scientists developing vaccines for this disease. In the present study, we characterized field isolates of F. columnare obtained from clinical columnaris outbreaks in red tilapia to select an isolate to use as a candidate for our vaccine study. This included characterizing its colony morphology, genotype and virulence status. The isolate was incorporated into a mucoadhesive polymer chitosan-complexed nanovaccine (CS-NE), the efficacy of which was determined by experimentally infecting red tilapia that had been vaccinated with the nanoparticles by immersion. The experimental infection was performed 30-days post-vaccination (dpv), which resulted in 89% of the unvaccinated control fish dying, while the relative percentage survival (RPS) of the CS-NE vaccinated group was 78%. Histology of the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) showed a significantly higher presence of leucocytes and a greater antigen uptake by the mucosal epithelium in CS-NE vaccinated fish compared to control fish and whole cell vaccinated fish, respectively, and there was statistically significant up-regulation of IgT, IgM, TNF α, IL1-β and MHC-1 genes in the gill of the CS-NE vaccinated group. Overall, the results of our study confirmed that the CS-NE particles achieved better adsorption onto the mucosal surfaces of the fish, elicited great vaccine efficacy and modulated the MALT immune response better than the conventional whole cell-killed vaccine, demonstrating the feasibility of the mucoadhesive nano-immersion vaccine as an effective delivery system for the induction of a mucosal immune response against columnaris disease in tilapia.","environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

Additionally, a comparison study of carbon ions versus protons is performed considering current best solutions in commercial TPS. Methods: All treatment plans were optimized and calculated using the RayStation TPS (RaySearch, Sweden). The dose distributions calculated with the TPS were compared with measurements using a 24-pinpoint ionization chamber array (T31015, PTW, Germany). Tissue-like inhomogeneities (bone, lung, and soft tissue) were embedded in water, while a target volume of 4 x 4 x 4 cm3 was defined at two different depths behind the heterogeneities. In total, 10 different test cases, with and without range shifter as well as different air gaps, were investigated. Dose distributions inside as well as behind the target volume were evaluated. Results: Inside the target volume, the mean dose difference between calculations and measurements, averaged over all test cases, was 1.6% for carbon ions. This compares well to the final agreement of 1.5% obtained in water at the commissioning stage of the TPS for carbon ions and is also within the clinically acceptable interval of 3%. The mean dose difference and maximal dose difference obtained outside the target area were 1.8% and 13.4%, respectively. The agreement of dose distributions for carbon ions in the target volumes was comparable or better to that between Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations and measurements for protons. Percentage dose differences of more than 10% were present outside the target area behind bone–lung structures, where the carbon ion calculations systematically over predicted the dose. MC dose calculations for protons were superior to carbon ion beams outside the target volumes. Conclusion: The pencil beam dose calculations for carbon ions in RayStation were found to be in good agreement with dosimetric measurements in heterogeneous geometries for points of interest located within the target. Large local discrepancies behind the target may contribute to incorrect dose predictions for organs at risk.","radiology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, medical","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

A shift from C. albicans to non-albicans Candida has been observed worldwide. This study aims to identify species of Candida and factors associated with the overall 30-day mortality rate. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted among children with culture-confirmed IC from birth to 15 years of age at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine associated factors with 30-day mortality. Results: From 2003 to 2019, 102 episodes of IC in pediatric group with a median age of 16 months (interquartile range 4-65) and 12 episodes of IC in neonatal group with a median age of 18 days (interquartile range 12-22). The species distribution were Candida albicans (35%), Candida parapsilosis (26%), Candida tropicalis (22%), Candida glabrata (6%) and other/unspecified species (11%). Antifungal treatment was given in 88% (67% Amphotericin B deoxycholate, 28% Fluconazole). Overall 30-day mortality rates were 28.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20.8%-38.4%] and 8.3% (95% CI 1.2%-46.1%) in pediatrics and neonates, respectively. Mortality rate among the neutropenic group was significantly higher than non-neutropenic group (46.4% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.005). Factors associated with 30-day mortality in pediatric IC were shock [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.2; 95% CI 1.8-9.4], thrombocytopenia (aHR 7.7; 95% CI 1.8-33.9) and no antifungal treatment (aHR 4.6; 95% CI 1.7-12.1). Conclusions: Two-third of children with IC were diagnosed with non-albicans Candida. Children with high mortality rate included those with neutropenia, presented with shock or thrombocytopenia, such that the proper empiric antifungal treatment is recommended.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

There have also been many studies on the essentials of disaster preparedness and recovery. However, few studies have investigated these factors in combination. Therefore, this study explored how demographic shifts such as a decreasing and aging population impact disaster recovery and efforts to build a sustainable soci-ety. It examined coastal communities in Japan’s Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures that were affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET) from the perspective of two disaster-recovery theories: (1) Bates and Peacock argued that disaster recovery continues or accelerates a community’s pre-disaster trends [1, 2]; and (2) Hirose argued that disaster-recovery efficacy depends on the disaster scale, outside aid, and community strength [3]. This study’s analy-ses support the first theory while stating that a com-munity’s pre-disaster demographic and social trends have a more significant effect on disaster recovery suc-cess than the disaster scale and outside aid considering the second theory. The study reiterates that disaster recovery begins before a disaster, and demographic variables should affect plans to build a sustainable so-ciety. Finally, this note shows how the lessons learned from the 2011 GEJET disaster can provide the insights to improve disaster risk management in societies with declining and aging populations.","accidentistrys and accidentistry prevention, fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

Thus, information regarding this issue is still requisite in Thailand. In this study, wastewater and sludge samples were collected from an activated sludge operation of an industrial WWTP in different seasons, that is, dry season and wet season. The MP particles were identified by size, shape, and polymer types under stereomicroscope and μFT-IR. From the wastewater, MPs were detected in the highest amounts after the aeration unit (134.35 ± 20.79 particles/L) during dry season and from influent (103.13 ± 59.48 particles/L) during wet season. In addition, sludge contained relatively low MP concentrations (2.27 ± 0.08 in the dry and 1.86 ± 0.28 particles/g dw. in the wet seasons). The size fraction in wastewater varied, but in sludge was &gt; 300 μm commonly in both seasons. Fragments and pellets were identified as the most common shape of wastewater and sludge in both seasons. The treatment units and seasonal variation had a significant effect on MP abundance. The suspected particle was confirmed to be 71.13% plastic polymer, mainly polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). The overall removal efficiency was 93.86%, indicating that there are many MPs still discharged to the river due to effluent MPs, which was approx. 1.8 × 108 particles per day. Consequently, this study suggests that, to define the effect of a season, prolonged monitoring is required. Moreover, the attention must be on WWTPs in Thailand, as they act as the greatest source of MP contamination in the environment.","environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"

The surfactants trap dirt and strains by micelles formation and removing dirt at concentration beyond the value at the CMC point. The CMC value can be extracted from the intersecting point between the two different linear fits of the contact angle as a function of the surfactant concentration, using image processing software and simple mathematic calculation. These CMC values of those cleaning agents are extremely helpful to reduce the use of excess chemicals and waste into an environment. In combination with the STEM concept, this instrument provides a simple design, easy to construct with high accuracy results. This interdisciplinary concept can be demonstrated as an excellent STEM tool for school or university students to explore the scientific phenomena at the surface which is no need for expensive equipment.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, sociology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous), Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Computer Science (miscellaneous), Information Systems and Management, Engineering (miscellaneous), Education"

Here, we report the first high-density survey of genomic variants for the Thai population, the Thai Reference Exome (T-REx) variant database. T-REx comprises exome sequencing data of 1092 unrelated Thai individuals. The targeted exome regions common among four capture platforms cover 30.04 Mbp on autosomes and chromosome X. 345 681 short variants (18.27% of which are novel) and 34 907 copy number variations were found. Principal component analysis on 38 469 single nucleotide variants present worldwide showed that the Thai population is most genetically similar to East and Southeast Asian populations. Moreover, unsupervised clustering revealed six Thai subpopulations consistent with the evidence of gene flow from neighboring populations. The prevalence of common pathogenic variants in T-REx was investigated in detail, which revealed subpopulation-specific patterns, in particular variants associated with erythrocyte disorders such as the HbE variant in HBB and the Viangchan variant in G6PD. T-REx serves as a pivotal addition to the current databases for genomic medicine.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics, human genetics, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

In contrast, supernatural fears do not involve direct experience but seem to be related to sensory or cognitive biases in the interpretation of stimuli as well as culturally driven cognitions and beliefs. In this multidisciplinary synthesis and collaborative review, we claim that supernatural beliefs are “super natural.” That is, they occur spontaneously and are easy to acquire, possibly because such beliefs rest on intuitive concepts such as mind-body dualism and animism, and may inspire fear in believers as well as non-believers. As suggested by psychological and neuroscientific evidence, they tap into an evolutionarily prepared fear of potential impending dangers or unknown objects and have their roots in “prepared fears” as well as “cognitively prepared beliefs,” making fear of supernatural agents a fruitful research avenue for social, anthropological, and psychological inquires.","neuroscienceoscience; integrative neuroscienceophysicsiology; neuroscienceobiology of stress, psychologyhiatry, psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Behavioral Neuroscience"

This research aims to design the conversion process of ethanol into a more versatile and valuable product, e.g., diethyl ether (DEE). To produce DEE, two types of ethanol can be utilized. Previously, the anhydrous ethanol was tested experimentally via catalytic dehydration on the Ru-HBZ catalyst. Satisfactory results were obtained, particularly acetaldehyde was not formed in the reaction. Herein, the catalytic experiment is extended using hydrous ethanol as feed resulting in an observable amount of acetaldehyde. These experimental results are implemented in the design of DEE production processes. Three production cases are investigated including the utilization of the anhydrous ethanol (Case I) and the utilization of the hydrous ethanol (Cases II and III). The most profitable process is obtained in Case I with the pay-out period of 4 years and % IRR (percentage of internal rate of return) of 55%. Acetaldehyde appears problematic in the DEE purification in Case II – the process is not profitable if distillation is selected for acetaldehyde removal. By implementing adsorption for the acetaldehyde removal, the process in Case III becomes profitable which is comparable to Case I. In addition, about a 5% reduction in the CO2 emission and a 7% gain in the energy utilization efficiency are observed in Case III. Finally, the utilization of hydrous ethanol (Case III) can be more attractive when the difference in selling prices of the hydrous and the anhydrous ethanols is more than 50%.","mixing and separation, energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The oil–water interfacial tension (IFT) and optimal salinity of the microemulsion systems with different equivalent alkane carbon numbers (EACN) were examined. The anionic–nonionic surfactant ratio was found to play a pivotal role in the phase transition, IFT, and optimal salinity. The minimum IFT of mixed SDHS − C12 − 14Ej systems were about three times lower than those of neat SDHS systems. A hydrophilic–lipophilic deviation (HLD) empirical model for the mixed anionic–nonionic surfactant system with the characteristic parameter was proposed, as represented in the excess free energy term (Formula presented.). The results suggested that the mixed system of SDHS − C12 − 14E1 was more lipophilic, while SDHS − C12 − 14E9 was more hydrophilic than the ideal mixture (no excess free energy during the microemulsion formation), and the SDHS − C12 − 14E5 system was close to the ideal mixture.

Hence, this work provided a fundamental understanding of coke and coking to achieve the desire performance for the Ni-based catalysts typically employed in the industrial via the control over the formation of deactivating coke – amorphous (Cβ), carbide (Cγ), and graphitic coke (CC) that associated directly to the catalyst performance. Therefore, it is demonstrated that during DRM and CSDRM, a low reaction temperature would result in a conversion that is too low to be a practical process, while around 600 °C, the Ni carbide (Cγ) would form in high quantity, and operating up to 800 °C will cause the catalyst performance to drop significantly due high amount of graphitic coke. The CSDRM process compared to DRM can reduce the deactivating coke from 25 – 38% to 2.5 – 21.4% on the Ni-based catalysts. This positive effect on coke-resistant is the elimination of Cβ formation, which is the reactant for the graphitic carbon formation, resulting in a decrease in the overall amount of deactivating coke. Hence, we suggested that one select CSDRM over DRM due to the promotional effect of steam associated with the mitigation of the total deactivating coke via the blocking of amorphous coke formation and the appropriate temperature prevent Cγ and CC formation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

We determine the optimum equilibrium point and derive a linearized model of MBR. Then, we design the state observer to estimate the non-measurable state using the pole placement method. Both the measurable output and estimated state are fed back through PID controller. The objectives of PID control consist of stabilization and performance improvement. Genetic Algorithm is applied to find the optimal PID parameters that minimize the integral of absolute error and satisfy the specified time-domain criteria. We apply the observer-based PID controller to the linearized model of MBR. Numerical results demonstrate the design of PID controller and the improvement of the closed-loop response and quality of the treated water.","computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Aerospace Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Control and Systems Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Optimal cloud orchestration model of containerized task scheduling strategy using integer linear programming: Case studies of iotcloudserve@tein project,"Swatthong N., Aswakul C.",2021-08-01,"Cloud architectures, Improving performance, Information networks, Integer Linear Programming, Networking environment, Resource availability, Round robin scheduling algorithms, Task completion time, Cloud computing, Cloud orchestration, Container technology, Integer linear programming","As a playground for cloud computing and IoT networking environment, IoTcloudServe@TEIN has been established in the Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN). In the IoTcloudServe@TEIN platform, a cloud orchestration for conducting the flow of IoT task demands is imperative for effectively improving performance. In this paper, we propose the model of optimal containerized task scheduling in cloud orchestration that maximizes the average payoff from completing tasks within the whole cloud system with different levels of cloud hierarchies. Based on integer linear programming, the model can take into account demand requirement and resource availability in terms of storage, computation, network, and splittable task granularity. To show the insights obtainable from the proposed model, the edge-core cluster of IoTcloudServe@TEIN and its peer-to-peer federated cloud scenario with OF@TEIN+ are numerically experimented and herein reported. To evaluate the model’s performance, payoff level and task completion time are considered by comparing with a well-known round-robin scheduling algorithm. The proposed ILP model can be a guideline for the cloud orchestration in IoTcloudserve@TEIN because of the lower task completion time and the higher payoff level especially upon the large demand growth, which is the major operation range of concerns in practice. Moreover, the proposed model illustrates mathematically the significance of implementing cloud architecture with refined splittable task granularity via the light-weighted container technology that has been used as the basis for IoTcloudServe@TEIN clustering design.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Towards high carbon conversion efficiency by using a tailored electrodialysis process for in-situ carboxylic acids recovery,"Zhao W., Jegatheesan V., Liang Q., Soontarapa K., Jiang H., Zhang Y., Yan B.",2021-05-15,"Acid recovery, Acidogenic fermentation, Anaerobic fermentation, Carbon conversion rate, Carbon conversions, Energy-consumption, High carbons, Inorganic carbon, Low-yield, Organic wastes, Acidogenic fermentation, Carbon conversion rate, Carboxylic acids, Electrodialysis, Energy consumption","Production of carboxylic acids from anaerobic fermentation has gained increasing attention. However, acidogenic fermentation is still facing challenges such as low yield of carboxylic acids and difficulties in product recovery and purification. The emission of acidogenic off-gas CO2 leads to a reduced carbon recovery (∼70%) and also increases the carbon footprint of the anaerobic treatment process. In this study, a tailored electrodialysis stack was integrated with a fermenter to recover the products and hence to improve quantity and quality of the produced carboxylic acids. Three levels of currents, i.e., 0.4, 1, and 4 A (T1, T2, and T3), were applied during electrodialytic separation of carboxylic acids and 12 cycles of electrodialysis were carried out to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. Results showed that different degrees of carboxylic acids removal led to varied impacts on the yield of carboxylic acids, economic viability, and the instability of microbial community. Compared with the case without coupling electrodialysis process, the carbon conversion rate increased by 28.04% in T3, which was due to the reuse of inorganic carbon introduced by a tailored electrodialysis process. After 12 cycles of fermentation, the percentage of Clostridiales finally increased from 0.11% (inoculum) to 31.15% in T3, which also confirmed the possible autotrophic acidogenesis by using inorganic carbon. This work would provide a promising solution to improve the recovery of carboxylic acids from organic wastes and achieve minimum carbon footprint in the organic waste management process.","mixing and separation, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
The importance of parameter-dependent coefficient of restitution in discrete element method simulations,"Yurata T., Gidaspow D., Piumsomboon P., Chalermsinsuwan B.",2021-04-01,"Coefficient of restitution, Collision incidents, Discrete element method simulations, Material combination, Operating condition, Parameter dependents, Particle trajectories, Spherical particle, Coefficient of restitution, Collision, Discrete element method, Drop test, Parameter-dependent coefficient of restitution","The coefficient of restitution (COR) is an important constant that represents the energy dissipation during contact between two objects. Simulation using the conventional discrete element method (DEM) involves a constant COR. This study presents a DEM simulation method that uses a parameter-dependent COR. The parameter-dependent COR was obtained from a collision incident between spherical particles and a plate surface using a drop-test apparatus. Glass and polypropylene beads of 3–6-mm diameter were used while acrylic and steel were used as the plate surfaces. The particle trajectories were captured by a high-speed camera and analyzed by an image analyzer. The COR was then correlated to a parameter-dependent COR function that depends on the material, impact velocity, and temperature. Free-fall DEM simulations using a constant COR and parameter-dependent COR were compared. The parameter-dependent COR approach obtained better agreement with experimental results than the constant-COR approach. The proposed concept could be applied for other material combinations with a wide range of operating conditions to obtain a database of parameter-dependent COR values for the simulation of solid handling applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Mechanics of Materials"
Remediation of punching shear failure using glass fiber reinforced polymer (Gfrp) rods,"Yooprasertchai E., Dithaem R., Arnamwong T., Sahamitmongkol R., Jadekittichoke J., Joyklad P., Hussain Q.",2021-07-02,"American Concrete Institute, Deformation capacity, Energy dissipation capacities, Experimental program, Flexural reinforcement, Glass fiber reinforced polymer, Longitudinal strain, Shear strengthening, Ductility, Energy dissipation capacity, Flat slab, GFRP rods, Punching shear failure","The results of an experimental program on shear-strengthening of flat slabs using Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rods are presented. A total of seven specimens were tested under an upward concentric monotonic loading until failure. One specimen served as a control and was tested without any modification. The remaining six specimens were strengthened with post-in-stalled GFRP rods in single (SG), double (DB), and radial (RD) patterns within shear critical parameters around the centric column. The results of this experimental study suggest that GFRP rods are capable of enhancing both the peak load and deformation capacity. Furthermore, brittle failure associated with punching shear failure was successfully avoided by all strengthening patterns. Of all of the patterns, the RD pattern resulted in maximum peak load increase and corresponding deformation capacity while the lowest bound was created by the SG pattern. The results suggested that SG, DB and RD patterns enhanced ultimate loads up to 9.1, 11.3 and 15.7% while corresponding deflections increased up to 109, 136 and 154%. Strain measurement on flexural reinforcement suggested that all strengthened specimens were able to withstand higher longitudinal strains than yield. It was further shown that reducing the spacing between the GFRP rods efficiently enhanced peak loads, nevertheless, neither this change was proportional, nor did it result in an enhanced energy dissipation capacity. In the end, recommendations of American Concrete Institute (ACI) for the shear strength of two-way systems were modified to incorporate the contributions from GFRP rods. The results indicate that the proposed analytical approach provides an excellent match with the experimental results.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

However, despite good early results, they lack durability. This study was designed to compare single-center results of implantation of 3 types of right ventricular outflow tract conduit, in terms of patient survival, graft failure, reoperation, and risk factors for reoperation. Methods: One hundred and forty-three pediatric patients who underwent right ventricular outflow tract conduit implantation between January 2006 and December 2018 were reviewed. We stratified conduits by aortic, pulmonic homograft, and Contegra; 74 aortic homografts, 61 pulmonic homografts, and 8 Contegra conduits were implanted. Median age at implantation was 3 years. The primary diagnosis was truncus arteriosus in 41.3%. We analyzed the role of sex, age, diagnosis, and graft size. Endpoints included freedom from graft failure, freedom from reoperation, and survival. Results: The survival rate was 83.2% at 10 years. Freedom from graft failure at 2, 5, and 10 years was 100%, 97.9%, and 63.4%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation was 85.8% for pulmonic homografts and 74.9% for aortic homografts at 10 years, and 100% for Contegra at 6 years. Multivariable analysis identified conduit diameter <18 mm as a risk factor for reoperation (hazard ratio: 3.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.38–7.23, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Homograft valves used for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction provided excellent long-term durability and late survival. The only factor that adversely affected graft longevity was small graft size (diameter <18 mm). Reoperation for conduit failure was not significantly different among the groups.",medical,"Surgery, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

The control objectives are to minimize the total operating cost (TOC) and the thermal comfort cost (TCC). According to practical realization, a coefficient of performance (COP) is a time-varying parameter of HVAC system and depends on environment conditions. Therefore, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) with k-means clustering to predict the COP. We design the SMPC to determine the optimal set-point temperature for the HVAC system which serves our control objectives. We utilize the predicted mean vote (PMV) to handle thermal comfort of occupants and to indicate an acceptable bound of the optimal set-point temperature. We formulate the SMPC with the predicted COP integration as two quadratic programs. The first quadratic program is a supervisory control problem for optimal set-point searching problem and the other is an MPC problem for optimal control input searching problem. Our results reveal that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the predicted COP is reduced by 34% using the clustered-ANN. When the SMPC is applied to the time-varying HVAC system, the TOC decreases by 14.53% compared to that of the nominal operation. Moreover, the maximum electrical power of the HVAC system is reduced by 15.66% resulting from smoothly shaved electrical power profile.","heat exchange, computer science, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Control and Systems Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study aimed to characterize drug-specific T cells from three co-trimoxazole hypersensitive patients presenting with either Stevens-Johnson syndrome or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Two of the patients carried the HLA allele of interest, namely HLA-B*13:01. Sulfamethoxazole and nitroso sulfamethoxazole specific T cell clones were generated from T cell lines of co-trimoxazole hypersensitive HLA-B*13:01-positive patients. Clones were characterized for antigen specificity and cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds by measuring proliferation and cytokine release. Surface marker expression was characterized via flow cytometry. Mechanistic studies were conducted to assess pathways of T cell activation in response to antigen stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients were stimulated to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ with nitroso sulfamethoxazole. All sulfamethoxazole and nitroso sulfamethoxazole specific T cell clones expressed the CD4+ phenotype and strongly secreted IL-13 as well as IFN-γ, granzyme B and IL-22. No secretion of IL-17 was observed. A number of nitroso sulfamethoxazole-specific clones cross-reacted with nitroso dapsone but not sulfamethoxazole whereas sulfamethoxazole specific clones cross-reacted with nitroso sulfamethoxazole only. The nitroso sulfamethoxazole specific clones were activated in both antigen processing-dependent and -independent manner, while sulfamethoxazole activated T cell responses via direct HLA binding. Furthermore, activation of nitroso sulfamethoxazole-specific, but not sulfamethoxazole-specific, clones was blocked with glutathione. Sulfamethoxazole and nitroso sulfamethoxazole specific T cell clones from hypersensitive patients were CD4+ which suggests that HLA-B*13:01 is not directly involved in the iatrogenic disease observed in co-trimoxazole hypersensitivity patients.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

A fourth-order nonlocal strain gradient model based on a thermodynamic approach is employed to represent the small-scale effect (nonlocal effect) while the Gurtin-Murdoch continuum model based on the surface elastic theory is used to account for the size-dependent effect (surface energy effect). The proposed model is derived from the virtual displacement principle, leading to the governing differential equations and its associated natural boundary conditions. The analytical solutions of the sixth-order governing differential equation for the nanowire-substrate element are provided, and were employed in numerical simulations. Two numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the performance and to investigate the characteristics of the fourth-order nonlocal strain gradient model on nanowire responses, when compared to the classical model and the second-order nonlocal strain gradient model. The first simulation investigates the influences of nonlocal and surface effects on the responses of a nanowire embedded in an elastic substrate, while the second simulation study assessed the sensitivity of system stiffness on parameters in the nanowire-substrate model.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The overuse of insecticides has contributed to both human health and environmental problems. The hexane extracts of Illicium verum (HS) and Syzygium aromaticum (HC) were evaluated against bruchid beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus and Callosobruchus chinensis). The insecticidal activities and enhancing seed germination after being coated by various concentrations of extracts, purified fraction (PF) of extracts, standard chemicals of PF, fipronil insecticide (FI), and coating agent groups were evaluated after stored. RESULTS: Both HS and HC at 3% concentrations were more effective against C. maculatus than C. chinensis with LT50 values of 1.60–1.90 and 3.44–3.62 h, respectively. They could also kill those insects with a higher number than that of standards. The HS and HC could inhibit the progeny population of those insects over 95.6% with no significant difference compared to the FI group. The eugenol standard was the most effective and completely inhibited the emergence compared with trans-anethol standard and PFs. The seed that was coated with 1% of HS and stored at 4 °C for 6 months showed no effect on seed germination with no significant difference between FI and control groups. CONCLUSION: The application of 1% of HS incorporated in the film seed coating against bruchid beetles and did not affect seed germination quality after 6 months. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","biological and integrated control, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Agronomy and Crop Science, Insect Science"

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that the backbone of the highly connective network of IS death consisted of IL6, ALB, TNF, SERPINE1, VWF, VCAM1, TGFB1, and SELE. Cluster analysis revealed immune and hemostasis subnetworks, which were strongly interconnected through the major switches ALB and VWF. Enrichment analysis revealed that the PPI immune subnetwork of death due to IS was highly associated with TLR2/4, TNF, JAK-STAT, NOD, IL10, IL13, IL4, and TGF-β1/SMAD pathways. The top biological and molecular functions and pathways enriched in the hemostasis network of death due to IS were platelet degranulation and activation, the intrinsic pathway of fibrin clot formation, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator pathway, post-translational protein phosphorylation, integrin cell-surface interactions, and the proteoglycan-integrin extracellular matrix complex (ECM). Regulation Explorer analysis of transcriptional factors shows: (a) that NFKB1, RELA and SP1 were the major regulating actors of the PPI network; and (b) hsa-mir-26-5p and hsa-16-5p were the major regulating microRNA actors.

This study addressed two objectives based on the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. Firstly, to find out whether the maximum values of the flow depth and flow velocity are the same as their critical values and, secondly, to verify which combination of the parameters is the best predictor of the building damage level. The data from 18,000 buildings in Ishinomaki City, Japan, with the cooperation of the Japanese joint survey team, were analyzed using the decision tree related algorithms. The critical variables were the simulated data at the time when the buildings collapsed. The analysis showed the accuracy of the prediction based on the group of variables.

Presence of MAbs was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Spot urine was obtained from patients with kidney disease, type I, or type II Diabetes Mellitus upon their visit at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during 2018–2019. All samples were analyzed for urine albumin with our POCT (CU microalbumin) and the other two commercial POCTs (Microalbu PHAN and MICRAL). The results were validated against standard method for urine microalbumin measurement. A urine microalbumin concentration of less than 20 ug/ml was defined as normal. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated in comparison with the standard laboratory method. Result: A total of 100 adult patients were included. CU microalbumin had a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 94%, and a positive predictive value of 96%. Our POCT showed good correlation with the laboratory results. Conclusion: CU microalbumin correlated well with the standard method for quantitative measurement of urine albumin. Therefore, it has the potential for early screening of CKD, especially in primary health care facilities in resource limited settings.","medical, biochemistryistry, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Hematology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Clinical Biochemistry, Medical Laboratory Technology, Biochemistry (medical), Microbiology (medical)"
Metabolic syndrome in Thai adolescents and associated factors: the Thai National Health Examination Survey V (NHES V),"Siwarom S., Aekplakorn W., Pirojsakul K., Paksi W., Kessomboon P., Neelapaichit N., Chariyalertsak S., Assanangkornchai S., Taneepanichskul S.",2021-12-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Child, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Metabolic Syndrome, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Thailand, Waist Circumference, Adolescents, Metabolic syndrome, Prevalence, Risk factors","Background: Presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in early life may influence cardiovascular outcome later in adulthood. There is limited data regarding MetS among Thai adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MetS and related factors in Thai adolescents. Methods: Data on MetS components of 1934 Thai adolescents aged 10–16 years were obtained from the 5th National Health Examination Survey. Age at first screen time exposure, duration of screen time, frequency of food intake and physical activities were collected from interviews. MetS was defined according to 3 definitions: International Diabetes Federation (IDF), Cook’s, and de Ferranti’s. Results: The prevalence of MetS was 4.1% by IDF, 8.0% by Cook’s, and 16.8% by de Ferranti’s definition. The overall prevalence was higher in male (19.0%) than female adolescents (15.3%). The most common MetS components composition among Thai adolescents was high waist circumference with high serum triglyceride and low HDL-cholesterol (40.0% for IDF, 22.6% for Cook’s and 43.5% for de Ferranti’s definition). Exposure to screen media during the first 2 years of life had a 1.3- fold increased odds of MetS by 1 out of 3 definitions (OR 1.30, 95% CI. 1.01–1.68). Duration of physical activity associated with decreased odds of MetS by Cook’s definition (OR 0.96, 95% CI. 0.92–0.99). Conclusions: The prevalence of MetS among Thai adolescents was higher than previously reported by other studies. Screen media exposure during the first 2 years of life should be discouraged and measures to promote physical activity among children and adolescents should be strengthen.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

CFD simulation and statistical experimental design analysis of core annular flow in T-junction and Y-junction for oil-water system,"Dianita C., Piemjaiswang R., Chalermsinsuwan B.",2021-12-01,"Core flow, Core-annular flow, Flow performance, Oil water flow, Oil/water, Statistical experimental design, T-pipe, T-shaped junctions, Y-pipe, Y-shaped junctions, CFD, Core-flow, Hydrodynamics, Oil-water flow, T-pipes, Y-pipes","One of the big challenges in transporting heavy oils through the pipelines is the high pressure drop due to the effect of viscosity and shear-thinning fluid behaviour of oil. Core annular technique has been applied in industry for transporting heavy oil via pipelines to considerably reduce pressure drop. Several studies have been conducted related to oil-water core annular flow (CAF) within pipelines. However, limited works are found in cases of CAF in widely used T and Y-shaped junction pipes which have important roles for dividing or combining the flow. In this study, a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach was applied to simulate the high viscous oil-water CAF through T and Y-shaped junction pipe configurations. The 2k factorial statistical experimental design was applied to investigate the effect of pipe diameter and junction angle on the flow performance through T and Y-shaped junction pipes. Eight cases were run with different junction pipe configuration combinations. By applying the factorial designs method, all possible combinations of factors were able to be investigated with lowest numbers of simulation run. The selected response variables of the flow system were the average values of oil hold up and pressure gradient as well as the standard deviation of pressure from inlet to outlets of pipes. It was observed that the stability of CAF was not achieved at the downstream region. The flow transformed into stratified and slug flow. The most attractive design was measured by the small average of pressure gradient and standard deviation of pressure but with a high value of oil holdup. The T-shaped pipe with smaller inlet diameter combined with larger outlet diameter showed the most considerable effect for a better flow performance.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Digital health technology for non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease: Futile or future?,"van Wamelen D.J., Sringean J., Trivedi D., Carroll C.B., Schrag A.E., Odin P., Antonini A., Bloem B.R., Bhidayasiri R., Chaudhuri K.R.",2021-08-01,"Biomedical Technology, Digital Technology, Female, Humans, Male, Monitoring, Physiologic, Parkinson Disease, Symptom Assessment, Accelerometer, Non-motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease, Sensor, Wearable","Introduction: There is an ongoing digital revolution in the field of Parkinson's disease (PD) for the objective measurement of motor aspects, to be used in clinical trials and possibly support therapeutic choices. The focus of remote technologies is now also slowly shifting towards the broad but more “hidden” spectrum of non-motor symptoms (NMS). Methods: A narrative review of digital health technologies for measuring NMS in people with PD was conducted. These digital technologies were defined as assessment tools for NMS offered remotely in the form of a wearable, downloadable as a mobile app, or any other objective measurement of NMS in PD that did not require a hospital visit and could be performed remotely. Searches were performed using peer-reviewed literature indexed databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials), as well as Google and Google Scholar. Results: Eighteen studies deploying digital health technology in PD were identified, for example for the measurement of sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension. In addition, we describe promising developments in other conditions that could be translated for use in PD. Conclusion: Unlike motor symptoms, non-motor features of PD are difficult to measure directly using remote digital technologies. Nonetheless, it is currently possible to reliably measure several NMS and further digital technology developments are underway to offer further capture of often under-reported and under-recognised NMS.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"
Erianthridin Induces Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Apoptosis through the Suppression of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase Activity,"Boonjing S., Pothongsrisit S., Wattanathamsan O., Sritularak B., Pongrakhananon V.",2021-04-01,"Apoptosis, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cell Line, Tumor, Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Phenanthrenes, apoptosis, Bcl-2 family proteins, Dendrobium densiflorum, erianthridin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, non-small cell lung cancer cells, Orchidaceae","Due to the high mortality of lung cancer, natural derivative compounds have been promoted as versatile sources for anticancer drug discovery. Erianthridin, a phenanthrene compound isolated from Dendrobium formosum, exhibits intriguing apoptosis-inducing effects in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Apoptotic nuclei staining assays showed that apoptotic cells with DNA fragmentation and apoptotic bodies were apparent, and an increase in annexin V-FITC-positive cells were found in cells treated with erianthridin. The apoptosis protein markers for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase were significantly upregulated in response to erianthridin. A mechanistic investigation revealed that erianthridin was able to attenuate extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity and thereby mediate apoptosis through the modulation of Bcl-2 family protein levels. U0126, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor, augmented the apoptosis-inducing effect of erianthridin; in contrast, overexpression of exogenous extracellular signal-regulated kinase substantially abrogated erianthridin activity. Furthermore, an in vitro 3D tumorigenesis assay showed that erianthridin was able to potentially suppress lung cancer cell proliferation. This study is the first to report a promising cytotoxic effect of erianthridin, which provides preclinical evidence for further research and development of this compound.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"
Specific interaction of DDX6 with an RNA hairpin in the 39 UTR of the dengue virus genome mediates G1 phase arrest,"Choksupmanee O., Tangkijthavorn W., Hodge K., Trisakulwattana K., Phornsiricharoenphant W., Narkthong V., Tulakarnwong S., Ngamphiw C., Tongsima S., Chimnaronk S.",2021-09-01,"3' Untranslated Regions, DEAD-box RNA Helicases, Dengue, Dengue Virus, G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints, Genome, Viral, Humans, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RNA, Viral, Virus Replication, Cell cycle, Dengue virus, DENV, Host-virus interaction, RNA helicase, Untranslated region, UTR, Viral RNA","The extent to which viral genomic RNAs interact with host factors and contribute to host response and disease pathogenesis is not well known. Here, we report that the human RNA helicase DDX6 specifically binds to the viral most conserved RNA hairpin in the A3 element in the dengue 39UTR, with nanomolar affinities. DDX6 CLIP confirmed the interaction in HuH-7 cells infected by dengue virus serotype 2. This interaction requires three conserved residues—Lys307, Lys367, and Arg369—as well as the unstructured extension in the C-terminal domain of DDX6. Interestingly, alanine substitution of these three basic residues resulted in RNA-independent ATPase activity, suggesting a mechanism by which RNA-binding and ATPase activities are coupled in DEAD box helicases. Furthermore, we applied a cross-omics gene enrichment approach to suggest that DDX6 is functionally related to cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenicity. Indeed, infected cells exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and a decrease in the early S phase. Exogenous expression of intact DDX6, but not A3-binding-deficient mutants, alleviated these effects by rescue of the DNA preinitiation complex expression. Disruption of the DDX6-binding site was found in dengue and Zika live-attenuated vaccine strains. Our results suggested that dengue virus has evolved an RNA aptamer against DDX6 to alter host cell states and defined DDX6 as a new regulator of G1/S transition. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by mosquitoes to humans, infecting 390 million individuals per year globally. About 20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. There is currently no specific treatment for dengue diseases, and the molecular mechanism underlying dengue pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we combined biochemical, bioinformatics, high-content analysis and RNA sequencing approaches to characterize a highly conserved interface of the RNA genome of DENV with a human factor named DDX6 in infected cells. The significance of our research is in identifying the mechanism for a viral strategy to alter host cell fates, which conceivably allows us to generate a model for live-attenuated vaccine and the design of new therapeutic reagent for dengue diseases.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Microbiology, Immunology, Insect Science, Virology"

The effects of hydrothermal (HT) and ethanol organosolv (OS) pretreatments on the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of RW were investigated in the study reported. HT with temperatures above 190 °C significantly enhanced the anaerobic digestibility of RW mainly due to the degradation of hemicellulose. On the other hand, OS with 75% ethanol provided a potential methane gas yield of 165.1 L CH4/kg-VS, which was higher than that for HT at 210 and 230 °C by 39 and 7%, respectively. This was due to intensive delignification during OS pretreatment which led to a reduction in the non-productive adsorption of cellulolytic enzymes by lignin. A first-order kinetic model showed that OS had a higher hydrolysis rate (k = 0.073 ± 0.003 day−1) resulting in a higher methane yield when lower pretreatment temperatures were applied. The anaerobic degradation of the pretreated RW in this study was a result of simultaneous CH4 production through the symbiosis of anaerobic bacteria and methanogens using a combination of the aceticlastic and hydrogenothrophic bioconversion pathways. The recovery and use of the phenolic compounds remaining in the process water would be a way of adding value to this process and the feasibility of producing methane from RW should be further investigated.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Recent studies report a high incidence and prevalence of HIV among Thai YMSM. The Thai national guidelines have recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since 2014 for key populations; free PrEP has been piloted since 2019. Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an optimal platform for innovative PrEP adherence interventions for Thai YMSM. Objective: This study aims to adapt the P3 (Prepared, Protected, emPowered) app, developed with YMSM and transwomen in the United States to improve PrEP adherence and persistence for YMSM in Thailand. The app aims to provide daily adherence support and addresses gaps in staff available for large-scale PrEP rollout needed to see population-level effects of HIV prevention. Methods: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with YMSM and key informant interviews (KIIs) with PrEP care providers in Bangkok, Thailand, to investigate PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers, preferences for functions and features in mHealth apps among YMSM, and how to best adapt the P3 app to the Thai context. We conducted four FGDs with 4-8 participants per group and 15 KIIs. Results: For FGDs, 23 YMSM participated with a mean age of 20 years (range 18-21), 96% (22/23) enrolled in full-time education, and all owned smartphones. The mean age of KII participants was 40 (range 26-60) years; most were state health service providers, with the majority being counselors (6/15, 40%) and physicians (6/15, 40%). Overall, the facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence identified were similar to those of MSM and YMSM globally including the United States. Key themes included general recommendations for improving mHealth apps in Thailand, such as presenting reliable information in an appealing format, minimizing privacy risks, and addressing connectivity challenges. Additional themes focused on P3 Thailand adaptations and were related to cultural and stylistic preferences, engagement strategies, and recommendations for new functions. To develop the adapted app, P3 Thailand, these findings were balanced with resource limitations resulting in the prioritization of minor modifications: Changes in app esthetics (color scheme, iconography, and imagery) and changes in the presentation of information in two of the app's features. FGDs identified similar PrEP adherence facilitators and barriers to those already addressed within the app. Conclusions: The core elements of the P3 app address major PrEP facilitators and barriers for Thai YMSM; however, changes to the app features, including stylistic presentation, were needed to appropriately customize the app to the Thai context. Given the similarities of facilitators and barriers for PrEP adherence globally, adapting existing PrEP mHealth solutions based on input from end users and key informants provides a promising approach. However, partnerships with local app designers and developers can improve the adaptation process and final product.",medical,Health Informatics
Hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfide over modified Al2O3 by platinum and barium in a packed-bed reactor,"Nimthuphariyha K., Usmani A., Grisdanurak N., Kanchanatip E., Yan M., Suthirakun S., Tulaphol S.",2021-01-01,"Alternative technologies, Catalytic deactivation, Chemicals productions, COS hydrolysis, Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy, Integrated gasification combined cycle, Modified Al2O3, Weight hourly space velocity, Ba promoter, Catalytic deactivation, COS hydrolysis, Modified Al2O3","The integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) has been applied as an alternative technology for power plant due to the higher thermal efficiency than that of conventional pulverized coal-fired technology. However, syngas produced from coal gasification in IGCC is usually contaminated with carbonyl sulfide (COS). Therefore, it is necessary to be treated before being utilized in gas turbine or chemicals production. In this paper, catalytic treatment of COS by hydrolysis over alumina-supported platinum (Pt/Al2O3) catalysts was investigated. COS was hydrolyzed and converted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in a packed-bed reactor under flue-gas in a temperature range of 150–250 °C, and Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) of 7,000 hr−1. The optimal Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were determined by varying active Pt metal (0.1–1.0 wt%) loadings and barium promoter (1–5 wt%) loadings. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and desorption, and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). It was found that the activity of Al2O3 drastically dropped from 90 to 10% after 510 min time on stream. The addition of Pt and Ba onto Al2O3 could stabilize the catalytic activity. The 0.5%Pt/5.0%Ba/Al2O3 catalyst provided the best performance in COS hydrolysis. The complete COS conversion was achieved with 0.5%Pt/5.0%Ba/Al2O3 in all initial concentrations, and the lifespan of the catalyst was prolonged. A kinetic model of this reaction was also purposed. Sulfur poisoning and carbon deposition on the catalyst surface caused the catalyst deactivation.","process equipment, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The molecular docking results suggested that, among 78 vinyl sulfones, there were eight compounds that could interact well with the EGFR-TK at the ATP-binding site. Afterwards, these screened compounds were tested for the inhibitory activity towards EGFR-TK using ADP-Glo™ kinase assay, and we found that only VF16 compound exhibited promising inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK with the IC50 value of 7.85 ± 0.88 nM. In addition, VF16 showed a high cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 33.52 ± 2.57, 54.63 ± 0.09, and 30.38 ± 1.37 µM against the A431, A549, and H1975 cancer cell lines, respectively. From 500-ns MD simulation, the structural stability of VF16 in complex with EGFR-TK was quite stable, suggesting that this compound could be a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting EGFR-TK.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

In the current study, the antibacterial activity of gold nanoparticles has been evaluated on selected human pathogens. Methods: In this study, we used panchagavya (PG) to synthesize gold nanoparticles, and the resulting nanoparticles (PG-AuNPs) were characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. In addition, antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied by well diffusion method. Results: The synthesis of AuNPs was affirmed by a colour change, which was further validated by UV–vis spectra with a maximum absorption peak at 527 nm. Bandgap energy was calculated as 2.13 eV by Tauc method from the UV result. The presence of amino acids and proteins in PG was responsible for the conversion of gold ions to AuNPs, according to FTIR analysis. (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystallographic planes were observed by XRD; further crystalline nature was validated by SAED analysis. The size and zeta value were found to be 53.29 nm and -9.8 mV respectively. Spherical shaped nanoparticles and elemental structure of PG-AuNPs were confirmed by HRTEM and EDS analysis. The antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs showed the maximum and minimum zone of inhibition against K. pneumoniae (17.12 ± 0.14 mm) and B. subtilis (11.42 ± 0.58 mm). Conclusion: Antibacterial activity of PG-AuNPs was found to be strong against gram negative bacteria and moderate against gram positive bacteria. Based on the result, it was concluded that PG-AuNPs could be used to combat antibiotic drug resistance. Besides, in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies of PG-AuNPs should be conducted.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The study aimed to determine the effect of a telemonitoring system on CPAP therapy adherence among Asian patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 60 Asian adults (70%male) withmoderate-to-severe OSA. Thirty patients each were randomized to a group usingCPAPwith a telemonitoring system or a group using CPAPwith usual care. The telemonitoring system functioned by transferringCPAP-usagedata via cellular network. When there were any triggers occurring 2 nights consecutively (usage hours < 4 hours per night; leakage > 27 L/min or AHI > 5 events/h), the investigator contacted the patients. The primary outcome was the 4-week CPAP usage hours per night. The secondary outcomes included the percentage of good adherence (defined as a 4-week period of therapy with CPAP usage > 4 hours/night on > 70% of total days), median leakage per night, adverse events from CPAP therapy, sleep quality improvement, and daytime sleepiness reduction. Results: The mean AHI was 50.3 events/h. The mean 4-week CPAP usage hours per night were insignificantly higher in the telemonitoring group (5.16 ± 1.47 hours/night vs 4.42 ± 1.91 hours/night; P =.18). However, the percentage of good adherence was significantly higher in the telemonitoring group (64.2% vs 34.4%; P =.024).Median leakage per night was also significantly lower in the telemonitoring group. Furthermore, significant sleep quality improvement was observed in the telemonitoring group. Overall adverse events and daytime sleepiness reduction were not different. Conclusions: The telemonitoring system implementation showed a trend toward increasing CPAP nightly usage hours and significantly improved adherence and sleep quality among Asian patients with moderate-to-severe OSA.",medical,Medicine (all)
Reducing Spelling Inconsistencies in Code-Switching Asr Using Contextualized Ctc Loss,"Naowarat B., Kongthaworn T., Karunratanakul K., Wu S.H., Chuangsuwanich E.",2021-01-01,"Automatic speech recognition, Character-based models, Code-switching, Ground truth, Multiple languages, Temporal classification, Code-switching, Connectionist temporal classification, Context prediction, End-to-end speech recognition","Code-Switching (CS) remains a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially character-based models. With the combined choice of characters from multiple languages, the outcome from character-based models suffers from phoneme duplication, resulting in language-inconsistent spellings. We propose Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) loss to encourage spelling consistencies of a character-based nonautoregressive ASR which allows for faster inference. The model trained by CCTC loss is aware of contexts since it learns to predict both center and surrounding letters in a multi-task manner. In contrast to existing CTC-based approaches, CCTC loss does not require frame-level alignments, since the context ground truth is obtained from the model's estimated path. Compared to the same model trained with regular CTC loss, our method consistently improved the ASR performance on both CS and monolingual corpora.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Mangifera indica leaf extract (MILE), coated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) at concentrations of 3, 5, 7, and 9 mM, were prepared using the Turkevich method (a relatively simple and reproducible technique for the synthesis of spherical particles). The nanoparticle size of 5 mM gold in trisodium citrate was 31.73 ± 0.59 nm, which is the most appropriate size for modifying a surface with MILE at 0.1% due to its small size and stabilizer qualities. Compared with arsenic on selectivity, the effect of the other metal ions, including (Cd(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), Mn(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III)) was studied. The results indicated that MILE/AuNPs showed the highest specific selectivity as As-MILE/AuNPs formation of complexes. Moreover, electrical chemical efficiency was performed by cyclic and square wave voltammetry. The experiment showed that gold nanoparticles improved with 0.1% MILE can detect arsenic ions with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.04 ppb, which is below the World Health Organization's (WHO) permissible limit of 10 ppb. Thus, the electrical chemical sensor that improved screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE)-modified surfaces with 0.1% MILE-coated AuNPs could be used to effectively detect arsenic ions.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

This study demonstrates the preparation of a novel V2O5 composite grown on a biodegradable ceramic material of three-dimensional (3D) vanadium aluminum carbide (V2O5@V2AlC) with a convenient thermal oxidation process to reinforce its structural stability for improved electrochemical performance. The physicochemical properties of the composite were investigated using X-ray diffraction for phase analysis, scanning electron microscopy for surface morphology, energy dispersive X-ray for elemental composition, and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller analysis for specific surface area measurements. When investigated as supercapacitor electrodes in three different aqueous electrolytic media such as acidic (1 M H2SO4), neutral (0.5 M K2SO4), and alkaline (1 M KOH) solution, the composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in the neutral solution. The maximum specific areal capacitance of 680 mF cm−2 at 5 mVs −1 and 740 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 was obtained and with improved cyclic stability. The enhanced capacitance properties and extended cyclic life along with the lower charge transfer resistance of the 3D-V2O5@V2AlC composite can be attributed to the strong mechanical properties of the material with an excellent capacitive contribution.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Science (all), Soil Science, Plant Science"

Measurements of the number of flocs and their size distributions are performed by means of shadowgraphy method and image analysis. Thanks to a coupling between population size distributions and results on local hydrodynamics, the evolution of the number of aggregates along the jet is directly correlated to the recirculation loop present in the flocculation zone. The relative independence of the floc size distributions on the flow rate is discussed in light of the Camp number Gt which remains constant for different flow rates investigated and can thus explain the efficiency of the jet clarifier in terms of flocculation.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The cause of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to the development of PD. Luteolin, a non-toxic flavonoid, has become interested in an alternative medicine, according to its effects on anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, although the underlying mechanism of luteolin on PD has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate whether luteolin prevents neurotoxicity induction by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+), a neurotoxin in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The results reveal that luteolin significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in MPP+-treated cells. Increasing lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion (O2-), including mitochondrial membrane potential (D m) disruption, is ameliorated by luteolin treatment. In addition, luteolin attenuated MPP+-induced neurite damage via GAP43 and synapsin-1. Furthermore, Cdk5 is found to be overactivated and correlated with elevation of cleaved caspase-3 activity in MPP+-exposed cells, while phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β are inhibited. In contrast, luteolin attenuated Cdk5 overactivation and supported phosphorylated level of Erk1/2, Drp1, Fak, Akt and GSK3β with reducing in cleaved caspase-3 activity. Results indicate that luteolin exerts neuroprotective effects via Cdk5-mediated Erk1/2/Drp1 and Fak/Akt/GSK3β pathways, possibly representing a potential preventive agent for neuronal disorder.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

However, inflammation can be detrimental to an organism and cause irreparable damage. For example, during sepsis, a cytokine storm can lead to multiple organ failures and often results in death. One of the strongest triggers of the inflammatory response is bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), acting mostly through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Paradoxically, while exposure to LPS triggers a robust inflammatory response, repeated or prolonged exposure to LPS can induce a state of endotoxin tolerance, a phenomenon where macrophages and monocytes do not respond to new endotoxin challenges, and it is often associated with secondary infections and negative outcomes. The cellular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon remain elusive. We used metabolic measurements to confirm differences in the cellular metabolism of naïve macrophages and that of macrophages responding to LPS stimulation or those in the LPS-tolerant state. In parallel, we performed an unbiased secretome survey using quantitative mass spectrometry during the induction of LPS tolerance, creating the first comprehensive secretome profile of endotoxin-tolerant cells. The secretome changes confirmed that LPS-tolerant macrophages have significantly decreased cellular metabolism and that the proteins secreted by LPS-tolerant macrophages have a strong association with cell survival, protein metabolism, and the metabolism of reactive oxygen species.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

We aimed to investigate differences in the localization of the ictal onset zone (IOZ) between patients with isolated ED and those with ED plus head turning (HT) during focal seizures. Methods: We reviewed intracranial video-EEG data for 931 seizures in 80 patients with focal onset epilepsy in whom the IOZ could be confirmed. The 233 seizures in 49 patients with ED were classified into two semiological groups based on initial ED and the presence/absence of HT: (1) isolated ED (i.e., ED without HT), and (2) ED + HT (i.e., ED with HT). We analyzed the localization and lateralization of IOZs in each semiological group. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis using a mixed-effects to determine the associations between IOZs and isolated ED/ED + HT. Results: A total of 183 IOZs in 24 patients were included in the isolated ED group, while a total of 143 IOZs in 31 patients were included in the ED + HT group. Sixty-eight IOZs of eight patients in the isolated ED group were located in the ipsilateral frontal interhemispheric fissure (F-IHF). Only ipsilateral F-IHF was significantly associated with isolated ED (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37–4.49; P = 0.021). The contralateral lateral frontal cortex (latF) (P = 0.007) and ipsilateral mesial temporal region (mT) (P = 0.029) were significantly associated with ED + HT. Conclusion: The present study is the first to demonstrate that seizures with an F-IHF focus tend to present with initial ipsilateral isolated ED.

The response of AZO-Flav to the reductase was as fast as 2 min with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.4 μM. Moreover, AZO-Flav displayed high enzyme specificity even in the presence of high concentrations of biological interferences, such as reducing agents and biothiols. Therefore, AZO-Flav was tested to detect hypoxic and normoxic environments in cancer cells (HepG2). Compared to the normal condition, the fluorescence intensity in hypoxic conditions increased about 10-fold after 15 min. Prolonged incubation showed a 26-fold higher fluorescent intensity after 60 min. In addition, the fluorescence signal under hypoxia can be suppressed by an electron transport process inhibitor, diphenyliodonium chloride (DPIC), suggesting that reductases take part in the azo group reduction of AZO-Flav in a hypoxic environment.

However, there has been a lack of evidence reporting the effects of anterior seat inclination on sit-to-stand (STS) performance in children with SDCP. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of anterior seat inclination on STS performance in children with SDCP. Methods: Fourteen children with SDCP (aged 8.74 (1.79) years, GMFCS levels I and II) participated in this study. All participants performed STS in four conditions of the seat including the horizontal seat (HS), anterior seat inclination of 5° (A5), 10° (A10) and 15° (A15). Three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to capture STS movements. Results: The total movement time and total mechanical work during the STS with A5, A10 and A15 were significantly lower than STS with HS. At the beginning of the task, STS with A5, A10 and A15 showed less trunk and hip flexion than HS. Conclusions: Anterior seat inclination with 5°, 10° and 15° could improve STS performance in children with SDCP. Therefore, applying these seats would be another option for children with SDCP to enhance STS performance.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Anterior seat inclination could improve sitting posture in children with diplegia.

Carbon dioxide hydrogenated to synthetic fuel, i.e. methanol, was investigated at 10 bar and 150-400 °C. The CuZnZrO2 catalyst was highly selective towards methanol at low temperatures (up to 99% selectivity), offering the highest yield of 12.6 g CH3OH kg-catalyst-1 h-1.

Consistently, across 3.8 million (M) genes annotated from 163.5 gigabases (Gb) of WMGS sequencing data, a significant number of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism of the dominant bacterial families were identified. Further identification of bacterial community‐wide metabolic functions promisingly highlighted the importance of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium involvement in central carbon metabolism, sugar utilization and metabolism towards butyrate biosynthesis. This work presents an initial study of shotgun metagenomics in a Thai population‐based cohort in a developing Southeast Asian country.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"
From “Leaky Gut” to Impaired Glia-Neuron Communication in Depression,"Rudzki L., Maes M.",2021-01-01,"Communication, Depression, Depressive Disorder, Major, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Neuroglia, Neurons, Cytokines, Depression, Glia, Leaky gut, Microbiota, Neuroimmunomodulation, Oxidative stress","In the last three decades, the robust scientific data emerged, demonstrating that the immune-inflammatory response is a fundamental component of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Psychological stress and various inflammatory comorbidities contribute to such immune activation. Still, this is not uncommon that patients with depression do not have defined inflammatory comorbidities, and alternative mechanisms of immune activation need to take place. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, along with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), constitutes the largest lymphatic organ in the human body and forms the biggest surface of contact with the external environment. It is also the most significant source of bacterial and food-derived antigenic material. There is a broad range of reciprocal interactions between the GI tract, intestinal microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, activation of immune-inflammatory response, and the CNS that has crucial implications in brain function and mental health. This intercommunication takes place within the microbiota-gut-immune-glia (MGIG) axis, and glial cells are the main orchestrator of this communication. A broad range of factors, including psychological stress, inflammation, dysbiosis, may compromise the permeability of this barrier. This leads to excessive bacterial translocation and the excessive influx of food-derived antigenic material that contributes to activation of the immune-inflammatory response and depressive psychopathology. This chapter summarizes the role of increased intestinal permeability in MDD and mechanisms of how the “leaky gut” may contribute to immune-inflammatory response in this disorder.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"
High process activity of a two-phase UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) receiving ethanol wastewater: Operational conditions in relation to granulation development,"Jiraprasertwong A., Karnchanapaisal P., Seneesrisakul K., Rangsunvigit P., Chavadej S.",2021-05-01,"Blanket systems, CH$-4$, Ethanol wastewater, Operational conditions, Organic loading rates, Process activities, Sludge granulation, Two phase, Two-phase upflow anerobic blanket (upflow anerobic sludge blanket), Upflow anaerobic sludge blankets, Biogas, Ethanol wastewater, Sludge granulation, Two-phase upflow anaerobic blanket (UASB)","The high process activity of a two-phase UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) system receiving ethanol wastewater was achieved in conjunction with sludge granulation. The optimal OLR (organic loading rate), as expressed in COD load of feed and overall effective liquid holding capacity, was found to be 32 kg m−3 d−1 with a mean granule diameter of 1.12 mm and granule density of 1.23 kg m−3. The system yielded a very high process effectiveness, as indicated in a high specific CH4 production rate (11.83 m3 CH4·mR−3 ·d−1) and a high total COD removal of above 90%. Moreover, the system showed the total energy yield was very high as 15,840 kJ kg−1 COD applied with the energy extraction efficiency of 82.5%. The sludge granulation seemed to begin and was clearly observed at high OLRs of 24 and 28 kg m−3 d−1, respectively. Apart from the long time operation (about 2 y) with a slowly increased rate of OLR, causing the accumulation of metal sulfide particles to act as nuclei to facilitate for the formation of microbial granules, the low pH of 5.5 in the primary reactor was responsible for avoiding the micronutrient deficit situation which, in turn, became a main factor in the success of granulation in the investigated two-phase UASB. The presence of lactic acid (HLa) in the secondary reactor can be used to indicate the system overload and process instability. The inhibition levels of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) to acidogens and methanogens were about 9,000 and 400 mg L−1 as acetic acid (HAc), respectively.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial biotechnology; waste disposal, petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"
Incidence / predictors of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea with normal oximetry,"Chuanprasitkul C., Veeravigrom M., Sunkonkit K., Tansrirattanawong S., Sritippayawan S.",2021-11-01,"Child, Humans, Incidence, Oximetry, Polysomnography, Prospective Studies, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, nocturnal oximetry, obstructive sleep apnea","Background: The polysomnogram (PSG) is the “gold standard” for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, nocturnal oximetry is a practical screening tool for children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH). This study aimed to investigate the incidence of, and predictive factors for, OSA in children with ATH and normal / inconclusive overnight oximetry. Methods: The prospective study enrolled children aged 3–15 years with ATH and normal / inconclusive overnight oximetry. All participants underwent full-night PSG. To evaluate the predictors of OSA, we used logistic regression analysis, including sex, history of allergic rhinitis, body mass index z-score, neck circumference–height ratio, and polysomnographic parameters (obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (OAHI), nadir oxygen saturation (SpO2), peak end-tidal CO2, and arousal index). Results: The participants were 189 children; 167 (88%) were diagnosed with OSA by PSG. A history of allergic rhinitis (P = 0.033), and the PSG findings for nadir SpO2 (P = 0.027) and arousal index (P = <0.001) predicted the diagnosis of OSA. We divided patients with OSA into two groups (mild versus moderate to severe OSA). Patients with OAHI ≥5/h were defined as having moderate-to-severe OSA. No clinical factors significantly predicted OAHI ≥5. Of the 189 participants, 58 children (31%) were diagnosed with severe OSA (OAHI ≥10). The only PSG factor that predicted severe OSA was the arousal index (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The observed incidence of OSA in children aged 3–15 years with ATH and normal/inconclusive overnight oximetry was very high. A history of allergic rhinitis may help to triage the patients. The arousal index was a predictor of pediatric OSA.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"
Distribution and Molecular Characterization of Escherichia coli Harboring mcr Genes Isolated from Slaughtered Pigs in Thailand,"Khanawapee A., Kerdsin A., Chopjitt P., Boueroy P., Hatrongjit R., Akeda Y., Tomono K., Nuanualsuwan S., Hamada S.",2021-07-01,"Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli Proteins, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Plasmids, Swine, Thailand, colistin, Escherichia coli, mcr, mobile colistin resistance, slaughtered pig, Thailand","The resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to colistin mediated by plasmid-borne mobile mcr genes is an emerging public health concern. This study aimed to explore the distribution and characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates harboring mcr genes from slaughtered pigs in Thailand from 2014 to 2015. A total of 779 E. coli isolates were assessed, of which 61 (7.8%) were found to carry mcr genes, including mcr-1, mcr-3, mcr-6, mcr-7, mcr-8, and mcr-9, together with co-occurrences of mcr-1+mcr-3, mcr-1+mcr-9, and mcr-3+mcr-6+mcr-7. In these mcr-harboring E. coli isolates, mcr-1 (40.9%) and mcr-9 (32.8%) were predominant. Colistin resistance was mainly mediated by the mcr-1 gene, whereas intermediate resistance was noted in isolates that harbored mcr-9, mcr-6, mcr-7, and mcr-8 genes. Most E. coli isolates harboring mcr genes were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and all of these isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Clermont phylotyping demonstrated that mcr-harboring isolates mainly belonged to phylogroup A (44.3%), followed by phylogroups B1 (34.4%), D (14.8%), and B2 (6.6%). Multilocus sequence typing revealed that 25 sequence types (STs) were assigned to 45 mcr-harboring E. coli isolates, whereas the remaining 16 isolates were novel STs. The mcr-1 and mcr-9 genes were mostly predominant in ST101 and ST8900, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the prevalence and diversity of mcr-harboring E. coli isolates obtained from slaughtered pigs across Thailand. Strengthening of surveillance systems by the government for controlling and preventing mcr dissemination from animals to humans or vice versa is urgently needed.

Anticipation of Historical Exercise Patterns by a Novel Artificial Pancreas System Reduces Hypoglycemia during and after Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity in People with Type 1 Diabetes,"Garcia-Tirado J., Brown S.A., Laichuthai N., Colmegna P., Koravi C.L.K., Ozaslan B., Corbett J.P., Barnett C.L., Pajewski M., Oliveri M.C., Myers H., Breton M.D.",2021-04-01,"Adult, Blood Glucose, Cross-Over Studies, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Exercise, Humans, Hypoglycemia, Hypoglycemic Agents, Insulin, Insulin Infusion Systems, Middle Aged, Pancreas, Artificial, Artificial pancreas, Closed-loop system, Disturbance anticipation, Moderate-intensity exercise","Objective: Physical activity is a major challenge to glycemic control for people with type 1 diabetes. Moderate-intensity exercise often leads to steep decreases in blood glucose and hypoglycemia that closed-loop control systems have so far failed to protect against, despite improving glycemic control overall. Research Design and Methods: Fifteen adults with type 1 diabetes (42 ± 13.5 years old; hemoglobin A1c 6.6% ± 1.0%; 10F/5M) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing two hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems, a state-of-the-art hybrid model predictive controller and a modified system designed to anticipate and detect unannounced exercise (APEX), during two 32-h supervised admissions with 45 min of planned moderate activity, following 4 weeks of data collection. Primary outcome was the number of hypoglycemic episodes during exercise. Continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-based metrics and hypoglycemia are also reported across the entire admissions. Results: The APEX system reduced hypoglycemic episodes overall (9 vs. 33; P = 0.02), during exercise (5 vs. 13; P = 0.04), and in the 4 h following (2 vs. 11; P = 0.02). Overall CGM median percent time <70 mg/dL decreased as well (0.3% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.004). This protection was obtained with no significant increase in time >180 mg/dL (18.5% vs. 16.6%, P = 0.15). Overnight control was notable for both systems with no hypoglycemia, median percent in time 70-180 mg/dL at 100% and median percent time 70-140 mg/dL at ∼96% for both. Conclusions: A new closed-loop system capable of anticipating and detecting exercise was proven to be safe and feasible and outperformed a state-of-the-art HCL, reducing participants' exposure to hypoglycemia during and after moderate-intensity physical activity.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; endocrine pancreas; diabetes, insulin, and glucose tolerance, medical, biochemistryistry, Health Professions","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology, Medical Laboratory Technology"

Normative data standardized across world regions and HRM manufacturers are limited. Methods: Our aim was to determine normative EGJ metrics in a large international cohort of healthy volunteers undergoing HRM (Medtronic, Laborie, and Diversatek software) acquired from 16 countries in four world regions. EGJ-CI was calculated by the same two investigators using a distal contractile integral-like measurement across the EGJ for three respiratory cycles and corrected for respiration (mm Hg cm), using manufacturer-specific software tools. EGJ morphology was designated according to Chicago Classification v3.0. Median EGJ-CI values were calculated across age, genders, HRM systems, and regions. Results: Of 484 studies (28.0 years, 56.2% F, 60.7% Medtronic studies, 26.0% Laborie, and 13.2% Diversatek), EGJ morphology was type 1 in 97.1%. Median EGJ-CI was similar between Medtronic (37.0 mm Hg cm, IQR 23.6-53.7 mm Hg cm) and Diversatek (34.9 mm Hg cm, IQR 22.1-56.1 mm Hg cm, P = 0.87), but was significantly higher using Laborie equipment (56.5 mm Hg cm, IQR 35.0-75.3 mm Hg cm, P < 0.001). 5th percentile EGJ-CI values ranged from 6.9 to 12.1 mm Hg cm. EGJ-CI values were consistent across world regions, but different between manufacturers even within the same world region (P ≤ 0.001). Within Medtronic studies, EGJ-CI and basal LESP were similar in younger and older individuals (P ≥ 0.3) but higher in women (P < 0.001). Conclusions: EGJ morphology is predominantly type 1 in healthy adults. EGJ-CI varies widely in health, with significant gender influence, but is consistent within each HRM system. Manufacturer-specific normative values should be utilized for clinical HRM interpretation.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Physiology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Gastroenterology"

Importantly, the discovery of inhibitors that targets the early phase of autophagy was identified as a beneficial choice. Despite the number of research in recent years, screening of the DrugBank repository (9591 molecules) for the Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) has not been reported earlier. Therefore, the present study was designed to identify potential VPS34 antagonists using integrated pharmacophore strategies. Primarily, an energy-based pharmacophore and receptor cavity-based analysis yielded five (DHRRR) and seven featured (AADDHRR) pharmacophore hypotheses respectively, which were utilized for the database screening process. The glide score, the binding free energy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties were examined to narrow down the screened compounds. This analysis yielded a hit molecule, DB03916 that exhibited a better docking score, higher binding affinity and better drug-like properties in contrast to the reference compound that suffers from a toxicity property. Importantly, the result was validated using a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation study. Overall, we conclude that the identified hit molecule DB03916 is believed to serve as a prospective antagonist against VPS34 for cancer treatment.","chemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This issue has implications for the epidemiology of sand fly-borne diseases, especially sand fly-associated viruses. Few studies concerning sand fly-associated viruses have been conducted in Thailand. Therefore, this study aimed to perform a molecular survey of groups of pathogenic RNA viruses belonging to the Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae in sand fly samples collected from southern Thailand. Methods: Sand flies were collected at two locations in Trang and Songkhla provinces of southern Thailand, and individual sand fly samples were processed for species identification and virus detection. The Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae molecular determination was performed by RT-PCR, and positive samples were identified by cloning and sequencing, cell culture inoculation, and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The results presented in this study were based on the analysis of a total of 331 female sand flies. This molecular study revealed evidence of Rhabdoviridae family virus presence in Phlebotomus papatasi (3/331, 0.9%). The findings demonstrated a new cluster of rhabdovirus that was closely related to Bactrocera dorsalis sigmavirus strain BDSV.abc5 and the lineages of insect-specific Rhabdoviridae. In addition, the Bayesian tree suggested that the common ancestor of this group was the dimarhabdovirus clade. It was assumed that the virus may have switched hosts during its evolution. However, the detection of Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera using specific primers for RT-PCR was negative in the collected sand flies. Conclusions: There is limited knowledge on the genetic diversity and ecology of Rhabdoviridae in Thailand. This is the first data regarding the circulation of Rhabdoviridae in Ph. papatasi from Thailand. We found a new cluster of rhabdoviruses that was close to the new B. dorsalis sigmavirus. It is possible that there is a great deal of diversity in this family yet to be discovered, and a more extensive survey for new rhabdoviruses may uncover viruses from a wide diversity of host taxa and broaden our understanding of the relationships among the Rhabdoviridae.

Herein, a hollow capillary channel was constructed via laser engraved micropatterning functions as a micropump to facilitate viscous fluidic transport, which would otherwise impede analysis on paper devices. Using salivary thiocyanate as a model analyte, the proposed device was found to exhibit a promising sensing ability on paper devices without the need for sample pretreatment or bulky instrumentation, as normally required in conventional methods used for saliva analysis. An extensive linear dynamic range covering detection of salivary thiocyanate for both high and trace level regimes (5 orders of magnitude working range) was collectively achieved using the dual-sensing modes. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection was 6 μmol L−1 with a RSD of less than 5%. An excellent stability for the μpumpPAD was also observed for over 30 days. Real sample analysis using the proposed device was found to be in line with the standard chromatographic method. Benefitting from simple fabrication and operation, portability, disposability, low sample volume (20 μL), and low cost (< 1 USD), the μpumpPAD is an exceptional alternative tool for the detection of various biomarkers in saliva specimens.

During Run 2 (covering 2015-2018) the LHC achieved instantaneous luminosities as high as 2 × 10 cm s while delivering proton-proton collisions at √s = 13 TeV. The challenge for the trigger system of the CMS experiment is to reduce the registered event rate from about 40 MHz to about 1 kHz. Significant improvements important for the success of the CMS physics program have been made to the muon trigger system via improved muon reconstruction and identification algorithms since the end of Run 1 and throughout the Run 2 data-taking period. The new algorithms maintain the acceptance of the muon triggers at the same or even lower rate throughout the data-taking period despite the increasing number of additional proton-proton interactions in each LHC bunch crossing. In this paper, the algorithms used in 2015 and 2016 and their improvements throughout 2017 and 2018 are described. Measurements of the CMS muon trigger performance for this data-taking period are presented, including efficiencies, transverse momentum resolution, trigger rates, and the purity of the selected muon sample. This paper focuses on the single- and double-muon triggers with the lowest sustainable transverse momentum thresholds used by CMS. The efficiency is measured in a transverse momentum range from 8 to several hundred GeV.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"
Relationship between microstructure and performances of simultaneous biaxially stretched films based on thermoplastic starch and biodegradable polyesters,"Yoksan R., Dang K.M., Boontanimitr A., Chirachanchai S.",2021-11-01,"Calorimetry, Differential Scanning, Crystallization, Elastic Modulus, Oxygen, Permeability, Plastics, Polyesters, Starch, Steam, Surface Properties, Temperature, Tensile Strength, Water, Biaxially stretched film, Biodegradable polyesters, Thermoplastic starch","Although thermoplastic starch (TPS) is a good candidate to overcome the limitations of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) due to its relatively low cost and high flexibility, the toughness and barrier properties of PLA/TPS blends are still insufficient for film applications. Therefore, the present work aims to improve the performance of PLA/TPS blend by simultaneous biaxial stretching and partially replacing PLA with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) for packaging film applications. PLA/TPS and PLA/PBAT/TPS sheets were prepared by melt cast extrusion and simultaneously biaxially stretched to form films. The mechanical, morphological, thermal, and water vapor and oxygen barrier properties and crystallinity of both intermediate sheets and their corresponding stretched films were examined. After stretching, PLA/TPS and PLA/PBAT/TPS blends showed markedly improved extensibility, impact strength, crystallinity, water vapor and oxygen barrier properties, and surface hydrophobicity. The stretched films demonstrated stacked-layer planar morphology, in which their outermost layers were a biodegradable polyester-rich phase. The synergistic effects of simultaneous biaxial stretching and partial replacing PLA with PBAT were extremely impressive for toughness improvement. The stretched films have the potential to replace non-biodegradable plastic packaging films, particularly where good mechanical and barrier properties are required.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in cyclodextrin nanoparticle eye drops: Ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effect on intraocular pressure,"Lorenzo-Soler L., Olafsdottir O.B., Garhofer G., Jansook P., Kristinsdottir I.M., Tan A., Loftsson T., Stefansson E.",2021-06-01,"Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists, Animals, Aqueous Humor, Cyclodextrins, Disease Models, Animal, Glaucoma, Open-Angle, Intraocular Pressure, Nanoparticles, Ophthalmic Solutions, Rabbits, angiotensin receptor blockers, glaucoma, intraocular pressure, pharmacokinetics","Purpose: Orally administered angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) decrease intraocular pressure (IOP). Topical administration may reduce systemic side effects and result in a useful glaucoma drug. The aim of this study is to test the ocular delivery and pharmacologic effect of nanoparticle eye drops containing ARBs (e.g. irbesartan and candesartan). Methods: 1.5% irbesartan and 0.15% candesartan eye drops were applied to rabbits. The pharmacokinetics in cornea and aqueous humour after single eye drop application were studied in 49 rabbits. The effect of the eye drops on IOP was studied in 10 rabbits using an iCare (® TonoVet Plus, iCare, Finland) tonometer and compared with 0.5% timolol eye drops. Results: Candesartan lowered IOP from 24.6 ± 5.1 mmHg at baseline to 19.0 ± 2.9 mmHg (mean ± SD, p = 0.030, n = 10) 4 hr after application. Irbesartan lowered IOP from 24.2 ± 1.7 mmHg to 20.2 ± 0.9 mmHg (p = 0.14, n = 10). Timolol decreased the IOP from 24.9 ± 4.2 mmHg to 20.4 ± 4.8 mmHg (mean ± SD, p = 0.036, n = 10). The pharmacokinetics data show that both formulations deliver effective amounts of drug into the intraocular tissues, with irbesartan and candesartan reaching concentrations of 121 ± 69 and 30.43 ± 13.93 ng/g (mean ± SD), respectively, in the aqueous humour 3 hr after a single-dose administration. Conclusions: Topical application of irbesartan and candesartan eye drops delivers effective drug concentrations to the anterior segment of the eye in rabbits, achieving drug concentrations 100 times above the IC50 for angiotensin II receptor and showing an IOP-lowering effect.

This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task—a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation—demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.","neuroscienceoscience; sensory systems; auditory system, psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience"

Aim: Based on this document, a Southeast Asia Working Group (SEAWG) wished to see how the new ESCEO algorithm developed in 2019 was perceived by Southeast Asian experts and how it was integrated into their clinical practice. Methods: A SEAWG was set up between members of the international ESCEO task force and a group of Southeast Asian experts. Results: Non-pharmacological management should always be combined with pharmacological management. In step 1, symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis are the main background therapy, for which high-quality evidence is available only for the formulations of patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. In step 2, oral NSAIDs are a useful option, considering the cardiovascular/renal/gastrointestinal profiles of the individual patient. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids are a possible alternative to oral NSAIDs, but limited evidence is available. If steps 1 and 2 do not give adequate relief of symptoms, tramadol can be used, but its safety is debated. In general, the indications of the ESCEO algorithm are important in Southeast Asian countries, but the reimbursement criteria of local health systems are an important aspect for adherence to the ESCEO algorithm. Conclusion: This guidance provides evidence-based and easy-to-follow advice on how to establish a treatment algorithm in knee OA, for practical implementation in clinical practice in Southeast Asian countries.","biochemistryistry, medical","Aging, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

In this work, the effects of acrylate coagents, which had different amounts of functional groups, on properties of UFPNR produced by radiation vulcanization and spray-drying was systematically investigated for the first time. Dipropylene glycol diacrylate (DPGDA), trimethylol propane trimethaacrylate (TMPTMA), and ditrimethylol propane tetraacrylate (DTMPTA) were used as coagents with two, three, and four acrylate groups, respectively. The radiation in the range of 250 to 400 kGy and coagent contents of up to 11 phr were used in the production process. Physical, chemical, and thermal properties of the UFPNR were characterized by swelling analysis, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. The properties of UFPNR produced by using different type and content of coagents were compared and discussed. The results revealed that UFPNR with the smallest particle size of 3.6 ± 1.1 µm and the highest thermal stability (Td5 = 349◦C) could be obtained by using DTMPTA, which had the highest amount of functional group. It was proposed that the coagent with the greater number of acrylate groups enhanced the crosslinking of natural rubber as it had more reactive groups. Finally, an application of UFPNR as a toughening filler in rigid PVC was demonstrated with 34% improvement of impact strength.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In bacteria, NER damage detection is orchestrated by the UvrA and UvrB proteins, which form the UvrA2-UvrB2 (UvrAB) damage sensing complex. The highly versatile damage recognition is accomplished in two ATP-dependent steps. In the first step, the UvrAB complex samples the DNA in search of lesion. Subsequently, the presence of DNA damage is verified within the UvrB-DNA complex after UvrA has dissociated. Although the mechanism of bacterial NER damage detection has been extensively investigated, the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis by UvrA and UvrB during this process remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a pre-steady state kinetics Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) study of the real-time interaction between UvrA, UvrB, and damaged DNA during lesion detection. By using UvrA and UvrB mutants harboring site-specific mutations in the ATP binding sites, we show for the first time that the dissociation of UvrA from the UvrAB-DNA complex does not require ATP hydrolysis by UvrB. We find that ATP hydrolysis by UvrA is not essential, but somehow facilitates the formation of UvrB-DNA complex, with ATP hydrolysis at the proximal site of UvrA playing a more critical role. Consistent with previous reports, our results indicated that the ATPase activity of UvrB is essential for the formation of UvrB-DNA complex but is not required for the binding of the UvrAB complex to DNA.","genetics and molecular biology; molecular genetics; dna repair, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

However, the role of nasogastric decompression in preventing postoperative complications and promoting the recovery of bowel function in children remains controversial. This systematic review aimed to assess whether routine nasogastric decompression is necessary after intestinal surgery in children. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guideline. Literature search was performed in electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of science. Studies comparing outcomes between children who underwent intestinal surgery with postoperative nasogastric tube (NGT) placement (NGT group) and without postoperative NGT placement (no NGT group) were included. Results: Six studies were eligible for inclusion criteria including two randomized controlled trials (RCT) and four comparative observational studies. The overall rate of postoperative anastomotic leak was 0.6% (1/179) in NGT group and 0.9% (2/223) in no NGT group. The overall rate of wound dehiscence was 2.4% (4/169) in NGT group and 1.6% (4/245) in no NGT group. Meta-analysis of two RCTs in children undergoing elective intestinal surgery showed significant increase of mild vomiting in no NGT group compared with NGT group (OR 3.54 95% CI 1.04, 11.99) but no significant difference in persistent vomiting requiring NGT reinsertion (OR 3.11 95% CI 0.47, 20.54), abdominal distension (OR 2.36 95% CI 0.34, 16.59), NGT reinsertion (OR 3.11 95% CI 0.47, 20.54), wound infection (OR 1.63 95% CI 0.49, 5.48) and time to return of bowel movement (MD − 0.14 95% CI − 0.45, 0.17). There was no incidence of anastomotic leak in these 2 RCTs. However, there was an incidence of NGT-related discomfort in NGT group, which ranged from 30 to 100% of children studied. Conclusion: Routine postoperative nasogastric decompression can be omitted in children undergoing intestinal surgery due to no benefit in preventing postoperative complications while increasing patient discomfort.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Surgery"

However, high PV penetration ratio (PVR) in turn critically reduces system frequency response performance of an existing power system due to reduction of on-line rotating generators. Besides intrinsic system inertia, system RC plays a vital role in dynamically securing the power system operation subject to large PV disturbances. This study proposes a graphical method to determine critical values of system RC requirement with respect to the anticipated PVR and PV ramp-down rate of disturbance; both of which should be forecastable, in practice, in each operating time interval. Impact of PVR on dynamic performance of a power system, through the effective time-varying of system inertia and governor response characteristic has been examined. The results of the analyses on graphical display will be useful for system operators to prepare enough system RC, economically well in-advance through Unit Commitment program, to ensure system dynamic security, complying with the N-1 contingency constraint. In addition, the proposed graphical display can reveal whether the curtailment of aggregated PV's output generation is necessary for that time interval. © 2021 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Although IBS does not develop into a serious disease or increase mortality, it results in a considerable reduction in the quality of life. The etiology of IBS is not known, but the intestinal microbiota appears to play a pivotal role in its pathophysiology. There is no effective treatment for IBS, and so the applied treatments clinically focus on symptom relief. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), an old Chinese treatment, has been applied to IBS patients in seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Positive effects on IBS symptoms in various degrees were obtained in four of these RCTs, while there was no effect in the remaining three. Across the seven RCTs there were marked differences in the selection processes for the donor and treated patients, the transplant dose, the route of administration, and the methods used to measure how the patients responded to FMT. The present frontier discusses these differences and proposes: (1) criteria for selecting an effective donor (superdonor); (2) selection criteria for patients that are suitable for FMT; (3) the optimal FMT dose; and (4) the route of transplant administration. FMT appears to be safe, with only mild, self-limiting side effects of abdominal pain, cramping, tenderness, diarrhea, and constipation. Although it is early to speculate about the mechanisms underlying the effects of FMT, the available data suggest that changes in the intestinal bacteria accompanied by changes in fermentation patterns and fermentation products (specifically short-chain fatty acids) play an important role in improving the IBS symptoms seen after FMT. FMT appears to be a promising treatment for IBS, but further studies are needed before it can be applied in everyday clinical practice.",medical,Gastroenterology

The two isolates showed the highest sequence similarity (98.58%) to Acetobacter tropicalis NBRC 16470T and Acetobacter senegalensis LMG 23690T. However, the calculated similarity values were lower than the threshold for species demarcation. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the branches of the two isolates were separated from other Acetobacter species, and the two isolates constituted a new species in the genus Acetobacter. The genomic DNA of isolate MS16-SU-2T was sequenced. The assembled genome of the isolate was analysed, and the results showed that the highest average nucleotide identity value of 75.9% was with Acetobacter papayae JCM 25143T and the highest digital DNA–DNA hybridization value of 25.1% was with Acetobacter fallax LMG 1636T, which were lower than the cutoff values for species delineation. The phylogenetic tree based on the genome sequences showed that the lineage of isolate MS16-SU-2T was most closely related to A. papayae JCM 25143T and Acetobacter suratthaniensis TBRC 1719T, but separated from the branches of these two species. In addition, the two isolates could be distinguished from the type strains of closely related species by their phenotypic characteristics and MALDI-TOF profiles. Therefore, the two isolates, MS16-SU-2T (=TBRC 12339T=LMG 32243T) and MS18-SU-3 (=TBRC 12305), can be assigned to an independent species within the genus Acetobacter, and the name of Acetobacter garciniae sp. nov. is proposed for the two isolates.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics"

In this work, the roles of 5.56 mol% pyrrolidine were investigated for the methane hydrate formation in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics along with morphology. The results showed that pyrrolidine generally improved the thermodynamic stability of mixed methane hydrates, enhancing the formation at milder conditions than those of pure methane hydrates. To demonstrate the kinetic performance of pyrrolidine, the experiments were performed at 8 MPa and 285.2 K in a quiescent configuration. The results showed that a very short induction time and a rapid rate of hydrate formation with desirable methane uptake were achieved. In addition, a distinct methane bubble with breathing effect, assisting methane gas to interact with the bulk solution, was observed during the hydrate formation morphology. The comparative kinetic study with 5.56 mol% tetrahydrofuran (THF) was also carried out under the same driving force and the same experimental condition. Surprisingly, although THF gave a high methane uptake, pyrrolidine could give more than 10 times higher rate of hydrate formation at the same driving force; moreover, it provided a competitive rate with THF at the similar formation condition.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; crudes; natural gas, natural gasoline and lpg, petroleum engineeringneering, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

But it also has some drawbacks. In this work, a novel nanomaterial - zinc oxide-doped graphene (G-nZnO) - was melt-blended with PP to prepare an antibacterial nanocomposite. It was found that the mechanical properties, thermal stability and barrier properties of nanocomposites reached the highest value when the content of G-nZnO was 0.2phr. The tensile properties of nanocomposites were 36% higher than those of pure PP, and the barrier properties were increased by 113%. The results of antibacterial tests showed that the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites increased with the G-nZnO content. Compared with previous studies on PP/graphene and different PP composites, this study that examined new nanocomposites was better in terms of improving various properties of PP. This kind of composite materials with excellent comprehensive performance has great potential for application in the fields of packaging and functional materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, have been proposed to predict age. The methylation of the ELOVL2 gene is one of the age-related markers that could be tested in fresh or postmortem blood sample. We study the use of DNA methylation markers on the ELOVL2 gene and develop a prediction model to estimate the age from a postmortem blood sample using pyrosequencing. From 100 anonymous blood samples, a correlation study of DNA methylation and age was investigated. The regression analysis revealed 2 CpG sites for model prediction with an adjusted R2 value of 0.7 (p < 0.01). The model explained 74% of the variation in postmortem blood samples (n = 36) with a prediction error (RMSE) of 10.2 years and a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 7.1 years, whereas the model (excluding a younger age group) had improved with a RMSE of 5.6 years and a MAD of 4.2 years. The performance parameters were analyzed in several simulated models and indicated that these markers are advantageous for age estimation in forensic scenarios. Finally, a robustness and reproducibility of the pyrosequencing technique would enable this approach to be the part of an age prediction in forensic investigation.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

Objectives: This study aimed at evaluating clinical correlation and prognostic role of plasma BAFF and related polymorphisms in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Plasma BAFF levels were measured from 100 healthy controls and 490 patients with chronic HBV infection (200 with HCC and 290 without HCC). The rs9514828 and rs12583006 polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination. Results: The HCC group had significantly higher BAFF levels compared with the non-HCC group and healthy controls. Among the non-HCC group, the HBeAg-positive subgroup had higher BAFF levels compared with the HBeAg-negative subgroup. In the HCC group, high BAFF levels at initial presentation significantly correlated with alpha-fetoprotein levels, Child-Pugh classification, tumor size and BCLC stage. Multivariate analyses showed that elevated BAFF concentration (≥ 1,100 pg/ml) was a significant and independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC (OR = 2.28, 95%CI: 1.07-4.87; P = 0.034). HCC patients with high BAFF levels (≥ 1,100 pg/ml) had a poorer median survival than those with low levels (P < 0.001, log-rank test). Regarding BAFF polymorphisms, the frequency of rs9514828 CT + TT genotypes was higher distributed in patients with chronic HBV infection compared with healthy controls (58.0% vs. 46.0%, P = 0.029). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate for the first time that elevated plasma BAFF levels at baseline exhibit clinical correlation in terms of disease severity and overall survival in HCC patients. Thus, plasma BAFF at initial diagnosis could serve as a prognostic marker for HBV-related HCC.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

However, data on acute kidney injury (AKI) rates associated with this approach in children have been unavailable. The aim of this study was to examine AKI rates in children who were prescribed a colistin loading dose. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in patients aged 1 month to 18 years who had received intravenous colistin for ≥48 h. Loading dose (LD) was defined as colistin methanesulfonate at 4–5 mg of colistin base activity/kg/dose. AKI was defined according to KDIGO serum creatinine (SCr) criteria — SCr ≥ 1.5 times the baseline, measured 3–7 days after colistin initiation. Augmented renal clearance (ARC) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >150 mL/min/1.73 m2. The rates of AKI were compared between children receiving or not receiving an LD, and between different eGFR groups. Results: In total, 181 children were enrolled. The mean age was 4.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6–4.9 years). Ninety-five of the subjects (52.5%) were male. There were 157 children with a baseline eGFR of ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. The overall AKI rate within the first week in this group was 20.4% (95% CI, 14.4–27.6%): LD, 16.1% vs no LD, 23.2% (p = 0.29). Subgroup analysis, excluding patients with ARC, showed a lower AKI rate of 12.8% (95% CI, 6.8–21.3%): LD, 9.7% vs no LD, 14.3% (p = 0.53). Conclusions: AKI rate was not different among children who received an intravenous colistin loading dose.

An enabling resynchronization technique for grid-connected voltage-source converters,"Kijshevavithaya N., Suwankawin S.",2021-05-19,"Control methodology, Grid-connected modes, Phase lock loop (PLL), Terminal voltage control, Voltage amplitude, Voltage reference, Voltage source converters, Voltage-source converter, Converter control, Resynchronization, Virtual synchronous generator, Voltage-source inverter","A novel control methodology for voltage-source converters (VSCs) is proposed. The control scheme mimics the functions of the synchronous generator (SG); or so-called virtual-synchronous-generator controlled converter (VSGCC), this function essentially allows VSCs to operate in both islanding and grid-connected modes. When a problem occurs at the main grid, the VSGCC can automatically transfer from the grid-connected mode to islanding mode. To stabilize the converter's voltage amplitude and frequency until the utility system is restored. Nevertheless, the amplitude and phase of the converter remain deviated from the main grid. This causes enormous inrush currents that bring harm to the equipment. As a solution, this paper presents a simple yet flexible resynchronization mechanism for a VSGCC operating in islanding mode. The scheme is based on the use of vector Phase-Lock-Loop (PLL) and the terminal voltage control to compensate the internal control loop of VSGCC by altering frequency and voltage reference setpoint until the frequency, phase-angle, and voltage amplitude difference between a converter and the main grid are synchronized. The results are then simulated to prove the vector PLL's abilities and the terminal voltage control to robustly regulate the voltage amplitude, the frequency, and the phase angle of the converter so that the difference with the main grid complies with IEEE Std. 1547-2018 for microgrid synchronization.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Objective: Here, we have performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the systemic innate immune cell repertoire during the course of AIT. Methods: Patients with allergy received standard preseasonal subcutaneous AIT with allergoids to birch and/or grass. Healthy controls were monitored without any intervention. Flow cytometry of innate lymphoid cell (ILC), natural killer cell, monocyte cell, and dendritic cell (DC) subsets was performed at baseline, 3 months (birch season), 6 months (grass seasons), and 12 months after the therapy in patients or at similar seasonal time points in controls. Additional analyses were performed in the third-year birch and grass season. Results: We observed a durable decrease in group 2 ILCs and an increase of group 1 ILCs after AIT, with dynamic changes in their composition. We found that an expansion of CD127+CD25++ clusters caused observed shifts in the heterogeneity of group 1 ILCs. In addition, we observed development of CD127+CD25++c-Kit+ group 3 ILC clusters. Moreover, we found an increase in the number of intermediate monocytes in parallel with a reduction in nonclassical monocytes during the first year after AIT. Classical and intermediate monocytes presented significant heterogeneity in patients with allergy, but AIT reduced the HLA-DR++ clusters. Finally, an increase in plasmacytoid DCs and CD141+ myeloid DCs was observed in individuals with allergy, whereas the number of CD1c+ myeloid DCs was reduced during the first year of AIT. Conclusion: AIT induces changes in the composition and heterogeneity of circulating innate immune cells and brings them to the level observed in healthy individuals. Monitoring of ILCs, monocytes, and DCs during AIT might serve as a novel biomarker strategy.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The model used video games' ratings of players and teams to help in prediction. Two types of fusion-based models, which are hierarchical model and ensemble model, were proposed in this paper. In the experiment, the proposed models were compared with different simple classification models in terms of accuracy using a dataset of English Premier League (EPL) season 2010/2011 to 2014/2015. Additionally, each model was also tested on the whole 2015/2016 EPL season as the selected season contains several unexpected results. Both proposed models yielded the accurate rates at 56.5332% and 56.8002%, which are higher than those of the other models.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software"

Although previous studies have focused on the sexual risk behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM), studies regarding binge alcohol drinking among MSM in Myanmar are scarce. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the alcohol consumption patterns among MSM aged over 18 years in two major cities of Myanmar where the MSM population is higher than other regions. Purposive sampling was applied and sampling was made through Myanmar MSM network. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Patterns of alcohol consumption were described as frequency/percentage and mean/median as appropriate. Bivariate analysis was also done to find out the association between types of MSM and binge drinking. Results: A total of 256 MSM included in the study (mean age, 27.33±7.7 years). Of 256 participants, 225 MSM had the experience of alcohol consumption in their lifetime (225/256, 87.9%). Among ever drinkers, 152 MSM consumed alcohol within three months (152/225, 67.6%). Regarding beer consumption, the highest proportions of MSM from both groups (42.8%, 36.8%) consumed 1-3 times per week. Overall, 57.2% of young MSM and 41.2% of adult MSM consumed beer together with their friends. Nearly 34% of young MSM and nearly 38% of adult MMS consumed beer at gatherings of friends. At different time periods, higher proportions of Thange (partners of MSM) had experienced of binge drinking than apwint (open) and apone (hidden) (p<0.05). Conclusions: The current study identified the alcohol consumption patterns in terms of type, amount, frequency at different time periods among MSM in major cities of Myanmar. It is suggested to develop and implement alcohol control policy for MSM since the proportion of current drinkers as well as binge drinking higher among these groups.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

Density and viscosity were measured over PZ/MPDL concentration ratios of 5/25, 10/20, and 15/15 %wt. and temperatures of 313, 323, and 333 K. Physical diffusivity of CO2 was calculated based on viscosity data by the modified Stokes–Einstein equation. Lastly, CO2 absorption capacity (mol CO2/mol amine) was experimentally determined in a temperature-controlled absorption reactor at 313 K and 10% v/v CO2. The results showed that density and viscosity of novel blended PZ-MPDL solvent increased as PZ concentration ratio increased and decreased as temperature increased. On another hand, physical diffusivity of CO2 decreased as PZ concentration ratio increased and increased as temperature increased. Based on the physical properties data (i.e., density, viscosity, and physical diffusivity of CO2), it can be summarized that the studied physical properties of PZ-MPDL were in the same ranges with those of conventional amine solvents. Additionally, it was found that CO2 absorption capacity of PZ-MPDL can be improved by increasing PZ concentration ratio. As a result, 15/15 %wt. PZ-MPDL showed the highest CO2 absorption capacity (0.741 mol CO2/mol amine) among the three studied concentrations.

Aim of the study: To examine serum levels of these minerals in TDT in relation to iron overload indices and erythron variables. Methods: This study recruited 60 children with TDT and 30 healthy controls aged 3–12 years old. Results: Zinc was significantly higher in TDT children than in controls, while copper and the copper to zinc ratio were significantly lowered in TDT. Serum zinc was significantly associated with the number of blood transfusions and iron overload variables (including serum iron and TS%) and negatively with erythron variables (including hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin). Serum copper was significantly and negatively associated with the same iron overload and erythron variables. The copper to zinc ratio was significantly correlated with iron, TS%, ferritin, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Albumin levels were significantly higher in TDT children than in control children. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the increase in zinc in children with TDT may be explained by iron loading anemia and hemolysis and the consequent shedding of high amounts of intracellular zinc into the plasma. Increased albumin levels and treatment with Desferral may further contribute towards higher zinc levels in TDT. We suggest that the elevations in zinc in TDT are a compensatory mechanism protecting against infection, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Previous proposals for prophylactic use of zinc supplements in TDT may not be warranted.","biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Inorganic Chemistry"

The incorporation of cellulose fibers into the natural rubber matrix significantly improved the crystallinity of the composite films. At the highest loading content of cellulose at 50% w/w, the uptake toluene of the film was reduced to only 5%, whereas its tensile strength was increased to 100 times higher than the neat rubber film. Thermal stability was decreased slightly, depending on cellulose fiber loading content, but the glass transition temperature remained constant at about − 64 °C. According to the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, the water absorption capacity and water vapor transmission of the composite films were enhanced. In addition, it was shown that the biodegradability was considerably improved; the composite films degraded sufficiently in soil within 2 weeks.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

Seven phenolic acids and three flavonoids were identified by ESI-Q-TOF–MS analysis. The common phenolic compounds in all BVE were sinapic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. The BVE (0.5 mg/mL) showed significant inhibitory activity against glucose-induced fluorescent advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation (34 – 67%) and preserved the amount of protein thiol group (30 – 35%). In addition, all extracts (0.125 – 4 mg/mL) also had the ability to trap MG, a reactive glycating agent. Total phenolic content of BVE exhibited a positive correlation with DPPH radical scavenging activity (r = 0.524) and % inhibition of AGE formation (r = 0.570) and % MG-trapping capacity (r = 0.786).

Results: The numbers of genes that were significantly differently expressed were 312 (DBBM vs control), 82 (DFDBA vs control), and 113 (DBBM vs DFDBA). Inflammation-related genes were upregulated in DBBM vs control (16 genes), DFDBA vs control (3 genes), and DBBM vs DFDBA (15 genes). Two of these genes, Bcl2a1 and Cxcl9, were significantly upregulated in both the DBBM and DFDBA groups compared with the control. Pathway analysis indicated that Bcl2a1 and Cxcl9 are dominantly expressed in inflammation-related pathways. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry showed upregulation of Bcl2a1 and Cxcl9 in DBBM compared with the control and DFDBA groups. Cxcl9 showed a significantly higher expression in the DBBM group. Bcl2a1 at the protein level was equally expressed in all groups. Any sign of inflammation, however, was not seen by histology in any of the groups. Conclusion: After a 1-month healing period, soft tissue covering bone grafted with DBBM expressed a higher number of inflammation-related genes compared with those non-grafted or grafted with DFDBA. DFDBA resulted in a decreased expression of inflammation-related genes",dentistry,Oral Surgery
Evaluation of peptones from chicken waste as a nitrogen source for micro-organisms,"Nakamura A., Takahashi H., Sulaiman S., Phraephaisarn C., Keeratipibul S., Kuda T., Kimura B.",2021-04-01,"Bacillus Subtilis, Chicken wastes, Enzyme treatment, Fermentation engineering, Growth ability, Micro-organisms, Microbial medium, Nitrogen sources, Nutrient sources, Peptone, Animals, Bacillus subtilis, Chickens, Culture Media, Escherichia coli, Hydrolysis, Nitrogen, Peptide Hydrolases, Peptones, chicken waste, enzyme treatment, fermentation engineering, microbial medium, nitrogen source, peptone","In this study, chicken peptone was produced by hydrolysing inedible parts derived from chickens using endo-protease and exo-protease. The usefulness of chicken peptone as a nutrient source for bacteria was evaluated in comparison with other commercially produced peptones (animal, soy and casein-derived peptone). Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were used as test strains to determine the effect of peptones from different sources on their growth ability. Both bacteria were successfully cultured in chicken peptone solution, which is similar to peptone solution containing commercial peptones apart from animal peptone. In chemical analysis, chicken peptone contained 12·0% nitrogen; this was similar to the nitrogen content from other commercial peptone sources, except for the 9·0% nitrogen found in soy peptones. The molecular weight of the peptone was determined by gel filtration chromatography, and those of all peptone, except animal-derived peptone, were found to be <5000 Da. In addition, when B. subtilis was cultured in a medium containing chicken peptone, it was shown that the protease activity was highest as compared with other commercial peptones. From these results, it is suggested that chicken peptone can be utilized for microbial culture, and this is an effective method to reuse chicken waste.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Immunology",Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
On the deactivation mechanisms of MnO2 electrocatalyst during operation in rechargeable zinc-air batteries studied via density functional theory,"Rittiruam M., Somdee S., Buapin P., Aumnongpho N., Kerdprasit N., Saelee T., Kheawhom S., Chotigkrai N., Praserthdam S., Praserthdam P.",2021-07-15,"Bifunctional electrocatalysts, Charge density difference, Charge discharge cycling, Deactivation mechanism, Free-energy diagrams, Oxygen evolution reaction (oer), Rechargeable zinc-air batteries, Surface distortion, Catalyst deactivation, Density functional theory, MnO2, Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Zinc-air battery (ZAB)","Due to its abundance and ecological friendliness, alpha-manganese dioxide (α-MnO2) is recognized as a cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The α-MnO2 is widely used in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, its performance gradually deteriorates upon charge-discharge cycling. Thus, its deactivation mechanisms must be understood to tackle such an issue. Herein, the deactivation mechanisms of MnO2 are duly investigated via the density functional theory–based analysis, where the MnO2 electrocatalysts are modeled based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the fresh MnO2 dominated by the α-MnO2 (211) and the spent one dominated by the β-MnO2 (110). Based on the simulated event of ORR, the *OOH species exhibited the strongest chemisorption to all of the surfaces, followed in order by *O and *OH, respectively. Regarding the surface distortion due to the species presented during ORR, it was investigated by the Bader charge and charge density difference analysis. It was found that all surface experienced some degrees of distortion confirmed by the calculated strain value, where the most distorted surface is the deactivated MnO2, the β-MnO2 (110). As the MnO2 phase transformation from α to β during ORR generates a less active surface, the low activity found on β-MnO2 (110) confirmed by the ORR overpotential (η) derived from its Gibbs free energy diagram is due to the limiting elementary step converting *OOH to *O, which blocks the propagation towards the final product. While the OER performance for the fresh and spent catalysts are similar. Hence, the deactivation of the MnO2 electrocatalyst occurring during ORR is due to (1) the phase change from α-MnO2 to β-MnO2 and (2) the limiting reaction, which leads to the formation of *OOH species rather than the H2O product. As a design guideline, the prevention of phase transformation is one of the key factors towards high-performance MnO2-based ORR/OER electrocatalysts.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Persuasive messages in advertising campaigns are more effective when customized to fit the customers' personalities. Researches suggested that music preference can reflect personality traits. However, those studies collected music listening history by using self-report of which the data obtained can be incomplete. This research aims to increase the completeness of music listening data by conducting a study on the three-month music streaming history of volunteers recorded automatically by Spotify. The eight audio features of each song (Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Speechiness, Valence, and Tempo) were extracted using Spotify's Application Programming Interface. The averages of these features calculated from songs in the music streaming history of each volunteer were used to represent his music preference. Pearson's Correlation method was employed to analyze relationships between the Big 5 Personality Traits and the music preference of 40 volunteers. The result shows a positive correlation between Openness-to-Experience and Liveness, a positive correlation between Extraversion and Acousticness, and a negative correlation between Extraversion with Energy and Speechiness. Agreeableness shows a positive correlation with Tempo. Instrumentalness is the only song feature that has a positive correlation with Neuroticism.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

In this study, we investigated its apoptotic induction ability and the involved mechanisms through the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3β/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2) signaling pathways in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer MCF-7 (MCF-7/DOX) cells. Our 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that rhinacanthin-C (3–28µM) significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7/DOX cells and potentiated hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity. This naphthoquinone was able to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), as measured by the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. This compound increased the number of apoptotic cells by elevating the ratio of apoptotic checkpoint proteins Bax/Bcl-2 and by decreasing the expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. Furthermore, Western blotting analyses showed that treatment with rhinacanthin-C (3–28µM) for 24h significantly decreased the expression levels of the phosphorylated forms of MAPK proteins (i.e., extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38), Akt, GSK-3β and Nrf2 proteins in MCF-7/DOX cells. Inhibition of the Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2 pathway led to a significant reduction in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)(H): quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) proteins. These findings suggested that rhinacanthin-C was able to induce apoptosis in MCF-7/DOX cells through increased ROS production and suppression of the cell survival systems mediated by the MAPKs and Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathways.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science"

This paper proposes a new market model for peer-to-peer energy trading based on double auction approach. By doing this, the proposed method provides the market participants more flexibility to decide the agreed price between any two partners of contract when compared to the other types of double auctions, i.e., uniform double auction, discriminatory double auction; pay-as-bid, pay buyer's price, and pay seller's price, and k-double auction. In the simulation, the generation and consumption data of all the market participants are randomized by using the real data from photovoltaic owner company and utility load research. Moreover, the trading period is set to be 1 hour which is separated into 2 intervals: bidding and power exchange. This paper focuses on the first 30 minutes for bidding period. The simulation results show that the proposed method can create more flexibility of setting exchange price.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"
Dynamic frequency support by photovoltaic system with virtual inertia control in Microgrid,"Chalittapom N., Chirapongsananurak P.",2021-05-19,"Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, Battery energy storage, Dynamic frequency supports, Moment of inertia, Photovoltaic systems, PV power generation, Rotational parts, Solar irradiances, Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, Frequency stability, PV system, Virtual inertia","In recent years, the usage of PV system is increasing in the power system. Typically, PV power generation is uncontrollable and depends on solar irradiance and temperature. In addition, PV has no moment of inertia due to the lack of rotational part. Hence, the PV penetration affects the frequency stability of system because of the reduction of the system inertia. This paper proposes the integration of virtual inertia to the PV system without using battery energy storage. The proposed approach is used for enhancing frequency stability by using power reserve from PV itself. This paper employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for adjusting the virtual inertia value to be suitable for the system. Moreover, ANFIS is used to adjust the power reserve of PV according to the strength of the system. To evaluate the results from the proposed virtual inertia method, a microgrid test system is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for observing the performance of the proposed control method. The results show that the proposed control method is superior to the constant inertia. Although PV virtual inertia is helpful to the system, power generation will be decreased for reservation in case of an unexpected situation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

As the climate, society, and the environment change, these could bring more difficulties for agricultural planning because of unexpected decreasing yields of food crops; this could create a poverty situation. Therefore, an appropriate crop yield estimation methodology should be developed to help individual farmers plant crops. It is not only for adequate and safe food crops but also sustainable agricultural planning. A crop yield model is a technology that could be the best tool for farmers and researchers to develop yield products and farm management. Many crop-model studies have applied low-resolution data over a large area, and therefore the yield calculation of a whole district or village has resulted in the exact figure, whereas in reality, many paddy areas have a fragmented pattern with small rice plots.This study emphasized transplanted rice in a tiny area in Saraburi province. Field survey experiments have been conducted at observing rice characteristics to calibrate the crop parameters for local rice varieties. The cultivar-specific and agricultural practices were measured and evaluated. Integration of moderate-resolution satellite image and the AquaCrop model was performed to extract the essential crop parameters of paddy for yield simulation using the model. The green canopy cover (CC) information derived from the satellite data has provided acceptable results through the rice yield simulation and observed yield validation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Information Systems

We aimed to design a multimeric-subunit vaccine using comprehensive immunoinformatic approach. Research design and Methods: The T and B cell epitopes were shortlisted on antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity from proteome data and joined with appropriate linkers. The physical characteristics of vaccine candidate was calculated and docking/molecular dynamic simulation performed to validate its robustness. The multimeric protein was codon optimized and in-silico cloned in pET28b. Results: From the 23,604 proteins of Ascaris, we filtered based on epitope prediction, localization, antigenicity, and allergenicity. Prepared a vaccine of 534 amino acid long, 56.31 kD weight and pI 4.52. Physiochemical features showed it is soluble, highly antigenic and non-allergenic. Its tertiary structure was forecasted, certified, and refined. The immunoinformatic simulation studies showed it to be potent T and B cell stimulator. Conclusions: We identified highly antigenic peptides of Ascaris from its proteome with good potential to induce innate as well as humoral immune response. These peptides were used to design a chimeric vaccine against Ascariasis infection, which can be used for prophylactic purpose but needs experimental and clinical validation.","Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

The complexity and uncertainty in the power system increase continuously due to the evolution of the smart grid, which needs an effective and accurate protection system. The faults in transmission lines affect the whole power system and also the consumers’ side. Therefore, accurate and precise identification of faults in transmission lines minimizes the losses and maximizes the functionality and reliability of the power network. Due to the recent advances in digital technology, an online scheme is used to locate the fault in transmission lines. In this paper, machine learning-based discrete wavelet transform and double-channel extreme learning machine method are proposed to locate and classify the faults in transmission lines. Db4 wavelet is used as a mother wavelet in the discrete wavelet transform for feature extraction up to nine levels. The proposed method validated on real-time data which achieves higher classification accuracies and less fault detection time. Results show that high-impedance non-linear faults have no effect on the proposed technique.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

However, knowledge of their objective characteristics and relationship to other motor symptoms amongst Asian PD patients is limited. Objectives: To identify objective vowel sound characteristics in Thai PD patients and correlate with disease severity, as determined by UPDRS and various sub-scores. Method: We evaluated 100 Thai PD patients, with a mean age of 66.56 years (±7.52) and HY of 2.7 (±1.08), and 101 age-matched controls. Phonatory evaluation, comprising of 15 objective parameters, was conducted using the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme with a sustained /a/ phonation. Results: PD patients exhibited significantly higher values of all dimensions of the phonatory parameters evaluated compared to controls (All, p < 0.001) except for duration of sustained phonation, which was significantly shorter in PD patients. When early- and advanced-stage patients were compared, significantly different parameters were limited to frequency perturbation parameters (Jitt, p = 0.01; RAP, p = 0.013; PPQ, p = 0.01; sPPQ, p = 0.001; vF0, p = 0.011), and NHR (p = 0.028). Several significant and moderate correlations were observed between both STD and frequency perturbation parameters and UPDRS-III, bradykinesia sub-score, and gait and postural instability sub-score. Both vF0, and STD significantly correlated with UPDRS-III and sub-scores in advanced stage patients. Conclusion: Our study provides objective evidence of phonatory dysfunction in Asian PD patients with certain characteristics correlated with advanced stage or different motor dysfunction.

Smart Waste Management Model for Effective Disposal of Waste Management Through Technology,"Marimuthu R., Shanthi M., Aramvith S., Sivaranjani S.",2021-01-01,"Connected systems, Ecological cycles, Management method, Municipal solid waste (MSW), Undesirable effects, Various technologies, Waste collection, Waste management systems, Internet of things, Smart bin, Waste management, Wireless sensor networks","Generation of waste is an essential part of ecological cycle and is found in every element of ecosystem. With an increase in population and an expansion in urbanization, waste production has become area centric. In addition, the developments in technology and luxury appliances to meet the demands of this urban population have increased multiple types of solid waste which differ in composition and their ability to decompose. For example, recently we have seen an increase in medical waste, e-waste, and also chemical waste which had not been there before three decades. Hence waste management becomes an important responsibility of all the stakeholders producing waste and authorities handling human locale and ecosystem. Waste management refers to a waste collection system, including its transportation, disposal, or reusing, and it must be effectively handled to avoid its undesirable effect on the health and the environment. Increase in urbanization, especially in developing countries like India, accounts for most of the irregularities in governance since the infrastructure, human resources, and facilities have not been preplanned for the rapid increase. According to the Census of India report in 2011, the urban population crossed 377 million accounting for 31% of the total population. According to Kumar and Gaikwad (2004), the rate of urbanization increases if the urban population exceeds 25% of total population. This in turn can produce a sharp rise in waste generation also, which in fact is corroborated by the data collected on the municipal solid waste (MSW). With generation of 133,760 tons of municipal solid waste per day, it is very much essential for us to go smart for both collection and treatment since the former is only 68.14% and the latter is a mere 19.35% of generation. Cities top the list in generation per capita in India with 0.17 kg in small towns compared to 0.62 kg in cities. With the prediction toward more increase in population, this is expected only to increase and not decrease in any way. With India’s MSW management still in landfill methods, it is going to be difficult to be efficient in waste management even in the near future. It is essential for us to turn to technology for waste management immediately. For example, the wastes we are creating every day can be converted into something good, such as electricity, heat, or fuel. In addition, the administration of the waste in different environments like rural and urban can be effectively planned with the help of technology. Internet of Things has been used in governance of waste management systems in advanced countries, right from the waste collection and classification to waste transformation, thus creating an effective recycling and connected systems across utilities. This chapter discusses the types of waste, waste generation, and waste management with a difference in rural and urban environment and the various considerations connected with both.

"Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and cellular metal accumulation caused by professionally applied fluoride products in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances: A randomized clinical trial.","Apiwantanakul N., Chantarawaratit P.-O.",2021-09-01,"DNA Damage, Fluorides, Humans, Mouth Mucosa, Orthodontic Appliances, Fixed, Prospective Studies, Corrosion, Cytotoxicity, Fluoride, Genotoxicity, Orthodontic appliances","Backgroud: Corrosion of metal orthodontic appliances caused by professional fluoride products has been recently concerned. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic effect of these products on buccal mucosal cells from patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. Methods: A total of 44 patients, aged 12 to 35 years, who began orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances were included in this single-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated into 4 parallel groups according to the type of professional fluoride treatment applied after placing the appliances: acidulated phosphate fluoride gel (APF); neutral fluoride gel (NGel); fluoride varnish (FVa); and without fluoride treatment (control). Buccal cells were collected before treatment (T1) and 3 months after appliance placement (T2). The cells were assayed for cell viability and underwent Papanicolaou staining. Cells with micronuclei and degenerative nuclear alterations were scored using a light microscope. Cell metal content was quantified by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed with the Kruskal–Wallis test. Results: The intracellular nickel content in the APF group significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas that of the control, NGel, and FVa groups did not. The changes in chromium concentration in all groups were not significantly different compared with control. Use of APF resulted in a significantly higher decrease in cell viability and increase in morphologic signs of cell death compared with control (P < 0.05). The change in frequency of micronucleated cells was not significantly different from that in the control group. Conclusions: Applying APF gel on fixed orthodontic appliances increased the cell metal content and decreased cell viability; however, genotoxic effects were absent. FVa and NGel are suggested as the products of choice to use during orthodontic treatment.",dentistry,Orthodontics

However, there is still limited information about the expression and role of the Notch ligand in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Objective: To investigate the expression of JAG1 and DLL4 in HCC tissues. Methods: One hundred and forty-five HCC tissues in paraffin block since 2009 to 2016 at King Chulalongkorn Memo-rial hospital were assayed for JAG1 and DLL4 by immunohistochemistry. All the sections were separately analyzed in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue and scoring based on intensity and quantity of immunoreaction. Kruskal-Wallis H test examined the correlation between JAG1 and DLL4 protein expression and clinical pathology. Results: The expression of JAG1 and DLL4 of tumor cells is 57.2% (83/145) and 88.9% (129/145), respectively. The expression of JAG1 is significantly higher in tumor tissues than adjacent non-tumor tissues (P = 0.002), and significantly increased in patients with age < 60 years old (P = 0.007). Interestingly, the DLL4 expression is also expressed in the normal liver tissue and DLL4 expression is not associated with any of the clinical parameters. When we performed a subgroup analysis, in HCC patients without a viral infection analysis, JAG1 is significantly increased in HCC patients with low albumin level (≤ 3.5) (P = 0.043). Conclusions: JAG1 expression is increased in HCC and seems to correlate with HCC patients with earlier onset and lower albumin level, whereas DLL4 expression did not significantly correlate with any clinical features.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

To compute LF in a low voltage distribution system (LVDS) with unbalanced topologies, each branch model in the LVDS can be simplified by defining the neutral and ground voltages as zero and then using Kron’s reduction to transform into a 3 × 3 branch matrix, but this decreases accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified branch model that is also reduced into a 3 × 3 matrix but is derived from the impedances of the phase-A,-B,-C, neutral, and ground conductors together with the grounding resistances, thereby increasing the accuracy. Moreover, this paper proposes improved LF equations for unbalanced LVDS with both PQ and PV nodes. The improved LF equations are based on the polar-form power injection approach. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the modified branch model and the improved LF equations.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study, therefore, aimed to gain insight into genetic information of antimicrobial resistance in environmental water in Thailand. Methods: Coliform bacteria were isolated from environmental water collected at 20 locations in Thailand and identified. Then, susceptibility profiles to ampicillin, cefazoline, cefotaxime, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid were assessed. In addition, antimicrobial resistant genes integrons, and replicon types were analyzed. And furthermore, plasmids carrying blaTEM and tetM were identified by S1-PFGE analysis and confirmed transmissibility by transconjugation experiments. Results: In 130 coliform bacteria isolated, 89 were resistant to cefazoline while 41 isolates were susceptible. Cefazoline-resistant coliform bacteria were found to be significantly resistant to cefotaxime and tetracycline as compared to susceptible isolates. Hence, blaTEM and tetM correlating with β-lactam antibiotics and tetracycline, respectively, were analyzed found to co-localize on the IncFrepB plasmids in isolates from pig farms’ wastewater by S1-PFGE analysis. And furthermore, transmissibility of the plasmids was confirmed. Conclusions: Results obtained in this study suggested that ARGs in coliform bacteria may have been spreading on the farm via IncFrepB plasmids. Hence, appropriate use of antimicrobials and good hygiene management on the farm are required to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

However, the dissolution of manganese leading to an abrupt decline of capacity and the sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics are still the main bottlenecks restricting their further development. Herein, a NiMn-layered double hydroxide-derived Ni-doped Mn2O3 (NM) is developed to suppress the dissolution of manganese. The incorporation of Ni2+ can promote electronic rearrangement and enhance the conductivity, ultimately improving the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of the NM. Moreover, the doped Ni2+ can effectively stabilize the Mn-O bond of Mn2O3 by reducing the formation energy. In addition, the storage mechanism based on the simultaneous insertion and transformation of H+ and Zn2+ is demonstrated. Interestingly, the Ni-doped Mn2O3 shows a high specific capacity of 252 mAh g–1 (0.1 A g–1), three times more than the pure Mn2O3 (72 mAh g–1). The capacity retention (≈85.6% over 2500 cycles at 1.0 A g–1) is also more excellent when comparing with the Mn2O3 cathode (≈49.7%). Significantly, an ultra-high energy density of 327.6 Wh kg–1 has been achieved using Ni-doped Mn2O3 cathode, which suggests that the synergistic effect of manganese and other transition metal ions provide a promising strategy for future development of ZIBs.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Chemistry (all), Biomaterials, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Electrochemistry"

Currently, the design and development of high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts remains the major challenge confronting nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Herein, anchoring the single Mo atom on the C9N4 substrate (Mo@C9N4) to form an efficient single-atom catalyst (SAC) is proposed for the conversion of N2 to NH3. By employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrated that gas phase N2 can be sufficiently activated and efficiently reduced to NH3 on the surface of Mo@C9N4. Meanwhile, we found that the NRR dominantly occurred on the Mo center via a preferred distal pathway with favorable limiting potential of 0.40 V. Importantly, the as-established Mo@C9N4 catalyst exhibits an outstanding structural stability and good selectivity toward NRR. These findings provide a promising platform for designing Mo-based SACs for electrochemical N2 fixation.","fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

The therapy is often discontinued due to the complexity of its delivery. Methods: Fifty-one PD patients undergoing CSAI as an add-on therapy were enrolled in the Thai Apomorphine Registry, an electronic database that recorded clinical characteristics and parameters during the 14-consecutive-day titration and long-term follow-up. Factors at the time of titration were documented in order to identify predictors of long-term discontinuation. Results: Following initiation, PD patients were administered a mean CSAI dose of 5.89 mg/h (SD 1.36) over a mean time of 12.28 h (SD 1.90) each day. The mean follow-up period was 626.2 days (SD 619.17).

Thirty-five (68.6%) patients discontinued during the follow-up period. Relative risks of variables recorded at the time of titration that determined discontinuation of CSAI therapy were an absence of full-time caregivers, achieving a daily off hours reduction <3.5 h, and NMSQ scores at the time of CSAI titration ≥9.5 points. Conclusion: Identifying factors that predict discontinuation of CSAI at the time of its initiation may help physicians to better understand the patient's drug response and how to manage them long-term.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 does not undergo its normal cytoplasmic degradation but instead travels to the nucleus, where it binds to a DNA promoter and initiates transcription of anti-oxidative genes. Nrf2 upregulation is associated with increased cellular levels of glutathione disulfide, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferases, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Given its key role in governing the cellular antioxidant response, upregulation of Nrf2 has been suggested as a common therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which are associated with chronic oxidative and nitrosative stress, characterised by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite. These processes lead to extensive lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and carbonylation, and oxidative damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Intake of N-acetylcysteine, coenzyme Q10 and melatonin is accompanied by increased Nrf2 activity. N-acetylcysteine intake is associated with improved cerebral mitochondrial function, decreased central oxidative and nitrosative stress, reduced neuroinflammation, alleviation of endoplasmic reticular stress and suppression of the unfolded protein response. Coenzyme Q10, which acts as a superoxide scavenger in neuroglial mitochondria, instigates mitohormesis, ameliorates lipid peroxidation in the inner mitochondrial membrane, activates uncoupling proteins, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and has positive effects on the plasma membrane redox system. Melatonin, which scavenges mitochondrial free radicals, inhibits mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase, restores mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, deacetylates and activates mitochondrial SIRT3, ameliorates increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and intestine and counters neuroinflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Methods: All patients treated from February 1999 until September 2019 at our center who had bone marrow biopsy-proven t-MN after PRRT were included. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and all tumor-directed therapies before t-MN diagnosis were collected. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with OS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to define cutoff values as well as sensitivity and specificity of the parameters. Results: Out of 1631 patients treated with PRRT, 30 patients developed t-MN comprising myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 23 patients (77%) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 7 patients (23%). The median OS of t-MN patients was 13 months (range 9.1–16.9 months): 6 months for AML and 15 months for the MDS subgroup, respectively. Higher platelet level was a significant prognostic parameter for longer OS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.99, P < 0.05). Using ROC analysis, the best cutoff value for thrombocyte count was 183.5 Gpt/L, resulting in a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 50%. Other factors, such as hemoglobin level, did not show a significant correlation with OS.

The TsOH-H2SO4 catalyst showed a good catalytic performance in tandem synthesis similar to TsOH and it could be recovered for reuse while TsOH could not be recovered. This process offers an attractive route for reuse homogeneous catalyst of tandem synthesis, the main by-product of biodiesel, to tert-butyl glycerol ethers – a value-added in applications as a valuable fuel additive.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Methods: A multicentre prospective cohort study was conducted among AYHIV (15 to 25 years), and age- and sex-matched HIV-uninfected adolescents and young adults (HUAY). The Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scales (GAD-7) were used as screening tools for depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively. History of lifetime and recent suicidal ideations/attempts were ascertained. Elevated mental health screening scores were defined as having either significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥9), significant anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 ≥10) or suicidality (lifetime; and recent [within two weeks]). Participants meeting these criteria were referred to psychiatrists for confirmatory diagnosis and mental health services. Follow-up assessment with PHQ-9 and GAD-7 was performed one year after psychiatric referral. Results: From February to April 2018, 150 AYHIV and 150 HUAY were enrolled, median age was 19.0 (IQR:16.8 to 21.8) years and 56% lived in urban areas. Among AYHIV, 73% had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL, and median CD4 count was 580 (IQR:376 to 744) cells/mm3. At enrolment, 31 AYHIV (21%; 95%CI:14% to 28%) had elevated mental health screening scores; 17 (11%) significant depressive symptoms, 11 (7%) significant anxiety symptoms and 21 (14%) suicidality. Seven AYHIV (5%) had all three co-existing conditions. These prevalences were not substantially different from HUAY. Urban living increased risk, whereas older age decreased risk of elevated mental health screening scores (p < 0.05). All AYHIV with elevated mental health screening scores were referred to study psychiatrists, and 19 (13%; 95%CI: 8% to 19%) had psychiatrist-confirmed mental health disorders (MHDs), including adjustment disorder (n = 5), major depression (n = 4), anxiety disorders (n = 2), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 1) and mixed MHDs (n = 4). One year after psychiatric referral, 42% of AYHIV who received mental health services demonstrated an absence of significant mental health symptoms from the reassessments, and 26% had an improved score. Conclusions: With the significant burden of MHDs among AYHIV, an integration of mental health services, including mental health screenings, and psychiatric consultation and referral, is critically needed and should be scaled up in HIV healthcare facilities.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

One difficulty in the engineering design and construction of rockfill dams is the characterisation of the rockfill materials. Thanks to advancements in computational geomechanics, a finite element analysis is usually employed in geotechnical engineering design. To perform such analyses, a proper constitutive model with relevant parameters that reflect the stress–strain-strength characteristics of rockfill materials are required. This study presents a procedure to determine the strength and stiffness parameters of rockfill materials that can be used with the Hardening Soil (HS) model to characterise the behaviour of rockfill materials. Based on triaxial and oedometer test results, a set of HS model parameters can be determined. To implement and validate the procedure, six rockfill materials from the Nam Ngum 2 Dam construction project in Laos PDR are employed in this study. The influences of stress level and particle breakage on the stress–strain/volumetric-strain behaviours of rockfill materials are discussed. Finally, the procedure to determine the material parameters for rockfill materials presented in this study can also be applied to other rockfill materials.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

The focus of this research is to synthesize, evaluate and analyze the performance of ordered mesoporous MCM-41 employing illite clay waste as silica and aluminum sources under hydrothermal pressure condition using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as structure template. The characterization of catalysts was carried out by low angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N2 physisorption isotherm which indicated the formation of well-ordered MCM-41 mesoporous materials, high surface area (952 m2/g) and corresponds to a type IV isotherm of hysteresis loop, respectively. Co and Fe were deposited on synthesized MCM-41 surface by impregnation method. The catalytic performance was tested in an ex-situ gasification process at 700 °C. The 5Co/MCM-41 catalyst significantly increased the carbon conversion from 68.63% to 77.30% while using 5Fe/MCM-41 catalyst yielded the highest H2/CO ratio of 0.66, hydrogen conversion of 26.80% and gas heating value of 10.72 MJ/kg. The results indicated that the illite waste may be converted to high-value zeolite material while TCR is a potential greener fuel feedstock for gasification. This novel method to synthesize the MCM-41 from illite clay waste utilized doping of cobalt and iron metal catalyst to increase the efficiency of gasification of TCR.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

A further aim was to evaluate peri-implant soft-tissue changes following surgical peri-implantitis treatment. Materials and methods: Group discussions based on two systematic reviews (SR) and one critical review (CR) addressed (i) the influence of implant material and surface characteristics on the incidence and progression of peri-implantitis, (ii) implant and restorative design elements and the associated risk for peri-implant diseases, and (iii) peri-implant soft-tissue level changes and patient-reported outcomes following peri-implantitis treatment. Consensus statements, clinical recommendations, and implications for future research were discussed within the group and approved during plenary sessions. Results: Data from preclinical in vivo studies demonstrated significantly greater radiographic bone loss and increased area of inflammatory infiltrate at modified compared to non-modified surface implants. Limited clinical data did not show differences between modified and non-modified implant surfaces in incidence or progression of peri-implantitis (SR). There is some evidence that restricted accessibility for oral hygiene and an emergence angle of >30 combined with a convex emergence profile of the abutment/prosthesis are associated with an increased risk for peri-implantitis (CR). Reconstructive therapy for peri-implantitis resulted in significantly less soft-tissue recession, when compared with access flap. Implantoplasty or the adjunctive use of a barrier membrane had no influence on the extent of peri-implant mucosal recession following peri-implantitis treatment (SR). Conclusions: Prosthesis overcontouring and impaired access to oral hygiene procedures increases risk for peri-implantitis. When indicated, reconstructive peri-implantitis treatment may facilitate the maintenance of post-operative peri-implant soft-tissue levels.",dentistry,Oral Surgery
Experimental study of the load-deformation behaviour of the precast post-tensioned continuous girder for straddle monorail: Full-scale load test under service and ultimate loading conditions,"Sirisonthi A., Suparp S., Joyklad P., Hussain Q., Julphunthong P.",2021-12-01,"Computational tools, Construction procedures, Design and construction, Engineering analysis, Experimental program, Service load condition, Two point loadings, Ultimate load-carrying capacity, Finite element analysis, Girder, Pier segments, Posttensioned, Precast concrete, Service load, Straddle monorail","This study presented the results of an experimental program conducted on a newly proposed Full-scale Precast Post-tensioned Continuous (FPPC) girder for straddle monorail. The investigated FPPC girder represents the actual size, design and construction details for a newly designed monorail transit system (Yellow Line and Pink Line Monorail) in Bangkok, Thailand. The salient features of the newly proposed girder system include lightweight, low-cost, easy and fast construction. The newly proposed FPPC girder is mainly comprised of three reinforced concrete (RC) hollow haunched girders, four piers or supports, two pier segments, four wet joints, and four bearings at each support. The FPPC girder was constructed at the casting yard of Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction Public Company Limited (STECON), Thailand. The FPPC girder was tested under different loading conditions (such as service and ultimate loading conditions). Both service and ultimate loads were applied as two-point loadings. Service load in a monotonic manner was applied on the right exterior span (two-point), middle span (two-point), and on the left exterior span and middle span (four-point). Meanwhile, the ultimate load in a monotonic manner was applied only on the left exterior and middle span as a four-point loading scheme. The test results indicate that the behaviour of the FPPC girder under service load conditions is elastic. Further, cracking of the concrete was not observed at any location. The observed maximum deflections under service load conditions were less than the permissible limits at all locations. Further, the maximum ultimate load-carrying capacity was observed to be much greater than the design load under ultimate loading conditions. This is an indication that the design details and construction procedure of FPPC girder are appropriate and further that this system could be used effectively to construct straddle monorail transit systems. Finite element analysis of FPPC monorail bridge girder was also performed by using a computer program ATENA which is a computational tool for nonlinear engineering analysis of bridges and culverts. The finite element analysis results indicate that the computer program ATENA is well capable to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity, displacement and cracking patterns of FPPC girder.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

Presently, it is assessed by conventional site observation, labour-intensive data collection, and manual data analysis before designing a building mass, plan, façade, openings, and interior space. City Information Model (CIM), with its capabilities to store, visualize, and analyze a wealth of site-related information, has a great potential to support an automated view assessment. However, its realization is nascent, and it has not integrated with architectural space planning in either research or practice. This research, therefore, aims to develop a model through which CIM can be extended to assist view assessment in architectural space planning. By literature review, brainstorming, prototyping, and case study, this research corroborates that by harnessing the power of CIM, the conventional view evaluation can be transformed from qualitative to mix-used. It helps practitioners assess a view and design a space in a more precise and rapid manner. This research also provides the integrated model for view evaluation in architectural space planning with three stages to support the real-world practice. Future studies are recommended to develop the proposed model and integrate it with multiple criteria to advance the generative design.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Building and Construction, Civil and Structural Engineering, Control and Systems Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications"

Previous genetic studies of Thai/Lao populations have focused almost exclusively on uniparental markers and there is a paucity of genome-wide studies. We therefore generated genome-wide SNP data for 33 ethnolinguistic groups, belonging to the five MSEA language families from Thailand and Laos, and analyzed these together with data from modern Asian populations and SEA ancient samples. Overall, we find genetic structure according to language family, albeit with heterogeneity in the AA-, HM-, and ST-speaking groups, and in the hill tribes, that reflects both population interactions and genetic drift. For the TK speaking groups, we find localized genetic structure that is driven by different levels of interaction with other groups in the same geographic region. Several Thai groups exhibit admixture from South Asia, which we date to ∼600-1000 years ago, corresponding to a time of intensive international trade networks that had a major cultural impact on Thailand. An AN group from Southern Thailand shows both South Asian admixture as well as overall affinities with AA-speaking groups in the region, suggesting an impact of cultural diffusion. Overall, we provide the first detailed insights into the genetic profiles of Thai/Lao ethnolinguistic groups, which should be helpful for reconstructing human genetic history in MSEA and selecting populations for participation in ongoing whole genome sequence and biomedical studies.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

Our hypothesis is curcumin regulates the expression of wound healing-related genes in human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). This study investigated whether curcumin regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, type I TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRI), type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in unwounded hGFs and an in vitro hGF wound healing model. Methods: The cytotoxicity of curcumin was evaluated using the MTT assay. Unwounded hGFs were treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of curcumin for 24 h. Gene expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, hGFs were treated with 1 µM curcumin in an in vitro wound healing model. PD98059 pretreatment was performed to determine whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling was required for regulation of gene expression by curcumin. Results: Curcumin at 0.1–20 µM caused no significant change in cell viability. In unwounded hGFs, curcumin had no significant effect on TGF-β1, TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, or VEGF expression. Conversely, curcumin significantly upregulated the expression of these genes in the in vitro wound healing model. PD98059 significantly attenuated the curcumin-stimulated TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF expression, whereas it had no effect on TGF-β1 expression. Conclusions: Curcumin upregulated TGF-β1, TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF expression in an in vitro hGF wound healing model. The ERK pathway is required for TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, and VEGF induction by curcumin.

This procedure can reconstruct a 5-digit hand with stable thumb for opposition. As the viable epiphyseal plate is included in this transfer, the potential for future growth can be expected from this type of reconstruction. This article describes details of the surgical procedures. The outcomes of this reconstruction are shown in a 7-year-old girl who presented with hypoplastic thumb type IV. Initially, her thumb was unstable, nonmobile, and had no function. The skin pedicle of this thumb had a diameter of about 3 mm. Preoperative radiography showed floating thumb without first metacarpal bone. The vascularized metatarsophalangeal joint from the opposite second toe was used for her hypoplastic thumb reconstruction. During the procedure, the flail thumb was preserved. The intraoperative bone gap that was needed for reconstruction was 3.5 cm. The artery was anastomosed with common digital artery from the third web space. Two dorsal veins were joined with the subcutaneous vein at the dorsum of the hand. Total operative time was 6 hours. At the 9-month follow-up, this girl achieved a 5-digit hand with stable thumb that had opposition to the tip of her little finger.

Several studies developed SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a platform; however, the validations with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the clinical performance of previously described CRISPR-Cas12a based diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. According to the results, the CRISPR-Cas12a assays on N1 and S genes provided diagnostic accuracy (≥ 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results. The assays with E, N2 and S genes yielded acceptable sensitivity of detection (≥ 95 %) whereas N1 and S genes provided outstanding specificity of detection (100 %).

It is common knowledge that linear finite elements, e.g., four-node quadrilateral (Q4) or eight-node hexahedral (HH8) elements, are not highly suitable for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The elements with quadratic interpolation functions have to be used instead. In this paper, the CIP-enhanced four-node quadrilateral element (CQ4), and the CIP-enhanced eight-node hexahedral element (CHH8), are for the first time extended to investigate geometrically nonlinear problems of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures. To further enhance the efficiency of the present approaches, novel numerical integration schemes based on the concept of mid-point rules, namely element mid-points (EM) and element mid-edges (EE) are integrated into the present CQ4 element. For CHH8, the 3D-version of EM (namely 3D-EM) and the element mid-faces (EF) scheme are investigated. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the two novel quadrature schemes in both regular and irregular (distorted) meshes are analyzed. Numerical results indicate that the new integration approaches perform more efficiently than the well-known Gaussian quadrature while gaining equivalent accuracy. The performance of the CIP-enhanced elements, which is examined through numerical experiments, is found to be equivalent to that of quadratic Lagrangian finite element counterparts, while having the same discretization with that by the linear finite elements. In addition, we also apply the present CQ4 and CHH8 elements associated with different numerical integration techniques to nearly incompressible materials.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

Despite many aspects describing rabies neuropathogenesis, numerous hypotheses remain unanswered and concealed. Observations obtained from infected primary neurons or mouse brain samples are more relevant to human clinical rabies than permissive cell lines; however, limitations regarding the ethical issue and sample accessibility become a hurdle for discovering new insights into virus–host interplays. To better understand RABV pathogenesis in humans, we generated human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons to offer the opportunity for an inimitable study of RABV infection at a molecular level in a pathologically relevant cell type. This study describes the characteristics and detailed proteomic changes of hiPSC-derived neurons in response to RABV infection using LC-MS/MS quantitative analysis. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) reveals temporal changes of proteins related to metabolic process, immune response, neurotransmitter transport/synaptic vesicle cycle, cytoskeleton organization, and cell stress response, demonstrating fundamental underlying mechanisms of neuropathogenesis in a time-course dependence. Lastly, we highlighted plausible functions of heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70 or HSPA8) that might play a pivotal role in regulating RABV replication and pathogenesis. Our findings acquired from this hiPSC-derived neuron platform help to define novel cellular mechanisms during RABV infection, which could be applicable to further studies to widen views of RABV-host interaction.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The TP method employs visible, UV and IR as light sources with different filters. Moreover, the multi-spectrum method, using a continuous light source and various filters, has been used in the same application. This research proposed a method of using narrow multi-colored LEDs as light sources instead of colored filters. It aimed to optimize the number of LED channels for identifying pigments in conservation and restoration applications. Twelve tunable single-wavelength LEDs having wavelengths of 400-700 nm and 2 white LEDs, were used as light sources for capturing images of 357 Kremer pigments, applied on white card paper, without an optical brightening agent, through a visible pass filter, located in front of the single lens reflex Canon 5D Mark II camera that was modified by removing the UV and IR blocks. The 357 pigments including 9 main colors: 50 red pigments, 37 orange pigments, 82 yellows, 38 greens, 38 blues, 17 purples, and a group of greys browns, blacks and whites were used as samples. Subsequently, the pigments were classified, based on the captured images obtained from the individual LED. The redundancy of the CIEL*C*h data of each LED was reduced using the principal component analysis and the number of LEDs was optimized. It was found that all pigments could be classified and some pigments could be identified using single wavelength LEDs. The PCA should be applied to the CIEL*C*h data of pigments having similar shade.

The benefits of the FPV plant are analysed in terms of energy generation using the Perez 1990 algorithm, evaporation reduction using Shuttleworth 1993 algorithm, economic analysis, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The analysis results are simulated based on the maximum coverage area of FPV that does not influence the normal operation of each reservoir. Based on the amount of energy production of all the considered 12 dams, the Srinagarind Dam can generate the highest power. In the Ubol Ratana dam, the water evaporates at the highest rate. In terms of investment, the production cost mainly depends on the plane of array (POA) of solar irradiance in each dam.","Business, computer science, energy, engineering, sociology","Strategy and Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Urban Studies"

Methods: A survey was performed using questionnaires composed of two parts: a scenario-based questionnaire using scenarios of polyps, which were adopted from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, and an image-based questionnaire using provided endoscopic images of polyps. Results: A total of 154 endoscopists participated in this survey. The most preferred resection techniques for diminutive (≤5 mm), small (6–9 mm), and benign-looking intermediate (10–19 mm) nonpedunculated polyps were cold forceps polypectomy, hot snare polypectomy, and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), respectively, in both the scenario- and image-based questionnaires. For benign-looking large (≥20 mm) nonpedunculated polyps, EMR and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) were preferred in the scenario- and image-based surveys, respectively. In case of malignant nonpedunculated polyps, EMR and ESD were preferred for intermediate-sized and large lesions, respectively, according to the scenario-based survey. However, ESD was preferred in both intermediate-sized and large malignant nonpedunculated polyps according to the image-based survey. Trainee endoscopists, endoscopists working in referral centers, and endoscopists in the colorectal cancer–prevalent countries were independently associated with preference of cold snare polypectomy for removing small polyps. Conclusions: The polypectomy practice patterns of Asian endoscopists vary, and cold snare polypectomy was not the most preferred resection method for polyps <10 mm in size, in contrast to recent guidelines.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"
In-situ chemical modification of printed conducting polymer films for specific glucose biosensing,"Fujisaki H., Watcharawittayakul T., Matsumoto A., Miyahara Y., Goda T.",2021-12-15,"Acid chloride reaction, Acid chlorides, Biosensing, Ethylene diamine, Ethylenedioxythiophenes, Fluorophenylboronic acid, Glucose sensing, Poly(styrene sulfonate), Potentiometry, Surface-modification, Acid chloride reaction, Fluorophenylboronic acid, Glucose sensing, Potentiometry, Surface modification","Conductive polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), can be used for specific biosensing after its surface is modified with functional groups. Herein, we report a simple two-step surface modification method for commercially available PEDOT:PSS films printed on a flexible substrate. The derivatization process involves: (1) the introduction of an ethylenediamine linker for conjugation with the biorecognition element by activating the sulfonate group in PSS with an acid chloride reaction; and (2) the introduction of FPBA into the ethylenediamine linker. As a proof of concept, 4-carboxy-3-fluorophenylboronic acid (carboxy FPBA) is covalently introduced to the side chain of the PSS dopant in the conductive layer. FPBA serves as a selective molecular recognition element for diol compounds, including glucose, at neutral pH. Continuous glucose monitoring is achieved by label-free potentiometry using FPBA-functionalized commercial PEDOT:PSS films. Negative potential responses with glucose are successfully achieved in ideal and realistic buffer solutions with or without 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) because of the complexation of FPBA. The dynamic range of the enzyme-free sensor covered physiologically relevant blood glucose levels of 70–140 mg/dL. The developed method is suitable and cost effective for the mass production of biosensors as it can be applied to a large surface area at once. Furthermore, various ligands and receptors can be introduced onto commercial PEDOT:PSS films using this technique. Hence, the proposed method has potential applications in wearable and implantable biosensors.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
The role of once-weekly online hemodiafiltration with low protein diet for initiation of renal replacement therapy: A case series,"Takkavatakarn K., Kittiskulnam P., Tiranathanagul K., Katavetin P., Wongyai N., Mahatanan N., Tungsanga K., Eiam-Ong S., Praditpornsilpa K., Susantitaphong P.",2021-11-01,"Bangkok, Haemodialysis, Hemodiafiltration, Hemodialysis patient, Incremental hemodialysis, Kidney function, Low protein diet, Once-weekly dialysis, Renal replacement therapies, Treatment modality, hemodiafiltration, Incremental hemodialysis, low-protein diet, once-weekly dialysis","Incremental hemodialysis (HD) has become an exciting approach according to the recognition of the importance of preserving residual kidney function (RKF). However, not all incident HD patients are suitable for this approach, particularly once-weekly HD. This is the first study which reported the effectiveness of once-weekly online-hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) plus low protein diet (LPD) in incident HD patients. All stage 5 CKD patients who had chosen HD as their treatment modality at the HD center of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, with RKF ⩾ 3 mL/min calculated by renal clearance of urea and urine output ⩾ 800 mL/day, started the treatment with once-weekly OL-HDF. Dietitians advised patients to consume LPD (0.6–0.8 g/kg/day) on non-dialysis days and a regular protein diet on the dialysis day (1.2 g/kg/day). Eleven incident HD patients were enrolled in the study. The mean RKF and urine volume at baseline were 4.56 ± 2.21 mL/min and 2,019.54 ± 743.73 mL/day, respectively. After 6 and 12 months of follow-up, the mean RKF of the patients who remained in the once-weekly OL-HDF protocol were 3.82 ± 1.68 mL/min and 3.28 ± 0.95 mL/min, respectively. The median duration of once-weekly OL-HDF before transitioning to twice- or thrice-weekly OL-HDF was 7 months (3–24 months). The most common indication for stepping prescription was too low RKF. We reported that dialysis initiation in the university-based center with once-weekly OL-HDF in carefully selected incident HD patients combined with LPD under serial monitoring is practical. Further studies on the clinical benefits of once-weekly OL-HDF are still required.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, medical, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

The parameters related to scalp physiology, drug PK, and formulations were incorporated into a Multi-Phase and Multi-Layer (MPML) Mechanistic Dermal Absorption (MechDermA) model within the Simcyp® Simulator V17. The finasteride PBPK model was linked to its effect on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels in plasma and scalp using an indirect response model. Predicted PK (and PD for finasteride) profiles and parameters were compared against the clinically reported data and justified by visual predictive checks and two-fold error criteria for model verification. The PBPK/PD model for finasteride reasonably demonstrated an ability to predict its respective PK and PD profiles, and parameters following scalp application under various clinical scenarios. Using the same scalp physiological input parameters, the minoxidil PBPK model was then developed and satisfactorily qualified with independent clinical datasets. Collectively, these results suggested that the established PBPK model may have broader utility for other topical formulations intended for scalp application.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

We aimed to assess the preferences for HIV care and attitudes towards DSD for ART maintenance among ART clients and providers at healthcare facilities in Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaires was conducted in September-November 2018 at five healthcare facilities in four high HIV burden provinces in Thailand. Eligible participants who were ART clients aged ≥18 years and ART providers were recruited by consecutive sampling. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics, preferences for HIV services and expectations and concerns towards DSD for ART maintenance. Results: Five hundred clients and 52 providers completed the questionnaires. Their median ages (interquartile range; IQR) were 38.6 (29.8 to 45.5) and 37.3 (27.3 to 45.1); 48.5% and 78.9% were females, 16.8% and 1.9% were men who have sex with men, and 2.4% and 7.7% were transgender women, respectively. Most clients and providers agreed that ART maintenance tasks, including ART refill, viral load testing, HIV/sexually transmitted infection monitoring, and psychosocial support should be provided at ART clinics (85.2% to 90.8% vs. 76.9% to 84.6%), by physicians (77.0% to 94.6% vs. 71.2% to 100.0%), every three months (26.7% to 40.8% vs. 17.3% to 55.8%) or six months (33.0% to 56.7% vs. 28.9% to 80.8%). Clients agreed that DSD would encourage their autonomy (84.9%) and empower responsibility for their health (87.7%). Some clients and providers disagreed that DSD would lead to poor ART retention (54.0% vs. 40.4%), increased loss to follow-up (52.5% vs. 42.3%), and delayed detection of treatment failure (48.3% vs. 44.2%), whereas 31.4% to 50.0% of providers were unsure about these expectations and concerns. Conclusions: Physician-led, facility-based clinical consultation visit spacing in combination with multi-month ART refill was identified as one promising DSD model in Thailand. However, low preference for decentralization and task shifting may prove challenging to implement other models, especially since many providers were unsure about DSD benefits. This calls for local implementation studies to prove feasibility and governmental and social support to legitimize and normalize DSD in order to gain acceptance among clients and providers.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Usefulness of an accelerometer-based navigation system in bilateral one-stage total knee arthroplasty,"Laoruengthana A., Rattanaprichavej P., Tantimethanon T., Eiamjumras W., Teekaweerakit P., Pongpirul K.",2021-12-01,"Accelerometry, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Humans, Knee Joint, Postoperative Period, Retrospective Studies, Surgery, Computer-Assisted, Accelerometer-based navigation, Bilateral total knee arthroplasty, Blood loss, Mechanical axis, Postoperative pain","Background: Bilateral one-stage total knee arthroplasty (BTKA) have increased because it provides a number of advantages. Recently, Accelerometer-based navigation (ABN) system which guide the cutting plane without intramedullary disturbance might result in less endothelial and microvascular damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ABN may reduce blood loss, reduce postoperative pain, and better restore BTKA alignment compared to conventional instruments. Methods: We retrospectively compared 44 consecutive patients receiving ABN assisted BTKA (iBTKA) to 57 patients with conventional instruments (cBTKA). Identical pre- and post-operative care was utilized to all patients. The outcome measures assessed were hemoglobin (Hb), calculated blood loss (CBL), blood transfusion, VAS score for pain, morphine consumption, knee flexion angle, and length of stay (LOS). Radiographic assessment included mechanical axis (MA) and component positioning at 3–6 months of follow up. Results: Both iBTKA and cTKA groups had equivalent demographic data. Postoperative Hb of the cBTKA group was significantly lower than those in the iBTKA group at 24 h (p = 0.02), but there was no significant difference in drain volume, CBL, and blood transfusion rate. For radiographic measures, the iBTKA group had more accurate MA and component orientation, and had a lower number of outliers than those in the cBTKA group (p ≤ 0.01), except for the sagittal femoral component angle. Conclusion: The ABN assisted BTKA could not reduce blood loss or postoperative pain more than cBTKA, nor improve functional recovery. However, the ABN significantly improved the accuracy of MA and prostheses positioning.

Users can ask and answer questions on a wide range of programming topics as well search for problems that other users have faced and find solutions that other users have suggested. From a viewpoint of a technology product owner, Stack Overflow can report various issues that product users have, and this serves as valuable input to the product improvement process. This paper proposes an automated approach to classifying questions that are posted on Stack Overflow with regard to a certain kind of products, i.e. database products in particular. The categories of questions are defined at two levels, i.e problem and subproblem. The problem level includes development, installation, and performance tuning, while the subproblem level consists of design, limitation, and discussion. By cross-combining the two levels, questions can be classified into nine problem-subproblem classes. Natural language processing and text classification are used with several machine learning algorithms, i.e. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Deep Learning Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network. The best classifiers for all classes are used further in a web-based tool that can classify each question by a problem-subproblem tag and also report the number of problems that users of a database product have posted. This information can benefit the owner of a database product in planning product maintenance and evolution.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Software, Information Systems and Management, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

In this study, we describe a new minimally invasive technique for percutaneous placement of modified iliac screws. Methods: A 64-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis suffered from a 3-column fracture at the L5 vertebra without any neurologic deficit. We performed percutaneous pedicle screw fixation from L2 to S1 with additional modified iliac screws augmentation using an intraoperative navigation. We inserted both S1 pedicle screw and modified iliac screw within a stab incision on each side of the patient's back without using rod connector. Results: The patient's severe low back pain subsided on the day following the operation. There was no clinical low back pain at 2-week follow-up. The 1-year follow-up x-ray showed that the fracture was healed successfully without signs of screw loosening or breakage. Conclusions: The modified iliac screws can be placed safely via percutaneous approach with an intraoperative image guidance. By using this new technique, surgeons can easily adjust the screw head to align with S1 pedicle screw via the same small incision. The rod connectors are not necessary for this technique. This method also prevents the acute angle that can develop between the screw head and shaft of the screw, which is typically found in S2 alar-iliac screw technique.","genergyal, orthopedic surgery, medical","Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

GSH plays a key role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and maintenance of balance in intracellular redox pathways. Recent data showed that imbalances in the GSH redox system are an important factor in the pathophysiology of ASD. Furthermore, ASD is accompanied by decreased concentrations of reduced GSH in part caused by oxidation of GSH into glutathione disulfide (GSSG). GSSG can react with protein sulfhydryl (SH) groups, thereby causing proteotoxic stress and other abnormalities in SH-containing enzymes in the brain and blood. Moreover, alterations in the GSH metabolism via its effects on redox-independent mechanisms are other processes associated with the pathophysiology of ASD. GSH-related regulation of glutamate receptors such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can contribute to glutamate excitotoxicity. Synergistic and antagonistic interactions between glutamate and GSH can result in neuronal dysfunction. These interactions can involve transcription factors of the immune pathway, such as activator protein 1 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, thereby interacting with neuroinflammatory mechanisms, ultimately leading to neuronal damage. Neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction are recently outlined as significant factors linking GSH impairments with the pathophysiology of ASD. Moreover, GSH regulates the methylation of DNA and modulates epigenetics. Existing data support a protective role of the GSH system in ASD development. Future research should focus on the effects of GSH redox signaling in ASD and should explore new therapeutic approaches by targeting the GSH system.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

It results in the formation of progressively growing plaque lesions that can harden and narrow their host arteries. Current computational models of the inflammatory process that govern atherosclerosis growth are reliant on a number of parameters that can freely vary and whose precise values are not well known. Methods: To identify the significance of variation in such parameters, a parametric sensitivity study had been conducted on the blood density, blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and bulk flow low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration. Using computational modeling, the significance of variation in these parameters was assessed on the transport of LDL. The simulation was performed via the 2k factorial experimental design, which was conducted to identify the significance of the select parameters on the intima LDL concentration and endothelial LDL coverage area. Results: Results identified the blood viscosity and bulk flow LDL concentration are the dominant parameters for the atherosclerotic lesion growth. The coverage of LDL on the arterial wall surface was strongly dependent on the blood viscosity. The significance of these findings was discussed. Conclusion: This statistical study identifies two dominating blood factors, LDL concentration and blood viscosity, and how they influence atherosclerosis which will serves as a guideline for further investigation on the atherosclerosis topic.","computer science, medical","Software, Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics"

Understanding the underlying mechanism of IS could lead to proper management and prognosis. We aimed to determine the prevalence of IS subtypes among HIV-infected patients who were hospitalized due to IS. Medical records of patients who were hospitalized at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 2008 and 2019 due to first-ever IS with documented HIV infection were retrospectively analyzed. IS subtypes were classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification. Among 6,952 patients who were hospitalized due to IS, 50 [0.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.5-1.0)] were HIV-infected patients and were included in the analysis. Common traditional stroke risk factors were dyslipidemia (62%), smoking (55.3%), hypertension (52%), and alcohol consumption (45%). The median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count was 294.5 (186-485) cells/mL and 74% were on antiretroviral therapy. The most common etiology of IS was small vessel occlusion (SVO) (48%), followed by stroke of undetermined etiology (UD) (26%), and stroke of other determined etiology (OD) (14%). Among patients with OD, 5 of 7 were from infectious-related cause. Virologically unsuppressed group had significantly higher proportion of OD (33.3% vs. 3.6%), UD (38.9% vs. 17.9%), and lower proportion of SVO (22.2% vs. 60.7%) based on TOAST classification compared with virologically suppressed group (p = .01). SVO was the most common cause of IS among HIV-infected patients and was more likely to occur among virologically suppressed group, suggesting that traditional vascular risk factors may play a larger role in developing IS. OD was more likely to occur among virologically unsuppressed group, most of which were infectious-related cause.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; diagnosis and disease monitoring, Immunology, medical","Immunology, Virology, Infectious Diseases"

A rapid and accurate detection method for this pathogen is highly desirable for the sustainable production of relevant food products. While several classical and molecular-based detection methods are available for the identification of B. cereus, they suffered one or more limitations such as the requirement for a tedious and time-consuming process, less than ideal specificity, and the lack of portability. Herein, we developed the first paper-based sensing device that exhibits high species specificity with sufficiently low limit of detection for the visual detection of specific DNA sequences of B. cereus. The success is attributed to the strategic planning of fabrication in various dimensions including thorough bioinformatics search for highly specific genes, the use of the pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe whose selectivity advantage is well documented, and an effective PNA immobilization and DNA-binding visualization method with an internal cross-checking system for validating the results. Testing in rice matrices indicates that the sensor is capable of detecting and distinguishing B. cereus from other bacterial species. Hence, this paper-based sensor has potential to be adopted as a practical means to detect B. cereus in food industries.

In-situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil derived from fast pyrolysis of sunflower stalk to aromatic hydrocarbons over bifunctional Cu-loaded HZSM-5,"Chaihad N., Anniwaer A., Karnjanakom S., Kasai Y., Kongparakul S., Samart C., Reubroycharoen P., Abudula A., Guan G.",2021-05-01,"Catalytic performance, Catalytic upgrading, Crystalline structure, H-zsm-5 catalysts, Regeneration properties, Sunflower stalks, Textural properties, Wet impregnation method, Aromatic hydrocarbons, Bio-oil, Catalytic upgrading, Cu modification, Fast pyrolysis, HZSM-5","Commercial HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 24) was modified with Cu species using the wet impregnation method, and applied in the in-situ upgrading of bio-oil from the fast sunflower stalk pyrolysis with a catalyst to biomass ratio of 1:1 at 500 °C. The main objective was to study the Cu doping effect on the HZSM-5 catalytic performance in terms of the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons (especially the specific aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and xylene) yield. It was found that Cu/HZSM-5 with low Cu loading amounts preserved HZSM-5 crystalline structure as well as its acid sites. The HZSM-5 with 0.5 wt.% Cu loading amount exhibited the best catalytic performance with a high relative amount of aromatic hydrocarbons of 73.2 % and a yield of specific aromatic hydrocarbons as high as 56.5 mg/g-biomass (d.a.f), which were much higher than those based on the parent HZSM-5 (55.0 % and 26.0 mg/g-biomass (d.a.f)). It should be mainly attributed to its suitable acidity and best textural properties for the deoxygenation of the bio-oil thanks to the optimum Cu loading amount. In addition, the 0.5 wt.% Cu loaded HZSM-5 catalyst also showed excellent catalytic reusability and regeneration property, and the spent catalyst was easily recovered by a simple calcination in air for a short time.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"
A critical review on second- and third-generation bioethanol production using microwaved-assisted heating (MAH) pretreatment,"Ocreto J.B., Chen W.-H., Ubando A.T., Park Y.-K., Sharma A.K., Ashokkumar V., Ok Y.S., Kwon E.E., Rollon A.P., De Luna M.D.G.",2021-12-01,"Bio-ethanol production, Bio-ethanols, Conventional heating, Critical review, Microwave assisted heating, Pre-treatments, Second generation, Sustainable development goal, Third generation, Torrefaction, Algae, Bioethanol, Lignocelluloses, Microwave-assisted heating, Sustainable development goal, Torrefaction","In the pursuit of the 7th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations, it is driven to develop affordable, sustainable, and clean energy. Second (lignocellulosic) and third (microalgae and macroalgae) generation bioethanol appear to be the most favorable renewable feedstocks to meet SDG 7 pursuance. However, several feedstock pretreatments have shown process challenges in terms of yield and product inhibitors. Microwave-assisted heating (MAH) has gained positive attention as a novel alternative method for pretreatment heating in the global community due to its numerous advantages over conventional heating. Therefore, current studies and progress in MAH pretreatment for bioethanol production are critically reviewed. The effects of different parameters on MAH pretreatment are also examined. The application of MAH pretreatment demonstrates rapid reaction exhibiting remarkable improvement in sugar recovery and fewer inhibitors over conventional heating. Despite these advanced results, certain obstacles remain to be addressed and improved until it is ready for industrial scalability. It includes understanding the interaction and relationship between the different parameters like biomass loading, catalysts, temperature, power intensity, contact time, and pressure for reactor design. Moreover, factors such as the non-thermal effect, dielectric properties of different biomass materials, and controlled temperature need to be further explored and evaluated. Thus, continuous research and development efforts on MAH pretreatment are encouraged to become commercially feasible for the applications of bioethanol production.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

In dental aspect, reconstruction of the resorbed alveolar bone after tooth extraction plays an important role in the success of dental substitution, especially in dental implant treatment. The hydroxyapatite (HA)-incorporated fibroin-alginate composite injectable hydrogel was fabricated to be used as scaffold for bone regeneration. HA was synthesized from eggshell biowaste. Fibroin was extracted from Bombyx mori cocoon. The synthesized HA, fibroin and alginate hydrogel were characterized. HA-incorporated fibroin-alginate hydrogel had decreased pore size and porosity compared with pure alginate hydrogel. Thermal analysis showed that hydrogel had a degradation peak of approximately 250 °C. Hydrogel could absorb water, with a swelling ratio of around 300% at 24 h. Hydrogel was degraded as time passed and almost completely degraded at day 7. Its compressive Young's modulus was approximately 0.04 ± 0.02 N/mm2 to 0.10 ± 0.02 N/mm2. Primary cytotoxicity test indicated non-toxic potential of the fabricated hydrogel. Increased ALP activity was observed in MC3T3-E1 cultured in HA-incorporated fibroin-alginate hydrogel. Results suggested the potential use of injectable HA fibroin-alginate hydrogel as dental scaffolding material.

High cost and low environmentally stable organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) are the main hurdles in their commercial realization. Perovskite community is actively looking for inorganic HTMs which will potentially yield into a pragmatic solution. Cu-based materials, e.g. Cu-based oxides, halides, and chalcogenides exhibit features like low production cost, suitable band alignment, and high hole mobility Due to these properties, Cu-based materials are being explored as potential HTMs in PSCs. Significant efforts are contributed toward using low-cost Cu-based materials because of high chemical stability, high carrier mobility, low-cost and the possibility of developing a very simple technique. The photo-physical properties, e.g. optical electronic structure, valence band engineering, and carrier mobility are briefly discussed. Detailed insights toward understanding the development of Cu-based HTMs along with their possible pragmatic commercialization aspects are presented.

The standard compounds were desorbed from the thin-layer chromatography plate and extracted at 80°C for 15 min showing good linearity of the calibration curves (R2> 0.98) and acceptable recovery range (65–81%). The plate after the separation was cut into four smaller parts followed by solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography—mass spectrometry analysis, which revealed different compound profile in each part with the correlation between log P of the standard compounds and their positions along the thin-layer chromatography plate (R2= 0.65). This approach was applied to analyze perfume compounds in the sample with strong matrix interference from the synthetic agarwood. Terpene hydrocarbons (woody-based odors), ketones/esters, aldehydes, ethers, and alcohols were mostly observed at 8 ± 1, 6 ± 1, 5 ± 2, 4 ± 2, and 3 ± 2 cm, respectively, from the bottom of the thin-layer chromatography plate. While, the conventional solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography—mass spectrometry analysis of this sample solution revealed only 62 compounds (including 35 perfume compounds), the four-piece approach resulted in 109 compounds (62 perfume compounds).

The proposed method employed the ant colony optimisation (ACO) approach to assist in hyperparameter selection for the adaptive-weighted projection-controlled steepest descent (AwPCSD) algorithm, which is a totalvariation (TV) based regularisation algorithm. During the implementation, there was a colony of artificial ants that swarm through the AwPCSD algorithm. Each ant chose a set of hyperparameters required for its iterative CT reconstruction and the correlation coefficient (CC) score was given for reconstructed images compared to the reference image. A colony of ants in one generation left a pheromone through its chosen path representing a choice of hyperparameters. Higher score means stronger pheromones/probabilities to attract more ants in the next generations. At the end of the implementation, the hyperparameter configuration with the highest score was chosen as an optimal set of hyperparameters. In the experimental results section, the reconstruction using hyperparameters from the proposed method was compared with results from three other cases: the conjugate gradient least square (CGLS), the AwPCSD algorithm using the set of arbitrary hyperparameters and the crossvalidation method.The experiments showed that the results from the proposed method were superior to those of the CGLS algorithm and the AwPCSD algorithm using the set of arbitrary hyperparameters. Although the results of the ACO algorithm were slightly inferior to those of the cross-validation method as measured by the quantitative metrics, the ACO algorithm was over 10 times faster than cross-Validation. The optimal set of hyperparameters from the proposed method was also robust against an increase of noise in the data and can be applicable to different imaging samples with similar context. The ACO approach in the proposed method was able to identify optimal values of hyperparameters for a dataset and, as a result, produced a good quality reconstructed image from limited number of projection data. The proposed method in this work successfully solves a problem of hyperparameters selection, which is a major challenge in an implementation of TV based reconstruction algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this study, we compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of LA on large (≥ 6 cm) and (< 6 cm) adrenal tumors. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all clinical data of patients who underwent unilateral transperitoneal LA in our institution between April 2000 and June 2019. Patients were classified by tumor size into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 had tumor size < 6 cm (n = 408) and patient in group 2 had tumor size ≥ 6 cm (n = 48). Demographic data, perioperative outcomes, complications, and pathologic reports were compared between groups. Results: Patients in group 2 were significant older (p = 0.04), thinner (p = 0.001) and had lower incident of hypertension (p = 0.001), with a significantly higher median operative time (75 vs 120 min), estimated blood loss (20 vs 100 ml), transfusion rate (0 vs 20.8%), conversion rate (0.25 vs 14.6%) and length of postoperative stays (4 vs 5.5 days) than in group 2 (all p < 0.001). Group 2 patients also had significantly higher frequency of intraoperative complication (4.7 vs 31.3%; adjust Odds Ratio [OR] = 9.67 (95% CI 4.22–22.17), p-value < 0.001) and postoperative complication (5.4 vs 31.3%; adjust OR = 5.67 (95% CI 2.48–12.97), p-value < 0.001). Only eight (1.8%) major complications occurred in this study. The most common pathology in group 2 patient was pheochromocytoma and metastasis. Conclusions: Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy in large adrenal tumor ≥ 6 cm is feasible but associated with significantly worse intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and recovery. However, most of the complications were minor and could be managed conservatively. Careful patient selection with the expert surgeon in adrenal surgery is the key factor for successful laparoscopic surgery in a large adrenal tumor.

However, the extraction processes of sericin from silkworm cocoons can alter the biological and biophysical properties, including a structural diversity of natural sericin. In addition, extracted natural sericin is often contaminated with fibroin that may be harmful to human cells. Induction of tolerogenic dendritic cell (DC) has become a strategy in biomaterial fields because this cell type plays a key role in immune modulation and wound healing. To overcome undesired effects of extracted natural sericin and to improve its biological properties, we biosynthesized sericin 1-like protein that contained only functional motifs and tested its biological activity and immunomodulatory properties in fibroblasts and DCs, respectively. In comparison to natural sericin, biosynthetic sericin 1 promoted collagen production in fibroblasts at a late time point. Furthermore, DCs treated with biosynthetic sericin 1 exhibited a tolerogenic-like phenotype with semimaturation and low production of proinflammatory cytokines, but high production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Biosynthetic sericin 1 might be developed as immunomodulator or immunosuppressant.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, engineering, Immunology, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Molecular Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Drug Discovery, Process Chemistry and Technology"

This sequence is infrequently interrupted by a different stimulus called the deviant or target stimulus. Potentially the oddball paradigm can be employed in an EEG-based speech discrimination assessment protocol. Speech discrimination indicates how well a person can differentiate between different words. Analyzing EEG measurements such as the Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) may help to achieve the goal of automated assessment process. In this work we compare two listening modes in an oddball paradigm in order to find a suitable mode for assessing speech discrimination automatically. The two listening modes include passive and active listening. Passive listening is when the listener does not pay attention to what they hear. Active listening is when the listener actively pays attention to the sound. We tested these two listening modes using two Thai words with consonant contrast. We compared the ERP waveform, classification accuracy, and attention during passive and active listening. We found that passive listening produced clearer ERP waveform. However, active listening achieved higher accuracy and engaged less attention. Therefore, we recommend using active listening for an auditory oddball paradigm when assessing speech discrimination.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems and Management, Biomedical Engineering, Media Technology"

Here, we investigated the microplastic's effects on floc characteristics, microbial community compositions, and fouling behavior inside sequencing-batch MBRs. MBRs were operated with 0, 7, 15, and 75 MPs/L of feed for 124-days. Results indicated that MP presence decreased sludge floc size, floc hydrophobicity, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) molecular size, and increased EPS concentration and the floc's negative zeta potential. These results were attributed to the facilitation of divalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) uptake by MPs that weakened ion-bridging interactions within the sludge flocs. MPs accumulation slightly affected microbial structure and diversity. Relative abundances of dominant phyla, Actinobacteria, also decreased substantially. MPs also acted like a scouring material on membrane surfaces, inducing transformation of matured biofilm structures where protein content was substantially lower than nucleic acid content, in contrast to the control. Overall, MPs’ negative effects on sludge flocs were counteracted by their scouring effect; consequently, SB-MBRs operated up to 4 months did not suffer from severe cake fouling, compared to control.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random-effects, generic inverse variance method of der Simonian and Laird. The primary outcomes included total cumulative complications and immediate complications following AF ablation. Results: Ten observational studies were met our inclusion criteria, comprising of total population of 11,660 patients, with SDD 51.3%.

Tissue engineering in conjunction with biomaterials holds promise for generating cartilage substitutes that withstand stress in joints. A major challenge of tissue substitution is creating a functional framework to support cartilage tissue formation. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA), by varying the mole ratios of GA/PVA in the presence of different amounts of plant-derived carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Porous scaffolds were created by the freeze-drying technique. The goal of this study was to investigate how CMC incorporation and crosslinking density might affect scaffold pore formation, swelling behaviors, mechanical properties, and potential use for engineered cartilage. The peak at 1599 cm−1 of the C=O group in ATR–FTIR indicates the incorporation of CMC into the scaffold. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and Young’s modulus were lower in the PVA/CMC scaffold, as compared to the PVA control scaffold.

Whether this also happens in species with tracheid xylem anatomy and lower sap flow rates, such as conifers, is currently unclear. We infused 13C-labelled solution into the xylem near the base of two 90-year-old Pinus sylvestris L. trees. A custom-built gas exchange system and an online isotopic analyser were used to sample the CO2 efflux and its isotopic composition continuously from four positions along the bole and one upper canopy shoot in each tree. Phloem and needle tissue 13C enrichment was also evaluated at these positions. Most of the 13C label was lost by diffusion within a few metres of the infusion point indicating rapid CO2 loss during vertical xylem transport. No 13C enrichment was detected in the upper bole needle tissues. Furthermore, mass balance calculations showed that c. 97% of the locally respired CO2 diffused radially to the atmosphere. Our results support the notion that xylem CO2 transport is of limited magnitude in conifers. This implies that the concerns that stem transport of CO2 derived from root respiration biases chamber-based estimates of forest carbon cycling may be unwarranted for mature conifer stands.","plant science; water and nutrients; water relations and gas exchange, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science"

Since mismanaged plastic waste can enter the ocean via inland waterways, microplastic contamination in freshwater used for tap water production has been raised as a potential issue. This study was conducted to determine the abundance and characteristics of microplastics in freshwater and treated tap water in Bangkok. Freshwater and treated water were collected from the eastern and western water supply systems in the dry and wet seasons. The source waters of the eastern and western water supply systems are the Chao Phraya River and Maeklong River, respectively. Approximately 0.40–2.40 particles/L microplastics was determined in the freshwater samples. No significant differences in microplastic abundance with respect to water supply system or season were found. Approximately 82.1% of the total microplastics found in the freshwater were smaller than 300 µm in size. The percentage contribution of various microplastic size ranges decreased with increasing size. The majority of microplastics found in freshwater were fragments (90.2%), colorless (64.3%), and made of polyethylene polymer (45.1%). Only the eastern water supply system was capable of removing microplastic particles (27.7%) from freshwater. The identification of microplastics larger than 100 µm in size in the treated tap water indicated potential contamination from microplastics in the treatment system, particularly after the sand filtration unit. The major characteristics of the microplastics found in treated tap water were similar to those found in freshwater, with 85.6% fragments, 85.1% colorless, and 47.9% made of polyethylene polymer.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, environmental","Environmental Science (all), Pollution, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Their pharmacological and physicochemical properties have been improved via the cyclodextrin (CD) encapsulation. Because the characteristics of β‐CD inclusion complexes with PCAL (1) and PCAC (2) are still equivocal, we get to the bottom of the inclusion complexation by an integrated study of single‐crystal X‐ ray diffraction and DFT full‐geometry optimization. X‐ray analysis unveiled that PCAL and PCAC are nearly totally shielded in the β‐CD wall. Their aromatic rings are vertically aligned in the β‐CD cavity such that the functional groups on the opposite side of the ring (3,4‐di(OH) and 1‐CHO/1‐ COOH groups) are placed nearby the O6–H and O2–H/O3–H rims, respectively. The preferred inclusion modes in 1 and 2 help to establish crystal contacts of OH…O H‐bonds with the adjacent β‐ CD OH groups and water molecules. By contrast, the DFT‐optimized structures of both complexes in the gas phase are thermodynamically stable via the four newly formed host–guest OH⋯O H‐ bonds. The intermolecular OH…O H‐bonds between PCAL/PCAC 3,4‐di(OH) and β‐CD O6–H groups, and the shielding of OH groups in the β‐CD wall help to stabilize these antioxidants in the β‐CD cavity, as observed in our earlier studies. Moreover, PCAL and PCAC in distinct lattice environments are compared for insights into their structural flexibility.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

In this paper, the Land Use Regression (LUR) technique was used to model the relationship between the daily PM2.5 concentration and various predictor variables using data from the entire year of 2019. The results confirmed strong seasonal effects on PM2.5 and substantial effects of time-variant predictors, including open biomass burning and meteorological conditions. However, time-invariant variables, including traffic, transportation, and land use characteristics were generally weaker predictors in the LUR models. The results of the model based on data for the entire year showed better statistical fit and robustness than the seasonal models. The relatively low adjusted R2 of the models developed in this study compared with previous LUR studies suggests that more detailed data, especially the traffic volume on roads nearby monitoring sites, might be necessary to improve the model's performance. Finally, the large buffer size of the open biomass burning predictor implied that the measures to reduce PM2.5 by limiting open biomass burning would require international cooperation as some fires within the buffer area occurred in neighboring countries outside the borders of Thailand.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Atmospheric Science"

This study aimed to develop a hearing-impaired version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (HI-ACE-III) and to assess whether the HI-ACE-III can accurately distinguish people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia from cognitively intact controls. Methods: The HI-ACE-III was developed by converting verbal instructions into a visual, timed PowerPoint presentation. Seventy-four participants over the age of 60 years were classified into three groups: 29 had MCI, 15 had mild to moderate dementia and 30 were cognitively intact controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were graphed to test screening accuracy. Concurrent validity was examined through correlations between HI-ACE-III domain scores and relevant, visually presented standardized neuropsychological measures. Results: ROC analysis for dementia revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, achieving excellent sensitivity (100%) and good specificity (93.3%) at an optimum cut-off of <87. The AUC for MCI was 0.86, achieving reasonable sensitivity (75.9%) and good specificity (86.7%) at an optimum cut-off of <92. HI-ACE-III subtests shared anticipated and statistically significant correlations with established measures of cognitive functioning. Internal consistency of the HI-ACE-III was excellent as verified with Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.904). Conclusions: Preliminarily, the HI-ACE-III showed good reliability, validity and screening utility for MCI and dementia in older adults in a hearing-impairment context. The adapted HI-ACE-III may offer accurate and reliable indication of cognitive performance, supporting timely diagnosis and research examining links between hearing loss and cognitive decline.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Due to the instability of this ubiquitous signal molecule in vivo and in vitro, its rapid and direct detection is necessary to obtain meaningful results. Therefore, the development of a method for the rapid electrochemical detection of nitric oxide at 0.72 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) using a carbon paste electrode, modified by drop casting, is presented. As modifying solution, a nanocomposite consisting of Nafion, graphene nanoribbons, and gold nanoparticles was prepared. The voltammetric investigations with the optimized sensor were performed at room temperature in phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4) as supporting electrolyte. Based on differential pulse voltammetry measurements, the obtained results for the analytical signal showed good linear response in the range of 0.39–2.34 μM and 2.34–104.7 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9941 and 0.9984, respectively. For both linear ranges, the repeatability as well as the reproducibility was <5% and <10%, respectively. A concentration of 40 nM was determined for the detection limit, whereas the limit of quantification was 130 nM. In addition, the influence of physiological interferences was also investigated and resulted in negligible effects. Finally, the sensor was successfully used to measure the NO release of NO donors. Based on the results obtained, the new sensor provides a simple and fast method for a direct voltammetric determination of low nitric oxide concentrations in solutions.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Despite previous information from computed tomographic (CT) images of intra-thoracic lymph nodes, some factors from animals and CT setting were less elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of internal factors from animals and external factors from the CT procedure on the feasibility to detect the intra-thoracic lymph nodes. Twenty-four, client-owned, clinically healthy cats were categorized into three groups according to age. They underwent pre- and post-contrast enhanced CT for whole thorax followed by inter-group evaluation and comparison of sternal, cranial mediastinal, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Results: Post contrast-enhanced CT appearances revealed that intra-thoracic lymph nodes of kittens were invisible, whereas the sternal, cranial mediastinal, and tracheobronchial nodes of cats aged over 7 months old were detected (6/24, 9/24 and 7/24, respectively). Maximum width of these lymph nodes were 3.93 ± 0.74 mm, 4.02 ± 0.65 mm, and 3.51 ± 0.62 mm, respectively. By age, lymph node sizes of these cats were not significantly different. Transverse lymph node width of males was larger than that of females (P = 0.0425). Besides, the detection score of lymph nodes was affected by slice thickness (P < 0.01) and lymph node width (P = 0.0049). Furthermore, an irregular, soft tissue structure, possibly the thymus, was detected in all juvenile cats and three mature cats. Conclusions: Despite additional information on intra-thoracic lymph nodes in CT images, which can be used to investigate lymphatic-related abnormalities, age, sex, and slice thickness of CT images must be also considered.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

However, given that fistula tracts may already be present at the initial presentation, primary closure of the tract as secondary prevention of fistula formation, using ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract, may be useful. Objective: This study aims to examine the feasibility and outcomes of performing intersphincteric exploration with ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract or attempted closure of internal opening for acute anorectal abscesses. Design: This is a retrospective study of patients with acute anorectal cryptoglandular abscesses who underwent surgery between January 2014 and December 2016. SETTINGS: The patients were treated at a tertiary referral center in Thailand. Patients: Eighty-six patients with acute anorectal abscesses without previous surgery were included. INTERVENTIONS: Intersphincteric dissection was performed. Further surgical intervention was dependent on the intersphincteric findings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was the 90-day healed rate. Results: Of the 86 patients, 3 had low intersphincteric abscesses, 26 had low transsphincteric abscesses, 25 had anterior high transsphincteric abscesses, 27 had posterior high transsphincteric abscesses, and 5 had high intersphincteric abscesses. Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract was successfully performed in 66 patients with an identifiable intersphincteric tract. Intersphincteric exploration with attempted closure of the internal opening was performed in the remaining 20 patients. The success rates were 86% and 70%. Unidentified internal opening and intersphincteric pathology were risk factors for nonhealing. No patients reported fecal incontinence postoperatively. Limitations: The limitation of this study is its retrospective nature and that all operations were performed by a single surgeon; therefore, the results may vary according to the individual surgeon's expertise. Conclusions: Fistula tract formation was found in most cases of acute anorectal abscesses. Definitive surgery using this strategy provides promising results.",medical,Gastroenterology

Weedy rice, particularly paddy seed, is difficult to handle and separate because it has characteristics (morphological likeness) similar to those cultivated rice. This report describes a modification of self-organizing maps (SOMs) for categorizing weedy rice from cultivated rice using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) on paddy seed in situ. The sample pretreatment was performed using a cyclone vacuum machine to remove the contaminated particles and other impurities. Optical microscope and thermogravimetric analysis were employed to evaluate the physical properties and thermal behavior of rice sample, respectively. For direct sample analysis, a near-infrared spectroscopy with a reflectance attachment was used. To show the relevant NIR regions, the obtained NIR spectra were smoothed using the Savitzky–Golay polynomial, baseline-aligned using the standard normal variate, and mean-centered; in addition, the second derivative was determined. SOMs were well-optimized and applied for the classification of weedy samples from four cultivated rice. To generate a robust prediction, the predictive modeling was generated from 100 different training and test set split.

Historical and observed river flow and sediment data measured during 1929–2019 were used to assess the variation in total sediment load along the Wang River and evaluate the effects of three major dam constructions on sediment supplied from the Wang River to the CPR. Results indicated that sediment loads increased toward downstream. Variation in long-term total sediment load (TSL) along the river suggested that construction of the Kiew Lom Dam in 1972 did not cause a reduction in sediment yield in the Wang River Basin because it impounded less than 20% of the average annual runoff, while the Mae Chang and Kiew Koh Ma Dams caused downstream sediment reduction. These three dams are located in the upper and middle river basins, and their effects on sediment load in the Wang River are ameliorated by additional sediment supplied from the lower basin. Results confirmed that construction of these three major dams in the Wang River did not greatly impact sediment supply from the Wang River to the CPR system. The dam site and sediment load variation along the river are the primary factors controlling the impact of the dam construction.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

All surfactants were chosen based on having the similar number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain. So the effects of the different head group and the existence of a polypropylene oxide in the ALF's structure on the surface activity and motor oil removal could be elaborated. The results demonstrated that CTAB, having strongest positively charged head group with the shortest tail length, provided the highest diffusivity, foamability, and foam stability, leading to the highest enrichment ratios of motor oil and surfactant. Conversely, ALF, having the largest molecular size and the longest tail length, gave the lowest diffusivity and foam properties. Hence, it exhibited the highest motor oil removal and surfactant recovery with the lowest enrichment ratios of both motor oil and ALF. The added packing media with 50% packing volume augmented the residence time of the rising air bubbles, enhancing the motor oil removal by about 16%, 15%, and 24% for the ALF, MES, and CTAB, respectively.","physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Therefore, the VRFB performance highly depends on the characteristics of the graphite felts. Although atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) have been applied for surface modification of graphite felt electrode in VRFBs for the enhancement of electrochemical reactivity, the influence of APPJ plasma reactivity and working temperature (by changing the flow rate) on the VRFB performance is still unknown. In this work, the performance of the graphite felts with different APPJ plasma reactivity and working temperatures, changed by varying the flow rates (the conditions are denoted as APPJ temperatures hereafter), was analyzed and compared with those treated with sulfuric acid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the APPJ treatment led to an increase in O-/N-containing functional groups on the GF surface to ~21.0% as compared to ~15.0% for untreated GF and 18.0% for H2SO4-treated GF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the surface morphology of graphite felt electrodes was still smooth, and no visible changes were detected after oxidation in the sulfuric acid or after APPJ treatment. The polarization measurements indicated that the APPJ treatment increased the limiting current densities from 0.56 A·cm−2 for the GFs treated by H2SO4 to 0.64, 0.68, and 0.64 A·cm−2, respectively, for the GFs APPJ-treated at 450, 550, and 650◦C, as well as reduced the activation overpotential when compared with the H2SO4-treated electrode.

The aim of this paper is to review how to construct a nomothetic model of ME/CFS using Partial Least Squares (PLS) path analysis and ensembling causome (bacterial trans-location as assessed with IgM/IgA responses to LPS), protectome (lowered coenzyme Q10), adverse outcome pathways (AOP) including increased lysozyme, CD38+ T cell activation, cell-medi-ated immune activation (CMI), and IgM responses to oxidative specific epitopes and NO-adducts (IgM OSENO).Using PLS, we trained, tested and validated this knowledge-and data-driven causal ME/CFS model, which showed adequate convergence, construct and replicability validity.This bot-tom-up explicit data model of ME/CFS objectivates the descriptive narratives of the ME/CFS phenome, using causome-protectome-AOP data, whereby the abstract concept ME/CFS is translat-ed into pathways, thereby securing the reification of the ME/CFS phenome. We found that 31.6% of the variance in the physiosomatic symptom dimension of ME/CFS was explained by the cumula-tive effects of CMI and CD38+ activation, IgM OSENO, IgA LPS, lysozyme (all positive) and coenzyme Q10 (inversely). Cluster analysis performed on the PLS-generated latent vector scores of all feature sets exposed three distinct immune groups of ME/CFS, namely one with increased ly-sozyme, one with increased CMI + CD38 activation + depressive symptoms, and another with increased bacterial translocation + autoimmune responses to OSENO.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery
Paper-based competitive immunochromatography coupled with an enzyme-modified electrode to enable the wireless monitoring and electrochemical sensing of cotinine in urine,"Larpant N., Kalambate P.K., Ruzgas T., Laiwattanapaisal W.",2021-03-01,"Electrochemical measurements, Electrochemical sensing, Enzyme modified electrodes, Immunochromatography, Modified electrodes, The near field communication (NFC), Wireless detection, Wireless monitoring, Biosensing Techniques, Chromatography, Affinity, Cotinine, Electrodes, Hydrogen Peroxide, Cotinine, Immunochromatography, Nanomaterials, Wireless biosensor","This paper proposes a combined strategy of using paper-based competitive immunochro-matography and a near field communication (NFC) tag for wireless cotinine determination. The glucose oxidase labeled cotinine antibody specifically binds free cotinine in a sample, whereas the unoccupied antibody attached to BSA-cotinine at the test line on a lateral flow strip. The glucose oxidase on the strip and an assistant pad in the presence of glucose generated H2 O2 and imposed the Ag oxidation on the modified electrode. This enabled monitoring of immunoreaction by either electrochemical measurement or wireless detection. Wireless sensing was realized for cotinine in the range of 100–1000 ng/mL (R2 = 0.96) in PBS medium. Undiluted urine samples from non-smokers exhibited an Ag-oxidation rate three times higher than the smoker’s urine samples. For 1:8 diluted urine samples (smokers), the proposed paper-based competitive immunochromatography coupled with an enzyme-modified electrode differentiated positive and negative samples and exhibited cotinine discrimination at levels higher than 12 ng/mL. This novel sensing platform can potentially be combined with a smartphone as a reader unit.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The microstructures of Ti-based materials processed via selective laser melting (SLM) have also been observed to contain a martensitic phase that improves the tensile strength. However, this improvement is achieved at the cost of reduced ductility. This study considered the use of post-heat treatment N dissolution to enhance the ductility of SLM-processed α-Ti materials. Tensile testing of the as-fabricated SLM Ti-(N) revealed a significantly increased strength of ~1200 MPa and a low ductility of 5% for N content of 0.5 wt%. However, the quenched samples exhibited increased ductility by up to 20%, with the microstructure, including primary α (αp) and transformed β structures. Further examination via electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in-situ high-temperature SEM observation and in-situ EBSD observation during tensile testing revealed that the enhancement in ductility of the quenched SLM-processed Ti-(N) samples was significantly due to alteration of the grain morphology, dislocations and N distribution. The findings of this study further clarify the microstructural evolution and deformation response of SLM-processed Ti-(N) materials under water quenching.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The World Health Organisation (WHO) releases guidelines to help the countries to reduce the spread of this virus to the public, like wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, shutting down all types of public transports, etc. These conditions led to a worldwide economic fall drastically, and on the other hand, indirect environmental benefits like global air quality improvement and decreased water pollution are also pictured. Currently, use of face masks is part of a comprehensive package of the prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of COVID-19 since there is no clinically proven drugs or vaccine available for COVID-19. Mostly, face masks are made of petroleum-based non-renewable polymers that are non-biodegradable, hazardous to the environment and create health issues. This study demonstrates the extensive use of the face mask and how it affects human health and the marine ecosystem. It has become a great challenge for the government sectors to impose strict regulations for the proper disposal of the masks as medical waste by the public. Neglecting the seriousness of this issue may lead to the release of large tonnes of micro-plastics to the landfill as well as to the marine environment where mostly end-up and thereby affecting their fauna and flora population vastly.

Melatonin and its derivative disrupt cancer stem-like phenotypes of lung cancer cells via AKT downregulation,"Phiboonchaiyanan P.P., Puthongking P., Chawjarean V., Harikarnpakdee S., Sukprasansap M., Chanvorachote P., Priprem A., Govitrapong P.",2021-12-01,"Unknown, acetyl melatonin, AKT, cancer stem cells, lung cancer, melatonin","Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of tumour cells, have properties of self-renewal and multipotency, which drive cancer progression and resistance to current treatments. Compounds potentially targeting CSCs have been recently developed. This study shows how melatonin, an endogenous hormone synthesised by the pineal gland, and its derivative suppress CSC-like phenotypes of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, H460, H23, and A549. The effects of MLT and its derivative, acetyl melatonin (ACT), on CSC-like phenotypes were investigated using assays for anchorage-independent growth, three-dimensional spheroid formation, scratch wound healing ability, and CSC marker and upstream protein signalling expression. Enriched CSC spheroids were used to confirm the effect of both compounds on lung cancer cells. MLT and ACT inhibited CSC-like behaviours by suppression of colony and spheroid formation in NSCLC cell lines. Their effects on spheroid formation were confirmed in CSC-enriched H460 cells. CSC markers, CD133 and ALDH1A1, were depleted by both compounds. The behaviour and factors associated to epithelial–mesenchymal transition, as indicated by cell migration and the protein vimentin, were also decreased by MLT and ACT. Mechanistically, MLT and ACT decreased the expression of stemness proteins Oct-4, Nanog, and β-catenin by reducing active AKT (phosphorylated AKT). Suppression of the AKT pathway was not mediated through melatonin receptors. This study demonstrates a novel role, and its underlying mechanism, for MLT and its derivative ACT in suppression of CSC-like phenotypes in NSCLC cells, indicating that they are potential candidates for lung cancer treatment.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Physiology, Pharmacology, Physiology (medical)"

Methods: All necessary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters from critically ill patients were obtained to develop mathematical models with first order elimination. Levofloxacin concentration-time profiles were calculated to determine the efficacy based on the probability of target attainment (PTA) of AUC24h/MIC ≥50 for Gram-positive and AUC24h/MIC ≥125 for Gram-negative infections. A group of 5000 virtual patients was simulated and tested using Monte Carlo simulations for each dose in the models. The optimal dosing regimens were defined as the dose achieved target PTA at least 90% of the virtual patients. Results: No conventional, FDA approved regimens achieved at least 90% of PTA for Gram-negative infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at MIC of 2 mg/L. The successful dose (1750 mg on day 1, then 1500 mg q 24 h) was far exceeded the maximum FDA-approved doses. For Gram-positive infections, a levofloxacin 750 mg q 24 h was sufficient to attain PTA target of ~90% at the MIC of 2 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Conclusions: Levofloxacin cannot be recommended as an empiric monotherapy for serious Gram-negative infections in patients receiving CRRT due to suboptimal efficacy.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, plain radiographs and three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) performed 12 months after MIS-TLIF were evaluated, and the risk of cage subsidence was calculated with odds ratio (OR), confidence interval (CI), and logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 114 patients (mean age, 65 years) and 135 levels were included in this study: 80 (59.3%) with and 55 (40.7%) without cage subsidence. Multifidus atrophy showed the strongest association with PEEK cage subsidence (p < 0.001). Compared to those with normal mass, the odds of PEEK cage subsidence were 76.0 (95% CI: 3.9–1472.9) for severe atrophy. The factors significantly associated with cage subsistence were posterior cage position (OR = 4.2; p = 0.005), cage height ≥ 12 mm (OR = 7.6; p = 0.008), use of an autograft mixed with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) (OR = 5.8; p = 0.002), body mass index (BMI) > 27.5 kg/m2 (OR = 4.2; p = 0.03), and titanium-coated PEEK (Ti-PEEK) cage-type (OR = 38.4, p = 0.02).

While the impact of these inland terminal on the efficiency of multimodal transportation has recently become more evident, it is relatively challenging to evaluate dry port's performance, as it typically involves with many operations performed by different gate operators with different numbers of container handling equipment (CHE). To properly evaluate dry port's performance, in this paper, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is proposed and implemented in SIMIO modeling platform based on the current data of Ladkrabang Inland Container Depot (LICD), Thailand. According to our results, we have found that, currently, all CHE types at the LICD are not well utilized, especially the internal trucks, as the frequency of trains arriving at the LICD is still far too few. We also find that the utilization of CHE does not significant change as we vary the proportion of cargo transported by trains to trucks from 30:70 to 50:50, while maintaining total container flow. As such, we suggest that gate operators should form a CHE sharing agreement in order to improve CHE efficiency, and so the LICD's, which would be crucial for their survivability, especially after the post pandemic.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics, sociology","Decision Sciences (miscellaneous), Automotive Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization, Transportation"

Methods: Mutations were detected by whole exome and Sanger sequencing. The permanent second molar obtained from the proband (DGI1) and the primary first molar from his affected son (DGI2) were studied for their color, roughness, mineral density, hardness, elastic modulus, mineral content, and ultrastructure, compared to the controls. Results: Two novel missense COL1A2 variants, c.752C > T (p.Ser251Phe) and c.758G > T (p.Gly253Val), were identified in both patients. The c.758G > T was predicted to be the causative mutation. Pulp cavities of DGI1 (permanent teeth) were obliterated while those of DGI2 (primary teeth) were wide. The patients’ teeth had darker and redder colors; reduced dentin hardness; decreased, disorganized, and scattered dentinal tubules and collagen fibers; and irregular dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), compared to controls. Lacunae-like structures were present in DGI2. Conclusions: We reported the novel causative mutation, c.758G > T (p.Gly253Val), in COL1A2 for OI type IV and DGI.

We aim to develop a solar power forecasting model suitable for a tropical climate, using Thailand as a model, and hence present a linear recursive regression model as a post-processing step for reducing the errors obtained from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. This model consists of submodels, each of which predicts the solar irradiance of a particular time of the day. By using a stepwise regression method, we found that WRF forecasts of irradiance, temperature, relative humidity, and the solar zenith angle were selected as highly relevant inputs of the model. The regression model coefficients are updated according to a Kalman filtering (KF) scheme so that the model can flexibly adapt to fluctuations in the solar irradiance. We then modify the KF update formula to accommodate the limitation in measurement availability at the time of executing the forecasts. The proposed KF formula can be generalized to find the optimal prediction given that the available measurements are mapped by an affine transformation. The obtained results using actual data from a solar rooftop system located in the central region of Thailand showed that the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of solar power prediction was about 12-13%, which was decreased from the NRMSE of the WRF model by 7-12% on average. This improvement was the best out of similar post-processing methods based on the model output statistics framework.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The analysis of the aioA gene showed that arsenite-oxidizing bacteria retrieved from groundwater, surface water, and soil were associated with Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. In groundwaters from the mining area, there were relatively high ratios of aioA/total 16S rRNA gene copies and the dominance of As5+, which suggested the presence and activity of arsenite-oxidizing bacteria. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the majority of the soil and surface water microbiomes were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi, whereas the groundwater microbiomes were dominated exclusively by Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Geochemical factors influencing the microbial structure in the groundwater were As, residence time, and groundwater flowrate, while those showing a positive correlation to the microbial structure in the surface water were TOC, ORP, and DO.

Effect of the metal nanoparticle (NP) type (M = Ni, Au, Pt or Pd) and, for Pd, the amount (1 %–4 %) decorated on the surface of thermal treated commercial TiO2 (T400) was evaluated. The obtained results demonstrated that both the type and amount of decorated metal NPs did not significantly affect the pollutant reduction, measured in terms of the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and oil & grease levels, but they affected the H2 production rate from both deionized water and biodiesel wastewater, which can be ranked in the order of Pt1/T400 > Pd1/T400 > Au1/T400 > Ni1/T400. This was attributed to the high difference in work function between Pt and the parent T400. However, the difference between Pt1/T400 and Pd1/T400 was not great and so from an economic consideration, Pd/TiO2 was selected as appropriate for further evaluation. Among the four different Pdx/TiO2 photocatalysts, the Pd3/TiO2 demonstrated the highest activity and gave a high rate of H2 production (up to 135 mmol·h−1) with a COD, BOD and oil & grease reduction of 30.3%, 73.7% and 58.0%, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, biochemistryistry, chemistry, coastal engineering","Environmental Engineering, Biochemistry, Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The responses of the walls were studied through the wall horizontal displacement profile, tensile strains along with wall depth on the retained side, the distribution of strains using photogrammetric analysis and observation of crack initiation at the wall. The experimental results indicate that the behaviours of DCM walls depend strongly on the wall dimensions, particularly the thickness, and the analysis concepts used for conventional retaining walls cannot be directly utilized. The wall-to-excavation shape factor has been proven to effectively distinguish the behaviour mode and characterize the crack location concerning the wall height.","mixing and separation, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering"
Comprehensive genome-wide analysis of calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) in Durio zibethinus and identification of fruit ripening-associated DzCAMTAs,"Iqbal Z., Iqbal M.S., Sangpong L., Khaksar G., Sirikantaramas S., Buaboocha T.",2021-12-01,"Bombacaceae, Calmodulin, Ethylenes, Fruit, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Transcription Factors, Auxin, CAMTA, Durian, Ethylene, Fruit ripening, Transcriptional regulation","Background: Fruit ripening is an intricate developmental process driven by a highly coordinated action of complex hormonal networks. Ethylene is considered as the main phytohormone that regulates the ripening of climacteric fruits. Concomitantly, several ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal components of the regulatory network underlying fruit ripening. Calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) is one such ethylene-induced TF implicated in various stress and plant developmental processes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis of the CAMTA gene family in Durio zibethinus (durian, Dz) identified 10 CAMTAs with conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis of DzCAMTAs, positioned DzCAMTA3 with its tomato ortholog that has already been validated for its role in the fruit ripening process through ethylene-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the transcriptome-wide analysis revealed DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 as the highest expressing durian CAMTA genes. These two DzCAMTAs possessed a distinct ripening-associated expression pattern during post-harvest ripening in Monthong, a durian cultivar native to Thailand. The expression profiling of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 under natural ripening conditions and ethylene-induced/delayed ripening conditions substantiated their roles as ethylene-induced transcriptional activators of ripening. Similarly, auxin-suppressed expression of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 confirmed their responsiveness to exogenous auxin treatment in a time-dependent manner. Accordingly, we propose that DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 synergistically crosstalk with ethylene during durian fruit ripening. In contrast, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 antagonistically with auxin could affect the post-harvest ripening process in durian. Furthermore, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 interacting genes contain significant CAMTA recognition motifs and regulated several pivotal fruit-ripening-associated pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the structure and probable function of CAMTA genes in the post-harvest ripening of durian.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biotechnology, Genetics"

Longitudinal growth patterns and final height in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus,"Jongvilaikasem P., Rianthavorn P.",2021-05-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Body Height, Child, Female, Growth Disorders, Humans, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Male, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Child, Growth disorders, Lupus erythematosus, Lupus nephritis","Patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) are at risk of becoming short adults. To evaluate the growth patterns and risk factors of short final height, a retrospective study was conducted in 97 patients (87 females, 90%) with cSLE who grew from the time of diagnosis and reached their final height. The primary outcome was the final height. Participants were divided into participants with short final height (final height standard deviation score (HSDS) < − 2, n = 22, 23%) and participants with normal final height (final HSDS ≥ − 2, n = 75, 77%). At diagnosis, the mean age was 11.3 ± 2.4 years and HSDS was − 0.5 ± 1.3. The participants reached the final height of 1.51 ± 0.08 m (final HSDS − 1.3 ± 0.1) at mean age of 16.2 ± 2.3 years. The HSDS of participants with short final height steadily declined throughout the course of SLE (p = 0.02), and were significantly lower than participants with normal final height at any time point (p < 0.001). In participants with normal final height, HSDS significantly declined from baseline until 2 years after diagnosis (p = 0.01), and then became stable thereafter. The independent risk factors for short final height were the male sex, short stature at diagnosis, low body weight at final height, and cumulative corticosteroid dose. Conclusion: A substantial number of the participants with cSLE became short adults. Adequate nutrition and corticosteroid minimization should be emphasized in patients at high risk for short final height.What is known?• Growth failure is common in SLE due to many risk factors including chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and long-term use of corticosteroids.• In comparison to growth failure, final height is a better indicator of growth as the prevalence of growth failure is variable depending on definitions, patient age and pubertal status.What is new?• Nearly one fourth of children with SLE have short final height.• The independent risk factors for short final height were the male sex, short stature at diagnosis, low body weight at final height, and cumulative corticosteroid dose.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

The Influence of Surface Roughening and Polishing on Microbial Biofilm Development on Different Ceramic Materials,"Abdalla M.M., Ali I.A.A., Khan K., Mattheos N., Murbay S., Matinlinna J.P., Neelakantan P.",2021-06-01,"Biofilms, Ceramics, Computer-Aided Design, Dental Porcelain, Materials Testing, Poland, Surface Properties, Biofilm, ceramic, feldspathic, lithium disilicate, zirconia","Purpose: To test the hypothesis that surface roughening and polishing of ceramics have no effect on their surface roughness and biofilm adhesion. Materials and methods: Feldspathic ceramic Vitablocks™ TriLuxe forte (VTF), lithium disilicate glass IPS e.max Press™ (IPS) and zirconia reinforced lithium silicate Vita Suprinity™ (VS) ceramic blocks (n = 27 per group) were prepared from sintered CAD blocks using a water-cooled saw. They were further subdivided into 3 subgroups according to the surface treatment protocols (n = 9): as prepared, roughened and polished. The surface roughness of the ceramic blocks was measured using an electro-mechanical profilometer. The ceramic sections were inoculated with Streptococcus mutans and incubated for 48 hours to form a biofilm. The ceramic surfaces with the biofilms were analyzed using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy to calculate the percentage of live bacteria and substratum coverage by the biofilm, and further visualized using scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS software using two-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni test to identify significant differences between the groups. The level of significance was set at p = 0.05. Results: As prepared VTF showed significantly higher mean surface roughness values than as prepared IPS and VS. The mean percentage of live bacteria and biofilm coverage of the substrate were significantly higher in the roughened ceramic blocks than the as prepared and polished blocks for all three ceramic types (p < 0.05). Polished specimens of VS significantly lower percentage of biofilm coverage than the other groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study sheds new light that adjustments of ceramic restorations prior to cementation increases the likelihood for formation and adhesion of microbial biofilms on the surface. Polished zirconia reinforced lithium disilicate ceramics demonstrated the lowest bacterial adhesion among the evaluated ceramics.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Objectives: To compare the short-term efficacy of methylene blue-mediated photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) and 5% amorolfine nail lacquer (AMO) for toenail onychomycosis using higher intensity and shorter total treatment period than previously reported. Methods: Twenty-seven toenails with onychomycosis were randomized to receive either six biweekly sessions of MB-PDT or AMO for twelve weeks. Dermoscopic photography was used for onychomycosis severity index assessment under a dermoscopic inspection (d-OSI) at baseline, weeks 6, 10, 14 and 22 as well as microscopic and microbiological tests. Adverse events were recorded. Results: All subjects completed the study. Causative organisms found were exclusively non-dermatophytes including Fusarium spp., Asperillus spp.,and yeasts. Fifteen toenails received MB-PDT, whilst 12 received AMO. D-OSI showed greater improvement in MB-PDT than in AMO groups at weeks 6, 10, 14 as well as 22, with median changes of −2, −3, −4 (P =.055). and − 3 respectively in the MB-PDT group.

The PBSA/PBS matrix phase was fixed at 70/30 wt%, whereas the PLA contents were varied from 10 to 30 wt%. Two grades of PLAs with different D-lactide contents of 4.0% (Hi-PLA) and 1.0% (Lo-PLA) were used. The developed microstructures and morphologies of dispersed PLA phases were purposed from DSC and WAXD studies. Basically, the presence of PLAs in ternary blends significantly enhanced the bubble stability during film blowing. According to the different chain backbones of PLA, Hi-PLA was completely melted during the extrusion process and coalescence led to a larger size of the dispersed phase. The biaxial deformation of dispersed Hi-PLA occurred in bubble inflation stages bringing to the layer-like morphology. Conversely, the cold crystallization occurred in Lo-PLA droplets which could not further deform during the bubble forming. The different reinforcing morphologies of these PLA minor phases were investigated and correlated with their mechanical properties of ternary blend films. A good balance of stiffness and toughness was achieved from ternary blend containing 10 wt% of Hi-PLA. Finally, the developed PBSA/PBS/PLA films can be suggested as a suitable packaging for environmental sustainability.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The thoron concentration measured by the monitors was compared with the reference value measured by a grab sampling method. As a result, the ratio of the measured concentration to the reference increased with flow rate for the RAD7 and the Radon Mapper although that of the AlphaGUARD decreased. The difference may be attributed to the coefficients used in the calculation and the measurement time scheme. The results indicate the importance of the sampling flow rate in thoron measurement.

In many constructions, the top cement surface is coated with a stucco system. In this study, we present experimental results on the corrosion behavior of a rapid-set stucco composite consisting of calcium sulfoaluminate cement (CSA). The rapid-set stucco is a new product on the market and was designed to improve the practicality of stucco use, which typically requires three coatings. Our test results indicate that the structure is not influenced by the fine aggregate (FA) content but is affected by the water-to-cement (w/c) ratio. The w/c ratio affects the apparent diffusivity (Da) of chloride ions penetrating the structure. The pH results indicate that the passivation layer is not formed, leaving a doubt that the CSA stucco should be in use, especially for non-galvanized steel reinforced system. To reduce the negative effect of absence of passivation layer, uniform mixing and casting mixture having good workability is needed which can prolong its serviceability up to 3 times. The use of galvanized steel is also essential which can be increase its service life for at least 5 to 10 times. This is because zinc layer from galvanization process also greatly decreases the corrosion rate by 475% less than that of steel layer itself.","corrosion, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model that combines the scientific method from meteorology and the deep learning method from computer science. We experimented with the model on both simulated data and radar images. Also, we have created the simulated data to imitate important features from radar images. The results show that our hybrid modeling approach outperforms all baselines on almost all datasets (both simulated and the radar data).","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software"

Many studies, carried out near the basin outlet, have suggested that the dam impounds significant sediment, resulting in shoreline retreat of the Chao Phraya Delta. In this study, the impact of damming on the sediment regime is analyzed through the sediment variation along the Ping River. The results show that the Ping River drains a mountainous region, with sediment mainly transported in suspension in the upper and middle reaches. By contrast, sediment is mostly transported as bedload in the lower basin. Variation of long-term total sediment flux data suggests that, while the Bhumibol Dam does effectively trap sediment, there was only a 5% reduction in sediment supply to the Chao Phraya River system because of sediment additions downstream.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

Motion artifact often deteriorates the ECG signal quality, and in the worst case, ECG signals must be discarded. Local skin deformation by mechanical disturbances causes the variation of electrical properties of electrode-skin interfaces. This may consider being the most contribution to the motion artifact or baseline drift in ECG signals. In this paper, we have studied the change of ECG baseline under externally applied force using a two-electrode ECG measurement system with thin-film force sensors. As a result, an increase of applied force on one electrode shows a large ECG baseline drift. In the case of the simultaneous increase of applied force on both electrodes shows reduced ECG baseline drift. We also confirmed the change of 50 Hz interference is often together with the baseline drift by an external force disturbance. In addition, an electrical model for motion artifact generation is also presented.","medicalcine and pharmacologymacology, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Although the dengue disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) is asymptomatic and self-limiting in most people with first infection, increased severe dengue symptoms may be observed in people with heterotypic secondary DENV infection. Since there is a lack of specific antiviral medication, the development of dengue vaccines is critical in the prevention and control this disease. Several targets and strategies in the development of dengue vaccine have been demonstrated. Currently, Dengvaxia, a live-attenuated chimeric yellow-fever/tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur, has been licensed and approved for clinical use in some countries. However, this vaccine has demonstrated low efficacy in children and dengue-naïve individuals and also increases the risk of severe dengue in young vaccinated recipients. Accordingly, many novel strategies for the dengue vaccine are under investigation and development.

This deficiency results in oxidative stress, dyserythropoiesis, and chronic anemia. Cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell linker (CLNK) belongs to adaptor proteins that have the capacity to interact with multiple signalling proteins and function in the organisation of the molecular components required for signal transduction. Objectives: This is the first study which measured serum CLNK in TDT patients and examines the correlation between CLNK and iron overload biomarkers. Patients and methods: Sixty children with TDT and 30 normal children (aged 3–12 years old) participated in the present study. The patients were on blood transfusion as a part of their treatment regimen. Serum C-reactive protein was negative in all samples. Results: The results showed significantly higher (P < 0.001) serum CLNK levels in TDT patients as compared with controls. The TDT diagnosis explained 19.4% of the variance in CLNK levels. The increased levels of CLNK were significantly associated with indicants of iron overload, namely increased ferritin levels. Conclusions: Increased CLNK levels in TDT may be explained by reciprocal effects between immune signalling and immature erythrocytes, which release soluble receptors and signalling molecules, including CLNK, in the blood.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

Therefore, comparative pharmacokinetics of pure puerarin alone and that in a P. mirifica extract in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted in order to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the 2 preparations. To this end, puerarin and P. mirifica extract, at an equivalent dose of 10 mg/kg of puerarin, were orally dosed to adult female monkeys for 7 consecutive days. A single intravenous injection of puerarin at a dose of 1 mg/kg was also peformed. Serial blood samples and excreta were collected from 0-24 h and 0-48 h after dosing. Determination of the puerarin levels and its metabolites in biological samples was conducted by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine fluctuated in the normal range, with no abnormal physical signs in the animal. The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 1% in both preparations. Accumulation of puerarin was found after oral dosing for 7 consecutive days in both groups. Major metabolites of puerarin found in monkeys were hydroxylation and deglycosylation products. A negligible amount of unchanged puerarin was detected in urine and feces. Pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from this study could help to design the prescribed remedy of puerarin and P. mirifica extract phytopharmaceutical products for human use.","genergyal, chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"
Effects of the reactor volumetric ratio and recycle ratio on the methane and energy productivity of a three-step anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (3S-ASBR) treating ethanol wastewater,"Seneesrisakul K., Jantaruksa T., Jiraprasertwong A., Pornmai K., Rangsunvigit P., Chavadej S.",2021-07-15,"Anaerobic sequencing batch reactors, Energy productivity, Energy yields, Ethanol wastewater, pH-regulation, Reactor volumetric ratio, Recycle ratios, Steady state, Three-step anerobic sequencing batch reactor, Volumetric ratio, Biogas, Ethanol wastewater, Reactor volumetric ratio, Recycle ratio, Three-step anaerobic sequencing batch reactor","A new three-step anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (3S-ASBR) was developed to enhance methane productivity and energy yield by varying the reactor volumetric and recycle ratios. The pH of the first reactor (R1) was maintained at 5.5, whereas that of the others (R2/R3) was not controlled. The effluent from R3 was recirculated to R1 to amplify the alkalinity and lessen the NaOH quantity for pH regulation. The 3S-ASBR was continually operated to attain a steady state at a moderate COD loading rate (10 kg/m3d) with different reactor volumetric ratios under 37 °C, a fixed total liquid volume of 30 L and a constant recycle ratio of unity. A R1:R2:R3 volumetric ratio of 1:1.5:5 gave the highest COD reduction (90%) and yielded 343 mL CH4/g COD applied with an overall energy extraction efficiency of up to 66%. This volumetric ratio corresponded well to the generation time ratio of the microbes involved in the hydrolysis/acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis steps which can be applied to scale up both 3S-ASBR and three-step/stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (3S-UASB) systems. The low pH level (5.5) in R1 was responsible for maintaining adequate amounts of all micronutrients in the system, causing both high microbial concentrations and activities. This was because the lower the solution pH, the higher the fraction of produced H2S to be in the gaseous phase, causing the lower the amounts of micronutrients to be precipitated chemically.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Energy (all), Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

It is normally surrounded by a few data points while normal ones are engulfed by others. This behavior leads to the proposed outlier factor called Mass-ratio-variance Outlier Factor (MOF). A score is assigned to a data point from the variance of the mass-ratio distribution from the rest of data points. Within a sphere of an outlier, there will be few data points compared with a normal one. So, the mass-ratio of an outlier will be different from that of a normal data point. The algorithm to generate MOF requires no parameter and embraces the density concept. Experimental results show that top-10 highest scores from MOF could identify all outliers from synthesized datasets similar to those scores from the state-of-the-art outlier scoring methods such as LOF and FastABOD. Moreover, it could retrieve more outliers from three real World datasets.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software"

Therefore, post-discharge care by a multidisciplinary care team (MDCT) may improve these outcomes. This study aimed to demonstrate the outcomes of implementing comprehensive care by a MDCT in severe AKI survivors. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted between August 2018 to January 2021. Patients who survived severe AKI stage 2–3 were enrolled and randomized to be followed up with either comprehensive or standard care for 12 months. The comprehensive post-AKI care involved an MDCT (nephrologists, nurses, nutritionists, and pharmacists). The primary outcome was the feasibility outcomes; comprising of the rates of loss to follow up, 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alert rates at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the amount of albuminuria at 12 months. Results: Ninety-eight AKI stage 3 survivors were enrolled and randomized into comprehensive care and standard care groups (49 patients in each group). Compared to the standard care group, the comprehensive care group had significantly better feasibility outcomes; 3-d dietary record, drug reconciliation, and drug alerts (p < 0.001). The mean eGFR at 12 months were comparable between the two groups (66.74 vs. 61.12 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.54). The urine albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR) was significantly lower in the comprehensive care group (36.83 vs. 177.70 mg/g, p = 0.036), while the blood pressure control was also better in the comprehensive care group (87.9% vs. 57.5%, p = 0.006). There were no differences in the other renal outcomes between the two groups. Conclusions: Comprehensive care by an MDCT is feasible and could be implemented for severe AKI survivors. MDCT involvement also yields better reduction of the UACR and better blood pressure control.

In the first step, CPECs were prepared by co-precipitation of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) mixed with various amounts of PANI as a filler. CPECs were formed by compression molding into 100 micron membranes using NaCl as a plasticizer and characterized for their electrochemical properties. In the second step, the highest capacitance CPEC membranes with 60% PANI loading were further modified and doped by crossflow polymerization of aniline through the composite membranes. By using a two-compartment crossflow reactor containing aniline and ammonium persulfate on each side, the PANI content of the composite membrane was further increased. Cyclic voltammetry showed a doubling in the capacitance of the membranes after the crossflow polymerization. The resulting electrodes were flexible with high capacitance and could be used to improve pseudo-capacitor performance.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, urinary biomarkers of cell-cycle arrest, and indicators of kidney stress can detect acute kidney injury before clinical manifestations. We sought to determine the event rates for acute kidney injury as a function of serial measurements of urinary (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) in patients at risk of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, so that an escalating series of kidney-sparing sepsis bundles based on international guidelines could be applied. DESIGN: We described the study protocol of ""Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis,"" a phase 4, multicenter, adaptive, randomized controlled trial. We performed simulations to estimate the rates for the trial's primary endpoint using patient-level data from two previous studies (Sapphire and Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock). SETTING: Academic and community ICUs. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, without evidence of stage 2/3 acute kidney injury at enrollment. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our primary endpoint is progression of two or more stages of acute kidney injury, death, or dialysis within 72 hours after enrollment. In the Sapphire simulation, 45 of 203 patients (22%) with sepsis met the endpoint. In Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock, 144 of 607 patients (24%) with septic shock met the endpoint. In both simulations, (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) patterns, suggested by Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis protocol, stratified the risk for the endpoint from 6% (three negative tests) to 41% (for patients eligible for the highest level of kidney-sparing sepsis bundle) in Sapphire, and 14% (two negative tests) to 46% (for the highest level of kidney-sparing sepsis bundle) in Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of our Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis trial simulation confirmed that (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) could identify patients with different rates of progression to moderate/severe acute kidney injury, death, or dialysis in 72 hours. The Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis protocol algorithm is therefore feasible in terms of identifying suitably high-risk individuals for kidney-sparing sepsis bundle.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

Tar content was greatly reduced by 10 folds when compared to that of the pyrolysis in argon gas (Ar). Molten salt resulted in the reduction of tar and CO2 formation due to the rapid heating of 141 °C/s alter the pyrolysis pathway to produce more syngas products. Further tar elimination was promoted with the presence of nickel supported on alumina catalyst in the salt. Tar was reduced by 5 folds when compared to that the pyrolysis in sole molten salt (MS). Tar from pyrolysis in MS-Ni was about 1 wt%. In addition, CH4 could be reformed with CO2 into additional syngas over the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. As a result, the pyrolysis in the combined salt and catalyst exhibited high syngas yield at 824 mL/g cellulose. Moreover, alumina particles enhanced the heat transfer in the molten salt, resulting in the highest heating rate of 181 °C/s obtained in MS-Ni medium. However, the catalyst deactivation was a serious issue in combining molten salt with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The high corrosiveness would damage the alumina support, while the Ni active metal would be leached from the catalyst particles, resulting in the catalyst deactivation.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

Although the makeup recommendation system was previously studied in many researches, but the suggestion cannot be applied for a person accurately in real situation. Color tone based on color wheel theory for facial makeup and color selection from individual skin tone were employed in this study. There were two stages of the hierarchical cascade classifier. The first stage was relied on a rule-based classification procedure, in which rules can be generated by investigating input data within the scope of this research together with the data from a professional makeup artist and 250 face images with makeup originated by makeup experts, resulting in primary color of eye shadow, cheek blush color, and lipstick color. Next, machine learning concept was used as the second stage of the hierarchical cascade classifier to indicate secondary color of eye shadow and alternative lipstick color corresponding to a feature vector. Six classification models, which are Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and Naïve Bayes classifier were selected in this study.

In this study, the novel α-glucosidase from Weissella cibaria BBK-1 (WcAG) was biochemically and structurally characterized. WcAG belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) and to the neopullanase subfamily. It exhibits distinct hydrolytic activity towards the α-1,4 linkages of short-chain oligosaccharides from the reducing end. The enzyme prefers to hydrolyse maltotriose and acarbose, while it cannot hydrolyse cyclic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. In addition, WcAG can cleave pullulan hydrolysates and strongly exhibits transglycosylation activity in the presence of maltose. Size-exclusion chromatography and X-ray crystal structures revealed that WcAG forms a homodimer in which the N-terminal domain of one monomer is orientated in proximity to the catalytic domain of another, creating the substrate-binding groove. Crystal structures of WcAG in complexes with maltose, maltotriose and acarbose revealed a remarkable enzyme active site with accessible +2, +1 and-1 subsites, along with an Arg-Glu gate (Arg176-Glu296) in front of the active site.

The challenge is to classify the same types of buildings in each airport that may differ in terms of shape, size, and color. In order to overcome these problems, we use the EfficientNet architecture, which achieves high accuracy with low numbers of parameters and relatively inexpensive computational time compared to other architectures. In this work, the proposed problem is handled by utilizing the EfficientNet concept in five versions (B0-B4) by classifying four types of buildings in the airport; the passenger terminal, the radio tower, the runway, and the car park. The dataset covers 322 airports in Asia in the RGB format, with a resolution of 560×560 pixels. The experimental validation of the used method is performed through a partition of the dataset; 70% in the training set, 10% in the validation set, and 20% in the test set. We found that EfficientNet-B4 is a tremendously applicable architecture. It provides a high accuracy level of up to 90%, which is considerably more than the other architectures.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

These agents are recommended at the same level on the basis of their efficacy and safety data. However, no local evidence of the impact of RA treatment regimens on total budget spending is available to date. This study aimed to explore the budget impact of different sequential targeted treatments in Thai patients with RA who failed at least three conventional synthetic DMARDs. Methods: We used the adapted model to evaluate the budget impact of adding tofacitinib in different order to RA targeted treatment regimens. The Thai RA population eligible for treatment was assessed on the basis of local prevalence and experts’ opinion. Cost-impact analysis was evaluated for the treatment sequences of four different lines of targeted therapies using inputs like clinical efficacy, safety, and costs. The model used a decision tree structure with treatment nodes corresponding to treatment response outcomes for a cohort of patients. The comparisons included five bDMARDs [etanercept (ETN), infliximab (IFX), golimumab (GOL), rituximab (RTX), tocilizumab (TCZ) intravenous formulation], two JAKi [tofacitinib (TOF) and baricitinib (BAR)], and two IFX biosimilars (PF-06438179/GP1111 and CT-P13). A total of 80 treatment sequences within each containing four sequential first-, second-, third-, and fourth-line options were generated. Results: The findings of the base case scenario indicated the treatment sequence with RTX as first-line, followed by IFX biosimilar (PF-06438179/GP1111), TOF, and TCZ, respectively, produced the lowest budget impact of US $693.54 million.

Methodology: Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing data of Jagged1-treated hDPs was performed using NetworkAnalyst. The mRNA expression was validated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. hDPs were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surfaces in the presence or absence of TGF-β or BMP inhibitor. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated using alkaline phosphatase staining, osteogenic marker gene expression and mineralization assay. Statistical analyses were performed using a Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by a pairwise comparison for more than three group comparison. Mann–Whitney U-test was employed for two group comparison. The statistical significance was considered at p <.05. Results: Jagged1 treatment in growth medium significantly promoted TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 whilst significantly inhibited BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6 mRNA expression (p <.05). In osteogenic induction medium, Jagged1 significantly up-regulated TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 at days 1 and 3 (p <.05). Pre-treatment with TGF-β1, TGF-β2 or TGF-β3 prior to osteogenic induction resulted in the significant increase of osteogenic marker gene expression, collagen type 1 protein expression, alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity and mineral deposition (p <.05). However, TGF-β signalling inhibition with SB431542 (4 μmol L−1) or SB505124 (47 and 129 nmol L−1) failed to attenuate the effect of Jagged1-induced osteogenic differentiation in hDPs. Dorsomorphin (4 and 8 μmol L−1) treatment significantly abolished the effect of Jagged1 on mineralization by hDPs (p <.05). Conclusion: Notch signalling activation by Jagged1 modulated TGF-β and BMP ligand expression.

A modified vortex tracking algorithm is used to detect TCs over the SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA domain in the historical simulations from 1986 to 2005. Sensitivity tests for the detection method criteria, including vorticity, outer core wind strength, sea level pressure anomaly, and temperature anomaly at 300, 500, 700, and 850 hPa, were conducted to determine the optimum threshold configuration for each SEACLID/CORDEX-SEA simulation used in the study. Comparison with the best track data of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center showed that model simulations underestimated the total number of TCs east of the Philippines for the 1986–2005 period but captured the annual cycle of the total number of TCs. This underestimation of TCs is possibly due to the domain used, which does not extend further east to cover most of the TC genesis area in the Western North Pacific. The structure of a typical TC from the regional climate model simulation is comparable to observed TC structure. However, results indicate that the resolution of the simulations is still not sufficient to capture the fine details of the observed TC structure, which could explain in part the lower intensification rate of TCs in the model output.","the atmosphere, earth sciences",Atmospheric Science

The initial rate of transesterification was increased with increasing amount of water (0–5 wt%). On the contrary, the initial rate was significantly reduced for the water concentration of 8–15 wt%. Moreover, when the biodiesel yield reached the maximum value of 30–40%, saponification as a side reaction became more significant with the presence of the emulsion phase, resulting in a remarkable decrease in biodiesel yield. The simple kinetic model including the rate constant and apparent activation energy revealed that transesterification containing 5 wt% water gave the higher rate constant compared to the case with the absence of water. However, the simple model could not describe the case with high water content. The water effect should be accounted for in the reaction rate in the adsorption term. The modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model including the effects of water contamination was originally proposed. Our finding suggested that despite the small amount of water content in transesterification using CaO catalyst giving rise in the initial rate, the water contamination in feedstocks for biodiesel production should be avoided because of the notable presence of saponification.","coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"
Sustainable fuel production from steam reforming of waste motor oil over olivine-supported Fe catalyst,"Phusuwan U., Atong D., Nisamaneenate J., Sricharoenchaikul V.",2021-11-01,"Carbon and hydrogens, Fe catalyst, Green fuel, Motor oil, Optimal conditions, Residence time, Steam-to-carbon ratio, Sustainable fuels, Syn gas, Waste motor oil, Fe catalyst, Olivine, Steam reforming, Syngas, Waste motor oil","Waste Motor Oil (WMO) has great potential to be utilized as a green fuel feedstock via thermochemical process as its high carbon content is suitable as alternative source during steam reforming reactions (SR). This process not only has potential for high syngas (CO and H2) production but also elimination of undesirable components, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals in WMO. Here, evaluation of optimal conditions for WMO catalytic steam reforming in fixed-bed laboratory reactor to produce quality syngas was carried out. Influences of residence time (7–20 s), reaction temperature (700–900 °C), steam to carbon (S/C) ratio (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1), and Fe loadings (5% and 10%) on olivine support on carbon and hydrogen conversions were investigated. Results showed that the highest carbon and hydrogen conversions could be obtained after 10 s due to reactions achieving equilibrium. As for temperature, carbon and hydrogen conversions increased with temperature from mainly endothermic reactions which cause more hydrocarbon cracking. S/C volume ratio of 1:1 was preferable to obtain better carbon and hydrogen conversions due to superior heat distribution. Thus, the optimal conditions of WMO reforming were 10 s and S/C ratio of 1:1 at 800 °C which resulted in 94.68% and 79.34% carbon and hydrogen conversions, respectively, while gas product LHV was 4.44 MJ/m3. As for Fe loading on olivine, the best performance was acquired at 800 °C, residence time of 15 s, and S/C ratio of 1:1 with 10% Fe/olivine. Carbon and hydrogen conversions increased by 7.60% to 69.91% and by 13.70% to 69.31%, respectively, when compared to non-catalytic cases. This is because of higher cracking of heavy hydrocarbons from greater Fe active sites. Application of this work may lead to decrease in environmental impact from WMO disposal and make available the green fuel for sustainable power generations or as chemical intermediates in many industries.","petroleum engineeringneering, energy",Energy (all)
Robust adaptive topology optimization of porous infills under loading uncertainties,"Hoang V.-N., Pham T., Tangaramvong S., Bordas S.P.A., Nguyen-Xuan H.",2021-05-01,"Automatic mesh refinements, Material continuities, Material microstructures, Microscopic structures, Multi-scale structures, Structural performance, Topological optimization, Topology Optimization Method, Adaptive geometric component, Load uncertainty, Multiscale topology optimization, Porous infill, Robust concurrent topology optimization","The majority of topology optimization methods for porous infill designs is based on the assumption of deterministic loads. However, in practice, quantities such as positions, weights, and directions of applied loads may change accidentally. Deterministic load-based designs might deliver poor structural performance under loading uncertainties. Such uncertain factors need to be taken into account in topological optimization to seek robust results. This paper presents a novel robust concurrent topology optimization method for the design of uniform/non-uniform porous infills under the accidental change of loads. A combination of moving morphable bars (MMBs) and loading uncertainties is proposed to directly model multiscale structures and seek robust designs. The macro- and microscopic structures can be simultaneously optimized through the minimization of the weighted sum of the expected compliance and standard deviation. The geometries of adaptive geometric components (AGCs) are straightforwardly optimized. The AGCs consist of two classes of geometric components: macroscopic bars describing the overall structure and microscopic bars describing the material microstructures. Automatic mesh-refinement is utilized to enhance computing efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate that robust porous design can be obtained with only one global volume constraint while the material continuity of neighboring unit cells and the structural porosity can be maintained without additional constraints. The robust designs yield a more robust structural performance along with a smaller standard deviation compared with deterministic porous designs under loading uncertainties.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Software, Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design"

The results were authenticate the nZVI nanoparticles have a chain shape and establish as separable nanospheres with an average size (29.95 nm) on the surface of IK. The FTIR spectra demonstrate the presence of Al-O as well as Si-O bonds. XRD results demonstrate the presence of zerovalent iron. SEM confirmed less agglomeration of Fe(0) nanoparticles which improves the mechanical strength. The weak signals of Fe and O confirm the establishment of zerovalent iron in nanocomposite. TEM demonstrates that the nanocomposite has a chain like structure. Pb(II)percentage removal was improved by rise in the IK-nZVI amount which results in rising the adsorption site. The nanocomposite had on optimum Pb(II) sorption at pH range of 4.5–6.5. The amount adsorbent increasing with the Pb(II) removal percentage was decreased. Kinetics study demonstrated that Pb(II) sorption was accomplished through more than one processes. IK was proved active support to progress the dispersion, and steadiness of IK-nZVI nanocomposite. The sorption processes pollutant was estimated through the kinetics models, and different sorption isotherm equations like Langmuir (LM), Langmuir-Freundlich (L-F), and Freundlich (FL) isotherms. The IK-nZVI typically accompanies outstanding Pb(II) removal efficiency of 98% and 96.05% with a span of 5 and 10 min for low and high concentrations, respectively. Significantly, the results reveal the maximum adsorption capability of the IK-nZVI is 192.0 mg/g. The thermodynamic study shown endothermic and spontaneous adsorption onto the IK-nZVI surface.

Results: The results of a comparison of MP levels in unprocessed whole blood showed that the concentration of all MPs in the donors without thalassemia trait (n = 255) was higher than in donors with thalassemia trait (n = 70). After processing, increased concentrations of MPs were documented in both groups. Among the blood components, PRBC showed higher platelet-derived MP concentrations in donors with thalassemia than in donors without thalassemia. However, PC showed higher concentrations of total MPs in donors without thalassemia than in donors with that condition.

However, the differences between this novel cell type and other nonhormone-producing cells have not been clarified. Therefore, we introduced several microscopic techniques to gain insight into the morphological characteristics of this novel DIP cell. We succeeded in identifying novel DIP cells under light microscopy using desmin immunocryosection, combining resin embedding blocks and immunoelectron microscopy. In conventional transmission electron microscopy, folliculostellate cells, capsular fibroblasts, macrophages, and pericytes presented a flat cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum, whereas those of novel DIP cells had a dilated pattern. The number of novel DIP cells was greatest in the intact rats, though nearly disappeared under prolactinoma conditions. Additionally, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy showed that these novel DIP cells had multidirectional processes and some processes reached the capillary, but these processes did not tightly wrap the vessel, as is the case with pericytes. Interestingly, we found that the rough endoplasmic reticulum was globular and dispersed throughout the cytoplasmic processes after three-dimensional reconstruction. This study clearly confirms that novel DIP cells are a new cell type in the rat anterior pituitary gland, with unique characteristics.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Among recycled aggregates (RAs), clay brick aggregate (CBA) has the potential of being the most widely used RAs because of the considerable amount of clay brick waste generated in many countries. The compressive behavior and mechanical properties of RAC with CBA are highly influenced by the mechanical properties of bricks. The stiffness and compressive strength of RAC with CBA are reported marginally lower than the natural aggregate concrete (NAC). In the past, different types of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites such as carbon FRP, glass FRP, and aramid FRP have been investigated to enhance the strength and stiffness of the RAC with CBA. However, the behavior of hybrid FRP confined RAC with CBA is not yet clear. In this study, the performance of a new, low-cost and high-performance hybrid composite to enhance the strength and stiffness of the RAC with CBA is investigated. Hybrid composite is developed by using natural Basalt fiber and E-glass fibers (Chopped Strand Mat) along with the use of high-performance polyester resin. Three types of bricks (having different strength and water absorption) were used to produce CBA. Other research parameters included were the strength of RAC with CBA and the number of layers of hybrid basalt/E-glass fiber reinforced polymer (BE-FRP) composite. A total number of 36 concrete cylinders (12 un-confined and 24 confined with BE-FRP) were tested under pure axial compressions. The results indicate that the BE-FRP composites are highly suitable to enhance strength, stiffness, and ductility of the RAC with CBA. Also, there was found a significant increase in strength and ductility with an increase in the confinement level. In the end, the efficiency of existing strength and stain models was assessed to predict the ultimate strength and strain of the BE-FRP confined RAC with BAC.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

Various noninvasive modalities, e.g., ultrasonography, elastography and clinical predictive scores, have been used as alternatives to liver biopsy, with limited performance. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed and integrated into noninvasive diagnostic tools to improve their performance. Methods: We systematically searched for studies on AI-assisted diagnosis of liver fibrosis and NAFLD on MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve was generated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the AI-assisted system. Subgroup analyses by diagnostic modalities, population and AI classifiers were performed. Results: We included 19 studies reporting the performances of AI-assisted ultrasonography, elastrography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and steatosis.

It is the leading cause of neonatal death. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral dydrogesterone on latency period in managing preterm labor. The secondary aims were to evaluate the gestational age at delivery, percentage of preterm delivery before 34 weeks and 37 weeks, time to recurrent uterine contraction, pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes, compliance and side effects. Methods: This was a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-eight pregnant women with preterm labor, singleton pregnancy, and gestational age of 24–34 weeks were enrolled into the study. The study group received 10 mg of oral dydrogesterone three times per day and the control group received placebo. All pregnant women received standard treatment with tocolytic and antenatal corticosteroids. Results: The median latency periods were not significantly different between the dydrogesterone group (27.5 days) and placebo group (34 days, p = 0.45). Additionally, there were no differences in the gestational age at delivery, percentage of preterm delivery before 34 weeks and 37 weeks, pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes, compliance and side effects. However, the time to the recurrence of uterine contractions in participants that had recurrent preterm labor was longer in the dydrogesterone group than in the placebo group (30.6 ± 12.3 vs 13.7 ± 5.0 days, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Adjunctive treatment with 30 mg of oral dydrogesterone could not prolong latency period in preterm labor when compared to placebo.

Adding poloxamer 188 to a poloxamer 407 solution increases the overall gelation temperature, thereby allowing adjustments to the window of operating temperatures. The rheological properties of the poloxamer hydrogel, including gelation temperature and gelation time, were investigated, and the biocompatibility, drug release, and antibacterial properties of a gentamicin-loaded hydrogel were determined. An injectable hydrogel was successfully formulated using 20 wt% of poloxamer 407 and 3 wt% of poloxamer 188. This system became fluid at room temperature (25 °C) in the presence of deionized water; at human body temperature (37 °C), it changed to a gel-like state. The gelation time was approximately 95 seconds. The poloxamer hydrogels showed no cytotoxicity to L929 cells after seven days of culturing. A poloxamer hydrogel loaded with gentamicin sulfate, an antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial properties against E. coli, B. cereus, S. aureus, and MRSA using gentamicin solution as the control. The results showed that the gentamicin-loaded poloxamer hydrogel inhibited bacteria from the first hour of testing. Moreover, the zone of inhibition of the gentamicin-loaded poloxamer hydrogel was larger than that of the gentamicin solution for a similar concentration of gentamicin sulfate.

Here, experiments on cGAS deficient (cGAS-/- ) mice were conducted using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection sepsis models and macrophages. Severity of CLP in cGAS-/- mice was less severe than in wildtype (WT) mice, as indicated by mortality, serum LPS, cfDNA, leukopenia, cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10), organ histology (lung, liver and kidney) and spleen apoptosis. With the LPS injection model, serum cytokines in cGAS-/- mice were lower than in WT mice, despite the similar serum cfDNA level. Likewise, in LPS-activated WT macrophages, the expression of several mitochondria-associated genes (as revealed by RNA sequencing analysis) and a profound reduction in mitochondrial parameters, including maximal respiration (determined by extracellular flux analysis), DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial abundance (revealed by fluorescent staining), were demonstrated. These data implied the impact of cfDNA resulting from LPS-induced cell injury. In parallel, an additive effect of bacterial DNA on LPS, seen in comparison with LPS alone, was demonstrated in WT macrophages, but not in cGAS-/- cells, as indicated by supernatant cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), M1 proinflammatory polarization (iNOS and IL-1β), cGAS, IFN-γ and supernatant cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP). In conclusion, cGAS activation by cfDNA from hosts (especially mtDNA) and bacteria was found to induce an additive proinflammatory effect on LPS-activated macrophages which was perhaps responsible for the more pronounced sepsis hyperinflammation observed in WT mice compared with the cGAS-/- group.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Expression of ColA protein and its enzymatic activity was demonstrated. In this study, cloned ColA protein, in comparison with LipL32, was used as an antigen for antibody detection. Thirty pairs of sera from human leptospirosis patients were tested. Sera from blood donors, and patients with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection (20 samples from each group) were tested for the specificity. All sera from leptospirosis patients tested in this study reacted with both ColA and LipL32 proteins. Sera from blood donors, patients with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection did not react with ColA protein. Data suggested that sensitivity and specificity of ColA protein for Leptospira antibody detection were 100%. In addition, ColA protein showed higher specificity than LipL32.

"Promoting self-assembly and synthesis of color-responsive polydiacetylenes using mixed water-organic solvents: Effects of solvent composition, structure, and incubation temperature","Saymung R., Traiphol N., Traiphol R.",2021-10-05,"Amphiphilics, Colorimetric sensors, Cosolvents, Diacetylenes, Incubation temperatures, Organics, Photopolymerizations, Polydiacetylenes, Solution mixing methods, Solvent composition, Co-solvent, Colorimetric sensors, Morphology, Polydiacetylene, Self-assembly","A conventional method for the synthesis of color-responsive polydiacetylene (PDA) materials normally involves the dispersion of amphiphilic diacetylene (DA) monomers in water, incubation at low temperature, and then photopolymerization. This time-consuming process produces relatively low PDA yield, limiting the utilization in industrial applications. Recently, we introduced a solution-mixing method (SMM) that significantly improved the synthetic process of PDA/Zn(II)/ZnO nanocomposites (Chanakul et al. (2021) [54]). Our previous report focused on the self-assembly and synthesis of the nanocomposites in mixed water-organic solvents containing ~5%vol/vol organic solvents. In this continuing study, we further explore the SMM for improving the synthesis of pure PDAs. The addition of organic solvents at various concentrations (0–70%vol/vol) into water alters physicochemical properties of solvent media. At suitable solvent compositions, the self-assembly of amphiphilic DA monomers is drastically enhanced, leading to the increase of PDA yield after photopolymerization. The PDA yield in this study is ~5 times higher than those obtained from the conventional thin film hydration method and solvent injection method. The addition of organic solvents also causes the increase of particle size and induces morphological transition. We have found that the dielectric constant and structure of organic solvents are important parameters, dictating the self-assembly of amphiphilic DA monomers. The incubation temperature also plays an important role. Interestingly, the self-assembly can be promoted by increasing the incubation temperature during the synthetic process. Our study presents a simple approach for promoting the self-assembly of DA monomers and hence increasing PDA yield. The resultant PDAs still exhibits colorimetric response to heat and various solvents, allowing the utilization in sensing applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

SBA-15 was synthesized using sol-gel method and Ce and Ce-Zr were added by two different procedures: i) directly during the synthesis and ii) via post-synthesis method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption isotherms, XPS, DRUV-Vis, TEM, SEM and Py-FTIR. Low angle XRD, N2 isotherms and TEM confirmed that the structure was not changed after metal incorporation. Wide angle XRD, UV–vis-DRS, XPS and TEM determined that the catalysts prepared by direct synthesis presented higher dispersion of Ce oxides, smaller particle size and isolated Zr4+ species. FTIR of adsorbed/desorbed pyridine indicated that zirconium as promoter increases the Lewis acidity of the catalysts, especially during direct synthesis. Ce-Zr-SBA-15 catalyst prepared by direct synthesis was very active in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, 4,6-dimethyl dibenzothiophene and benzothiophene using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant agent and acetonitrile as polar solvent. The effect of acidity in the catalyst, hydrogen peroxide concentration and temperature was studied. The deactivation test demonstrated that the catalyst is stable and adequate for the industrial process.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Focusing on major types of spending, including healthcare-related transportation and spiritual expenses, this study analyses OOP on outpatient and inpatient visits in Bhutan, using a two-part model and data from the nationally representative 2017 Bhutan Living Standards Survey. While OOP based on standard estimates is relatively low in Bhutan, the survey data show that expenses for healthcare-related transportation and spiritual ceremonies are substantive and by far exceed other components of OOP. Demographic, socio-economic, geographic and morbidity-related factors are found to affect the probability of incurring medical, transportation and spiritual OOP, as well as amounts spent. Disaggregating healthcare-related spending into its key components further reveals that living in rural areas increases the probability of incurring expenses for transportation and spiritual ceremonies, but decreases the odds of experiencing positive medical expenditure. Monthly equivalised household expenditure, functional disability, frequency of visits and length of stay are positively associated with total OOP, especially for transportation and spiritual expenses. Going to a public primary healthcare provider for the first outpatient visit, on the other hand, significantly decreases likelihood and amount of medical, transportation and spiritual OOP. These key results highlight the importance of understanding context-specific drivers of healthcare-related spending. In Bhutan, the financial burden particularly impacts respondents in rural areas and those with higher needs for healthcare services. A clear implication of the findings is that primary care and gatekeeping mechanisms need to be strengthened, especially considering that cost pressures have been growing which could lead to higher OOP in the future. Moreover, closer examination of the role of spiritual practices in the provision of health services is needed.","Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, sociology, arts","Health (social science), History and Philosophy of Science"
Payment mechanism and hospital admission: New evidence from Thailand healthcare reform,"Damrongplasit K., Atalay K.",2021-12-01,"Health Care Reform, Health Expenditures, Hospitalization, Hospitals, Humans, Thailand, DRG-Based payment, Hospital admission, Length of stay, Out-of-pocket expenditure, Provider payment","In 2007, Thailand's Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), one of the three main public health insurers, adopted a new payment mechanism for hospital admission. There has been a shift from fee-for-service toward Diagnostic Related Group (DRG)-based payment that transfers financial risk from the government to health care providers. This study investigates the effects of this policy change on hospital admission, frequency of admission, length of stay (LOS), type of hospital admitted, and out-of-pocket (OOP) inpatient medical expenditure. By employing nationally representative micro-level data (Health and Welfare surveys) and difference-in-difference approach, this study finds a 1 percentage point decline in hospitalization, a 10% higher chance of admission at community hospitals (the lowest level inpatient public health care facility), and a 7% less chance of admission at higher level public health care facilities like general hospitals. No significant change was observed in LOS, frequency of admission, or OOP inpatient medical expenditure associated with the post-2007 payment mechanism change. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of a close-ended payment mechanism for health care in developing countries. This study also adds to the limited literature on using micro-level data to investigate payment mechanism change in the context of low- and middle-income countries.","sociology, arts","Health (social science), History and Philosophy of Science"

In order to improve their production by enhancing FFAs secretion into a medium, we constructed three engineered Synechocystis 6803 strains including KA (a mutant lacking the aas gene), KAOL (KA overexpressing lipA, encoding lipase A in membrane lipid hydrolysis), and KAOGR (KA overexpressing quadruple glpD/rbcLXS, related to the CBB cycle). Certain contents of intracellular lipids and secreted FFAs of all engineered strains were higher than those of the wild type. Remarkably, the KAOL strain attained the highest level of secreted FFAs by about 21.9%w/DCW at day 5 of normal BG11 cultivation, with a higher growth rate and shorter doubling time. TEM images provided crucial evidence on the morphological changes of the KAOL strain, which accumulated abundant droplets on regions of thylakoid membranes throughout the cell when compared with wild type. On the other hand, BG11-N condition significantly induced contents of both intracellular lipids and secreted FFAs of the KAOL strain up to 37.2 and 24.5%w/DCW, respectively, within 5 days. Then, for the first time, we shone a spotlight onto the overexpression of lipA in the aas mutant of Synechocystis as another potential strategy to achieve higher FFAs secretion with sustainable growth.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The introduction of well-defined nanostructured porous fillers of pores close to the kinetic diameter of the gas molecule and polymer matrix compatibility is a challenge in improving the gas transportation characteristics of MMMs. This study deals with the preparation of porphyrin filler and the polysulfone (PSf) polymer MMMs. The fillers demonstrated uniform distribution, uniformity, and successful bond formation. MMMs demonstrated high thermal stability with a glass transition temperature in the range of 480–610 °C. The porphyrin filler exhibited microporous nature with the presence of π-π bonds and Lewis's basic functionalities between filler-polymer resulted in a highly CO2-philic structure. The pure and mixed gas permeabilities and selectivity were successfully improved and surpass the Robeson's upper bound curve's tradeoff. Additionally, the temperature influence on CO2 permeability revealed lower activation energies at higher temperatures leading to the gas transport facilitation. This can be granted consistency and long-term durability in polymer chains. These results highlight the unique properties of porphyrin fillers in CO2 separation mixed matrix membranes and offer new knowledge to increase comprehension of PSf performance under various contents or environments.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Results: Of 3439 potential studies, seven were included in the systematic review (1211 attacks; 433 patients) and three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to high dose steroid alone, the add-on TPE increases a chance for the returning of EDSS to baseline at discharge (RR 3.02, 95% CI 1.34–6.81) and last follow-up (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01–2.79) as well as improves visual acuity at last follow-up. Conclusion: TPE as an add-on therapy to high-dose steroid injection during an acute attack in NMOSD patients is associated with returning to baseline EDSS at discharge and last follow-up, and a trend to have a lower disability at 6–12 months.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

We characterized HIV infections that occurred in the blinded phase of HPTN 083. Methods: Retrospective testing included HIV testing, viral load testing, quantification of study drugs, and HIV drug resistance testing. Results: Fifty-eight infections were evaluated, including 51 incident infections (12 in CAB arm and 39 in TDF/FTC arm). In many cases (5 in CAB arm and 37 in TDF/FTC arm), infection was associated with low or unquantifiable study drug concentrations. In 4 cases, infection occurred with on-time CAB-LA injections and expected plasma CAB concentrations. CAB exposure was associated with prolonged viral suppression and delayed antibody expression. In some cases, delayed HIV diagnosis resulted in CAB provision to participants with undetected infection, delayed antiretroviral therapy, and emergence of drug resistance; most of these infections would have been detected earlier with viral load testing. Conclusions: Early detection of HIV infection and prompt antiretroviral therapy initiation could improve clinical outcomes in persons who become infected despite CAB-LA prophylaxis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the correlates of HIV protection in persons receiving CAB-LA.",medical,Medicine (all)
Optimization of elemental recovery from electronic wastes using a mild oxidizer,"Sronsri C., Sittipol W., Panitantum N., U-yen K.",2021-11-01,"Adsorption process, Electrochemical process, Electronics wastes, Industrial metals, Leachate flows, Leachate solutions, Metals recoveries, Mild oxidizer, Optimisations, Optimized conditions, Adsorption, Electronic Waste, Gold, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Metals, Rare Earth, Neodymium, Electrochemical process, Electronic waste, Metal recovery, Mild oxidizer, Rare-earth element","In this work, metals were recovered from electronic wastes under optimized conditions. The columnar extraction was used to increase the contact between the leachate solution and solid-state wastes. Industrial metals were recovered by an electrochemical process using a regenerated mild oxidizer under optimized operating parameters to enrich the metal concentrations and reduce waste generation. The maximum recovery rate (1.135 mg·min−1) was recorded under the optimized conditions (160 A·m−2 current density, 7 mL·min−1 leachate flow rate, and 0.8 mol·L–1 ferric concentration). The selective columnar extraction process was employed to extract gold, wherein the highest extraction efficiency (69.39%) was obtained under optimized conditions of 0.7 mol·L−1 thiourea, 0.6 mol·L−1 hydrochloric acid, 0.8 mol·L−1 ferric chloride, 120 min circulation time, and 6 mL·min−1 leachate flow rate. The adsorption process was used for the recovery of gold, which was investigated under the kinetic as well as equilibrium adsorption processes. The adsorption curves conformed to the Langmuir model and followed the first-order kinetics. The adsorption rate decreased with the increasing values of pH, temperature, adsorbent size, while the rate increased with the stirring speed and adsorbent quantity. Finally, acidic extraction under anaerobic and optimal conditions was performed to extract and selectively recover rare-earth elements. The rare-earth elements were initially precipitated in their sulfate forms and subsequently transformed into corresponding hydroxides and oxides. The total recovery efficiencies for cerium and neodymium were found to be 91.7% and 86.7%, respectively.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with type 2 DM. The outcome was the development of stage-3 CKD. The data set was randomly split into training and validation data sets. Cox proportional hazard regression was used for model development. Discrimination (Harrell's C statistic) and calibration (the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test and survival probability curve) were applied to evaluate model performance. Results: In total, 2178 type 2 DM patients without stage-3 CKD, visiting the hospital from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017, were recruited, with median follow-up time of 1.29 years (interquartile range, 0.5-2.5 years); 385 (17.68%) subjects had developed stage-3 CKD. The final predictors included age, male sex, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hemoglobin A1c. Two 3-year stage-3 CKD risk models, model 1 (laboratory model) and model 2 (simplified model), had the C statistic in validation data sets of 0.890 and 0.812, respectively. Conclusions: Two 3-year stage-3 CKD risk models were developed for Thai patients with type 2 DM. Both models have good discrimination and calibration. These stage-3 CKD prediction models could equip health providers with tools for clinical management and supporting patient education.","Economics, pharmacology, medical","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous), Health Policy"
Ergonomic Recommendations in Ultrasound-Guided Botulinum Neurotoxin Chemodenervation for Spasticity: An International Expert Group Opinion,"Lagnau P., Lo A., Sandarage R., Alter K., Picelli A., Wissel J., Verduzco-Gutierrez M., Suputtitada A., Munin M.C., Carda S., Khan O., Kocer S., Reebye R.",2021-04-01,"Acetylcholine Release Inhibitors, Botulinum Toxins, Consensus, Ergonomics, Health Care Surveys, Humans, Injections, Intramuscular, Muscle Spasticity, Muscle, Skeletal, Nerve Block, Occupational Health, Occupational Injuries, Patient Positioning, Posture, Treatment Outcome, Ultrasonography, Interventional, botulinumneurotoxin, chemodenervation, ergonomics, muscle spasticity, ultrasound-guided","Ultrasound (US)-guided botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections are becoming a mainstay in the treatment of muscle spasticity in upper motor neuron syndromes. As a result, there has been a commensurate increase in US-guided BoNT injection for spasticity training courses. How-ever, many of these courses do not emphasize the importance of ergonomics. This paper aims to highlight the importance of ultrasound ergonomics and presents ergonomic recommendations to optimize US-guided BoNT injection techniques in spasticity management. Expert consensus opinion of 11 physicians (4 different continents; representing 8 countries, with an average of 12.6 years of practice using US guidance for BoNT chemodenervation (range 3 to 22 years)). A search using PubMed, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia database, EMbase was conducted and found no publications relating the importance of ergonomics in US-guided chemodenervation. Therefore, recommendations and consensus discussions were generated from the distribution of a 20-question survey to a panel of 11 ultrasound experts. All 11 surveyed physicians considered ergonomics to be important in reducing physician injury. There was complete agreement that physician positioning was important; 91% agreement that patient positioning was important; and 82% that ultrasound machine positioning was important. Factors that did not reach our 80% threshold for consensus were further discussed. Four categories were identified as being important when implementing ultrasound ergonomics for BoNT chemodenervation for spasticity; workstation, physician, patient and visual ergonomics. Optimizing ergonomics is paramount when performing US-guided BoNT chemodenervation for spasticity management. This includes proper preparation of. the workspace and allowing for sufficient pre-injection time to optimally position both the patient and the physician. Lack of awareness of ergonomics for US-guided BoNT chemodenervation for spasticity may lead to suboptimal patient outcomes, increase work-related injuries, and patient discomfort. We propose key elements for optimal positioning of physicians and patients, as well as the optimal setup of the workspace and provide clinical pearls in visual identification of spastic muscles for chemodenervation.","pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This study enhanced the LR-CDs production by Thermus filiformis amylomaltase (TfAM) enzyme by starch pretreatment using glycogen debranching enzyme from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgGDE). CgGDE pretreated tapioca starch gave LR-CD conversion of 31.2 ± 2.2%, compared with LR-CDs produced from non-treated tapioca starch (16.0 ± 2.4%). CgGDE pretreatment enhanced amylose content by approximately 30%. Notably, a shorter incubation time of 1 h is sufficient for CgGDE starch pretreatment to produce high LR-CD yield, compared with 6 h required for the commercial isoamylase. High-Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography coupled with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) and Gel Permeable Chromatography (GPC) revealed that CgGDE is more efficient than the commercial isoamylase in debranching tapioca starch and gave lower molecular weight products. In addition, lower amount of by-products (linear oligosaccharides) were detected in cyclization reaction when using CgGDE-pretreated starch. In conclusion, CgGDE is a highly effective enzyme to promote LR-CD synthesis from starch with a shorter incubation time than the commercial isoamylase.","genergyal, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

Demedicalisation of HIV interventions translates medical discourse and shifts the paradigm from a disease-focused to a people-centred approach. It also recognises real-life experiences of key populations in the HIV response by empowering them to voice their needs and be at the forefront of the epidemic control. We further categorise a demedicalisation approach into three frameworks: (1) the demystification of clinical or medical concerns; (2) the destigmatisation of people living with HIV; and (3) the decentralisation of healthcare serVICes. This article reviewed the demedicalisation framework by looking at the HIV intervention examples from countries in the Asia-Pacific, which included: (1) a study on drug-drug interaction between pre-exposure prophylaxis and feminising hormone treatment for transgender women; (2) the roles of key population-led health serVICes; and (3) certification of key population lay providers.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Deep learning approaches have been introduced in order to challenge the automatic sleep stage classification conundrum. However, the difficulties can be posed in replacing the clinicians with the automatic system due to the differences in many aspects found in individual bio-signals, causing the inconsistency in the performance of the model on every incoming individual. Thus, we aim to explore the feasibility of using a novel approach, capable of assisting the clinicians and lessening the workload. We propose the transfer learning framework, entitled MetaSleepLearner, based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge from a large dataset to new individual subjects (source code is available at https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/MetaSleepLearner). The framework was demonstrated to require the labelling of only a few sleep epochs by the clinicians and allow the remainder to be handled by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to understand the learning course of our approach. In all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of 5.4% to 17.7% improvement with statistical difference in the mean of both approaches. The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation to each subject also confirmed that the performance was directed towards reasonable learning. MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approaches as a result from the fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy subjects and patients. This is the first work that investigated a non-conventional pre-training method, MAML, resulting in a possibility for human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification and easing the burden of the clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather than an entire recording.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, medical, engineering, Health Professions","Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Health Information Management"

The power flow sensitivity analysis is utilized to construct power loss function for an optimization. The proposed method was tested on IEEE-33 bus systems with residential and commercial load profiles. Results showed that the proposed method can reduce power losses and DG curtailment for residential and commercial load profiles.

Herein, we conducted a case–control association study to determine whether global DNA methylation of Alu and LINE-1 transposable elements responsible for genomic stability and transcriptional regulation was correlated with clinical parameters indicating ATDILI in TB patients and might serve as an ATDILI biomarker. Alu and LINE-1 methylation levels in blood leukocyte of 130 TB patients (80 ATDILI cases and 50 non-ATDILI cases) and 100 healthy controls were quantified using quantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis. Both TB patients with and without ATDILI had significantly lower methylation levels of Alu and LINE-1 elements than healthy controls. Compared with non-ATDILI patients, Alu methylation levels were significantly decreased in ATDILI patients, commensurate with LINE-1 methylation analysis. Hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 measured within 1–7 days of TB treatment was independently associated with raised levels of serum aminotransferases assessed within 8–60 days of TB treatment. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis uncovered that Alu and LINE-1 methylation levels were both more sensitive and specific for differentiating ATDILI cases from non-ATDILI cases than serum aminotransferases after starting TB treatment within 1–7 days. Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed a significant association between hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 elements and an increased rate of ATDILI occurrence in TB patients. Collectively, global DNA hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 elements would reflect ATDILI progression and might serve as novel sensitive and specific ATDILI biomarkers.","Immunology, medical, pharmacology","Parasitology, Epidemiology, Microbiology, Immunology, Drug Discovery, Virology, Infectious Diseases"

The central nervous system (CNS) is a likely reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), vulnerable to viral rebound, inflammation, and clinical changes upon stopping antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is critical to evaluate the CNS safety of studies using analytic treatment interruption (ATI) to assess HIV remission. Methods. Thirty participants who started ART during acute HIV infection underwent CNS assessments across 4 ATI remission trials. ART resumption occurred with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL. CNS measures included paired pre- vs post-ATI measures of mood, cognitive performance, and neurologic examination, with elective cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results. Median participant age was 30 years old and 29/30 were male. Participants’ median time on ART before ATI was 3 years, and ATI lasted a median of 35 days. Post-ATI, there were no differences in median mood scores or neurologic findings and cognitive performance improved modestly. During ATI, a low level of CSF HIV-1 RNA was detectable in 6 of 20 participants with plasma viremia, with no group changes in CSF immune activation markers or brain DTI measures. Mild worsening was identified in post-ATI basal ganglia total choline MRS, suggesting an alteration in neuronal membranes. Conclusion. No adverse CNS effects were observed with brief, closely monitored ATI in participants with acutely treated HIV, except an MRS alteration in basal ganglia choline. Further studies are needed to assess CNS ATI safety in HIV remission trials, particularly for studies using higher thresholds to restart ART and longer ATI durations.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Results: Between September 2016 and June 2018, 707 children weighing ≥14 kg were enrolled; including 311 ART-naïve children and 396 children starting second-line. 47% of children were enrolled in Uganda, 21% Zimbabwe, 20% South Africa, 9% Thailand, 4% Europe. 362 (51%) participants were male; median age [range] at enrolment was 12.2 years [2.9–18.0]. 82 (12%) children weighed 14 to < 20 kg, 135 (19%) 20 to < 25 kg, 206 (29%) 25 to < 35 kg, 284 (40%) ≥35 kg. 128 (18%) had WHO stage 3 and 60 (8%) WHO stage 4 disease. Challenges encountered include: (i) running the trial across high- to low-income countries with differing frequencies of standard-of-care viral load monitoring; (ii) evaluating pragmatic DTG dosing in PK sub-studies alongside FDA- and EMA-approved dosing and subsequently transitioning participants to new recommended doses; (iii) delays in dosing information for children weighing 3 to < 14 kg and rapid recruitment of ART-naïve older/heavier children, which led to capping recruitment of participants weighing ≥35 kg in ODYSSEY A and extending recruitment (above 700) to allow for ≥60 additional children weighing between 3 to < 14 kg with associated PK; (iv) a safety alert associated with DTG use during pregnancy, which required a review of the safety plan for adolescent girls. Conclusions: By employing a basket design, to include ART-naïve and -experienced children, and nested PK sub-studies, the ODYSSEY trial efficiently evaluates multiple scientific questions regarding dosing and effectiveness of DTG-based ART in children.

Enhanced routing algorithm based on reinforcement machine learning—a case of voip service,"Militani D.R., de Moraes H.P., Rosa R.L., Wuttisittikulkij L., Ramirez M.A., Rodriguez D.Z.",2021-01-02,"Additional control, Communication quality, Conventional routing, Degree of mobility, Dynamic adjustment, Network parameters, Performance comparison, Reinforcement learning techniques, Intelligent routing, Machine learning, QoE, Reinforcement learning, Routing algorithms, VoIP","The routing algorithm is one of the main factors that directly impact on network perfor-mance. However, conventional routing algorithms do not consider the network data history, for instances, overloaded paths or equipment faults. It is expected that routing algorithms based on machine learning present advantages using that network data. Nevertheless, in a routing algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) technique, additional control message headers could be re-quired. In this context, this research presents an enhanced routing protocol based on RL, named e-RLRP, in which the overhead is reduced. Specifically, a dynamic adjustment in the Hello message interval is implemented to compensate the overhead generated by the use of RL. Different network scenarios with variable number of nodes, routes, traffic flows and degree of mobility are implemented, in which network parameters, such as packet loss, delay, throughput and overhead are obtained. Additionally, a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication scenario is implemented, in which the E-model algorithm is used to predict the communication quality. For performance comparison, the OLSR, BATMAN and RLRP protocols are used. Experimental results show that the e-RLRP reduces network overhead compared to RLRP, and overcomes in most cases all of these protocols, considering both network parameters and VoIP quality.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
The role of corporate social responsibility and corporate image in times of crisis: The mediating role of customer trust,"Chen C.-C., Khan A., Hongsuchon T., Ruangkanjanases A., Chen Y.-T., Sivarak O., Chen S.-C.",2021-08-02,"Morals, Organizations, Social Responsibility, Surveys and Questionnaires, Trust, Corporate image, Corporate social responsibility, Customer trust, Emerging economy, Mediation, Multi-dimensional CSR, Smart PLS, Times of crisis","The purpose of this research is to empirically examine relationships between a multi-dimensional set of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, numerous dimensions of customer trust, and corporate image in an emerging economy. It also analyzes the mediating effect of customer trust on the relationship between CSR and corporate image. This study focuses on two of the most well-known hotel chains situated in Pakistan. Close-ended, self-administered questionnaires were circulated amongst a total of 300 hotel customers. The research data was analyzed using a partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) model. The results revealed that economic, legal, and ethical CSR significantly impacted corporate image, while philanthropic CSR did not affect the corporate image. However, economic, legal, and philanthropic CSRs were found to be in a significant relationship with customer trust, while ethical CSR was not in a significant relationship with customer trust. Finally, customer trust fully mediated the relationship between economic and legal CSR with corporate image, whereas it partially mediated the relationship between ethical and philanthropic CSR. This study is unique from earlier CSR research based on an assessment of the connection between CSR dimensions and corporate image to examine customers’ trust in an emerging economy, especially in times of crisis.","genergyal, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
"In schizophrenia, non-remitters and partial remitters to treatment with antipsychotics are qualitatively distinct classes with respect to neurocognitive deficits and neuro-immune biomarkers: results of soft independent modeling of class analogy","Al-Hakeim H.K., Mousa R.F., Al-Dujaili A.H., Maes M.",2021-06-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Antipsychotic Agents, Biomarkers, Cognition, Cytokines, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuropsychological Tests, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, Young Adult, Biomarkers, Fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms, Inflammation, Major depression, Neuroimmunomodulation, Schizophrenia","Around one third of schizophrenia patients are non-responders to antipsychotic therapy. The present study aimed to delineate the pathway-phenotypes of non-remitters (NRTT) and partial remitters (PRTT) to treatment with antipsychotics as defined using the Global Clinical Impression scales. We recruited 60 NRTT, 50 PRTT and 43 healthy controls and measured schizophrenia symptoms, neurocognitive tests, plasma CCL11, interleukin-(IL)-6, IL-10, Dickkopf protein 1 (DKK1), high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), κ- and μ-opioid receptors (KOR and MOR, respectively), endomorphin-2 (EM-2), and β-endorphin. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) showed that NRTT and PRTT are significantly discriminated with a cross-validated accuracy of 94.7% and are qualitatively distinct classes using symptomatome, and neuro-immune-opioid-cognitome (NIOC) features as modeling variables. Moreover, a NIOC pathway phenotype discriminated PRTT from healthy controls with an accuracy of 100% indicating that PRTT and controls are two qualitative distinct classes. Using NIOC features as discriminatory variables in SIMCA showed that all PRTT were rejected as belonging to the normal control class and authenticated as belonging to their target class. In conclusion, a non-response to treatment can best be profiled using a SIMCA model constructed using symptomatome and NIOC features. A partial response should be delineated using SIMCA by authenticating patients as controls or PRTT instead of using scale-derived cut-off values or a number of scale items being rated mild or better. The results show that PRTT is characterized by an active NIOC pathway phenotype and that both NRTT and PRTT should be treated by targeting neuro-immune and opioid pathways.","neuroscienceoscience; pharmacologymacology of the central nervous system; antipsychologyhotics, biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Here, the renal ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) was performed in Fc gamma receptor 2b deficient (Fcgr2b-/-) lupus mice and the in vitro experiments. At 24 h post-renal I/R injury, NETs in peripheral blood neutrophils and in kidneys were detected using myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), as well as kidney apoptosis (activating caspase-3), which were prominent in Fcgr2b-/- mice more compared to wild-type (WT). After 120 h renal-I/R injury, renal NETs (using MPO and NE) were non-detectable, whereas glomerular immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition and serum anti-dsDNA were increased in Fcgr2b-/- mice. These results imply that renal NETs at 24 h post-renal I/R exacerbated the lupus nephritis at 120 h post-renal I/R injury in Fcgr2b-/- lupus mice. Furthermore, a Syk inhibitor attenuated NETs, that activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; a NETs activator) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a potent inflammatory stimulator), more prominently in Fcgr2b-/- neutrophils than the WT cells as determined by dsDNA, PAD4 and MPO. In addition, the inhibitors against Syk and PAD4 attenuated lupus characteristics (serum creatinine, proteinuria, and anti-dsDNA) in Fcgr2b-/- mice at 120 h post-renal I/R injury. In conclusion, renal I/R in Fcgr2b-/- mice induced lupus exacerbation at 120 h post-I/R injury partly because Syk-enhanced renal NETs led to apoptosis-induced anti-dsDNA, which was attenuated by a Syk inhibitor.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The electric field moves aqueous drops into contact and helps the coalescence of the aqueous phase. However, an excessively high electric field may result in partial or non-coalescence, reducing the efficiency of the process. In this work, we did an experiment to observe the coalescence of a charged drop under an applied electric field. The drop is charged and injected from a needle tip to merge with water at a planar interface, which is located below the tip. The results demonstrate that the aqueous drop can coalesce with the water plane with the electric field below 4.2 kV/cm. With increasing the electric field from a low value, the acceleration of the drop is enhanced, and the coalescence with the water plane becomes faster. When the electric field is increased to 4.2 kV/cm, the non-coalescence between the charged drop and the water plane occurs. Further increase in the field leads to the disintegration of the drop before the coalescence.","fluid mechanics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffractometer are used to study the surface morphology and texture of the zinc deposits, respectively. Uniform and compact coatings with a dominant (110) texture are obtained for all of the bath formulations. Nevertheless, significant differences in surface morphology and relative preferences for the (110) and (100) planes were found to result from the concentrations of zinc and sodium hydroxide in the bath. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization scan were used to evaluate the corrosion resistance. The coatings with a moderate Zn (8 g/L to 11 g/L) and controlled NaOH (120 g/L) contents show good corrosion resistance, with the corrosion current and corrosion rate being the lowest at 8 g/L of Zn and 120 g/L of NaOH. The ratios of texture coefficient, morphology, and compressive residual stress from different bath composition contribute to the corrosion-resistant property. The findings from this work should provide useful information regarding electrogalvanized zinc coatings with enhanced corrosion resistance.","corrosion, chemistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

NO has been shown to attenuate airway inflammation and enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids in the animal model of asthma. Here, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of inhaled sodium nitrite as add-on therapy with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in adult patients with persistent asthma. Methods: In protocol 1, 10 asthmatic patients were administered a single dose of nebulized 15-mg sodium nitrite to assess safety, effect on lung function, and pharmacokinetics of nitrite within 120 min. In protocol 2, 20 patients were randomly assigned to a nitrite (15 mg twice daily) group or a placebo group to assess the efficacy over 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). The secondary outcomes were other lung function parameters, unplanned asthma-related visits at the emergency department (ED) or outpatient department (OPD), admission days, asthma control test (ACT), and safety. Results: Nebulized sodium nitrite had neither acute adverse effect nor effect on lung function test within 120 min. No blood pressure change was seen. At week 12, FEV1 increased in the nitrite group, whereas there was no change in the placebo group. There were 5 events of asthma exacerbation, 4 ED visits, and one unplanned OPD visit in the placebo group, but none of these was noted in the nitrite group. There was no change in ACT scores in both groups. No adverse event was reported during 12 weeks in the nitrite group. There was no change in methemoglobin levels and sputum inflammatory markers. Conclusion: From our pilot trial, nebulized sodium nitrite is safe in asthmatic patients, and shows the potential to reduce asthma exacerbation compared with placebo.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

The use of different values of tube voltage for imaging, and the appropriate settings of the ATCM system, were evaluated. The custom-made phantom consisted of three sections of different sizes with inserts of various materials. It was scanned using tube potentials of 80-140 kV and different image quality ATCM settings. CTDIvol and image quality in terms of noise, contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for air, polyethylene (PE), acrylic, polyoxymethylene (POM) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) were analysed. A figure of merit (FOM) was estimated by combining CNR and CTDIvol. CTDIvol values were similar for all values of tube voltage and individual image quality ATCM settings when tube current was not restricted by the maximum value. The contrasts were independent of ATCM image quality setting, but CNR increased at the higher image quality level as image noise decreased. Both contrast and CNR decreased with increasing tube voltage for PVC and PE, but increased for POM and acrylic. PVC was the only insert material for which there was a significant improvement in contrast at lower tube potentials. FOM indicated that standard (SD = 10) and low dose (SD = 12.5) ATCM settings might be appropriate. The optimum tube voltage settings for imaging the PVC was 80-100 kV, but not for the lower contrast POM and acrylic, for which the standard tube voltage setting of 120 kV was better. The tube potential should be carefully set to gain radiological protection optimisation and keep the radiation dose as low as possible. Results indicate that 100 kV is likely to be appropriate for imaging small and medium-sized Thai patients when iodine contrast is used.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, medical","Waste Management and Disposal, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In this context, this article proposes a quality monitoring system, named Q-Meter, whose main objective is to improve subscriber complaint detection about telecommunication services using online-social-networks (OSNs). The complaint is detected by sentiment analysis performed by a deep learning algorithm, and the subscriber’s geographical location is extracted to evaluate the signal strength. The regions in which users posted a complaint in OSN are analyzed using a freeware application, which uses the radio base station (RBS) information provided by an open database. Experimental results demonstrated that sentiment analysis based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-recurrent neural network (RNN) with the soft-root-sign (SRS) activation function presented a precision of 97% for weak signal topic classification. Additionally, the results showed that 78.3% of the total number of complaints are related to weak coverage, and 92% of these regions were proved that have coverage problems considering a specific cellular operator. Moreover, a Q-Meter is low cost and easy to integrate into current and next-generation cellular networks, and it will be useful in sensing and monitoring tasks.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Methods: Patient characteristics, antibiotic treatment, microbiology, and 30-day all-cause outcome from children <18 years with blood-culture-confirmed bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) were collected anonymously using REDCap™ through the Global Antibiotic Prescribing and Resistance in Neonates and Children network from February 2016 to February 2017. Concordance of early empiric antibiotic treatment was determined using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing interpretive guidelines. The relationship between concordance of empiric regimen and 30-day mortality was investigated using multivariable regression. Results: Four hundred fifty-two children with blood-culture-positive BSI receiving early empiric antibiotics were reported by 25 hospitals in 19 countries. Sixty percent (273/452) were under the age of 2 years. S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. were the most common isolates, and there were 158 unique empiric regimens prescribed. Fifteen percent (69/452) of patients received a discordant regimen, and 7.7% (35/452) died. Six percent (23/383) of patients with concordant regimen died compared with 17.4% (12/69) of patients with discordant regimen. Adjusting for age, sex, presence of comorbidity, unit type, hospital-acquired infections, and Gram stain, the odds of 30-day mortality were 2.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-7.0; P = 0.015) for patients receiving discordant early empiric antibiotics. Conclusions: Odds of mortality in confirmed pediatric BSI are nearly 3-fold higher for patients receiving a discordant early empiric antibiotic regimen.

The simulated results revealed that scandenin preferentially located within all the studied βCDs nanocavities by inserting its hydroxyphenyl ring and pyran terminal close to the narrow and wider rims (conf-A), respectively. In another feasible orientation (conf-B), the guest substance was deeply included into the lipophilic cavity of only 6-HPβCD and 2,6-DMβCD, but not in the other cyclodextrins. The favored inclusion formation of scandenin/2,6-DHPβCD occurred when the guest interpolated its hydroxyphenyl terminal into CD hydrophobic interior. Binding free energy calculation based on the MM-PBSA approach indicated that the modified βCDs (except for 2,6-DHPβCD) showed the stronger binding affinity to scandenin than did the parent host molecule. The results could help in selecting suitable βCD derivatives to enhance the stability of such guest molecules prior to in vitro testing.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

A range of diseases are characterized by elevated IFN-I, including systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). The DNA-activated cGAS-STING pathway is a major IFN-I-inducing pathway, and activation of signaling is dependent on trafficking of STING from the ER to the Golgi. Methods: Here we used cell culture systems, a mouse lupus model, and material from lupus patients, to explore the mode of action of a STING antagonistic peptide, and its ability to modulate disease processes. Findings: We report that the peptide ISD017 selectively inhibits all known down-stream activities of STING, including IFN-I, inflammatory cytokines, autophagy, and apoptosis. ISD017 blocks the essential trafficking of STING from the ER to Golgi through a mechanism dependent on the STING ER retention factor STIM1. Importantly, ISD017 blocks STING activity in vivo and ameliorates disease development in a mouse model for lupus. Finally, ISD017 treatment blocks pathological cytokine responses in cells from lupus patients with elevated IFN-I levels.

A novel conceptual framework with different solar radiation indexes was developed to investigate and evaluate the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) energy production by comparing predicted and actual results for energy acquired from the reference project. The trend of potential energy production was predicted from solar radiation data as the basis for further calculations to evaluate PV system efficiency through a techno-economic analysis of project development. A mathematical model was developed to predict the obtained electrical energy by considering the suitable location-specific solar radiation indexes including direct normal radiation, All-Sky insolation incident on a horizontal surface, direct normal irradiation and global horizontal irradiance. The developed model was tested with three existing Smart City projects at various locations in Thailand. The All-Sky index was determined as the most suitable option to evaluate new PV development projects. Highest energy production from the PV projects occurred in March and April. Energy production efficiencies of the PV systems were estimated in the range of 3.97–4.32 kWh/kWp. The techno-economic analysis suggested that the PV project had an internal rate of return of 14.30–15.75% and payback period of 6.18–6.74 years. The proposed conceptual framework was a promising tool for decision-making regarding Smart City PV projects.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"
"Contrasting coral community structures between natural and artificial substrates at Koh Tao, Gulf of Thailand","Monchanin C., Mehrotra R., Haskin E., Scott C.M., Urgell Plaza P., Allchurch A., Arnold S., Magson K., Hoeksema B.W.",2021-12-01,"Artificial reefs, Artificial substrates, Community structures, Coral community, Coral reef, Gulf of Thailand, Natural substrates, Recruitment, Spawnings, Thailand, Animals, Anthozoa, Coral Reefs, Thailand, Artificial reef, Coral reef, Recruitment, Spawning","Concrete cubic frames and decommissioned steel naval vessels have been deployed in Thailand liberally to act as artificial substrates for coral restoration and marine recreation. We assessed recruitment at such substrate types at Koh Tao, Gulf of Thailand, and compared the community structure of scleractinian corals between artificial substrates and nearby natural reefs. Our results from a sample of 2677 recruits from nine sites highlighted significant differences in community structure between both reef types. Investigations of variables including time since deployment, distance from the natural reef, and seafloor depth revealed only the latter as a possible influencing factor. The diversity of recruits could not be explained by dynamics in coral spawning, and were found to represent groups with lower structural complexity. Our results suggest that coral community structure on artificial and natural reefs differs and supports distinct ecological and functional roles.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; ecology of communities/ecosystems; community/ecosystem structure, geology, fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"
Effect of 5-HT2C receptor gene polymorphism (HTR2C−759C/T) on metabolic adverse effects in Thai psychiatric patients treated with risperidone,"Vanwong N., Puangpetch A., Unaharassamee W., Jiratjintana N., Na Nakorn C., Hongkaew Y., Sukasem C.",2021-06-01,"Cross-Sectional Studies, Humans, Polymorphism, Genetic, Prospective Studies, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C, Risperidone, Schizophrenia, Thailand, -759C/T, HTR2C, hypertension, metabolic adverse effects, risperidone","Background: The use of Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) is related to metabolic disturbances, which put psychiatric patients at risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence is emerging of genetic risk factors. The HTR2C gene is an essential candidate in pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects. Nevertheless, there were inconsistent results among studies. Objective: To investigate the relationship between -759C/T, functional polymorphism of the HTR2C gene and metabolic adverse effects in Thai psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy. Method: In this cross-sectional study, 108 psychiatric patients treated with risperidone monotherapy for ≥3 months were recruited. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests were obtained upon enrollment and history of treatment was reviewed from medical records. Weight gain was defined as an increase ≥7% of baseline weight. Metabolic syndrome was evaluated according to the 2005 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Asia criteria. The -759C/T, polymorphism was genotyped. The associations between -759C/T polymorphism and metabolic side effects were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used for determining potential confounders. Results: Neither weight gain nor metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with −759C/T allelic and genotype variants of HTR2C. However, T allele of -759C/T polymorphism significantly associated with the hypertension. This association was not affected by possible confounding factors such as gender, risperidone dose, duration of treatment and family history of hypertension. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that psychiatric patients with T allele of -759C/T polymorphism may be at higher risk for hypertension. Further study with prospective design with larger patient groups are needed.",medical,"Epidemiology, Pharmacology (medical)"

The present study is intended to harvest 2D skin from Bombyx mori cocoons and collagen type I with chicken endothelial cell culture for alleviating skin diseases like cancer. The Artificial 2D Skin is fabricated by seeding the endothelial cell, fibroblast and keratinocytes embedded in the silk sponge for 21 days, which results in a 2D skin. The fabricated 2D skin scaffold is subjected to material characterization and evaluated by UV absorption, FTIR, FESEM, swelling index, enzymatic degradation and antibacterial activity. The UV absorbance of sericin, fibroin and collagen are found at 215–240, 260−290 and 300 nm respectively. The results of FT-IR spectrum confirms the presence of proteinaceous substances. Moreover,FESEM shows a high degree of viable epidermis formation. The swelling index and enzymatic degradation is found as 30 %, 26.5 % respectively. The cell viabilitytest performed on different pus-forming bacteria which exhibited antibacterial property significantly at p<0.001.

However, plastic waste comes in different types such as thermoplastic or thermoset, which results in varied properties of polymer modified asphalt (PMA). In this work, four thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) were prepared using different peroxide concentrations to produce four formulations of gel content (with varying extent of crosslinked part) in order to imitate the variation of plastic waste. All four TPVs were then mixed with asphalt at 5 wt% thus producing four formulations of PMA, which went through physical, rheological, and storage stability assessments. PMA with higher gel content possessed lower penetration and higher softening temperature, indicating physically harder appearance of PMA. Superpave parameters remained unchanged among different gel content PMA at temperatures of 64, 70, and 76◦ C. PMA with any level of gel content had lower Brookfield viscosity than PMA without gel content at a temperature of 135◦ C. Higher gel content resulted in shorter storage stability measured with greater different softening temperatures between top and bottom layers of PMA after 5 days of 163◦ C storage. This study shows that asphalt with thermoset plastic waste is harder and easier to pave, thus making the non-recycling thermoset plastic waste more useful and friendly to the environment.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Modulations of the reduction potentials of flavin-based electron bifurcation complexes and semiquinone stabilities are key to control directional electron flow,"Sucharitakul J., Buttranon S., Wongnate T., Chowdhury N.P., Prongjit M., Buckel W., Chaiyen P.",2021-02-01,"Acidaminococcus, Acyl Coenzyme A, Bacterial Proteins, Benzoquinones, Butyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Electron Transport, Electron-Transferring Flavoproteins, Electrons, Ferredoxins, Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide, Flavins, Models, Biological, Oxidation-Reduction, Protein Binding, Spectrophotometry, butyryl-CoA, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, electron transfer flavoprotein, ferredoxin, flavin, flavin-based electron bifurcation, redox modulation","The flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) system from Acidaminococcus fermentans is composed of the electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd). α-FAD binds to domain II of the A-subunit of EtfAB, β-FAD to the B-subunit of EtfAB and δ-FAD to Bcd. NADH reduces β-FAD to β-FADH−, which bifurcates one electron to the high potential α-FAD•− semiquinone followed by the other to the low potential ferredoxin (Fd). As deduced from crystal structures, upon interaction of EtfAB with Bcd, the formed α-FADH− approaches δ-FAD by rotation of domain II, yielding δ-FAD•−. Repetition of this process leads to a second reduced ferredoxin (Fd−) and δ-FADH−, which reduces crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. In this study, we measured the redox properties of the components EtfAB, EtfaB (Etf without α-FAD), Bcd, and Fd, as well as of the complexes EtfaB:Bcd, EtfAB:Bcd, EtfaB:Fd, and EftAB:Fd. In agreement with the structural studies, we have shown for the first time that the interaction of EtfAB with Bcd drastically decreases the midpoint reduction potential of α-FAD to be within the same range of that of β-FAD and to destabilize the semiquinone of α-FAD. This finding clearly explains that these interactions facilitate the passing of electrons from β-FADH− via α-FAD•− to the final electron acceptor δ-FAD•− on Bcd. The interactions modulate the semiquinone stability of δ-FAD in an opposite way by having a greater semiquinone stability than in free Bcd.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial metabolism and physicsiology; microbial energygetics, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

Thai data on its characteristics and outcomes have never been systematically reported, to our knowledge. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features and outcomes of Thai patients with AML. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective observational study of nine academic hospitals. Patients with newly diagnosed AML were invited to register online. Results: A total of 679 patients with AML were included. The presence of circulating peripheral blood blasts was correlated with a high white blood cell count. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) had predominantly lower white blood cell counts and higher proportions without peripheral blood blasts compared with non-APL AML. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was commonly presented in APL (37.7%). Splenomegaly and normal platelet count were more frequently seen in patients with Philadelphia chromosome–positive AML. The median follow-up time for those who survived more than 1 year was 28.0 months. One-year overall survival rates for non-APL AML and APL were 31.9% and 88.2%, respectively; 2-year overall survival rates were 29.6% and 88.2%, respectively. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could improve survival in non-APL AML. Conclusion: APL should be considered despite absence of peripheral blood blast. This study demonstrates poor outcome of Thai AML and more research to improve outcomes are underway. Expanding access to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered in Thailand.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Oncology, Cancer Research"

Methods: We tested for interleukin-6 (IL-6) -producing T cells in IPFPs of patients with knee OA using ELISPOT. Cytokine and cytotoxic mediator production from OA PBMCs, IPFPs, synovial tissues, and synovial fluids in response to proteoglycan aggrecan peptides were quantified by cytometric bead array. Patterns of cytokine and cytotoxic mediator production were analyzed and compared. Results: T cells from IPFPs elicited strong responses towards the p263-280 peptide by secreting IL-6. In addition, there was a trend that the p263-280 peptide stimulated higher production of cytokines/cytotoxic mediators than other proteoglycan aggrecan peptides, although this was not statistically significant. In patients with knee OA, a group of cytotoxic mediators (sFas, perforin, granzyme A, and granulysin) and IL-6 were detectable at high levels from the synovial fluid. In addition, inflammation in patients with knee OA was more pronounced in joint-surrounding tissues than levels in circulating peripheral blood. Conclusion: Our data suggest that T cells responding to the p263-280 peptide contribute to the secretion of various soluble mediators that are found within the synovial fluid.

The influences of nonlinear (second-order approximation) geometry are realistically incorporated using an AISC 2010 direct analysis method. The optimization minimizes the total weight of structures subjected to the challenges associated with the simultaneous presence of nonlinear design formulations and discrete design variables realistically considering the availability of standard steel sections. This leads to a non-convex and/or non-smooth optimization program. The ESO algorithm overcomes the problem by performing iterative elimination procedures of ineffective sections, where the feasible design domain progressively converges to the minimum distribution of steel members satisfying limit state (ultimate strength and serviceability) criteria. The ESO design process is encoded within a visual basis application (VBA) framework having a direct interface with the commercial analysis and design software, called SAP2000. An illustrative example motivated by practical engineering applications has been successfully proceeded and hence highlighted robustness of the proposed approach in obtaining the optimal design of steel structures under applied forces.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

Carbon emission reduction can be achieved through carbon capture and replacement technologies. Microalgae and ammonia (NH3) have been known to be carbon capture and carbon replacement option, respectively. This paper examines the inter-relationship between these two candidates with carbon reduction potential: microalgae and ammonia, and their future perspectives. Firstly, impact of ammonia presence in natural habitat of microalgae is identified, from the aspect of microalgal growth characteristic, photosynthetic performance, and biochemical composition. Possible solutions of ammonia removal in aquatic system include biotreatment with microalgae, nitrification–denitrification with bacteria, ion exchange using zeolites, and membrane contactor technologies. Next, with ammonia being identified as potential future energy source, conventional ammonia production, as well as bio-ammonia production are discussed. Microalgae technology used to produce syngas through pyrolysis and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) are reviewed and is identified to produce ammonia to achieve carbon emission reduction target. Finally, the challenges and impacts of bio-ammonia production using microalgae are highlighted. The main factors determining the sustainability of microalgae-based technology are energy demand, environmental impacts, and production cost, with each having challenges to varied extent. Governmental policies that drive the development in this field are also discussed. However, further research on the impact on environment and energy consumption need to be thoroughly carried out, to enable clear improvement over current usage of fossil fuel.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Recent accumulated data revealed the dysregulation of various microRNAs (miRNAs) in several diseases including psoriasis. Objective: We explored the functional role and regulation of hsa-miR-155-5p (miR-155) in an immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), in relation to the pathogenesis and treatment of psoriasis. Methods: miR-155 expression in normal skin and psoriatic skin lesion before and after treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB-UVB) were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Apoptotic activity, cell cycle and viable cells of miR-155 transfected HaCaT were measured using flow cytometry and MTS assay. Since, caspase-3 (CASP3) gene was predicted as a target gene of miR-155, the expression of CASP3 was detected in transfected HaCaT using western blot. Results: We discovered that both MTX and NB-UVB significantly down-regulated miR-155 expression in psoriatic skin lesions. We also found that overexpression of miR-155 in HaCaT led to suppression of cell apoptosis and induced cell arrest at G0/G1 phase. Moreover, CASP3 expression was down-regulated in miR-155 transfected HaCaT. Conclusion: This study demonstrates down-regulation of miR155 after treatment with MTX and NB-UVB in psoriatic skin lesion. miR155 plays significant role in apoptosis on HaCaT via CASP3. This finding provides a better understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and might aid on developing the new monitoring tool or therapy for psoriasis in the future.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The role of trace elements, minerals, and the endogenous opioid system (EOS) in UA are less well established. Methods: We measured lipid, insulin resistance (IR), and immune, trace element (copper and zinc), mineral (magnesium, calcium), EOS (β-endorphin and mu-opioid receptor (MOR)) and antioxidant (vitamin D3) biomarkers in patients with ATS (n = 60) and UA (n = 60) and healthy controls (n = 58). Results: ATS patients showed increased atherogenic and IR indices, IL-6, IL-10, β-endorphin, copper and magnesium, and lower zinc than healthy controls. Logistic regression showed that UA was significantly discriminated from ATS without UA with an accuracy of 85.5 % using calcium, IL-10, β-endorphin, MOR, triglycerides, IR (all positively), and copper and vitamin D3 (inversely). Neural networks showed that UA was discriminated from ATS without UA with an area under the ROC curve of 0.942 using MOR, β-endorphin, calcium, insulin resistance, vitamin D3 and copper as input variables. We found that 50.0 % of the variance in IR was explained by the regression on copper, IL-10, IL-6 (all positively), and zinc (inversely), while 32.9 % of the variance in the atherogenic index of plasma was explained by copper, IL-10 (both positively), and magnesium (inversely). Conclusion: UA is not only mediated by insulin resistance, atherogenicity, and immune disorders, but also by aberrations in the endogenous opioid system and trace elements as well as lowered antioxidant levels. Copper appears to play a key role in IR and atherogenicity.","biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Inorganic Chemistry"

The modification enabled the materials to be strongly adsorbed onto polyethersulfone (PES) membranes without requiring prior exfoliation. This was in strong contrast to MoS2 itself. Spectroscopic characterisation indicated adhesion was through strong hydrophobic π-π* stacking and electrostatic interactions between PTCA and PES. Modification of the PES resulted in an increased hydrophilic character, as evidenced by a decreasing contact angle (78° unmodified, 40° – 50° modified) and an increase in water uptake (WU) from 12.8% to 17 – 27% (%WU = [(Ww / Wd) – 1] × 100%, where Ww and Wd refer to wet and dry membrane weights, respectively). When modifying PES using different MoS2-PTCA ratios, increasing the PTCA content decreased the permeate flux and pure water flux, while increasing the % removal of congo red, Hg(II), Cr(VI) and Pb(II) to approximately 80%. The potency of the membranes is ascribed to the formation of lamellar structures with increased hydrophilicity and the synergy between the disulfide linkage and absorptive capabilities of the MoS2.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The response to darbepoetin alfa could divide anemic CKD dogs into responder (RP) and non-responder (NRP) subgroups. The results from experiment I showed that packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma albumin concentration were significantly lower in CKD dogs of all stages while the total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was lower in only CKD stage 3 and 4 compared with dogs in CONT group. The PCV was related to both TIBC and albumin when considering among all dogs or only in CKD dogs. The hepcidin concentration in CKD dogs with anemia was lower than those without anemia (P<0.05). In experiment II before darbepoetin alfa treatment, RP subgroup had significantly higher iron and TIBC compared with NRP subgroup (P<0.05), the iron concentration was decreased only in RP subgroup after darbepoetin alfa treatment (P<0.05). The percent increase in PCV was correlated with initial TIBC (P<0.01).

Herein, we present final overall survival (OS) from HERITAGE. Methods: HERITAGE is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive trastuzumab-dkst or trastuzumab plus taxane followed by continued monotherapy until disease progression. Overall survival was to be assessed at 36 months or after 240 deaths, whichever occurred first, as observed from time of randomization of last patient. Results: At the final analysis (36 months), 242 patients in the intention-to-treat population had died during the study: 116 and 124 in the trastuzumab-dkst and trastuzumab groups, respectively, and 1 untreated patient from each treatment group. Median OS by Kaplan–Meier analysis was 35.0 months with trastuzumab-dkst and 30.2 months with trastuzumab. Evaluation of PFS showed a median of 11.1 months in both treatment groups. No new safety concerns were reported from week 48 until the end of the survival follow-up. Conclusion: This is the first phase 3 trial of a trastuzumab biosimilar to report long-term survival data similar to originator trastuzumab in patients with MBC. The comparable long-term OS between the trastuzumab-dkst and originator trastuzumab groups further supports the similarity of trastuzumab-dkst with originator trastuzumab and establishes trastuzumab-dkst as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC.

Super high-flux hemodialysis provides comparable effectiveness with high-volume postdilution online hemodiafiltration in removing protein-bound and middle-molecule uremic toxins: A prospective cross-over randomized controlled trial,"Thammathiwat T., Tiranathanagul K., Limjariyakul M., Chariyavilaskul P., Takkavatakarn K., Susantitaphong P., Meesangnin S., Wittayalertpanya S., Praditpornsilpa K., Eiam-Ong S.",2021-02-01,"Aged, Cross-Over Studies, Female, Hemodiafiltration, Humans, Kidney Failure, Chronic, Male, Prospective Studies, Renal Dialysis, Uremia, online hemodiafiltration, super high-flux hemodialysis, uremic toxins","Although high-volume postdilution online hemodiafiltration (ol-HDF) is superior to high-flux HD in removing all kinds of uremic toxins and improving survival, this treatment is not available in most HD centers. The present study was conducted to compare the effectiveness in removals of protein-bound (indoxyl sulfate [IS]), middle-molecule [beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and alpha-1 microglobulin (A1MG)], and small-molecule uremic toxins between super high-flux HD (SHF-HD), HD with a novel SHF dialyzer and high-volume postdilution ol-HDF in a noninferiority fashion. Fifteen prevalent HD patients were randomly allocated into two sequences of 12-week treatment periods of SHF-HD treatment and later high-volume postdilution ol-HDF period or vice versa. Each treatment period was divided by a wash-out phase of 4-week high-flux HD. Twelve of 15 patients could complete the study. When compared with high-volume postdilution ol-HDF (convective volume of 24.4 ± 3.52 L), SHF-HD provided comparable reduction ratio values of IS, B2M, and A1MG with mean difference of 5.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.63, 13.37), 1.98 (95% CI,-0.21, 4.18), and 22.96 (95% CI, -1.91, 47.83), respectively. The spKt/Vurea was not different. The predialysis levels of all uremic toxins at baseline and after 12-week treatment did not differ between both groups. Although albumin loss in dialysate in SHF-HD was greater than high-volume postdilution ol-HDF, the serum albumin levels after 12-week SHF-HD treatment were significantly higher than baseline. In conclusion, SHF-HD provides noninferior effectiveness to high-volume postdilution ol-HDF in removing various uremic toxins with significantly increased serum albumin levels despite higher albumin loss. SHF-HD might be an effectively alternative treatment when high-volume postdilution ol-HDF is not available.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"

Stable metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) based semiconductor photocatalytic systems have been mainly investigated for this purpose. Nevertheless, their large band gap (~3.2 eV) makes them inefficient in utilization of visible light portion of solar light leading to a lower degradation efficiency. Investigations have focused on the development of visible light responsive bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX; X = Cl, Br, I), one of the potential nanomaterials with unique layered structure, for efficient absorption of solar light for the degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers limits their practical applicability. To overcome such drawbacks, the development of BiOX based ternary nanocomposites received significant attention because of their unique structural and electronic properties, improved visible light response and increased separation and transfer rate of photogenerated charge carriers. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments on bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites for enhanced environmental pollutants decomposition under visible light irradiation. The principles of photocatalysis, synthetic methodologies of bismuth oxyhalides and their characteristics such as heterojunctions formation, improved visible light response and separation rate of charge carriers and the mechanisms for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity are discussed. In addition, the future prospects on the improvement in the photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites are also discussed. This review could be beneficial for designing new ternary nanocomposites with superior visible light photocatalytic efficiency.","genergyal, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of the GFs, a novel method is developed to modify the surface of GFs by decorating layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with Ni or NiO nanoparticles. For a comparative study, GFs treated with acid and heat are also prepared as porous electrodes of the VRFB. The performance of VRFBs with GFs treated with various methods and investigated the characteristics of these GFs. The results show that GFs decorated with LDH (including Ni and NiO nanoparticles) can improve the energy efficiency of the VRFB by 5% compared with acid- or heat-treated GFs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate that the improvement in the heat-treated graphite fibers’ wettability is due to a reduction in the O/C ratio and an increase in the C–O/C = O ratio on the graphite fibers. An H2 reduction treatment formed the metallic Ni on the LiAlO platelets. The calcination heat treatment in the air created NiO to improve the active surface area and therefore enhance the redox reaction.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

The aim of this study was to investigate the adherence to postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines among physicians in Asia. Methods: A survey study was performed in seven Asian countries. An email invitation with a link to the survey was sent to participants who were asked to complete the questionnaire consisting of eight clinical scenarios. Results: Of the 137 doctors invited, 123 (89.8%) provided valid responses. Approximately 50% of the participants adhered to the guidelines regardless of the risk of adenoma, except in the case of tubulovillous adenoma ≥10 mm combined with high-grade dysplasia, in which 35% of the participants adhered to the guidelines. The participants were stratified according to the number of colonoscopies performed: ≥20 colonoscopies per month (high volume group) and <20 colonoscopies per month (low volume group). Higher adherence to the postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines was evident in the high volume group (60%) than in the low volume group (25%). The reasons for nonadherence included concern of missed polyps (59%), the low cost of colonoscopy (26%), concern of incomplete resection (25%), and concern of medical liability (15%). Conclusions: A discrepancy between clinical practice and surveillance guidelines among physicians in Asia was found. Physicians in the low volume group frequently did not adhere to the guidelines, suggesting a need for continuing education and appropriate control.

In the elderly, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently coexists as an independent factor of bone loss. However, little is known about the skeletal changes in a combined condition of estrogen deficiency and T2DM. Herein, we performed ovariectomy (OVX) in nonobese Goto-Kakizaki (GK) T2DM rats to examine changes associated with calcium and phosphate metabolism and bone microstructures and strength. As expected, wild-type (WT) rats subjected to ovariectomy (OVX-WT) had low trabecular bone volume and serum calcium with increased dynamic histomorphometric and serum bone markers, consistent with the high turnover state. T2DM in GK rats also led to low trabecular volume and serum calcium. However, the dynamic histomorphometric markers of bone remodeling were unaffected in these GK rats, indicating the distinct mechanism of T2DM-induced bone loss. Interestingly, OVX-GK rats were found to have anomalous and unique changes in bone turnover-related parameters, i.e., decreased osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces with lower COOH-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen levels compared with OVX-WT rats. Furthermore, the levels of calciotropic hormones, i.e., parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)2D3, were significantly decreased in OVX-GK rats. Although the OVX-induced bone loss did not further worsen in GK rats, a three-point bending test indicated that OVX-GK bones exhibited a decrease in bone elasticity. In conclusion, T2DM and estrogen deficiency both led to microstructural bone loss, the appearance of which did not differ from each factor alone. Nevertheless, the combination worsened the integrity and suppressed the turnover, which might eventually result in adynamic bone disease.","genergyal, medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Physiology, Physiology (medical)"

The upregulated candidate genes were selected for validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, related plasma protein levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Three significantly upregulated genes, including high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2 (HMGN2), folate receptor gamma (FOLR3), and amphiregulin (AREG), were selected. In the first cohort, the results showed that only HMGN2 expression was significantly increased in OC patients. In the larger sample size, the overall results demonstrated that HMGN2 expression had a tendency to increase in both OC and OPC patients compared with HC. Interestingly, the plasma HMGN2 (HMG-17) protein level exhibited the same trend as that observed at the transcriptional level.

Widmanstätten FCC lamellae form from the allotriomorphic FCC precipitates at the B2 grain boundaries, leading to a lamellar microstructure, divided into two distinct sub-systems. Isothermal annealing further drives these individual sub-systems towards equilibrium via precipitation of ordered intermetallic phases. The transformation in FCC lamellae initiates by the formation of metastable L12 precipitates at shorter annealing times, which are eventually replaced by the equilibrium BCC and B2 phases, forming composite B2+BCC laths, on long term annealing. These results further exemplify that interesting transformation pathways lead to hierarchical microstructures within HEAs, and the fact that as processed conditions in these alloys are often far-from equilibrium.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys"

Senescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) facilitate fibrosis resolution, while senescence in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes acts as a potent mechanism driving liver fibrogenesis. In many clinical studies, telomeres and mitochondrial DNA contents, which are both aging biomarkers, were reportedly associated with a degree of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLDs); this highlights their potential as biomarkers for liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying multi-step progression of senescence may yield new therapeutic strategies for age-related chronic liver pathologies. Areas covered: This review examines the recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies on mechanisms of senescence in liver fibrogenesis and its involvement in liver fibrosis. A comprehensive literature search in electronic databases consisting of PubMed and Scopus from inception to 31 August 2021 was performed. Expert opinion: Cellular senescence has diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential in progressive liver complications, especially liver fibrosis. Stimulating or reinforcing the immune response against senescent cells may be a promising and forthright biotherapeutic strategy. This approach will need a deeper understanding of the immune system’s ability to eliminate senescent cells and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry"

Nitriding of spherical Ti powders (D50=130 µm and D50=63 µm) was carried out at different temperatures from 873 K to 1373 K for 10 min. The nitriding process enabled the manufacture of a core–shell-structured Ti-(N) powder, where an N-enriched shell surrounds a lower N core. The thickness of the N-rich Ti shell increases exponentially with increasing nitriding temperature. Depending on nitriding temperature, a shell layer consisting of Ti2N and TiN compounds can form. Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, it was identified that the N-rich shell is composed of (i) only Ti(N) solid solution when nitrided below 1023 K; and (ii) Ti(N) solid solution, Ti2N and TiN compounds if nitrided at or above 1023 K. The core–shell-structured Ti-(N) powders were subsequently used to manufacture bulk samples by spark plasma sintering (SPS) and laser metal deposition (LMD) processes for comparison. The microstructure was characterized and discussed. LMD-fabricated Ti-N alloy samples exhibited high tensile strength (965 MPa) with good tensile ductility (7.6%) due to the homogeneous distribution of N and fine grain size. In contrast, SPS-fabricated Ti-N alloy samples using the same nitrided Ti-N powder showed much lower tensile strength (708 MPa) with essentially no tensile ductility (0.3%) due to the inhomogeneous distribution of N. LMD can allow the fabrication of strong and ductile Ti-N alloys while it is not possible by SPS.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Mechanics of Materials"

The nanofibrous film was investigated and it was noted that the formation of resultant PVDF nanofibers was improved depending on an increase of the amount of the volatile solvent in the PVDF solution. The average diameters of the fibers in the electrospun films were 174–1150 nm. A large amount of volatile solvent was responsible for low dark spot and bead-free morphological observation. The mechanical properties of the fibers were strongly influenced by the morphology, uniformity and crystalline structure of the PVDF fibers. The α phase of the PVDF was eliminated especially when the volatile solvent was in a ratio of 4:6. The surface area and the porosity of the PVDF nanofibers were also improved. Moreover, the penetration was also studied and reported as the relationship between the water contact angle and time. Among the volatile solvents that were studied, DMF with MA and EA at a ratio of 4:6 was the best solvent that provided fine electrospun PVDF nanofibers and the maximum tensile strength of 15.7 ± 1.3 MPa for EA and elongation of 175.3 ± 4.4% for MA, high water contact angle, speedy penetration rate and a high fraction of β crystalline phase.

LS04 in municipal wastewater for biodiesel production and their deoiled biomass cellular extracts as biostimulants for Lactuca sativa growth improvement,"Silambarasan S., Logeswari P., Sivaramakrishnan R., Kamaraj B., Lan Chi N.T., Cornejo P.",2021-10-01,"Biodiesel production, Biostimulant, Cellular extracts, Cyanobacterium, Lettuce, Ls04, Municipal wastewaters, Nostoc sp., Nutrient removal, Paddy field waters, Biofuels, Biomass, Cell Extracts, Lettuce, Microalgae, Nostoc, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Waste Water, Biodiesel, Biostimulants, Lettuce, Municipal wastewater, Nostoc sp. LS04, Nutrients removal","In this study, seven different cyanobacteria (LS01-LS07) were isolated from paddy field water and among them, the isolate LS04 was able to grow well on municipal wastewater. The LS04 isolate was identified as Nostoc sp. (designated as Nostoc sp. LS04) based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strain LS04 grew well in 75% wastewater and had the greatest nutrients removal efficiency (81.02–95.17%). Strain LS04 obtained the higher biomass (1.31 ± 0.08 g L−1) and productivity of 131.33 ± 8.08 mg L−1 d−1. The lipid content and productivity of LS04 were 14.85 ± 0.86% (dry cell weight) and 19.46 ± 0.05 mg L−1 d−1, respectively. The high proportion of C16–C18 fatty acids found in the lipids of LS04 indicated the high suitability for biodiesel production. In addition, Nostoc sp. LS04 cellular extracts were potentially used as a biostimulant for Lactuca sativa cultivation. The foliar application of 60% LS04 cellular extracts showed the maximum shoot length, root length, fresh biomass, dry biomass, Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids in lettuce plants compared to control plants. Similarly, 60% of LS04 cellular extracts treatment improved the concentrations of macro and micronutrients, and biochemical compounds in the leaves. Therefore, these results reveal that the Nostoc sp. LS04 is a promising candidate for the nutrients removal from wastewater and their biomass is a potential resource for biodiesel production and biostimulant for sustainable crop production.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Evaluation of the greater occipital nerve location regarding its relation to intermastoid and external occipital protuberance to mastoid process lines,"Huanmanop T., Issara I., Agthong S., Chentanez V.",2021-09-07,"Female, Head, Humans, Male, Mastoid, Neck, Neck Muscles, Occipital Bone, External occipital protuberance, Greater occipital nerve, Localisation, Mastoid process, Piercing point, Semispinalis capitis muscle, Trapezius muscle","Background: Localisation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) is essential for the achievement of several procedures performed in the occipital region especially the treatment of occipital neuralgia. This study proposed to investigate the location of GON subcutaneous (Sc) and semispinalis capitis (SSC) piercing points related to the intermastoid and external occipital protuberance (EOP) to mastoid process (MP) lines. Materials and methods: The Sc piercing point, relation to SSC and obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscles of 100 GONs from 50 cadaveric heads (23 males, 27 females) were dissected. Distances from EOP to MP (EM line) on both sides and between MPs (MM line) were measured. Perpendicular lines from Sc and SSC piercing points to EM and MM lines were created and measured. Distances from EOP to the perpendicular lines of SSC piercing point and from MP to the perpendicular lines of Sc piercing point were measured and calculated into percentage of EM and MM length, respectively. Results: Three types of Sc piercing points (I, II and III) were obtained. The percentage of GON piercing trapezius muscle (TP) (type I), aponeurosis of TP (type II) and aponeurosis between TP and sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) (type III) were 2, 67 and 31, respectively. In addition, 95% of GON pierced SSC, 2% pierced its tendinous band and 3% travelled between its medial fibres and the nuchal ligament. 94% of the GON turned around the lower edge of the OCI, while 6% pierced the lower edge of this muscle. Sc piercing point was always located above the MM line, but it could be above, below or on the EM line. In contrast, all of the SSC piercing points were located below the EM line except in one specimen, but it could be above, below or on the MM line. Therefore, the MM and EM lines were used as reference lines for locating the Sc and SSC piercing points, respectively. The mean EM line length was 81.26 ± 5.26 mm with statistically significant differences between genders and sides in female. The mean MM line length was 121.77 ± 8.54 mm with a statistically significant difference between genders. Sc piercing point could be located at 44% of MM line length from ipsilateral MP with a mean vertical distance of 18 mm. No statistically significant difference was found between genders and sides in these parameters, but a statistically significant difference was found in the percentage of MB to MM line between type III and type I (p = 0.02). SSC piercing point of all types could be located at the point of 25% of EM line length from EOP with a vertical distance of 18 mm below EM line. No statistically significant difference was found between genders, sides and types of both piercing points. Conclusions: MM and EM lines are potential reference lines for locating the Sc and SSC piercing points of GON, respectively.","genergyal, medical","Anatomy, Histology"
"Modernizing Daily Function Assessment in Parkinson's Disease Using Capacity, Perception, and Performance Measures","Maetzler W., Rochester L., Bhidayasiri R., Espay A.J., Sanchez-Ferro A., van Uem J.M.T.",2021-01-01,"Activities of Daily Living, Disabled Persons, Humans, Parkinson Disease, Perception, Quality of Life, Surveys and Questionnaires, activities of daily living, digital technologies, ICF model, perception","Many disease symptoms restrict the quality of life of the affected. This usually occurs indirectly, at least in most neurological diseases. Here, impaired daily function is interposed between the symptoms and the reduced quality of life. This is reflected in the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health model published by the World Health Organization in 2001. This correlation between symptom, daily function, and quality of life makes it clear that to evaluate the success of a therapy and develop new therapies, daily function must also be evaluated as accurately as possible. However, daily function is a complex construct and therefore difficult to quantify. To date, daily function has been measured primarily by capacity (clinical assessments) and perception (surveys and patient-reported outcomes) assessment approaches. Now, daily function can be captured in a new dimension, that is, performance, through new digital technologies that can be used in the home environment of patients. This viewpoint discusses the differences and interdependencies of capacity, perception, and performance assessment types using the example of Parkinson's disease. Options regarding how future study protocols should be designed to get the most comprehensive and validated picture of daily function in patients are presented. © 2020 The Authors.

The SBA-15-supported nickel phosphide nanocatalysts were prepared with three different wt.% ratios of Ni/P: 10:2, 10:3, and 10:4. The Al-SBA-15 support was also used, where the wt.% ratio of Ni/P of 10:4 was applied for the preparation. The prepared nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM, TEM, and NH3-TPD, confirming the successful incorporation of nickel phosphide nanoparticles on (Al-)SBA-15 and the preservation of the hexagonal structure of the support after the modification processes. Notably, the characterization results also indicate that each catalyst contained different crystalline phases of nickel phosphide. The synthesized nanocatalysts were tested for their catalytic performance in the hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellobiose to produce sorbitol under the following conditions: 150 °C, 3 h, 4 MPa of H2. Three major products including glucose, sorbitol, and mannitol were obtained by all catalytic reactions. The proportions of these products, however, differed by the presence of different phases of nickel phosphide in each catalyst. The effect of reaction temperature and that of support materials on the catalytic performance are also studied.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Cast irons with varying C content from 1.73 to 2.34 mass% under 5 mass% of Cr, Mo, W, V each and 2 mass% Co were prepared. After annealing, the specimens were hardened from 1 323 K and 1 373 K austenitizing by fan air cooling. Hardened specimens (As-H) were tempered at three levels of temperatures which were at maximum tempered hardness (THTmax), lower and higher temperatures than that of THTmax (L-THTmax and H-THTmax, respectively). A rubber wheel wear tester was used to evaluate the abrasive wear resistance. It was found that the relationship between wear loss (Wl) and wear distance (Wd) was expressed by a linear function in every wear test. In each heat treatment condition, the wear rate (Rw, mg/m) value decreased as the C content rose. As-H specimens showed almost higher wear resistance than the tempered specimens. In the tempered state, the lowest Rw were mostly obtained in the THTmax specimens. The higher austenitizing temperature provided the lower Rw value. The best wear resistance was obtained in the As-H specimen with 2.34%C in the both austenitizing temperatures. The Rw was lowered roughly in proportion to an increase in hardness. However, the Rw values scattered broadly at the volume fraction of retained austenite (Vγ ) values lower than 10% and then, decreased gradually as the Vγ value rose, irrespective of austenitizing temperature.","lubrication, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

However, among young children, tooth brushing requires skill and motivation from caregivers and is not widely practised. To find a more effective way to train caregivers, Protection-Motivation Theory (PMT)-based educational programmes were compared with the basic one with regard to the incremental caries rate in children, caregiver's motivation and caregiver's awareness. Methods: In a quasi-experimental study, 9- to18-month-old children and their caregivers (N = 102) were allocated to PMT or control groups. The PMT group received PMT-based oral health education programme while the control group received public hospital's current one. Children's caries status and motivation and awareness among caregivers were measured. Mann-Whitney U test was used to find out the difference between control and test groups. Results: After 12 months, the PMT group showed lower dmft, dmfs and incremental caries rate compared with control. Chi-square test showed the control group was at more risk of developing additional dental caries (RR 2.23, 95% C.I.: 1.41–3.54, p < 0.001), and when early carious lesions were included (RR 2.40, 95% C.I.: 1.56–3.69, p < 0.001). In terms of motivation and awareness among caregivers, the PMT group rated their perception of disease severity and belief in self-efficacy significantly higher than the control group. Conclusions: PMT-based education programmes encourage suitable motivation and awareness that changes oral healthcare behaviour of caregivers, relating to decreased incremental caries rate in infants and toddlers comparing with regular health education methods.",dentistry,Dentistry (miscellaneous)

Results: Of 194,364 thyroid aspirates, 0.6% were pediatric cases (mean age, 15.0 years). Among 827 nodules with accessible follow-up, the resection rate and risk of malignancy (ROM) were 36.3% and 59.0%, respectively. Malignant nodules (n = 179) accounted for 59.7% of resected nodules and 21.6% of all thyroid nodules with available follow-up. Compared with the published adult series, pediatric nodules had a higher resection rate and ROM, particularly in the indeterminate categories. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that Asian pediatric thyroid nodules had higher ROM than those from adults. The prototypic outputs of TBSRTC may need to be adjusted in the pediatric population.","genergyal, medical",Pathology and Forensic Medicine

The demand and supply of natural gas must be balanced at all times.Large error in forecasts of natural gas demand can cost Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) millions of dollars. In this study, techniques for accurate forecasting of natural gas demand are examined. The models are tested and validated on real data from nPower forecasting competition 2018, which consists of historical natural gas consumption and the corresponding weather forecast at 6-h intervals. The methodology presents a holistic approach that includes data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature selection, model development, and post-processing. To capture the intra-day variability in natural gas demand a block-wise approach is used to develop the forecasting models. In this approach, a separate model is developed for each block of the day. Subsequently, four different forecasting models are developed using the block-wise technique, namely, a block-wise gradient boosting model using features from sensitivity analysis (GB), a block-wise gradient boosting model using features from PCA (GB-PCA), a block-wise ANN-CG model using features from sensitivity analysis (ANN-CG) and a block-wise ANN-CG model using features from PCA (ANN-CG-PCA). Three hybrid forecasts are also developed by combining the forecasts from the four individual models. The results show that the combined models outperform the individual models, with an improvement of around 15% in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).","natural gas; natural gas computer science., prop., and uses, petroleum engineeringneering, hydrocarbons, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

In this work, we successfully developed a new PCA3 assay on an origami paper-based peptide nucleic acid device (oPAD). The PCA3 oPAD comprises an acrylic cassette and shutter slides to facilitate the molecular reaction and liquid control occurring on the paper surface. To quantify PCA3, a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) was immobilized onto the aldehyde-modified oPAD surface as a selective capture probe. A G-quadruplex (GQD) DNAzyme reporter probe was designed so that the PCA3 gene target binding triggered the hybridization chain reaction of the reporter probe, resulting in the accumulation of the GQD on the oPAD. The peroxidase activity of the GQD-hemin generated a deep green color of the oxidized ABTS substrate. Image analyses were performed in Adobe Photoshop CS6. The proposed oPAD was successfully applied in PCA3 detection ranges of 1–5 μM (r2 = 0.982) with a limit of detection of 0.5 μM. Our proposed oPAD was demonstrated to measure PCA3 samples in both urine matrix and human cancer cell lines. The results reveal the great potential of our origami paper-based platform to be an alternative approach for facile, rapid, and low-cost detection of PCA3 in real samples.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

Mixtures of SDS with nonionic surfactants were proposed to solve this problem. Polyoxyethylene (n) lauryl ether (EO3 and EO5) and alkyl poly glycol ether (APG) were chosen to mix with SDS in different concentrations at 8 MPa and 4 °C in the quiescent system for both kinetics and morphology studies. The result showed that the addition of EO3 resulted in the slight increase for the induction time but no change in the formation rate. Adding EO5 showed the stochastic phenomenon on hydrate formation kinetics. In the presence of APG, the induction time increased up to ten times and lowered the hydrate formation rate compared to only 0.25 wt% SDS. The methane uptakes were about the same with all conditions. The morphology showed similar hydrate formation and dissociation patterns with all investigated solutions. Interestingly, the mixture of nonionic surfactants with SDS decreased the foam formation compared with the system with only SDS. The addition EO3 showed the gradual decrease in the foam height with the higher concentration of EO3. Adding the highest EO5 concentration showed the optimum foam reduction compared with all conditions. Moreover, the presence of APG showed the similar effects of foam reduction with EO5.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; crudes; natural gas, natural gasoline and lpg, energy",Energy Engineering and Power Technology

The biological tests with primary cells and two cell lines revealed that the cells cannot adhere and preferably formed cell aggregates on eADF4(C16) hydrogels, due to the polyanionic properties of eADF4(C16). Mixing SF in the blends ameliorated the cellular activities, as the proliferation of L929 fibroblasts and SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cells increased with an increase of SF content.

Levodopa Versus Dopamine Agonist after Subthalamic Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease,"Picillo M., Phokaewvarangkul O., Poon Y.-Y., McIntyre C.C., Beylergil S.B., Munhoz R.P., Kalia S.K., Hodaie M., Lozano A.M., Fasano A.",2021-03-01,"Antiparkinson Agents, Deep Brain Stimulation, Dopamine Agonists, Humans, Levodopa, Parkinson Disease, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome, Unknown","Background: No clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (DBS) in PD. Methods: Thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study. All patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (NMS). Analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population. Results: Randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in NMSS between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: −11.78–21.53, P = 0.566]). In short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. The ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location. In the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders. Conclusions: This trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for PD. The reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of NMSs, such as apathy and sleep disturbances. © 2020 The Authors.

Bus arrival time prediction and reliability analysis: An experimental comparison of functional data analysis and Bayesian support vector regression,"Huang Y.P., Chen C., Su Z.C., Chen T.S., Sumalee A., Pan T.L., Zhong R.X.",2021-11-01,"Accurate prediction, Bus arrival time predictions, Bus travel time predictions, Comparative studies, Data-driven approach, Experimental comparison, Functional data analysis, Prediction accuracy, Bus arrival time prediction, Bus travel time reliability, Real-time transit information system, Skewed journey time distribution","To maintain the stability and punctuality of bus systems, an accurate forecast of arrival time is essential to devise control strategies to prevent bus bunching especially under congested traffic conditions. Transit agencies provide travelers with accurate and reliable bus arrival times to downstream stations to improve transit service quality so as to attract more transit riders. Varieties of approaches have been dedicated to providing high prediction accuracy while the measure of the associated uncertainty is ignored. Noting that the quantification of uncertainty is vital for robust performance, this paper proposes data-driven approaches based on the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Bayesian Support Vector Regression (BSVR) for short-term bus travel time prediction while anticipating various uncertainties. To capture spatial–temporal dynamic traffic conditions along the route so as to increase the accuracy of the journey time prediction and to capture the skewness in journey time distribution, a probabilistic nested delay operator is adopted. Journey time reliability analysis is then conducted using the skewness of dynamic journey time distribution. An empirical study is carried out by fusing the bus transit date of No. 261 bus route and Floating Car Data (FCD) in Guangzhou.

For this purpose, we develop a surrogate-based robust simulation-optimization approach for robust tuning and analyzing the sensitivity of stochastic controllers. Kriging surrogate is combined with robust design optimization to construct a robust simulation-optimization model in the class of dual response surfaces. Randomness in simulation experiments due to uncertainty is analyzed through bootstrapping technique by computing confidence regions for the estimation of Pareto frontier. Results confirmed a proper trade-off between the model's performance with the measure of expected Integral Squared Error (ISE) and robustness against uncertainty in the plant's physical parameters. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and simplicity particularly in comparison with some common existed techniques in the tuning of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Fractional-Order PID (FOPID) controllers.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering","Modeling and Simulation, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In a VRFB system, pumps deliver positive and negative electrolytes, through a piping system, to each stack. Because the electrolytes are electrically conductive, shunt currents can occur within a multicell stack and within the piping system, connecting the stacks due to the voltage differences between cells and between stacks. Shunt currents cause energy loss and are affected by the number of cells in a single stack, the number of stacks, and the piping system dimensions. In this study, we develop a mathematical model, based on Kirchhoff's law, to locate shunt currents in a multistack system. Using this model, we estimate the charge efficiency with various numbers of stacks. The results show that the shunt currents in the central stacks are larger than the currents in other stacks. In addition, the piping system dominates the distribution of the electrolytes, and the shunt currents gradually shift from inside the stack to the piping system.","process equipment, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

As lung cancer patients are mostly detected at metastatic stages, strategies that inhibit cancer metastasis may offer effective therapies. Activation of FAK and Akt/mTOR pathways promotes the highly metastatic phenotypes of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We unraveled EMT inhibitory action of pongamol and the mechanism controlling cell dissemination in lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of pongamol were determined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis and necrosis induction in response to pongamol treatment was observed and visualized by nuclei staining assay. Wound healing migration, invasion, and anchorage-dependent growth assay were conducted to evaluate metastatic behaviors. EMT protein expression and FAK pathway were detected by western blot analysis. Results: Pongamol at 0-100 μM exhibited significant inhibition on migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Regarding anoikis resistance potential, the compound significantly inhibited survival and growth of cancer cells in an anchorage-independent manner, as indicated by the depletion of growing colonies in pongamol-pretreated cells. Protein level analysis further showed that pongamol exerted its anti-metastasis effect by inhibiting EMT, as indicated by a decrease of several mesenchymal proteins (N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, and Slug). Regarding the up-stream mechanisms, we found that pongamol inhibited activation of FAK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Conclusion: Pongamol exhibits potent anti-metastatic activity through suppressing key potentiating factors of cancer metastasis EMT and FAK.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"
Osteogenic enhancement of silk fibroin-based bone scaffolds by forming hybrid composites with bioactive glass through GPTMS during sol-gel process,"Manissorn J., Wattanachai P., Tonsomboon K., Bumroongsakulsawat P., Damrongsakkul S., Thongnuek P.",2021-03-01,"Alkaline phosphatase activity, Bone tissue engineering, Enzymatic Degradation, Mechanical integrity, Organic-inorganic hybrid, Physiological condition, Simulated body fluids, Sustainable solution, Bioactive glass, Bone scaffold, GPTMS, Hybrid composite, Silk fibroin, Tissue engineering","Silk fibroin-based porous scaffolds have attracted many attentions as sustainable solutions for treatment of non-union bone fracture due to their decent biocompatibility. However, the lack of intrinsic bioactivity and rapid enzymatic degradation are main complications that limit its use as bone scaffolds. Herein, we developed a simple way to enhance bone bonding as well as long-term stability under physiological condition by crosslinking silk fibroin polypeptides with bioactive glass through GPTMS during sol-gel process. GPTMS provided many benefits to the developed organic-inorganic hybrid scaffolds. First, it prevented silk fibroin polypeptides from being leached out. While the uncrosslinked hybrid scaffolds submerged in protease solution suffered from 50 % weight loss within one day, it took 28 days for the GPTMS-crosslinked hybrid scaffolds to experience similar degradation level. Second, GPTMS crosslinking induced the formation of silk crystalline β-sheets and hence increased the compressive modulus of the hybrid scaffolds from 0.015 MPa to 3.122 MPa, which is close to that of the cancellous bone. Further, the hybrid scaffolds could induce crystallization of calcium phosphate under simulated body fluid, which resulted in greater SaOS-2 osteoblast proliferation on the hybrid scaffolds than silk fibroin or bioactive glass controls throughout 28-day cultivation. The cells on hybrid scaffolds also showed greater levels of osteogenic markers (alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition) than those on silk fibroin scaffolds. This work therefore demonstrates that GPTMS crosslinking with bioactive glass during sol-gel process not only provided the hybrid scaffolds retarded enzymatic degradation and greater mechanical integrity. Bioactivity was also remarkably increased, enhancing the potential use of silk fibroin-based scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

It was found that during the synthesis process, pretreatment affected the transformation of iron nanoparticles in the Fe2O3/GO, leading to significant difference in formation of carbon nanoparticles. When the Fe2O3/GO was employed within a temperature range of 700−900 °C, Fe2O3 was reduced to α-Fe, yielding CNT growth on the graphene surface. However, the α-Fe could be transformed to γ-Fe when the Fe2O3/GO was subject to the temperature of 1000 °C, resulting in formation of carbon spheres instead of CNTs.

Graphene alone exhibits electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) with low energy density and high power density. The use of aerogels in a supercapacitor is a pragmatic approach due to its extraordinary properties like ultra-lightweight, high porosity and specific surface area. The aerogels encompass a high volume of pores which leads to easy soak by the electrolyte and fast charge-discharge process. Graphene aerogels assembled into three-dimensional (3D) architecture prevent there stacking of graphene sheets and maintain the high surface area and hence excellent cycling stability and rate capacitance. However, the energy density of graphene aerogels is limited due to EDLC type of charge storage mechanism. Consequently, 3D graphene aerogel coupled with pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal oxides, metal hydroxides, conducting polymers, nitrides, chalcogenides show an efficient energy density and power density performance due to the presence of both types of charge storage mechanisms.

Here, we report the discovery of the Penaeus monodon stimulator of interferon gene (PmSTING) and interferon regulatory factor (PmIRF) genes and their important roles in the host defense against viral infection. High expression levels of PmSTING transcripts were detected in the midgut, hepatopancreas, and hindgut, with lower levels in foregut, while PmIRF was highly expressed in the hindgut, foregut, and hepatopancreas of P. monodon. The mRNA expression level of both PmSTING and PmIRF was up-regulated in the foregut in response to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV; dsDNA virus) infection. RNA-interference-mediated gene silencing of PmSTING and PmIRF rendered shrimps to be more susceptible to WSSV infection; suppression of PmIRF decreased the mRNA transcript level of PmSTING; and silencing of the cytosolic sensor PmDDX41 suppressed both PmSTING and PmIRF gene transcript levels. Thus, PmSTING and PmIRF are likely to be important for the antiviral innate response against the dsDNA WSSV pathogen and may mediate the antiviral immune defenses via PmDDX41/PmSTING/PmIRF signaling cascade in P. monodon.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

Elderly patients with ischemic stroke often have worse outcomes than younger patients. However, there has not been a study of ischemic stroke in the elderly in Thailand. A better knowledge of the risk factors, subtypes, and outcomes of strokes in the elderly may have significant practical implications for the aged society in the future. The objective of the study was to assess the risk factor, stroke subtypes, and outcome of stroke in the elderly compared to the younger patients. Method: All patients presented with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) aged over 45 years who were admitted in the Stroke unit between November 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2017 were retrospectively studied. Result: Five hundred forty-two patients were included. The average age was 68.78 ± 12.03, 44.8% of them were male. 186 (34.3%) patients were 75 or older. Cardioembolism was found to be the most common cause of ischemic stroke in 156 patients (28.8%) and was associated with poor outcome. Patients who were 75 or older had significantly worse outcomes in all categories including NIHSS at discharge, modified Rankin scale, length of stay and the number of deaths compared to the younger group. Atrial fibrillation was the risk factors associated with older age with OR 3.861 (p value< 0.001).

Using in situ spectromicroscopy, the sublimation and recrystallization of InP(100) surfaces are followed and controlled in real time, revealing unexpectedly the presence of an ultrathin In layer that coexists with microscopic In droplets. The In layer can be enticed to dewet by controlled exposure to ultraviolet photons which induce quantum electronic stress in the layer. Dewetted atoms redistribute toward existing droplets, forming ultrathin layers around them. Upon heating the layers expand and overlap to form a contiguous layer, returning the surface to the original state prior to dewetting. Effectively, ultrathin In layer can be grown and broken up at will. The wetting-dewetting dynamics around intrinsic (In) and extrinsic (Au) droplets are observed in situ via low-energy electron microscopy while chemical analyses of the surfaces are made using synchrotron-based soft X-rays photoemission electron microscopy. The results demonstrate the often overlooked possibility to grow flat, ultrathin metal films on semiconductors, despite lattice mismatch and the close-packed nature of metallic bond.

Therefore, in this work, we prevented B19’ phase from relaxation phase transition by applying external force to supply a reliable structure for its subsequent properties calculations. In addition, a reversible phase transition between phases B19’ and B33 was found and the theoretical value of transformation stress was determined. The changes of elastic modulus, formation enthalpy and electronic property of two phases (B33 and B19’) under various pressures were compared and analyzed.

"Contamination of antibiotics and sul and tet(M) genes in veterinary wastewater, river, and coastal sea in Thailand","Suzuki S., Ogo M., Takada H., Seki K., Mizukawa K., Kadoya A., Yokokawa T., Sugimoto Y., Sato-Takabe Y., Boonla C., Anomasiri W., Sukpanyatham N.",2021-10-15,"Antibiotic resistance genes, Aquatic environments, Coastal seas, Fresh Water, Pig farms, Resistance, Sea, Sulphonamides, Thailand, Water system, Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Rivers, Swine, Thailand, Waste Water, Antibiotics, Aquatic environment, Pig farm, Resistance, Sea","Water systems in Southeast Asia accumulate antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from multiple origins, notably including human clinics and animal farms. To ascertain the fate of antibiotics and ARGs in natural water environments, we monitored the concentrations of these items in Thailand. Here, we show high concentrations of tetracyclines (72,156.9 ng/L) and lincomycin (23,968.0 ng/L) in pig farms, followed by nalidixic acid in city canals. The city canals and rivers contained diverse distributions of antibiotics and ARGs. Assessments of targeted ARGs, including sul1, sul2, sul3, and tet(M), showed that freshwater (pig farm wastewater, rivers, and canals) consistently contained these ARGs, but these genes were less abundant in seawater. Although sulfonamides were low concentrations (<170 ng/mL), sul1 and sul2 genes were abundant in freshwater (minimum 4.4 × 10−3–maximum 1.0 × 100 copies/16S), suggesting that sul genes have disseminated over a long period, despite cessation of use of this class of antibiotics. Ubiquitous distribution of sul genes in freshwater appeared to be independent of selection pressure. In contrast, water of the coastal sea in the monitored area was not contaminated by these antibiotics or ARGs. The density of Enterobacteriales was lower in seawater than in freshwater, suggesting that the number of ARG-possessing Enterobacteriales falls after entering seawater. From the pig farms, through rivers/canals, to the coastal sea, the occurrence of tetracyclines and tet(M) exhibited some correlation, although not a strong one. However, no correlations were found between concentrations of total antibiotics and ARGs, nor between sulfonamides and sul genes. This is the first comprehensive study showing Thai features of antibiotics and ARGs contaminations. The pig farm is hot spot of antibiotics and ARGs, and sul genes ubiquitously distribute in freshwater environments, which become less abundant in seawater.",environmental,"Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

However, current data on the diagnostic performance of these devices are scarce. Aims: We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of atrial fibrillation diagnosis by smart gadgets/wearable devices. Methods: We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for all works since the inception of each database until January 2020. Included in this review were published observational studies of the diagnostic accuracy of smartphones or smartwatches in detecting atrial fibrillation. We calculated the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curves and pooled sensitivities and specificities. Results: Participants in our study were from the general population or were patients with underlying atrial fibrillation. In the overall analyses, the areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.96 and 0.94 for smartphones and smartwatches, respectively. Smartphones had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 96%, and smartwatches showed similar diagnostic accuracy, with a specificity of 94% and a sensitivity of 93%. In subgroup analyses, we found no difference in diagnostic accuracy between photoplethysmography and single-lead electrocardiography. Conclusions: This study suggests that smart devices have similar diagnostic accuracies. Regarding atrial fibrillation detection methods, there was also no difference between photoplethysmography and single-lead electrocardiography. However, further studies are warranted to determine their clinical implications in atrial fibrillation management.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

In the existing design methods, the behavior of RC pile cap is usually considered as a rigid body and resulting forces or reactions on piles are assumed equal. However, in actual conditions, there is a possibility of bending of pile cap and un-equal reactions or forces on piles. This study represents a detailed finite element analysis of RC eight-pile cap by using a computer program ATENA. ATENA serve as rational tools to explain the behavior of RC structures. Research parameters included different types of loading conditions, analysis types such as linear and non-linear, support conditions, length of pile, strength of concrete and thickness of pile cap. The finite element analysis results indicate that the behavior of RC pile cap is not a rigid body and resulting forces or reactions are unequal. Also, it was observed that, support conditions, analysis type and thickness of RC pile cap had a significant effect on the global behavior of RC pile caps.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Materials Science (all), Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

HSPs, which regulate protein folding and refolding, assembly, translocation, and degradation, are induced in response to physiological and environmental stressors. In recent years, HSPs have been recognized for their potential role in immunity; in particular, these proteins elicit a variety of immune responses to infection and modulate inflammation. This review focuses on delineating the structural and functional roles of crustacean HSPs in the innate immune response. Members of crustacean HSPs include high molecular weight HSPs (HSP90, HSP70, and HSP60) and small molecular weight HSPs (HSP21 and HSP10). The sequences and structures of these HSPs are highly conserved across various crustacean species, indicating strong evolutionary links among this group of organisms. The expression of HSP-encoding genes across different crustacean species is significantly upregulated upon exposure to a wide range of pathogens, emphasizing the important role of HSPs in the immune response. Functional studies of crustacean HSPs, particularly HSP70s, have demonstrated their involvement in the activation of several immune pathways, including those mediating anti-bacterial resistance and combating viral infections, upon heat exposure. The immunomodulatory role of HSPs indicates their potential use as an immunostimulant to enhance shrimp health for control of disease in aquaculture.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

In this study, the authors describe our current technique of extradural subtemporal approach (ESTA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the role and efficacy of ESTA for treatment of the PBLs. To our knowledge, this is the largest reported clinical series of using an ESTA-treated PBLs in which the clinical outcomes were evaluated. Methods: Between 1994 and 2019, 67 patients with PBLs treated by ESTA were retrospectively reviewed. Extent of resection, neurological outcomes, recurrence rate, and surgical complications were evaluated and compared with previous studies. The indications, advantages, limitations, and outcomes of ESTA were analyzed according to pathology. Results: This series included 7 facial nerve schwannomas (10.4%), 16 cholesterol granulomas (23.9%), 16 chordomas (23.9%), 6 chondrosarcomas (9%), 5 trigeminal schwannomas (7.5%), 9 epidermoids/dermoids (13.4%), and 8 other pathologies (11.9%). The most common location of PBLs operated with ESTA was at the petrous apex and rhomboid areas (68.7%). Gross total resection was achieved in 35 (55.6%). Symptomatic improvement occurred in 56 patients (83.6%). Complications occurred in 7 (10.4%) of cases including one mortality. Nine patients (17%) had recurrence within the mean follow-up 71 months. Compared to previous literature, our results demonstrated comparable outcomes but with higher rates of hearing and facial nerve preservation as well as minimal morbidity. From our results, ESTA is an effective therapeutic option for lesions located at the rhomboid and petrous apex, particularly when patients presented with intact facial and hearing function. Conclusion: Our series demonstrated that ESTA provided satisfactory outcomes with excellent benefits of hearing and facial function preservation for patients with petrous bone lesions. ESTA should be considered as a safe and effective therapeutic option for selected patients with PBLs.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

The phase 3 HERITAGE trial demonstrated equivalent overall response rate (ORR) with trastuzumab-dkst or originator trastuzumab at 24 weeks in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. We now present the correlation of ORR with progression-free survival (PFS) for maintenance monotherapy with trastuzumab-dkst vs trastuzumab at 48 weeks of treatment, and the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. Methods: HERITAGE is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, phase 3 study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive trastuzumab-dkst or trastuzumab in combination with taxane followed by continued monotherapy until disease progression. The analysis included PFS at 48 weeks to support the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR and safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of trastuzumab-dkst vs trastuzumab as maintenance monotherapy. Results: Of 500 randomized patients, 342 entered the monotherapy phase; 214 patients received ≥48 weeks of treatment. There were no statistically significant differences between PFS, ORR, or interim overall survival at week 48 between trastuzumab-dkst and trastuzumab. Week 24 ORR was highly correlated with week 48 PFS (rb = 0.75). Cumulative treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious AEs were similar in both groups, with few grade ≥3 TEAEs. Immunogenicity was low and similar in both groups at 48 weeks. Conclusion: The correlation between ORR and PFS supports the design of first-line metastatic trials assessing biosimilar trastuzumab. Overall, trastuzumab-dkst and trastuzumab were well tolerated with similar efficacy, including ORR and PFS, in combination with a taxane followed by monotherapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Surgery, Oncology, Cancer Research"

HIV self-tests (HIVSTs) are rapidly administrable and prompt linkage to HIV treatment or prevention services. This study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of blood-based HIVST use in adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among YMSM and YTGW aged 15–19 years with HIV acquisition risk. Participants completed questionnaires on the HIVST and then administered INSTI® independently, an HIVST immunoassay detecting gp41 and gp36 antibodies from finger-stick blood. Confirmatory HIV antibody tests were performed. Results: Between July and September 2020, 90 adolescents were enrolled. Mean (SD) age was 17.6 (1.1) years. Half (N = 45) were YMSM. Forty-six (51%) were first-time HIV testers, and 32 (36%) had “ever used” HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Two (2.2%, 95% CI: 0.0–5.3) tested positive, 21 (23.4%) invalid, and 67 (74.4%) negative. Invalidity causes included 17 (81%) insufficient blood, 3 (14%) buffer spillage, and 1 (5%) procedural missteps; all had negative HIV antibody tests. HIV self-test acceptability was 87.8% (95% CI: 81.0–94.5). Most (79%) preferred HIVST performance in hospital rather than at home. Conclusions: HIVSTs are acceptable in HIV at-risk adolescents.

Nevertheless, no BD studies have evaluated the IRS/CIRS ratio using CD (cluster of differentiation) molecules expressed by peripheral blood activated T effector (Teff) and T regulatory (Treg) subpopulations. This study examined Teff/Treg subsets both before and after ex vivo anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation using flow cytometric immunophenotyping in 25 symptomatic remitted BD patients and 21 healthy controls and assessed human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)–specific IgG antibodies. BD is associated with a significantly lowered frequency of unstimulated CD3 + CD8 + CD71+ and CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 and increased CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + CD152+ frequencies and with lowered stimulated frequencies of CD3 + CD8 + CD71+, CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + CD152+, and CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + GARP cells and, consequently, by an increased stimulated Teff/Treg ratio. Moreover, the number of manic, but not hypomanic or depressive episodes, is significantly and negatively associated with the stimulated proportions of CD3 + CD4 + CD154+, and CD69+ and CD71+ expression on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, while duration of illness (≥ 10 years) is accompanied by a depleted frequency of stimulated CD152+ Treg, and CD154+ and CD71+ CD4+ T cells. BD and anti-human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG levels significantly interact to decrease the expression of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP+GARP T phenotypes. In conclusion, in BD patients, immune injuries, staging, and HCMV seropositivity interact and cause CIRS dysfunctions and exaggerated IRS responses, which play a key role in parainflammation and neuroaffective toxicity. HCMV seropositivity contributes to an immune-risk phenotype in BD.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Water-stable scaffolds can be obtained after crosslinking, and the SFG and SFGHA samples were stable in cell culture medium up to 10 days. The presence of HA in the scaffolds with appropriate crosslinking conditions greatly enhanced the swellability. The microarchitecture of the freeze-dried scaffolds showed high porosity and interconnectivity. In particular, the pore size was significantly larger with an addition of HA. Biological activities of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts seeded on SFG and SFGHA scaffolds revealed that both scaffolds were able to support cell adhesion and proliferation of a 7-day culture. Furthermore, cell penetration into the scaffolds can be observed due to the interconnected porous structure of the scaffolds and the presence of bioactive materials which could attract the cells and support cell functions. The higher cell number was noticed in the SFGHA samples, possibly due to the HA component and the larger pore size which could improve the microenvironment for fibroblast adhesion, proliferation, and motility. The developed scaffolds from ternary blends showed potential in their application as 3D cell culture substrates in fibroblast-based tissue engineering.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

METH process could upgrade CO2 containing biogas into CH4-rich gas which then decomposed into H2 and forming CNTs over CoMo/MgO catalyst by CVD process. The effects of Ce addition to CoMo/MgO were investigated. Comprehensive characterization confirms that all as-synthesized samples composed of well-aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a narrow size distribution. The Ce addition improved CoMo dispersion on MgO, resulting in smaller and uniform CNTs. The small addition of Ce into CoMo/MgO catalyst could enhance the production CNTs yield. The higher Ce addition would, however, result in the CNTs yield decreased, attributed to a high basicity of CeO2 surface and a large coverage of CeO2 on the catalyst surface. The IG/ID increased with increased Ce addition, while the surface area monotonically decreased, attributed to a decrease in defects of nanotubes. In addition, this wisely combined process could result in a remarkable 100%CO2 elimination, while high CH4 conversion of 90% was obtained.

Among these materials, concrete and steel are heavy weight, whereas FRP are expensive along with skin problems during handling and installations. In this paper, the efficiency of natural sisal fiber reinforced polymer composites is evaluated on strength and ductility of RC members. The salient features of natural sisal FRPs are low density, higher toughness, acceptable strength properties, reduced irritation to the skin and respiratory system, biodegradable and sustainable since they are natural products. The objectives of this research were twofold. The first was to evaluate the compressive and flexural behavior of small-sized concrete specimens (cylinders and beams) strengthened with natural sisal FRPs, considering different resin matrices, FRP thickness and concrete strengths. Whereas, the second objective was to investigate the strengthening effect of natural sisal FRP strengthening on the flexural response of RC beams. Test results showed that externally bonded natural sisal FRPs are significantly effective to increase the strength and ductility of the concrete members. In general, the experimental results demonstrated a higher increase in the load carrying capacity when the thickness of the sisal FRPs was increased. However, RC beams strengthened by natural sisal FRP, may fail by de-bonding of FRP from the concrete surface. To avoid this failure, a new anchoring system has been proposed and tested to evaluate their performance in preventing the de-bonding of FRP from concrete surface. Based on experimental results, proposed anchoring system was found to be effective to prevent the delamination of natural sisal FRPs from concrete surface.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

Agonists of the sigma-1 receptor may provide protection of the mitochondria, activate mitophagy to remove damaged and leaking mitochondria, prevent ER stress, manage calcium ion transport, and induce autophagy to prevent cell death in response to infection.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry"
Selective electrochemical etching of the Sn-3Ag-0.5Cu/0.07 wt% graphene nanoparticle composite solder,"Ahmad I., Firdaus Mohd Nazeri M., Azmira Salleh N., Kheawhom S., Mustafa Erer A., Kurt A., Azmin Mohamad A.",2021-10-01,"Composite solders, Electrochemical removal, Lead-Free, Microstructural changes, Morphological changes, Selective electrochemical etchings, Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu, Solder alloys, Structure change, Three electrode cells, Composite solder, Graphene, Lead-free solders, Microstructure, Selective electrochemical etching, Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu","The morphological changes of SAC305 solder alloy with the addition of 0.07 wt% graphene was investigated using selective electrochemical etching. To evaluate the effect of graphene inclusion, selective electrochemical removal of the β-Sn phase from SAC305 and SAC305/0.07GNP was performed using a standard three-electrode cell approach at specific potentials determined by cyclic voltammetry. The phase, chemical structure and microstructural changes were observed. The texture and the phases of SAC305 solder paste were retained, while the microstructure of β-Sn and Ag3Sn was refined owning to graphene addition. Sufficient removal of β-Sn without affecting other phases was obtained by using etching potential below −350 mV. Due to Van der Waals force attraction, two types of agglomeration of graphene were observed from cross-sectional observation. Large agglomerations seen at the vicinity of solder/substrate interface were found to help in forming diffusion barrier. This contributes to the refinement of microstructure with the presence of graphene. Accurate observation regarding the shape and texture of the intermetallic compound (IMC) phases affected by the addition of graphene provided by selective electrochemical removal helps better insight into understanding the electrochemical dissolution mechanism of SAC alloys.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The graft copolymerization was achieved successfully in the latex stage using tert-butyl hydroperoxide and tetraethylenepentamine as radical initiators at 30°C. The obtained graft copolymer was hydrogenated by a diimide reduction system in the presence of different copper (II) homogeneous catalysts. The effects of styrene to acrylonitrile on the total conversion and the grafting efficiency have been studied. The structural characterization of the obtained copolymers was made by 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. The graft DPNR was then characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The effects of different copper (II) catalysts on the system have been evaluated by the hydrogenation degree of each hydrogenated sample. The improvement of the thermal properties of the graft copolymers was confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis. The core-shell arrangement was obtained in both DPNR-graft-PS/PAN and hydrogenated-DPNR-graft-PS/PAN by transmission electron microscopy.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

TRANSIENT PARADOXICAL WORSENING OF VISION DUE TO GRAVITATIONAL SHIFT OF SUBRETINAL FLUID AFTER PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY,"Saengsirinavin A.-O., Ma D., Stewart J.M.",2021-11-01,"Central Serous Chorioretinopathy, Humans, Photochemotherapy, Retrospective Studies, Subretinal Fluid, central serous chorioretinopathy, gravitational shift, half-dose, half-fluence, photodynamic therapy, subretinal fluid, verteporfin","Purpose:To report an atypical treatment-related complication from photodynamic therapy in central serous chorioretinopathy patient and explain its mechanism.Methods:History, physical examination, and imaging data were retrospectively reviewed and obtained from the electronic medical records of the patient.Results:A central serous chorioretinopathy patient with several focal leakage spots near the superotemporal arcade was treated with half-fluence verteporfin photodynamic therapy. The patient complained of worse vision after the treatment. Examination showed relocation of subretinal fluid from the superior macula to the central and submacular area, explained by a gravitational shift of subretinal fluid and the predisposing factor of a previously weakened junction between the retinal pigment epithelium and neurosensory retina. Without further treatment, the fluid reabsorbed, and the patient's vision returned to normal.Conclusion:This is the first report to describe this transient atypical adverse visual outcome early after photodynamic therapy in a central serous chorioretinopathy patient, caused by a gravitational shift of viscous subretinal fluid.",medical,Ophthalmology
Donor-specific ELISPOT assay for predicting acute rejection and allograft function after kidney transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Udomkarnjananun S., Kerr S.J., Townamchai N., van Besouw N.M., Hesselink D.A., Baan C.C.",2021-08-01,"Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Graft Rejection, Humans, Kidney Transplantation, Transplantation, Homologous, Acute rejection, Allograft function, Cytokines, eGFR, ELISPOT, Kidney transplantation","Acute rejection remains an important problem after kidney transplantation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay has been investigated extensively and has shown promising results as a predictor of allograft rejection. The objective of this study was to systematically review and analyze the predictive value of the donor-specific ELISPOT assay to identify recipients at risk for acute rejection. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting donor-specific ELISPOT and kidney transplantation outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) for acute rejection was calculated, along with standardized mean difference (SMD) of cytokine producing-cells between recipients with and without acute rejection. Pooled estimates were calculated using random-effect models. The positive ELISPOT cutoff frequencies were extracted from each study. From 665 articles found, 32 studies were included in the meta-analysis. IFN-γ was the most investigated cytokine (30 out of 32 studies). Patients with positive pre-transplantation donor-reactive IFN-γ ELISPOT had an OR of 3.3 for acute rejection (95%-CI 2.1 to 5.1), and OR of 6.8 (95%-CI 2.5 to 18.9) for post-transplantation ELISPOT. Recipients with rejection had significantly higher frequencies of pre- and post-transplantation cytokine producing-cells (SMD 0.47, 95%-CI 0.07 to 0.87 and SMD 3.68, 95%-CI 1.04 to 6.32, respectively). Pre-transplantation ELISPOT had a positive predictive value of 43% and a negative predictive value of 81% for acute rejection. A positive ELISPOT result was associated with a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (SMD −0.59, 95%-CI −0.83 to −0.34). In conclusion, patients with a high frequency of donor-reactive IFN-γ ELISPOT are at higher risk for acute rejection. The donor-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT assay can serve as an immune-monitoring tool in kidney transplantation.",biochemistryistry,Clinical Biochemistry
Phylogeography and demographic history of Thai Pediculus humanus capitis (Phthiraptera: Pediculidae) revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequences,"Yingklang M., Banjong D., Haonon O., Intuyod K., Dangtakot R., Thongpon P., Pinlaor P., Laha T., Siriyasatien P., Pinlaor S.",2021-07-01,"Animals, Base Sequence, DNA, Mitochondrial, Gene Flow, Genetic Variation, Humans, Lice Infestations, Pediculus, Phylogeny, Phylogeography, Population Dynamics, Thailand, Genetic diversity, Haplotype network, Head lice, Insect, Population structure, Thailand","Pediculus humanus (human louse) is a hematophagous insect that feeds on human blood. It is distributed worldwide. Understanding phylogeography and population-genetic structure of the human louse will illuminate the evolution of this insect and the dynamics of how resistance alleles might spread in the landscape. In this work, we used mitochondrial (cox1 and cytb genes) sequences of the human louse to investigate genetic diversity, population-genetic structure and demographic history of the louse in Thailand. Human lice in Thailand belonged to mitochondrial clades A and C. Most genetic variation was attributed to intra-region 65.71% within provinces for clade A and 68.92% for clade C, while inter-region level was 34.40% among provinces within regions for clade A and 20.09% for clade C. Neutrality and other indices suggested that louse populations from clades A and C in Thailand have experienced a population expansion. But head lice from Khon Kaen Province in clade C demonstrated a significant recent population bottleneck or natural selective pressure with constant population size. Head lice in Thailand showed varying degrees of low to high genetic differentiation at the level of province with many populations being genetically distinct from each other among regions and within the same region. Knowledge of the clades present in Thailand and that gene flow occurs between regions will assist in developing appropriate strategies for management of head lice at the local level in the country.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Autophagosome, cancer, flux, LC3, lysosome, macroautophagy, neurodegeneration, phagophore, stress, vacuole","In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"
Antibacterial efficiency of microporous hypercrosslinked polymer conjugated with biosynthesized silver nanoparticles from Aspergillus niger,"Ratvijitvech T., Na Pombejra S.",2021-09-01,"Anti-bacterial activity, Antibacterials, Aspergillus niger, Biosynthesized silver nanoparticle, Cost effective, Eco-friendly, Energy, Hypercrosslinked polymers, Manufacturing cost, Microporous, Antibacterial activity, Biosynthesized silver nanoparticle, Hypercrosslinked polymer","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are notable antimicrobial agents. However, their productions via physical procedures generally consume high energy leading to elevation of manufacturing cost, while chemical approaches, which are more popular processes, usually generate toxic wastes. Thus, we here introduced a cost-effective and eco-friendly biosynthetic method for AgNP production by employing fungal filtrate of Aspergillus niger as a bio-reducing agent. By using UV–vis spectrophotometry, XRD, TEM, FESEM, and DLS analysis, the formation of spherical-shaped AgNPs with 1–50 nm metal core size and 20–150 nm hydrodynamic diameter was verified. Additionally, these biosynthesized AgNPs showed a promising antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. To further develop the AgNP usage, the catechol-based hypercrosslinked polymer (HCP) was used as a protective support to preserve the AgNPs. The encapsulation of AgNPs into the HCP was confirmed by EDX, FESEM, and TEM. The antibacterial evaluation of AgNP-encapsulated HCP (AgNP-HCP) indicated a great bactericidal activity of this material suggesting a potential use in disinfection treatments.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"
Genetic polymorphism of the extracellular region in surface associated interspersed 1.1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates from Thailand,"Chaianantakul N., Sungkapong T., Changpad J., Thongma K., Sim-ut S., Kaewthamasorn M.",2021-12-01,"Membrane Proteins, Plasmodium falciparum, Polymorphism, Genetic, Protozoan Proteins, Thailand, Gene polymorphism, Malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, Surf gene, SURFIN, Variable surface antigens","Background: A novel variable surface antigens (VSAs), Surface-associated interspersed proteins (SUFRINs), is a protein that is modified on the surface of infected red blood cell (iRBC). Modified proteins on the iRBC surface cause severe malaria, which can lead to death throughout the life cycle of a malaria parasite. Previous study suggested that SURFIN1.1 is an immunogenic membrane-associated protein which was encoded by using the surf1.1 gene expressed during the trophozoite and schizont stages. This study aimed to identify the regions of SURFIN1.1 and investigate the genetic diversity of the extracellular region of the surf1.1 gene. Methods: A total of 32 blood samples from falciparum malaria cases that were diagnosed in Si Sa Ket Province, Thailand were collected. Plasmodium genomic DNA was extracted, and the extracellular region of surf1.1 gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A sequence analysis was then performed to obtain the number of haplotypes (H), the haplotype diversity (Hd), and the segregating sites (S), while the average number of nucleotide differences between two sequences (Pi); in addition, neutrality testing, Tajima’s D test, Fu and Li’s D* and F* statistics was also performed. Results: From a total of 32 patient-isolated samples, 31 DNA sequences were obtained and analysed for surf1.1 gene extracellular region polymorphism. Researchers observed six distinct haplotypes in the current research area. Haplotype frequencies were 61.3%, 16.2%, and 12.9% for H1, H2, and H3, respectively. The remaining haplotype (H4-H6) frequency was 3.2% for each haplotype. Hd was 0.598 ± 0.089 with the Pi of 0.00381, and S was 15. The most common amino acid polymorphic site was E251Q; other sites included N48D, I49V, E228D, E235S, L265F, K267T, E276Q, and S288F. Fu and Li’s D* test value was − 1.24255, Fu and Li’s F* test value was − 1.10175, indicating a tendency toward negative balancing selection acting on the surf1.1 N-terminal region. The most polymorphic region was variable 2 (Var2) while cysteine-rich domain (CRD) was conserved in both the amino acid and nucleotide extracellular region of surf1.1 gene. Conclusions: The Thai surf1.1 N-terminal region was well-conserved with only a few polymorphic sites remaining. In this study, the data regarding current bearing on the polymorphism of extracellular region of surf1.1 gene were reported, which might impact the biological roles of P. falciparum. In addition, may possibly serve as a suitable candidate for future development of SURFIN-based vaccines regarding malaria control.

In this work, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil was studied in a fixed bed reactor to produce light olefins. The operating parameters, such as the temperature, feed flow rate of fusel oil, feedstock, and the co-feeding water, were investigated over a HZSM-5 catalyst in terms of the yields and distribution of the gaseous products. The highest total carbon in the gaseous products with excellent ethylene and propylene selectivity (44.7%, 34.4%, and 28.6%, respectively) were obtained at 550 °C, a feed flow rate of 0.04 mL/min, and 0.02 g of catalyst. After a long time on stream (TOS), the stability of HZSM-5 was slightly decreased due mainly to coke deposition. Thus, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil shows the ability to be converted into light olefins. However, catalyst improvement to enhance the catalytic activity and stability is still required, at the same time, the technical process with economic feasibility still needs more development in order to be realistically useable on an industrial scale in the future.","genergyal, process equipment, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"

Dapsone hydroxylamine (DDS-NHOH), an active metabolite of dapsone, has been believed to be responsible for DHS. However, studies have not highlighted the importance of other genetic polymorphisms in dapsone-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR). We investigated the association of HLA alleles and cytochrome P450 (CYP) alleles with dapsone-induced SCAR in Thai non-leprosy patients. A prospective cohort study, 16 Thai patients of dapsone-induced SCARs (5 SJS-TEN and 11 DRESS) and 9 Taiwanese patients of dapsone-induced SCARs (2 SJS-TEN and 7 DRESS), 40 dapsone-tolerant controls, and 470 general Thai population were enrolled. HLA class I and II alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSOs). CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 genotypes were determined by the TaqMan real-time PCR assay. We performed computational analyses of dapsone and DDS-NHOH interacting with HLA-B*13:01 and HLA-B*13:02 alleles by the molecular docking approach. Among all the HLA alleles, only HLA-B*13:01 allele was found to be significantly associated with dapsone-induced SCARs (OR = 39.00, 95% CI = 7.67–198.21, p = 5.3447 × 10−7), SJS-TEN (OR = 36.00, 95% CI = 3.19–405.89, p = 2.1657 × 10−3), and DRESS (OR = 40.50, 95% CI = 6.38–257.03, p = 1.0784 × 10−5) as compared to dapsone-tolerant controls. Also, HLA-B*13:01 allele was strongly associated with dapsone-induced SCARs in Asians (OR = 36.00, 95% CI = 8.67–149.52, p = 2.8068 × 10−7) and Taiwanese (OR = 31.50, 95% CI = 4.80–206.56, p = 2.5519 × 10−3). Furthermore, dapsone and DDS-NHOH fit within the extra-deep sub pocket of the antigen-binding site of the HLA-B*13:01 allele and change the antigen-recognition site. However, there was no significant association between genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and dapsone-induced SCARs (SJS-TEN and DRESS). The results of this study support the specific genotyping of the HLA-B*13:01 allele to avoid dapsone-induced SCARs including SJS-TEN and DRESS before initiating dapsone therapy in the Asian population.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The aim of this study was to delineate (a) the differences in these pathways between stable-phase, first (FES) and multiple (MES) episode schizophrenia and (b) the pathways that determine the behavioral-cognitive-physical-psychosocial (BCPS) deterioration in FES/MES. This study included 21 FES and 58 FES patients and 40 healthy controls and measured indicants of serum C1q circulating immune complexes (CIC), leaky gut, immune activation, and oxidative stress toxicity (OSTOX). We constructed a BCPS-worsening index by extracting a latent vector from symptomatic, neurocognitive, and quality of life data. FES was associated with higher IgA CIC-C1q, IgA directed to cadherin, catenin, and plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein, and IgA/IgM to Gram-negative bacteria as compared with FES and controls. In FES patients, the BCPS-worsening score was predicted (48.7%) by IgA to Klebsiella pneumoniae and lowered paraoxonase 1 activity. In MES patients, the BCPS-worsening score was explained (42.7%) by increased tumor necrosis factor-α, OSTOX, and number of episodes. In schizophrenia, 34.0% of the variance in the BCPS-worsening score was explained by IgA to K. pneumoniae, OSTOX, and number of episodes. Increased IgA to K. pneumoniae was the single best predictor of residual psychotic symptoms in FES and MES. This study delineated different mechanistic processes in FES, including breakdown of adherens junctions, bacterial translocation, and IgA CIC-C1q formation, and MES, including immune and oxidative neurotoxic pathways.

Here, we demonstrate that an incorporation of zinc-aluminium layered double hydroxides (ZnAl-LDH) into PDA assemblies via a simple mixing process promotes local interactions, yielding reversible thermochromism. The Zn2+ ions, released from ZnAl-LDH particles, play an essential role on achieving this phenomenon. X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy reveal that the Zn2+ ions intercalate with PDA bilayer and strongly interact with carboxylate headgroup. Color-transition temperature of the nanocomposites can be tuned from 50 to 90 °C by varying the alkyl side chain of PDA. Furthermore, the reversible thermochromism persists in various organic solvents, allowing the utilization in smart paints and coating technologies. Compared to the previous studies of other PDA/LDH nanocomposites, our new materials exhibit more distinct color transition. The synthetic method is also much simpler. The new nanocomposites are more stable at low or high pH regions compared to the system of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposite, expanding new routes for fabrication and applications in harsh conditions.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

A dataset having an imbalance problem contains a noticeably different number of instances belonging to different classes. Three sampling techniques are used to solve this problem by balancing class distributions. The first one is an undersampling technique removing noises from a class having a large number of instances, called a majority class. The second one is an over-sampling technique synthesizing instances from a class having a small number of instances, called a minority class, and the third one is the combined technique of both undersampling and oversampling. This research applies the combined technique of both undersampling and oversampling via the mass ratio variance scores of instances from each individual class. For the majority class, instances with high mass ratio variances are removed whereas for the minority class, instances with high mass ratio variances are used in synthesizing minority instances. The results of this proposed sampling technique help improve recall over standard classifiers: a decision tree, a random forest, Linear SVM, MLP on all synthesized datasets; however it may have low precision. So the combined measure of precision and recall is used, F1-score. Recall and F1-scores of synthesized datasets and UCI datasets are significantly better for collections of datasets having small imbalance ratio. Moreover, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to confirm the improvement for datasets having imbalance ratio smaller than or equal to 0.2.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

The physicochemical properties of the tested river water such as Electric Conductivity (EC), turbidity, total hardness, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Ca, SO2-, and NH3, NO3, NO2, PO4, Mg, F− and Cl− contents were not within the permissible limits. Lab-scale and field-based phycoremediation treatments with the indigenous native microalgal species, Chlorella sp. from the Thirumanimutharu river water sample were set up for 15 days with three different (Group I, II, and III) biomass densities (4 × 104, 8 × 104, and 12 × 104 cells mL−1). Group III of both the lab-scale and field based treatments showed the maximum reduction in the physicochemical parameters compared to the other groups. Further, the group III of the field based study showed an extensive reduction in BOD (34.51%), COD (32.53%), NO3, NO2, free NH3 (100%) and increased dissolved oxygen (DO) (88.47%) compared to the lab scale study. In addition, the trace elements were also reduced significantly. The pollutant absorbing active functional moieties (O–H, C[dbnd]O, and C[tbnd]N) found on Chlorella sp. had been confirmed by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. In the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) study, significant morphological changes on the surface of the treated Chlorella sp. were noticed compared with the untreated Chlorella sp. biomass, which also confirmed the absorption of the pollutants during treatment.","surface water quality; rivers and streams, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The results indicate the changes in electron distribution, molecular dipole moment and molecular polarization of magnetized water from infrared and Raman results. The thermal property of magnetized water also changed as its heat capacity decreased. The solubility performance of magnetized salt solutions is studied additionally using the electrical conductivity measurement. All the mentioned changes depend on magnetic flux density (B) and magnetic exposure time (te) during the magnetization process. The increase in these two parameters (B and te) will increase the effect and become saturated in static process when B and te approaches 600 mT and 9 min, respectively. The dynamic magnetization shows similar changes in the properties of water. The magnetization with water velocity of 3.18 m s−1 at B of 600 mT at the circulation time of 60 min is the optimal condition for observing the change. It is obvious that static magnetization shows the higher effect than dynamic magnetization.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The synthesized MnFe2O4 nanoparticles were highly crystalline and showed face-centred cubic (FCC) structure with average particle size of 58 ± 4 nm. The BET analysis of the MnFe2O4 nanoparticles revealed the mesoporous distribution of material with high surface area can provide large electro active sites and short diffusion paths for the transport of ions which plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of CR. The point of zero charge (pHPZC) was observed to be 6.7 indicating favourable condition for material-anionic dye interaction.

Structural predictions of superconducting phase in tungsten ditellurides WTe2 from first-principles evolutionary techniques under high pressure,"Tsuppayakorn-aek P., Ektarawong A., Jimlim P., Kanchanavatee N., Ahuja R., Luo W., Bovornratanaraks T.",2021-12-01,"Density-functional-theory, Ditelluride, Evolutionary techniques, First principles, High pressure, High-pressure phase, Monoclinics, Structural prediction, Superconducting phase, Tungsten ditelluride, Density functional theory, High pressure, Structural prediction, Superconductivity, Tungsten ditellurides","High-pressure phases of WTe2 are investigated by using first-principles evolutionary algorithm technique. The novel monoclinic (C2/m) and tetragonal (I4/mmm) phases of WTe2 are found to be thermodynamically stable, as the material is compressed under the applied pressure above 80 GPa. Because of their substantial similarity in terms of enthalpy and several intrinsic properties, the two novel high-pressure phases are likely to coexist in practical samples of WTe2. By inspecting their electronic band structures, both C2/m and I4/mmm phases are likely type-II Weyl semimetal, and by using the Allen-Dynes equation we find that the two phases also behave conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. The electron localized solutions and the nature of the chemical bonding in WTe2 further support the superconducting transition temperature in the proposed C2/m and I4/mmm phases.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering, physics, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computational Mathematics"

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Motion analysis research laboratory. Participants: Thirty subjects with plantar fasciitis and 30 aged-matched controls. Main outcome measure(s): Range of motion of the lower extremity and multi-segment foot during gait using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results: The plantar fasciitis group showed significant differences in motion in the multi-segment foot, ankle, knee, and hip from the control group during various subphases of the stance phase. Specifically, relative to the control group, the plantar fasciitis group had more rearfoot adduction, forefoot eversion, ankle abduction, and hip abduction. They also had less midfoot dorsiflexion, forefoot dorsiflexion, knee extension, knee external rotation, and hip extension (all Ps < 0.05). Conclusions: Individuals with plantar fasciitis exhibited more flexibility in the ankle-foot complex and poorer quality of lower-extremity movement than the group that did not have plantar fasciitis. Thus, differences in structures in both the ankle-foot complex as well as those in the hip and knee joints appear to be associated with the presence of plantar fasciitis.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"
Immune-Regulatory and Molecular Effects of Antidepressants on the Inflamed Human Keratinocyte HaCaT Cell Line,"Curzytek K., Maes M., Kubera M.",2021-08-01,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Antidepressive Agents, Cell Survival, HaCaT Cells, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Keratinocytes, Adhesion molecules, Antidepressant drugs, Contact hypersensitivity, Cytokines, Depression","Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a T cell-mediated type of skin inflammation resulting from contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to antigens. There is strong comorbidity between ACD and major depression. Keratinocytes release immunomodulatory mediators including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which modulate skin inflammation and are crucial cell type for the development of CHS. Our previous studies showed that fluoxetine and desipramine were effective in suppressing CHS in different mouse strains. However, the immune and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain to be explored. The aim of the current study was to determine the immune and molecular mechanisms of action of antidepressant drugs engaged in the inhibition of CHS response in the stimulated keratinocyte HaCaT cell line. The results show that LPS, TNF-α/IFN-γ, and DNFB stimulate HaCaT cells to produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8. HaCaT stimulation was associated with increased expression of ICAM-1, a cell adhesion molecule, and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Imipramine, desipramine, and fluoxetine suppress the production of IL-1β, CCL2, as well as the expression of ICAM-1. LPS and TNF-α/IFN-γ activate p-38 kinase, but antidepressants do not regulate this pathway. LPS decreases E-cadherin protein expression and fluoxetine normalizes these effects. In summary, the antidepressant drugs examined in this study attenuate the stimulated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and modulate adhesion molecule expression by the HaCaT cell line. Therefore, antidepressants may have some clinical efficacy in patients with ACD and patients with comorbid depression and contact allergy.","neuroscienceoscience; pharmacologymacology of the central nervous system; antidepressants, neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

We use a treatment study dataset of sorghum (S. bicolor) which consists of more than 40,000 images of growing sorghum images captured in the phenotyping facility in 3 views. The experiment studies plant growing under 3 treatment conditions: 100/100 (100% ammonium/100% nitrate), 50/10, and 10/10. The network is divided into two parts: the features extraction and classification network. VGG16 with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset is used as the feature extractor. LSTM cell with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to classify extracted features to determine the stress of the plants after subjected to the stressor.

Among available technologies, adsorption is here presented as an effective technology. The aims of this work were to investigate the adsorption capacity, kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, and adsorption energy of Pb2+ by activated carbon (AC) prepared from mangosteen peel (MPAC). Maximum Pb2+ adsorption equal 130 mg g−1 was achieved when using Pb2+ concentration of 50 mg L−1, adsorbent dose of 0.67 mg mL−1, pH of 5, contact time of 180 min, and temperature of 30 °C. The isotherm adsorption was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm. The kinetics adsorption behavior go along with the pseudo-second order model. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔG < 0 and ΔH° = −61.27 kJ mol−1) indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic. The Density-Functional Theory (DFT) calculation was also used to investigate the effect of AC pore size on binding efficiency to Pb2+. DFT calculations revealed that the 0.44 nm micropore AC model has a higher adsorption efficiency than that of the 0.71 nm micropore AC and graphene models due to the stronger ion–dipole interaction and suitable pore size for Pb2+ binding.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental, sociology","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Geography, Planning and Development, Water Science and Technology"

Long mononucleotide A-T repeats are cis-regulatory transcriptional elements that control many genes, increasing the expression of numerous genes in various cancers, including lung cancer. Therefore, targeting A-T repeats may dysregulate many genes driving cancer development. Here, we tested a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligo containing a long A-repeat sequence [A(15)] to disrupt the transcriptional control of the A-T repeat in lung cancer and CSCs. Methods: First, we separated CSCs from parental lung cancer cell lines. Then, we evaluated the role of A-T repeat gene regulation by counting the number of repeats in differentially regulated genes between CSCs and the parental cells of the CSCs. After testing the dosage and effect of PNA-A15 on normal and cancer cell toxicity and CSC phenotypes, we analysed genome-wide expression to identify dysregulated genes in CSCs. Results: The number of A-T repeats in genes differentially regulated between CSCs and parental cells differed. PNA-A15 was toxic to lung cancer cells and CSCs but not to noncancer cells. Finally, PNA-A15 dysregulated a number of genes in lung CSCs. Conclusion: PNA-A15 is a promising novel targeted therapy agent that targets the transcriptional control activity of multiple genes in lung CSCs.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Herein, the oxygen defects have been introduced into V2O5 (V2O5-Od), the experimental studies and first-principles calculations reveal the oxygen defects can enlarge the interlayer spacing (7.58 Å) and significantly lower the Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier (0.72 eV), leading to favorable Zn2+ migration path and fast reactive kinetics. Moreover, a narrower bandgap (0.45 eV) and lower charge transfer resistance are obtained in V2O5-Od, thus accelerating the electron transportation and improving the Zn2+ storage performance (427.3 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g). In addition, the internal structure of V2O5 is well-maintained owing to the greatly reduced formation energy of V2O5-Od (55.04 eV), contributing to outstanding cycling stability (92.1% after 5,000 cycles at 20 A/g), outperforming numerous reported cathodes. Moreover, the pouch cell with V2O5-Od delivers admirable electrochemical performance and modular integration capabilities, suggestive of its excellent practical viability. Therefore, this research highlights the great potential of oxygen defects in designing advanced electrodes and offers a guideline for exploring the working mechanism of defective electrode materials.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Materials Science","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

MOS requires a large number of people to reliably rate each utterance, making the development process slow and expensive. Recent research on speech quality assessment tends to focus on training models to estimate MOS, which requires a large number of training data, something that might not be available in low-resource languages. We propose an objective assessment metric based on the DTW distance using the spectrogram and the high-level features from an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to cover both acoustic and linguistic information. Experiments on Thai TTS and the Blizzard Challenge datasets show that our method outperformed other baselines in both utterance- and system-level by a large margin in terms of correlation coefficients. Our metric also outperformed the best baseline by 9.58% when used in head-to-head utterance-level comparisons. Ablation studies suggest that the middle layers of the ASR model are most suitable for TTS evaluation when used in conjunction with spectral features.","fluidex; related topics, arts, computer science, Mathematics","Language and Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software, Modeling and Simulation"

Interestingly, few data exist on the pathway(s) such as TLR and inflammasome, primarily involved in sensing the microorganisms and inducing downstream inflammatory responses, apoptosis and neuroprogressive changes that drive prenatal infection-induced risk of schizophrenia. Herein, we aimed to discern whether prenatal infection-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) causes schizophrenia-like behaviours through activation of TLR and inflammasome pathways in the brain of offspring. Sprague Dawley rats (n=15/group) were injected either with poly (I:C) or LPS or saline at gestational day (GD)-12. Significantly elevated plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-17A assessed after 24 hours were observed in both the poly (I:C) and LPS-treated rats, while IL-1β was only elevated in LPS-treated rats, indicating MIA. The offspring of poly (I:C)-and LPS-treated dams displayed increased anxiety-like behaviours, deficits in social behaviours and prepulse inhibition. The hippocampus of offspring rats showed increased expression of Tlr3, Tlr4, Nlrp3, Il1b, and Il18 of poly (I:C) and Tlr4, Nlrp3, Cas1, Il1b, and Il18 of LPS-treated dams. Furthermore, Tlr and inflammasome genes were associated with social deficits and impaired prepulse inhibition in offspring rats. The results suggest that MIA due to prenatal infection can trigger TLR and inflammasome pathways and enhances the risk of schizophrenia-like behaviours in the later stages of life of the offspring.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; humoral medicalators of Immunologyne response; other factors, pharmacology, neuroscience, medical","Pharmacology, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry, Pharmacology (medical)"

Formation of the target polymer on substrates is confirmed by Ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, Raman spectroscopy and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Heterogeneous electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous solution under catalysis of the target polymer coated on the carbon paper gives carbon monoxide (CO) as a major product. Controlled potential electrolysis at a constant potential of –0.66 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding an overpotential of –0.54 V from thermodynamic potential for CO production, for 2 h leads to optimum yield of CO with Faradaic efficiency (FE), turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 94%, 2.10 × 103 and 0.29 s–1, respectively. Upon 20-h electrolysis with quantitative product monitoring, the target polymer appears to be stable throughout the process and continuously produces CO with the FE, TON and TOF of 72%, 1.24 × 104 and 0.17 s–1, respectively.

Study Design: Observational cohort study. Setting & Participants: 7,771 hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) participants from 6 countries participating in the Peritoneal and Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Studies (PDOPPS/DOPPS). Predictors: Patient-reported functional status (based on daily living activities), country, demographic and clinical characteristics, and comorbidities. Outcome: Employment status and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) instrument physical and mental component summary scores (PCS, MCS), kidney disease burden score, and depression symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] score > 10). Analytical Approach: Linear regression (PCS, MCS, kidney disease burden score), logistic regression (depression symptoms), adjusted for predictors plus 12 additional comorbidities. Results: In both dialysis modalities, patients in Japan had the highest PCS and employment (55% for HD and 68% for PD), whereas those in the United States had the highest MCS score, lowest kidney disease burden, and lowest employment (20% in HD and 42% in PD). After covariate adjustment, the association of age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and functional status with PROs was similar in both modalities, with women having lower PCS and kidney disease burden scores. Lower functional status (score <11) was strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores, a much greater burden of kidney disease, and greater likelihood of depression symptoms (CES-D, >10). The median change in KDQOL-based PROs was negligible over 1 year in participants who completed at least 2 annual questionnaires. Limitations: Selection bias due to incomplete survey responses. Generalizability was limited to the dialysis populations of the included countries. Conclusions: Variation exists in quality of life, burden of kidney disease, and depression across countries but did not appreciably change over time. Functional status remained one of the strongest predictors of all PROs. Routine assessment of functional status may provide valuable insights for patients and providers in anticipating outcomes and support needs for patients receiving either PD or HD.",medical,Nephrology

However, this method does not always allow for the identification of individual species in goat's RBCs. Moreover, its unreliability in detecting low levels of parasitemia makes it unsuitable for epidemiological investigations and leaves goat farms vulnerable to potential outbreaks. In the present study, a novel multiplex PCR (mPCR) targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was developed to detect and subsequently differentiate Plasmodium caprae, Theileria luwenshuni, and Babesia spp. The specificity of each primer set was assessed both in silico and with a panel of DNA samples from the hosts themselves and other goat hemoparasites. Amplicons generated from each pair of primers were 664, 555, and 320-bp for P. caprae, Babesia spp., and T. luwenshuni, respectively. These products were further confirmed by sequencing. Our novel mPCR reactions successfully demonstrated the accurate and simultaneous amplification of the three parasites’ DNA samples. The current mPCR method showed no cross-amplification with unintended targets. The detection limit of the mPCR in this study was 108 parasites’ DNA copies per reaction. The current mPCR was able to detect the minimum parasitemia of approximately 0.001%, 0.000005%, 0.00001% for P. caprae, Babesia spp. and T. luwenshuni, respectively. The diagnostic specificity in the detection of P. caprae and T. luwenshuni ranged from 94.9 to 100 %. The mPCR was further applied to a collection of field blood samples from five provinces in Thailand to validate its reliability and applicability. The results demonstrated the successful detection of P. caprae, Babesia spp. and T. luwenshuni in goat samples with the same sensitivity levels as conventional PCR methods.

In this study, various host systems, including different avian embryonated eggs (duck and chicken) and cell cultures (primary duck embryo fibroblast (DEF), primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), African green monkey kidney (Vero) and Aedes albopictus clone C6/36 (C6/36) cells), were evaluated and compared for their ability to support DTMUV isolation and propagation. Our results showed that all host systems were susceptible to DTMUV infection; however, BHK-21 and primary DEF cells supported more efficient replication of DTMUV compared to the other host systems. BHK-21 cells had the highest DTMUV isolation rate when tested with experimental and field clinical samples. All circulating phylogenetic clusters of DTMUV, including clusters 1, 2 and 3, were successfully isolated from duck clinical samples using BHK-21 cells. In conclusion, our findings supported the use of BHK-21 cells as a host system for primary isolation of all circulating phylogenetic clusters of DTMUV from duck clinical samples. This study highlights the importance of selecting the most appropriate host system for efficient isolation and propagation of DTMUV from duck clinical samples. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS DTMUV replicated more efficiently in BHK-21 and primary DEF cells than in other host systems tested. BHK-21 cells had the highest DTMUV isolation rate. All DTMUV phylogenetic clusters were successfully isolated from the samples using BHK-21 cells. BHK-21 cells were the most efficient host system for DTMUV isolation.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Immunology and Microbiology (all)"
Ground Motion Parameters and Resonance Effect During Strong Earthquake in Northern Thailand,"Mase L.Z., Likitlersuang S., Tobita T.",2021-03-01,"Earthquake rupture, Ground motion parameters, Horizontal ground motion, Horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios, Micro-tremor measurements, Site investigations, Spectral acceleration, Structural buildings, Ground motion, Microtremor, Northern Thailand, Resonance, Tarlay Earthquake","Several previous investigations have suggested that ground motion as described by various parameters and resonance effects could have contributed to the damage observed during an earthquake. This paper presents a ground motion parameters study and site investigation in Northern Thailand during the Tarlay Earthquake of 2011. Ground motion parameters recorded at the closest seismic station to the earthquake rupture, i.e. Mae Sai Station (MSAA) are studied. Microtremor measurement was performed at the MSAA site. The horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (H/V) from the investigation are interpreted. Spectral acceleration ratios based on data from the MSAA are compared to determine the possibility of resonance during the earthquake. Spectral acceleration data based on recorded ground motion are compared to guideline design spectral acceleration to determine the critical period. Results show that during the Tarlay Earthquake, significant duration was 24 s. Within this duration, resonance was plausible within the frequency range of 1.82 to 2.1 The critical period ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 s, indicating that low-medium story buildings were most vulnerable. Results also show that horizontal ground motion was relatively dominant in the destruction of structural buildings during the earthquake.","mechanics, fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"
A colorimetric paper-based optode sensor for highly sensitive and selective determination of thiocyanate in urine sample using cobalt porphyrin derivative,"Wirojsaengthong S., Aryuwananon D., Aeungmaitrepirom W., Pulpoka B., Tuntulani T.",2021-08-15,"Cobaltporphyrin, Colorimetric detection, Naked-eye, Optodes, Paper-based optode sensor, Porphyrin cobalt(II) complex, Selective determination, Thiocyanate, Tridodecylmethylammonium chlorides, Urine sample, Cobalt, Colorimetry, Ionophores, Porphyrins, Thiocyanates, Colorimetric detection, Naked-eye, Paper-based optode sensor, Porphyrin cobalt(II) complex, Thiocyanate","In this work, a highly sensitive colorimetric paper-based optode for the determination of thiocyanate in urine samples was developed for the first time. The cocktail solution of the optode was composed of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-octyloxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) complex (L), tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMACl), 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether, and polyvinyl chloride as an ionophore, an ion exchanger, a plasticizer, and a polymer, respectively. The paper-based optode responded to thiocyanate by increasing the blue component in the RGB index and a visible change, with the naked-eye, of the optode color from pink to green was observed. From the central composite design, the optimized conditions that yielded the highest sensitivity were 4.70 mmol/kg TDMACl and 13.75 mmol/kg L. The developed optode sensor was highly selective and responded to thiocyanate over other anions, with a working range of 0.001–5 mM and with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9915. The limits of detection using naked-eye and camera were determined to be 50.0 μM and 1.26 μM, respectively. In addition, the LOD and LOQ estimated from the standard deviation of the blank were 0.65 and 1.87 μM, respectively. Furthermore, this sensor was successfully applied to the detection of thiocyanate in urine samples from non-smokers and smokers. The results were in good agreement with the standard ion chromatography (IC) technique. This developed paper-based optode sensor was simple, low-cost, portable, and easy to use as a sensing device without any complicated instrument.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

In recent study, utilizing a single 3-aminophenylboronic acid (3-APBA) to create imprinted surfaces could result in a strong interaction and difficulty in removal of a template molecule. Hence, a mixture of monomer solution containing 3-APBA and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) in the presence of the L-hyp molecule was co-electropolymerized onto the screen-printed electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) to eradicate this mentioned limitation. The detection principle of this sensor is relied on alteration of mediator's charge transfer resistance (Rct) that could be obstructed by L-hyp occupied in imprinted surface. The successfully fabricated biosensor was explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and confocal scanning microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of polymer composition on the Rct response was systematically investigated. The result exhibited that the mixture of monomers could provide the highest change of Rct due to high selectivity from esterification of 3-APBA and from hydrogen bond of OPD surrounding the template. The sensor showed a significant increase in Rct in the presence of L-hyp, whereas no observable resistance change was detected in the absence thereof. The calibration curve was obtained in the range from 0.4 to 25 μg mL−1 with limits of detection (3SDblank/Slope) and quantification (10SDblank/Slope) of 0.13 and 0.42 μg mL−1, respectively. This biosensor exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity and was successfully applied to determine L-hyp in human serum samples with satisfactory results.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexation is a method of choice for reducing side effects and improving bioavailability of drugs. Here, we investigate in-depth the β-CD encapsulation of sertraline (STL) HCl (1) and fluoxetine (FXT) HCl (2) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT complete-geometry optimization, in comparison to the reported complex of paroxetine (PXT) base. X-ray analysis unveiled the 2:2 β-CD–STL/FXT complexes with two drug molecules inserting their halogen-containing aromatic ring in the β-CD dimeric cavity, which are stabilized by the interplay of intermolecular O2–H⋯N1–H⋯O3 H-bonds, C3/C5–H⋯π and halogen⋯halogen interactions. Similarly, the 1:1 β-CD–tricyclic-antidepressant (TCA) complexes have an exclusive inclusion mode of the aromatic ring, which is maintained by C3/C5–H⋯π interactions. By contrast, the 2:1 β-CD–PXT complex has a total inclusion that is stabilized by host–guest O6–H⋯N1–H⋯O5 H-bonds and C3–H⋯π interactions. The inherent stabilization energies of 1 and 2 evaluated using DFT calculation suggested that the improved thermodynamic stabilities via CD encapsulation facilitates the reduction of drug side effects. Moreover, the SSRI conformational flexibilities are thoroughly discussed for understanding of their pharmacoactivity.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

The tensile modulus and strength of a PVA fiber were greatly enhanced irrespective of the post-spinning hot-stretching process. The high degree of molecular orientation arose from the reduction in the crystallinity and hydrogen bonding between PVA chains in the solution resulting from the addition of LiBr, which was revealed by the rheological properties of aqueous solutions. The LiBr was removed from the fiber during the spinning process in the coagulation bath, and during the washing process. This ensures strong hydrogen bonding in the fibers, and results in excellent mechanical properties.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

However, its wide applicability is limited by its availability, logistics and financial implications. Use of alternative imaging like CTand Ultrasound (US) for IGABT has been attempted. In order to arrive at a systematic, uniform and international approach for CT based definition and contouring of target structures, GEC ESTRO, IBS and ABS agreed to jointly develop such recommendations based on the concepts and terms as published in the ICRU Report 89. The minimum requirements are clinical examination & documentation, CT or MR imaging at diagnosis and at a minimum, CT imaging with the applicator in place. The recommendations are based on (i) assessment of the GTV at diagnosis and at brachytherapy, (ii) categorizing the response to external radiation into different clinical remission patterns, (iii) defining various clinico-radiological environments and (iv) definition & delineation of a target on CT imaging at the time of brachytherapy with the applicator in situ. CT based target contouring recommendations based on 4 remission categories within 8 defined environments, aim at improving the contouring accuracy for IGABT using CT, US and MRI as available. For each clinico-radiological environment, there is an attempt to minimize the specific uncertainties in order to arrive at the best possible contouring accuracy.

Methods: In order to investigate the optimal condition in operating the AD/OD-MBR system to lower organic waste pollution to promote sustainable urban development, LCA with SimaPro 8 software was used to evaluate the environmental impact such as global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials for six different operating conditions of AD/OD-MBR system for management of food waste and building wastewater. Results and Discussion: The evaluation by LCA shows that the proposed AD/OD-MBR system can effectively control the environmental impact from liquid digestate and sludge that are discharged into environment. The eutrophication potential of the integrated AD/OD-MBR system is reduced to the lowest value of 4.66 kg PO43−as compared to the values of 713.77 and 75.12 kg PO43− that are obtained from sole OD-MBR and sole AD, respectively. Moreover, global warming potential of AD/OD-MBR is lower than that of AD system. Conclusions: The proposed integrated AD/OD-MBR system can efficiently minimize the impacts from global warming and eutrophication potentials. It can be a model of prototype zero-organic waste for building water and organic waste management with water recycling for garden and landscape use.

"Caregiver burden and associated factors for the respite care needs among the family caregivers of community dwelling senior citizens in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand","Aung T.N.N., Aung M.N., Moolphate S., Koyanagi Y., Supakankunti S., Yuasa M.",2021-06-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Caregiver Burden, Caregivers, Female, Humans, Independent Living, Middle Aged, Respite Care, Thailand, Aging, Asia, Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Community integrated intermediary care (CIIC), Long-term care, Respite care","Background: Families are the backbone of caregiving for older adults living in communities. This is a tradition common to Thailand and many low-and middle-income countries where formal long-term care services are not so available or accessible. Therefore, population aging demands more and more young people engaging as family caregivers. Informal caregiving can become an unexpected duty for anyone anytime. However, studies measuring the burden of informal caregivers are limited. We aimed to determine the caregiver burden, both from the perspective of the caregivers as well as that of their care recipients. Method: We used the baseline survey data from a cluster randomized controlled trial providing a community integrated intermediary care (CIIC) service for seniors in Chiang Mai, Thailand, TCTR20190412004. Study participants were 867 pairs of older adults and their primary family caregivers. Descriptive analysis explored the characteristics of the caregivers and binary logistic regression identified factors influencing the caregivers’ burden. Results: The mean age of family caregivers was 55.27 ± 13.7 years and 5.5% indicated the need for respite care with Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) scores ≥24. The highest burden was noted in the time-dependence burden domain (25.7%). The significant associated factors affecting CBI ≥24 were as follows: caregivers older than 60 years, being female, current smokers, having diabetes, and caring for seniors with probable depression and moderate to severe dependency. Conclusions: A quarter of caregivers can have their careers disturbed because of the time consumed with caregiving. Policies to assist families and interventions, such as respite service, care capacity building, official leave for caregiving, etc., may reduce the burden of families struggling with informal care chores. Furthermore, caregiver burden measurements can be applied as a screening tool to assess long-term care needs, complementing the dependency assessment. Finally, implementation research is required to determine the effectiveness of respite care services for older people in Thailand.","genergyal, public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This paper aims at developing a novel biorefinery-integrated-Kraft-pulping network with improved profitability, energy self-sufficiency and minimum CO2 emission by employing technologies consisting of biofuel and biochemical productions, biomass gasification together with CO2 capture and utilization. Three scenarios, including (I) the production of gasification-based dimethyl ether (DME); (II) the co-production of DME and succinic acid; and (III) the co-production of DME and succinic acid coupled with the CO2 utilization, have been investigated. Among all scenarios, Scenario II exhibits the best economic performances as highlighted by the 74% increase of profit compared to the conventional process. Scenario III achieves the highest energy efficiency at 39% and an improved environmental performance due to the 65% reduction of CO2 emission compared to the conventional process with only 0.7% profit reduction.

Compared with patients without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD had significantly higher body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) (median, 0.94 [IQR, 1.30-2.62] vs 0.13 [IQR, −0.69 to 0.84]; P = .01), ALT (median, 17 IU/L [IQR, 16-52 IU/L] vs 12 IU/L [IQR, 10-14 IU/L]; P = .02), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (median, 49 mg/dL [IQR, 41-51 mg/dL] vs 57 mg/dL [IQR, 52-69 mg/dL]; P = .039). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified high BMI-SDS as the sole independent risk factor associated with NAFLD (OR, 5.79; 95% CI, 1.04-32.18). Conclusion: The prevalence of NAFLD in children and young adults with T1D was comparable to that in the general population. Our study suggests that routine screening for NAFLD in patients with T1D might not be necessary but should be performed in those patients with T1D who are overweight/obese.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; endocrine pancreas; diabetes, insulin, and glucose tolerance, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"
Sulfonated graphene oxide from petrochemical waste oil for efficient conversion of fructose into levulinic acid,"Lawagon C.P., Faungnawakij K., Srinives S., Thongratkaew S., Chaipojjana K., Smuthkochorn A., Srisrattha P., Charinpanitkul T.",2021-09-01,"Biomass conversion, Environmentally benign, High surface area, ITS applications, Levulinic acid, Petrochemical wastes, Platform chemicals, Sheet-like structure, Catalyst, Fructose, Levulinic acid, Petrochemical waste oil, Sulfonated graphene oxide","Handling of petrochemical waste oil (PWO) is costly, tedious, and risky to human health and environment. Hence, upcycling of PWO for biomass conversion to platform chemicals would be very advantageous. Herein, a highly porous sheet-like structure of sulfonated graphene oxide (sGO) catalyst was synthesized from PWO. The synthesized sGO possessed high surface area (246.2 m2 g1) due to its mesoporosity and high content of sulfonic groups (2.4 mmol g−1) grafted onto its surface. As its application, the synthesized sGO was employed to convert fructose to levulinic acid (LA) within deionized water. The high yield (61.2 mol %) of LA was obtained under a condition of 160 °C, 1 h, and 6 g g−1 fructose to sGO weight ratio. It can be reused several times (5 runs) with no severe degradation of catalytic activity. Therefore, the sGO derived from petrochemical waste oil would be considered as an environmentally benign catalyst for producing platform chemicals, i.e. LA from fructose and other biomass derivatives.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; liquid wastes, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
High-power short duration and low-power long duration in atrial fibrillation ablation: A meta-analysis,"Kewcharoen J., Techorueangwiwat C., Kanitsoraphan C., Leesutipornchai T., Akoum N., Bunch T., Navaravong L.",2021-01-01,"Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Flutter, Catheter Ablation, Heart Atria, Humans, Treatment Outcome, atrial fibrillation ablation, high power, low power","Background: Multiple strategies have advocation for power titration and catheter movement during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Comparative favoring evidence regarding the efficacy, logistics, and safety of a higher-power, shorter duration (HPSD) ablation strategy compared to a lower-power, longer duration (LPLD) ablation strategy is insubstantial. We performed a meta-analysis to compare arrhythmia-free survival, procedure times, and complication rates between the two strategies. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from inception to September 2020. We included studies comparing patients who underwent HPSD and LPLD strategies for AF ablation and reporting either of the following outcomes: Freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) including AF and atrial flutter, procedure time, or periprocedural complications. We combined data using the random-effects model to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and weight mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Ten studies from 2006 to 2020 involving 2274 patients were included (1393 patients underwent HPSD strategy and 881 patients underwent LPLD strategy). HPSD strategy was not associated with increased freedom from AT at 12-month follow-up (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.99 to 2.40, p =.054). In the subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled trial, the HPSD strategy was associated with increased freedom from AT compared to the LPLD strategy (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.18 to 8.20, p =.02). There was a significant reduction in the HPSD group for the total procedure (WMD = 49.60, 95% CI: 29.76 to 69.44) and ablation (WMD = 17.92, 95% CI: 13.63 to 22.22) times, but not for fluoroscopy time (WMD = 1.15, 95% CI: −0.67 to 2.97). HPSD was not associated with a reduction in esophageal ulcer/atrioesophageal fistula (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.06) or pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade rates (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.81). Conclusions: When compared to the LPLD strategy, the HPSD strategy does not improve recurrent AT nor reduce periprocedural complication risks. However, subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled trial showed that HPSD significantly reduces AT recurrence. An HPSD strategy can significantly reduce total procedure and ablation times.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

Candida administration in bilateral nephrectomy mice elevates serum (1→3)-β-d-glucan that enhances systemic inflammation through energy augmentation in macrophages,"Issara-Amphorn J., Dang C.P., Saisorn W., Limbutara K., Leelahavanichkul A.",2021-05-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Animals, Candida, Candida albicans, Dysbiosis, Energy Metabolism, Humans, Inflammation, Lipopolysaccharides, Macrophages, Mice, Microbiota, Nephrectomy, Proteoglycans, (1→3)-β-D-glucan, Bilateral nephrectomy, Candida, Endotoxin, Uremia mice","Systemic inflammation, from gut translocation of organismal molecules, might worsen uremic complications in acute kidney injury (AKI). The monitoring of gut permeability integrity and/or organismal molecules in AKI might be clinically beneficial. Due to the less prominence of Candida albicans in human intestine compared with mouse gut, C. albicans were orally administered in bilateral nephrectomy (BiN) mice. Gut dysbiosis, using microbiome analysis, and gut permeability defect (gut leakage), which was determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and intestinal tight-junction immunofluorescent staining, in mice with BiN-Candida was more severe than BiN without Candida. Additionally, profound gut leakage in BiN-Candida also resulted in gut translocation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), the organismal components from gut contents, that induced more severe systemic inflammation than BiN without Candida. The co-presentation of LPS and BG in mouse serum enhanced inflammatory responses. As such, LPS with Whole Glucan Particle (WGP, a representative BG) induced more severe macrophage responses than LPS alone as determined by supernatant cytokines and gene expression of downstream signals (NFκB, Malt-1 and Syk). Meanwhile, WGP alone did not induced the responses. In parallel, WGP (with or without LPS), but not LPS alone, accelerated macrophage ATP production (extracellular flux analysis) through the upregulation of genes in mitochondria and glycolysis pathway (using RNA sequencing analysis), without the induction of cell activities. These data indicated a WGP pre-conditioning effect on cell energy augmentation. In conclusion, Candida in BiN mice accelerated gut translocation of BG that augmented cell energy status and enhanced pro-inflammatory macrophage responses. Hence, gut fungi and BG were associated with the enhanced systemic inflammation in acute uremia.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

However, oral administration of EOs has limited practicality because of their high volatility, odor, rapid decomposition, and poor bioavailability in the lower part of the intestines. The main objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate an innovative tool for targeted delivery and sustained release of EOs in the gastrointestinal tract by using a nano/microstructured hybrid composite system. Cinnamon oil was used as a plant-derived antimicrobial agent model to prepare the nanoparticles via the hot homogenization technique. The prepared nanoparticles were then encapsulated in microparticles using an alginate-calcium chloride system. Their stability was investigated in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. The particles were also physicochemically characterized and biologically evaluated as antibacterial agents against foodborne pathogens. Our results showed that under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, the nano/microstructured hybrid composite particles exhibited good gastric resistance and sustained release in intestinal fluids. They also exhibited excellent antibacterial characteristics against important foodborne pathogens, namely, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, S. enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae. In conclusion, the innovation reported in the present study is an improved formula of cinnamon oil that could serve as a promising candidate as an antibacterial bioproduct for decontamination of foodborne pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

The aim was to identify factors associated with recurrent knee FC after surgery. Methods: The records of 62 CCP (age 10.6±2.6 years) who underwent surgery and were followed for > six months were reviewed. Knee FC was treated by hamstring lengthening, posterior knee capsulotomy, and femoral shortening/extension osteotomy until full extension was obtained. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of the correction being maintained. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to compare parameters between patients with and without recurrent knee FC, with the time to recurrence as the endpoint. Potential confounding factors were included in the multivariate analysis. Results: In total, the procedure was performed on 122 knees. The average weight-for-age z score was −1.3±1.2. The average follow-up period was 5.4±4.2 years. Knee FC recurrence was observed in 37 knees (30%). The average recurrence-free time was 4.9 years, with most cases of recurrence (33 knees) occurring within six years after surgery. The factors associated with recurrence were age (HR, 1.19) and a required posterior knee capsulotomy procedure (HR, 4.53). Conclusion: Recurrent knee FC after correction is associated with CCP who are older at the time of operation and when posterior knee capsulotomy is performed. The age at operation should be optimized. The sequence of procedures should be performed only as necessary to minimize the chance of post-operative muscle weakness and recurrence.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

The underlying mathematical models for the bulk and the surface material are formulated, respectively, from the couple-stress and Gurtin-Murdoch surface-elasticity theories. A general solution for the elastic field within the bulk is derived in a closed form via the method of Fourier integral transform. All involved unknown coefficients are also determined in a closed form by enforcing the boundary conditions together with the continuity along the surface-bulk interface and the surface governing equation. An efficient quadrature is then adopted to numerically evaluate all involved integrals resulting from Fourier integral inversions. Results from an extensive numerical study have clearly reflected the crucial role of both surface and couple stresses on the elastic response of the half plane as well as the size-dependent characteristics of predicted solutions when the size of loading region is comparable to the internal length scales of the bulk and surface materials.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

The TMB was used as a swelling agent and P123 acted as template-structuring. The physicochemical properties of synthesized catalysts were determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD). The evidence suggested that various ratios of TMB/P123 can differently control the mesostructure including the pore size, specific surface area, and pore volume. Particularly, MCF-C 3.5 catalyst (TMB/P123 of 3.5) enhanced the catalytic via ethanol dehydrogenation. Interestingly, effectively controllable pore structure of catalysts is beneficial for the desorption of selective product such as acetaldehyde leading to remarkably increased yield of acetaldehyde. Furthermore, the MCF-C 3.5 evidently exhibited outstanding stability at temperature of 400 °C for 12 h. Thus, it can be reasonably selected the ratio of TMB/P123 as 3.5, which is dominantly facilitated either high diffusion of reactant or high stability without losing of the traditional structure compared with other ratios of TMB/P123.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Importantly, the d-band center of TM atom can serve as an ideal descriptor for the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates. Such superb catalytic activity can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of TM and g-CN, which can effectively guarantee outstanding conductivity and electron transfer, thus tuning the interaction strength of adsorbates and optimizing the catalytic performance.

Unfortunately, the real estate data in many locations, such as Thailand, are quite limited in terms of features. Hence, it becomes mandatory to reduce the complexity using feature selection techniques. These techniques aim to improve performance by identifying significant factors and help decrease the computational overload and model construction. However, due to the lack of explicability and interpretability in ANNs, the analysis of input factors cannot be explained directly by model composition. In this research, we apply a combination of a boosting strategy and input sensitivity analysis in an improved Garson's algorithm to perform feature selection that can adjust its selection criteria through each iteration on an ANN model. This proposed technique is then compared with other traditional feature selection techniques using synthetic data and real-world house valuation data. The results show that our model can maintain the sensitivity coefficient for every informative feature. The technique of this study provides a set of features that influences the house price and implies the character of each specific area. It also contributes to statistical improvement in most valuation cases, with a lower error than that obtained without a selected feature dataset, and it placed in the top 24% of the public leaderboard in the Zillow Prize competition. &copy; 2021 IEEE.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Polypropylene is a promising material, considering its 3D printed mechanical properties are as high as those from traditional manufacturing, yet, still exhibiting dimensional instabilities. In this work, we solve this instability problem by reinforcing PP with microcapsules. These microcapsules comprise polylactic acid (PLA) and reduced graphene oxide, confirmed by x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. By first encapsulating graphene with PLA, once melt-compounded, our scanning and transmitting electron microscopy shows that the PLA-graphene microcapsules are well dispersed throughout the PP main matrix. Our rheological analysis shows that our PP nanocomposites exhibit high melt elasticity, giving better support to printing constructs, and low viscosity, promoting printability, avoiding nozzle clogging and filament buckling. At 30% volume fraction, our nanocomposites also outperform the neat PP in mechanical testing.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methodology: Participants were newly diagnosed with moderate or severe OSA from the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Respiratory parameters from polysomnography were extracted. Each participant was tested on a battery of neuropsychological tests and underwent an MRI scan of the brain. Cortical thickness analysis and diffusion tensor imaging analysis were performed. Participants were classified as having either severe or mild hypoxia based on parameters of hypoxia, i.e., oxygen desaturation index, lowest oxygen saturation, and the percentage of total sleep time spent below 90% oxygen saturation. Results: Of 17 patients with OSA, there were 8 men (47%). Median age was 57 years and median AHI was 60.6. Comparison of cortical thickness between the severe and the mild group of each hypoxic parameter revealed two clusters of cortical thinning at the right inferior frontal gyrus (p-value = 0.008) and right inferior parietal gyrus (p-value = 0.006) in the severe desaturation group and a cluster of cortical thinning at the superior parietal gyrus (p-value = 0.008) in the high oxygen desaturation index group. There was no difference in cognitive function or white matter integrity between groups.

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of MDCT for diagnosis of ICI-related colitis was 81% (58/72), 52 % (24/46), 73% (58/80), and 63% (24/38), respectively. Small bowel involvement was visualized in 25% of cases with ICI-related colitis (18/72). In melanoma patients presenting with diarrhea grade ≥ 2 (n = 40), MDCT had the best diagnostic performance for ICI-related colitis (specificity = 80% [8/10], PPV = 92% [23/25]). MDCT severity scores predicted intravenous steroid use (OR 10.3, p = 0.004), length of stay > 7 days (OR 9.0, p < 0.001), and endoscopic mucosal ulceration (OR 4.7, p = 0.02). Conclusion: MDCT is a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool for evaluating patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-related colitis. An MDCT-based severity score enables assessment of disease severity and predicts outcome. Key Points: • MDCT is useful for the diagnosis of colitis in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, and an MDCT-based severity score allows for prognostication of patient outcomes. • MDCT yielded moderate sensitivity (81%) for diagnosis of ICI-related colitis but limited specificity (52%). However, in symptomatic melanoma patients (grade 2–4 diarrhea) with a high pretest probability, MDCT proved useful for diagnosis with a high PPV (92%). • For ICI-related colitis, our proposed MDCT severity score has prognostic value in predicting intravenous steroid use, prolonged length of stay during inpatient admission (> 7 days), and endoscopic mucosal ulceration.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
Interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training for cardiorespiratory fitness improvements in middle-aged and older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Poon E.T.-C., Wongpipit W., Ho R.S.-T., Wong S.H.-S.",2021-01-01,"Aged, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, High-Intensity Interval Training, Humans, Middle Aged, Oxygen Consumption, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, aerobic fitness, continuous exercise, HIIT, interval exercise, public health","Interval training has been promoted as a superior, time-efficient exercise strategy for enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness in the ageing population. This study assessed the effectiveness of interval training compared with that of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in middle-aged and older adults. Six databases were systematically searched for studies with exercise interventions (minimum 2-week duration). Meta-analyses were conducted for within-group and between-group comparisons of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Sub-group analysis was performed using the nature of interval training (high-intensity interval training [HIIT] and sprint interval training [SIT]). Of 3,257 studies, 14 were included (429 participants). Within–group analyses demonstrated significant VO2max improvements (mL/kg/min) following interval training (mean difference: MD = 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50–3.02) and MICT (MD = 1.34; 95% CI = 0.45–2.23]. When comparing the modes of training, the gain in VO2max was significantly greater following interval training (MD = 1.10; CI = 0.55-1.64). Sub–group analysis showed that HIIT (MD = 1.04; CI = 0.21–1.88) and SIT (MD = 1.18; CI = 0.60-1.76) resulted in superior VO2max gain than MICT. This study provides evidence synthesis for interval training as a viable exercise strategy to improve cardiorespiratory function in healthy ageing.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"
Iterative LMI approach to robust static output feedback control of uncertain polynomial systems with bounded actuators,"Jennawasin T., Banjerdpongchai D.",2021-01-01,"Parameter dependent Lyapunov function, Parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality, Parametric uncertainties, Static output feedback, Static output feedback control, Static output-feedback stabilization, Sum-of-squares techniques, Uncertain polynomials, Control input constraints, Iterative LMI, Parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions, Polynomial systems, Stabilization, Static output feedback, Sum-of-squares","This paper presents a novel static output feedback stabilization of polynomial systems with bounded actuators. We propose a new sufficient condition for static output feedback design for nominal polynomial systems with constraints on input magnitudes. In the proposed stabilization condition, the system matrices and the Lyapunov matrices are separated, and hence parameterization of the controller is independent of the Lyapunov matrices. The main result is the novel parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions that are readily applied to robust static output feedback design of polynomial systems subject to parametric uncertainty. The proposed design conditions are bilinear in the decision variables. Hence, we provide iterative algorithms to solve the design problems. At each iteration, the design condition is cast as parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities using the sum-of-squares technique and can be efficiently solved. The proposed approach leads to enhanced static output feedback design with computationally tractable formulation. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural production from hexose sugars using adjustable acid- and base-functionalized mesoporous SBA-15 catalysts in aqueous media,"Thunyaratchatanon C., Sinsakullert W., Luengnaruemitchai A., Faungnawakij K.",2021-10-01,"5 hydroxymethyl furfurals, Aqueous media, Catalyst performance, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, Functionalized SBA-15, Reactant concentrations, Reaction temperature, Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Aqueous media, Fructose, Functionalized SBA-15, Glucose, HMF","The conversion of glucose and fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was investigated using a series of functionalized SBA-15 catalysts in a glass tube reactor. The synthesized SBA-15 as a support was grafted with various organosilanes in order to acquire the acid-modified SBA-15 (SBA-A), acid- and hydrophobicity-modified SBA-15 (SBA-AC), and base-modified SBA-15 (SBA-N) catalysts. Effects of the reaction temperature and time, reactant concentration, and catalyst loading level on the catalyst performances in this reaction, in terms of the hexose conversion level, product yield, and selectivity, were evaluated. The prepared catalysts were extensively characterized by X-ray diffractometry, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, CHN/S elemental analysis, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, and acid–base titration. The hexose-to-HMF reaction was greatly enhanced by increasing the reaction temperature, whereas the other factors had only a minor effect. In the case of the glucose-to-HMF production, the SBA-N catalyst exhibited reasonably high levels of glucose conversion and HMF yield, but its catalytic activity was pretty low for the fructose-to-HMF reaction. Herein, fructose was identified as an intermediate substance for further dehydration to HMF. The different catalyst types provided different functions, where isomerization required a basic property, whereas dehydration was optimal over an acidic one. Suppression of the levulinic acid formation was obtained via an increased hydrophobicity of the SBA-AC catalyst.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected using a structured record form. Patients were divided into FPU group and normal group. A univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of predictor variables.Results.FPU occurred in 82 patients (27.3%), 129 zones, and 151 lesions. The average age was 61.9 years (11-89), the average operating time was 3.8hours (3-8.3). The locations of FPU were the forehead, maxillary, and chin zone (33.3%, 34.1%, and 32.5%, respectively). The severity was mostly stage I or II except one patient who developed stage III on the entire face. Patients in the FPU group had significant difference in: operation time (4.4 vs. 3.6hours), anesthetic time (5.2 vs. 4.0hours), hypotension (79% vs. 56%), lowest blood pressure, total blood loss, total crystalloid, colloid and blood replacement, highest temperature (36.5 C° vs. 36.2 C°) compared to the normal group (P<0.05).

Comparison of three filter paper-based devices for safety and stability of viral sample collection in poultry,"Wannaratana S., Thontiravong A., Pakpinyo S.",2021-01-01,"Animals, DNA, Viral, Herpesvirus 2, Gallid, Limit of Detection, Marek Disease, Newcastle Disease, Newcastle disease virus, Poultry, Poultry Diseases, Specimen Handling, Virus Inactivation, CVI988, DNA stability, dried blood spot card, Flinders Technology Associates filter card, NDV, qualitative filter paper, safety","General diagnosis of poultry viruses primarily relies on detection of viruses in samples, but many farms are located in remote areas requiring logistic transportation. Filter paper cards are a useful technology that offer an alternative for collecting and preserving samples without hazardous exposure. The goal of this study was to compare three filter papers: the Flinders Technology Associates filter (FTA®) card, dried blood spot (DBS) card and qualitative filter paper (FP) grade 2 to collect poultry samples. In particular, we have used Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to evaluate safety and a Marek’s disease virus (MDV) attenuated vaccine (CVI988) to evaluate stability of viral DNA. This experiment was divided into two parts. The first part was to determine the DNA stability and detection limit of CVI988 in samples collected in different paper supports after four storage times (3, 7, 14 and 30 days post spot). The second part was to determine the safety of papers by evaluating the viral inactivation efficacy using NDV as a representative virus. Results showed that all papers could preserve CVI988 DNA at all times, with a detection limit of 0.5 PFU/5 µl for FTA® and DBS cards, and 5 PFU/5 µl for FP. Our results showed that the NDV remained viable and infectious on the DBS card and FP, while no viable virus was detected on the FTA® card, suggesting that the FTA® card was safest to use. Therefore, the use of the DBS card and FP for infectious sample collection should be discouraged and reconsidered. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS The detection limits of the FTA® card, DBS card and FP for CVI988 detection were 0.5, 0.5 and 5PFU/5µl, respectively. All three filter papers could preserve viral DNA for at least 30 days of post spot. The DBS card and FP are not suitable for collecting NDV samples, which is one of the major economical threats for the poultry industry worldwide.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Immunology and Microbiology (all)"
Supercritical reaction between methanol and glycerol: The effects of reaction products on biodiesel properties,"Sakdasri W., Ngamprasertsith S., Saengsuk P., Sawangkeaw R.",2021-12-01,"Biodiesel production, Biodiesel properties, Glycerol conversions, Glycerol reaction, Molar ratio, Non-catalytic, Production process, Supercritical methanol, Supercritical reactions, Transesterifications, Biodiesel, Biofuel, Glycerol, Supercritical methanol, Transesterification","This work investigated the supercritical reaction between glycerol and supercritical methanol (SCM) in non-catalytic biodiesel production process. Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production that could react with SCM, producing glycerol ethers (GEs). Simultaneous conversion of triglycerides and glycerol in SCM is promising to reduce the glycerol surplus. These GEs are completely miscible with biodiesel and work as fuel enhancer. In a batch reactor, the glycerol reaction with SCM was investigated between 325 °C and 400 °C. The methanol-to-glycerol molar ratios and reaction time were varied from 3:1 to 9:1 and 8 min to 12 min, respectively. It was observed that the reactions of glycerol and SCM were etherification, dehydration, and thermal decomposition of glycerol. At molar ratios of 3:1 and 6:1, the temperature and reaction time significantly enhanced the glycerol conversion, especially by the thermal decomposition reaction. The increasing methanol-to-glycerol molar ratios reduced the overall glycerol conversion. The maximum glycerol conversion of 46.40% was observed at reaction temperature of 400 °C, methanol-to-glycerol molar ratio of 3:1, and reaction time of 12 min. Besides, the effects of GEs-to-neat biodiesel (B100) volumetric ratios on the fuel properties were investigated. The blending of GEs positively improved the viscosity and cloud point, whereas it had no impact on the heating value and flash point.",energy,"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, studies on the load bearing capacity of cellular columns or beam-columns are still lacking. This study aimed to examine efficiency of using EN 1993-1-1 and ANSI/AISC 360-16 to design the load bearing capacity about major axis of pin-pin supported and doubly symmetric cellular beam-columns. An examination was conducted through a parametric study of finite element (FE) analyses validated by eight tested beam-columns. The investigated parameters were steel sections, opening geometries and slenderness. For cellular columns, the design buckling strengths are less conservative than with regular columns. Differences between the design and FE strengths are from −7.2% to +6.1% for the EN method and from −11.4% to +6.3% for the AISC method. A narrow web post and a large opening diameter affect the conservatism level. Since computation of the EN reduction factor is more sensitive to opening parameters, the EN deviation is more scattered than the AISC deviation at a given slenderness. For cellular beam-columns, differences between the design and FE interaction moment at a given compression are from −4.6% to +9.0% for the EN method and from +3.5% to +15.6% for the AISC method. The design estimates move from conservative for regular beam-columns to non-conservative for cellular beam-columns. Since buckling around the opening is not considered in the AISC and EN methods, the interactions are overestimated in design estimates. The interaction factor computation in each method also affects the difference. To provide more accurate interaction results, a modified AISC interaction criterion is proposed.","structural design, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

Methods: This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded parallel design. Subjects were pulmonary TB patients, new or re-treatment, aged 18 years or older. The eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either the study group or the control group using stratified blocked randomization. The add-on DPI of combined anti-TB therapy (each capsule contained isoniazid 5 mg, rifampicin 2 mg, pyrazinamide 16 mg, and levofloxacin 2 mg) was used throughout the course of the standard oral anti-TB treatment. The primary outcome was Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) sputum culture conversion measured after receiving treatment for eight weeks. Secondary outcomes were clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to anti-TB agents. The percentages of patients who achieved the primary outcome were compared (95% confidence interval). All analyses were performed using the modified intention-to-treat principle. Results: 91 patients were randomly allocated: 44 to the study group and 47 to the control group. Important baseline data (%peak expiratory flow rate, chest X-ray findings, resistance to anti-TB agents, renal and liver function tests) were similar between the two groups. Although the percentages of patients who achieved the primary outcome were similar in both groups (34/44 [77.3%] in the study group and (34/47 [72.3%] in the control group; relative risk [RR] 1.07, 95% CI 0.84–1.36; p = 0.589), the study group patients seemed to achieve the primary outcome earlier than the control group (22/44 [50.0%] vs 15/47 [31.9%]; RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.94–2.61; p = 0.079) at the end of week 4. Cough was significantly lower in the study group than in the control group (23/44 [52.3%] vs 43/47 [91.5%]; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43–0.77; p < 0.001) at week 4 of treatment. Hemoptysis was found in approximately half of each group at baseline. The percentage of patients having hemoptysis was substantially reduced at week 2 of treatment (5 [11.4%] in the study group and 11 [23.0%] in the control group, p = 0.132). Regarding safety outcomes, no dyspnea or severe ADRs were reported. Adverse events (AEs) related to oral anti-TB agents, (e.g. liver function tests) were in normal ranges in most patients in both groups during the treatment. The incidences of common AEs reported (e.g. anorexia, dizziness, numbness, arthralgia, rash, and itching) were similar between the two groups, while the incidences of nausea and vomiting were significantly lower in the study group than the control group (38.6% vs 74.5%, p = 0.001, and 43.2% vs 66.0%, p = 0.029, respectively). Conclusions: Add-on combined anti-TB DPI therapy to the standard oral anti-TB treatment did not increase MTB sputum culture conversion at two months of treatment. However, the percentage of patients having cough in the study group was significantly lower than in the control group at two months after treatment. A reduction in cough might represent adequate response to treatment, and result in a decreased risk of spread of infection. Combined anti-TB DPI therapy was safe. Further study investigated in a larger sample using higher strengths of DPI therapy is required.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

The unavoidable consequence is iron overload. Iron chelation therapy is the mainstay of treatment, of which the favorable outcome depends mainly on adherence level. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to iron chelation therapy of TDT patients. A cross-sectional cohort of TDT patients were evaluated on their adherence to chelation therapy using the Thai version of Morisky Medication Adherence Scales (MMAS-8). A total of 70 patients (38 males, 32 females), with a median age of 10 years, were enrolled in the study. Sixteen patients (22.9%) and 54 patients (77.1%) were classified as high and medium-low adherence level groups. The raised serum ferritin value for 6 months previous to enrollment in the high adherence level group is lower than the medium-low adherence level group (276.4 vs. 413.0 ng/mL, p = 0.034, respectively). Factors impacted high adherence to iron chelation including younger age (p = 0.015) and deferasirox (DFX) administration (p = 0.025). The body weight and height in both groups were not statistically different. The most common obstacle to adherence was forgetfulness. The Thai version of MMAS-8 is a practical tool for evaluating adherence to chelation therapy in TDT patients. High adherence level of patients correlates with more controlled serum ferritin level. The younger age and once-daily dose chelation therapy are associated with better adherence.","genergyal, medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Genetics (clinical), Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

The pretreated rice bran showed efficient hydrogen production upon anaerobic fermentation without nutrients addition. The Rhizopus pretreated biomass can provide required nutrients for the enhancement of hydrogen yield by anaerobic fermentation. The Rhizopus pretreatment of rice bran enhanced the hydrogen production under nutrient-free conditions which reduced the overall production cost.

The proposed method integrated the kth percentile of the sum of intensities, a genetic algorithm (GA), and support vector machine (SVM) to classify a lesion, and then applied the kth percentile of the sum of intensities to select the optimal window of interest (WOI) where all the features are extracted. After feature extraction, a GA was used to select only relevant features that were then forwarded to SVM to classify the lesion. Efficiency of the proposed features and the proposed method was evaluated using a dataset of 89 EBUS images with 10-fold cross-validation. Optimal classification results were obtained using 16 selected features from the WOI at the fifth percentile with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision at 86.52%, 87.27%, 85.29%, and 90.57%, respectively. Among the 16 selected features, six were from the proposed features. The proposed method was compared with other existing methods.

A 125-micron diameter of coreless silica fibre (CSF) connected to single-mode fibre (SMF) at both ends to achieve a structure of SMF-CSF-SMG is proposed to detect VOCs biomarkers for diabetes such as acetone and isopropanol. The coreless fibre region is considered to be a sensing region where the multimode interference (MMI) occurs having a higher light interaction at the interface between the fibre and sensing medium which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity. The sensing region undergoes surface functionalisation with Au-silane for the sensor to be selectively detect VOCs biomarker with electrostatic absorption. The length of the sensing region is numerically optimised to achieve a reimaging distance where the highest possible of coupling efficiency occurs and the maximum output signal can be obtained. Coupling efficiency spectra at different volume fractions of gold nanoparticles with various acetone and isopropanol concentrations are also presented. A sensitivity of the Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor is achieved by using the analysis of wavelength shift interrogation. The results show the spectra undergoes red-shift phenomenon in the near-infrared region (NIR) when concentrations of acetone and isopropanol are increased. The functionalisation of Au-silane on the optical fibre sensor provides a higher sensitivity compared to the unfunctionalised sensor as it shows more dramatic shifts of absorption spectra when there is a change in VOCs biomarker concentration.,"fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, medical","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Each agent of MAS is described by a homogeneous linear time-invariant dynamic model. The control structure has two layers, namely, an upper layer and a lower layer. Local actions are executed in the lower layer. Each agent shares information through an undirected graph with neighboring agents in the upper layer to achieve the global stabilization and disturbance attenuation. We employ a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to formulate the robust control design of the local and global feedback in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities and incorporate constraints on disturbance attenuation. We propose the sufficient condition, where system matrices and Lyapunov variables are separated. The parameterization of the controller depends on a common slack variable instead of the Lyapunov matrices.

Purpose: The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the accuracy of implant placement among five drilling systems of sCAIS in a controlled experimental setting. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five 3D printed models with two edentulous bilateral premolar spaces were allocated to five different drilling systems: group A: sleeve-in-sleeve, group B: sleeve-in-sleeve with self-locking, group C: mounted sleeve-on-drill, group D: integrated sleeve-on-drill with metal sleeve in the guide, group E: integrated sleeve-on-drill without metal sleeve. Models were scanned with CBCT and optical scanner. All implants were digitally planned and 10 implants placed with sCAIS in each group. Postoperative 3D deviation of placed vs planned position was measured by means of platform, apex and angular deviation. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test (P ≤.05). Pairwise comparisons were tested with Dunn's test with adjusted P values. Results: The overall platform deviation ranged from 0.42 ± 0.12 mm (group B) to 1.18 ± 0.19 mm (group C). The overall apex deviation ranged from 0.76 ± 0.22 mm (group B) to 1.95 ± 0.48 mm (group D). The overall angular deviation ranged from 2.50 ± 0.89 degree (group B) to 5.30 ± 1.04 degree (group E). Group A and B showed significantly less angular deviation than groups D and E (P <.05). There was no statistically significant differences in all parameters between group A and B, as well as between group D and E (P >.05). Conclusions: Significant differences were found with regards to accuracy among the five sCAIS systems tested, suggesting that the drilling protocol, the devices used and the design principles of the guides could influence the accuracy of implant placement.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"
"Increased nitro-oxidative toxicity in association with metabolic syndrome, atherogenicity and insulin resistance in patients with affective disorders","Morelli N.R., Maes M., Bonifacio K.L., Vargas H.O., Nunes S.O.V., Barbosa D.S.",2021-11-01,"Biomarkers, Depressive Disorder, Major, Humans, Insulin Resistance, Male, Metabolic Syndrome, Mood Disorders, Oxidative Stress, biomarkers, Bipolar disorder, Major depression, Metabolic syndrome, oxidative and nitrosative stress, antioxidants","Background: There is a strong comorbidity between mood disorders and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and nitro-oxidative stress toxicity (NOSTOX) partially underpin this comorbidity. Aims: To examine the associations of RONS/NOSTOX biomarkers with MetS after adjusting for the significant effects of mood disorders (major depression, and bipolar type 1 and 2), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), tobacco use disorder (TUD), and male sex. Methods: The study included subjects with (n=65) and without (n=107) MetS and measured levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and computed z unit-weighted composite scores which reflect RONS/NOSTOX. The study included 105 patients with mood disorders, 46 with GAD, and 95 with TUD. Results: MetS was associated with increased levels of MDA and AOPP, independently from mood disorders, TUD, sex and GAD. Atherogenicity and insulin resistance (IR) were significantly associated with a NOSTOX composite score. Mood disorders, TUD, GAD, male sex and MetS independently contribute to increased RONS/NOSTOX. The RONS/NOSTOX profile of MetS was different from that of GAD, which showed increased SOD1 and NOx levels. TUD was accompanied by increased SOD1, LOOH and MDA, and male sex by increased LOOH and AOPP. Conclusions: MetS is characterized by increased lipid peroxidation with aldehyde formation and chlorinative stress, and atherogenicity and IR are strongly mediated by RONS/NOSTOX. Partially shared RONS/NOSTOX pathways underpin the comorbidity of MetS with mood disorders, GAD, and TUD.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; depression, psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
Expressions of cytochrome P450 aromatase and anti-Müllerian hormone in testes of fattening pigs by the timing of the first vaccination for immunocastration,"Srisuwatanasagul K., Srisuwatanasagul S., Roongsitthichai A.",2021-03-01,"Animals, Anti-Mullerian Hormone, Aromatase, Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone, Immunohistochemistry, Male, Orchiectomy, Organ Size, Seminiferous Tubules, Sus scrofa, Testis, Vaccines, anti-Müllerian hormone, aromatase, gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccine, immunocastration, testes","In practice, two injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine are recommended for pig immunocastration for effective outcomes. The present study aimed to investigate the expressions of cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in testes, testicular length and testicular histomorphometry of the fattening pigs receiving the first injection of GnRH vaccine 6 weeks earlier than the standard protocol. Based on vaccination protocol, 24 pigs were equally divided into three groups: T1 was vaccinated at 15 and 19 weeks of age, T2 received vaccine at 9 and 19 weeks of age and C remained intact. P450arom and AMH expressions were analysed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results revealed that testicular length was highest in C pigs, but not different between T1 and T2 groups (6.5 ± 0.2 versus 6.9 ± 0.3 cm, p =.538). Histomorphometry demonstrated that the height of spermatogenic epithelia, the diameter of seminiferous tubules and the number of seminiferous tubules between T1 and T2 groups were not different (p >.05). For P450arom, immunohistochemistry revealed that H-score of C group was significantly higher than that of both T1 and T2 groups. Western blot analysis showed that C group possessed the densest protein band. Moreover, H-score between T1 and T2 groups was not significantly different. Protein band intensity between both groups was not apparently different. As for AMH, C pigs had significantly lower H-score than both T1 and T2 pigs. Furthermore, T2 pigs possessed significantly higher H-score than T1 pigs. Western blot analysis showed that the most intense protein band was found in T2 group. In summary, GnRH vaccine affected testicular development and functions. The first injection could be performed either at 9 or 15 weeks of age since both protocols contributed to comparable results in aspect of testicular length, histomorphometry and expressions of P450arom and AMH.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

Ni3S2/d-Ti3C2 provides abundant active sites and reduces the Na+ diffusion path, leading to high sodium storage performance. The d-Ti3C2 nanosheets work as a conductive framework, providing high ion- and electron-conductive pathways and buffer volume change in Ni3S2 nanoparticles, while Ni3S2 nanoparticles exhibit high sodium storage and are applied as the spacer to suppress the restacking of d-Ti3C2 nanosheets. The synergistic effect effectively improves sodium storage performance of the obtained electrode and shows a special capacitive and diffusive dual-model energy storage mechanism for sodium-ion batteries. Specifically, Ni3S2 nanoparticles are battery-type components with high capacity, and the d-Ti3C2 nanosheets are pseudocapacitive components with a high pseudocapacitive value and fast energy storage. Consequently, the Ni3S2/d-Ti3C2 electrode provides enhanced performance (234.4 mA h g-1 at 0.1A g-1), almost 5.5 times that of the d-Ti3C2 electrode (∼42.4 mA h g-1). The results show that this metal sulfide incorporation strategy presents a prospective way to heighten sodium storage performance of d-Ti3C2 MXene.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Area Business Continuity Management is a framework, offering a guidance for the coordinated disaster damage mitigation both employees of tenant companies and local residents in the industrial complex. Therefore, disasters typically affect the business, and it is also directly associated with the worker 's capability to deal with the disasters. Employees 'intention and ability to reach work is one of the most important factors, affecting the employer 's business continuity. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how to incorporate their societal (community and individual) behaviors into a model of the private sector business continuity.

The Asian experience with diagnosing MTC by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was scarcely reported. Methods: Cases of MTC with available FNA slides were enrolled from 13 hospitals representing 8 Asia-Pacific countries. Clinicopathological information, including sample preparation technique, staining method, original cytologic diagnosis and review diagnosis were collected. Results: Of a total of 145 MTC cases retrospectively recruited, 99 (68.3%) were initially interpreted as MTC/suspicious for MTC (S-MTC). The distribution of original FNA diagnostic categories was not associated with the staining method or sample preparation technique. The staining methods used were Papanicolaou, hematoxylin-eosin and Romanowsky stains. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) was used only in three countries. After reviewing all cases, the diagnostic rate of MTC/S-MTC increased to 91.7% (133/145). Cases with initially unrecognized MTC had either marked pleomorphism or cytology mimicking papillary carcinoma or follicular neoplasm. Although LBC provided certain benefits, there was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between conventional smear and LBC. Immunocytochemistry was available in 38 cases (26.2%), all of which were correctly recognized as MTC. Conclusion: Our report summarizes how MTC is handled in contemporary Asian thyroid FNA practice. Although the detection rate of MTC by cytology alone is less satisfactory, integration with ancillary tests could achieve an excellent performance. The recognition of constitutive cytomorphologic features is needed for each cytopreparatory method, which may result in a lower threshold to initiate further workup for MTC.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology"

The foundation is modeled as a rigid disk, with either permeable or impermeable and smooth contact surface, whereas a multilayered transversely isotropic poroelastic half-space is defined for the supporting soil. To investigate the dynamic interaction problem, a displacement and flow boundary condition at the contact surface is constituted by employing a discretization technique and the displacement influence functions, which are obtained from the exact stiffness matrix scheme, with the stiffness matrices being presented explicitly for the first time. A set of numerical results are presented to portray the effects of anisotropic and poroelastic properties, hydraulic boundary conditions, soil heterogeneity, and frequency of excitation on vertical dynamic response of rigid circular foundations. In addition, vertical vibrations of a ring foundation and a massive circular foundation are also investigated.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"
Attentive Hybrid Collaborative Filtering for Rating Conversion in Recommender Systems,"Tengkiattrakul P., Maneeroj S., Takasu A.",2021-01-01,"Accuracy prediction, Conversion methods, Explicit feedback, Knowledge graphs, Movielens, Traditional approaches, User feature, Collaborative filtering, Neural networks, Rating conversion, Recommender systems","Recommendation models that use collaborative filtering consider the influence of friends and neighbors when recommending suitable items for a target user. Most of these neighborhood-based models use the actual ratings from neighbors to predict the ratings of the target user toward target items, which often leads to a low accuracy prediction caused by the improper rating-range problem. Recently, rating conversion methods have been proposed to address this issue. Because each friend/neighbor can have a different level of influence on the target user, we propose a friend module, which converts their ratings to match the target user’s perspective and assigns different weight to each user before modeling latent relations and predictions. In rating conversion, ratings that involve explicit feedback are important. Instead of the traditional approach to user embedding, we propose a novel approach that uses explicit feedback. This can express user features better than traditional methods and can then be used to convert ratings to match the target user’s perspective. For better representation and recommendation, we also learn latent relations between each user and item by adopting knowledge graph ideas, which leads to more accurate results. The FilmTrust and MovieLens datasets are used in experiments comparing the proposed method with existing methods. This evaluation showed that our model is more accurate than existing methods.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

The treatment for BKVAN is reduction of the immunosuppressive load which increases the risk of kidney transplant rejection. There is no biomarker to monitor BKV activity besides BK viral load. The value of the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISPOT) assay as a tool to monitor the recipient's anti-BKV immune response after transplantation was investigated systematically. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies of ELISPOT evaluating the immune response against BKV. BKV status was categorized as ""active BKV infection"" and as ""resolving BKV infection"". Random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic performance of the ELISPOT assay, after stratifying patients into groups based on positive and negative ELISPOT results. One-hundred twenty-seven articles were identified of which nine were included. Patients with negative ELISPOT had an increased risk of having active BKV replication (odds ratio of 71.9 (95%-CI 31.0–167.1). Pooled sensitivity was 0.95 (95%-CI 0.89–0.98) and specificity was 0.88 (95%-CI 0.78–0.94). The standardized mean difference of the number of IFN-γ producing cells between patients with active BKV infection compared with patients who had resolving BKV infection was -2.09 (95%-CI -2.50, -1.68). The ELISPOT assay is a useful tool for BKV risk assessment and in combination with BKV load may support clinicians in guiding immunosuppressive therapy in patients with BKV replication.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

This study aimed to systematically compare the degree of face shield contamination between endoscopists who performed EGD on patients lying in the left lateral decubitus (LL) and prone positions. Methods: This is a randomized trial in patients scheduled for EGD between April and June 2020. Eligible 212 patients were randomized with 1:1 allocation. Rapid adenosine triphosphate test was used to determine contamination level using relative light units of greater than 200 as a cutoff value. All eligible patients were randomized to lie in either the LL or prone position during EGD. The primary outcome was the rate of contamination on the endoscopist's face shield. Results: The majority of patients were female (63%), with a mean age of 60 ± 13 years. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. There was no face shield contamination after EGD in either group. The number of coughs in the LL group was higher than the prone group (1.38 ± 1.8 vs 0.89 ± 1.4, P = 0.03). The mean differences in relative light units on the face shield before and after EGD in the LL and prone groups were 9.9 ± 20.9 and 4.1 ± 6 (P = 0.008), respectively. Conclusion: As measured by the adenosine triphosphate test, performing diagnostic EGD does not lead to contamination on the face shield of the endoscopist. However, placing patients in the prone position may further mitigate the risk.","genergyal, gastroenterology, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, for articles published from inception until February 1, 2021. We included studies that compared blood biomarkers in psychiatric patients with (SA+) and without SA (SA-) and heathy controls and we combined different IO&NS biomarkers into immune, inflammatory, and neurotoxic profiles and used meta-analysis (random-effect model with restricted maximum-likelihood) to delineate effect sizes with 95% confidence interval (CI). Findings: Our search included 51 studies comprising 4.945 SA+ patients and 24.148 controls. We stratified the control group into healthy controls and SA- patients. SA+ patients showed significantly (p<0.001) increased immune activation (SMD: 1.044; CI: 0.599, 1.489), inflammation (SMD: 1.109; CI: 0.505, 1.714), neurotoxicity (SMD: 0.879; CI: 0.465, 1.293), and lowered neuroprotection (SMD: 0.648; CI: 0.354, 0.941) as compared with healthy controls.

Included studies were those that enrolled adult patients who had been on NAs for more than 6 months with available information on end-of-treatment (EOT) HBcrAg and/or HBV RNA and relapse rates. Results: Sixteen studies were included. Virological and clinical relapse rates ranged from 11% to 100% and 11% to 73%, respectively. Low or undetectable EOT HBcrAg levels were associated with low off-treatment relapse rates in most studies with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.69–0.70 for predicting virological relapse (VR) and 0.61–0.77 for predicting clinical relapse (CR). Undetectable EOT HBV RNA was associated with a lower risk of off-treatment relapse with AUROC of 0.65–0.76 for predicting VR and 0.66–0.73 for predicting CR. Combined EOT HBcrAg and HBV RNA performed better in predicting off-treatment relapse than either test alone with AUROC of 0.816–0.846 for predicting CR. None of the patients with double-negative HBV RNA and HBcrAg developed CR. Conclusion: Combining HBcrAg with HBV RNA or HBsAg improved the discriminating abilities in the prediction of off-treatment relapse of each test. Patients with double-negative HBcrAg and HBV RNA at EOT had low risks of relapse and could be considered for NA discontinuation.","genergyal, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

The co-digestion of food waste (FW) from a canteen with waste sludge (WS) from OD-MBR was performed with the proportion of FW:WS at 10:1 by weight. The liquid digestate from the co-digestion process was further co-treated with building wastewater in the OD-MBR system for water reuse purpose. Maximum methane content of 65.2% in biogas as well as average specific methane yield of 0.24 gCH4/gVS could be obtained with anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and waste sludge from OD-MBR with HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s. The observed main methanogen species in this co-digestion process were Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus palmolei. For co-treatment of liquid digestate and building wastewater with the OD-MBR, it was found that HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s could achieve highest COD and nitrogen removal efficiencies. HRT can be considered as a main key parameter to promote nitrification activity inside the OD-MBR system. Moreover, treated effluent from the SAC/OD-MBR could comply with the water reuse standard for garden and landscape application in the university campus. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis indicates that this proposed system has a high potential of total cost savings and other indirect benefits. Therefore, the prototype SAC/OD-MBR can be an alternative system for food waste management and wastewater recycling for building application.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
High B-cell activating factor levels in multi-transfused thalassemia patients,"Watanaboonyongcharoen P., Akkawat B., Tohthong T., Rojnuckarin P.",2021-10-01,"Adult, B-Cell Activating Factor, Blood Group Antigens, Cohort Studies, Humans, Isoantibodies, Thalassemia, BAFF, multi-transfused thalassemia, red blood cell alloantibody","Objectives: To assess the associations between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and alloimmunisation in multi-transfused thalassemia. Background: Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation is a complication of multi-transfused thalassemia. BAFF is promoting B cells that produce alloantibodies. Methods/Materials: Multi-transfused thalassemia, 15 years or older, were recruited in the cohort study. Alloantibodies and BAFF levels were analysed. Results: Of 114 patients, the overall prevalence of RBC alloimmunisation was 29.8%. The most common alloantibodies were anti-E, anti-Mia and anti-c. BAFF levels were different among the three groups; the patients with baseline alloantibodies (median ± interquartile range 1251 ± 474 pg/ml), without alloantibodies (1098 ± 453) and healthy controls (719 ± 306), p < 0.001. The BAFF level was elevated in the >25 years old patients (vs. the <25, p = 0.011) and the buffy-coat-reduced blood recipients (vs. the pre-storage leukocyte-depletion, p = 0.005). Absolute lymphocyte count was higher in the patients without baseline alloantibodies (vs. with baseline alloantibodies, p = 0.049) and the splenectomised patients (vs. the non-splenectomised patients, p < 0.001). Of the 72 patients without baseline antibodies, four who developed new antibodies showed no statistically different BAFF levels compared with those without new antibodies after 40-month follow-up (1296 ± 734 vs. 1062 ± 460, p = 0.491). In multivariate analysis, BAFF to absolute lymphocyte ratio was independently associated with RBC alloimmunisation (odds ratio 3.07, 95% confidence interval 1.124–8.369, p = 0.029). Conclusion: B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels were elevated in multi-transfused thalassemia and the BAFF to absolute lymphocyte ratio was associated with red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics; inherited disorders, medical",Hematology
Stabilization of foam using hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles and mixed anionic surfactant systems in the presence of oil,"Rattanaudom P., Shiau B.-J., Suriyapraphadilok U., Charoensaeng A.",2021-01-01,"Air water interfaces, Alkane chain length, Binary surfactant systems, Carbon-chain length, Coefficient values, Foam stability, Internal olefin sulfonates, Mixed surfactant, foam, foam stability, Nanoparticles, oil, surfactant","The use of nanoparticles has been intensively investigated to improve foam flooding in oil production. Because nanoparticles have larger adhesion energy at the air-water interface than the surfactant, they help to prevent a gas diffusion between bubbles that leads to foam film rupture. In this study, the detail investigation on the behavior of mixed-surfactant foam stabilized by silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) was conducted. The binary surfactant systems of an internal olefin sulfonate (IOS) and sodium polyethylene glycol monohexadecyl ether sulfate (C32H66Na2O5S) were selected. The impact of alkane oil with varying carbon chain length (i.e. hexane, octane, dodecane, and hexadecane) was investigated. The findings from a similar system of foam in deionized water (DI) and brine solution also presented for comparison. For SiO2-NPs foam/brine system in the presence of oil, the foam stability increased to a maximum with respect to certainly added nanoparticles (10 ppm), and the additional surfactant is required to maintain the foam stability when the alkane chain length increases. The foam stability parameter indicated by spreading (S) and entering (E) coefficients shows that the SiO2-NPs foam systems with the shorter-tail surfactant (mixed C15-18 IOS) had lower the coefficient values compared to the longer-tail one (mixed C19-23 IOS), suggesting that the structure of surfactant influents on foam stability. The findings from this study bring an understanding of the SiO2-NPs foam/alkane oil behavior in the brine solution, which helps to select the appropriate system for improving foam flooding in EOR applications.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistry, Materials Science","Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics"

Yet, identifying emotions using only brainwaves is still very challenging, especially the subject-independent task. Numerous studies have tried to propose methods to recognize emotions, including machine learning techniques like convolutional neural network (CNN). Since CNN has shown its potential in generalization to unseen subjects, manipulating CNN hyperparameters like the window size and electrode order might be beneficial. To our knowledge, this is the first work that extensively observed the parameter selection effect on the CNN. The temporal information in distinct window sizes was found to significantly affect the recognition performance, and CNN was found to be more responsive to changing window sizes than the support vector machine. Classifying the arousal achieved the best performance with a window size of ten seconds, obtaining 56.85% accuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.1369. Valence recognition had the best performance with a window length of eight seconds at 73.34% accuracy and an MCC value of 0.4669. Spatial information from varying the electrode orders had a small effect on the classification. Overall, valence results had a much more superior performance than arousal results, which were, perhaps, influenced by features related to brain activity asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, CINAHL, and AMED were searched from inception to October, 2019 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials that investigated the effects of Aloe vera on health outcomes. Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed the methodological quality, and rated the credibility of evidence according to established criteria. Ten articles reporting 71 unique outcomes of Aloe vera were included. Of these, 47 (67%) were nominally statistically significant based on random-effects model (p ≤.05). Only 3 outcomes were supported by highly suggestive evidence, whereas 42 outcomes were supported by weak evidence. The highly suggestive evidence supported benefits of Aloe vera in the prevention of second-degree infusion phlebitis (RR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.10–0.32, p-value: 1.75 × 10−9) and chemotherapy-induced phlebitis based on overall incidence (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.08–0.20, p-value: 9.68 × 10−20) and incidence of the second degree of severity (OR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.07–0.14, p-value: 3.41 × 10−35). However, the majority of the evidence were limited by small sample size and poor methodological quality. Therefore, despite the overall favorable effect of Aloe vera, more robust studies are needed.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Its apparent lack of effective treatments is posing challenging public health issues. Introduction: Encouraging research results indicating probable anti-cancer properties of the Delonix regia flower Extract (DRE) have prompted us to evaluate the feasibility of developing a type of product for future cancer prevention or treatment. Methods and Results: In the present report, using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we demonstrate in the DRE the presence of high concentrations of three identifiable flavonoids, namely rutin 4.15±0.30% w/w, isoquercitrin 3.04±0.02%w/w, and myricetin 2.61±0.01% w/w, respectively, while the IC50 of DPPH and ABTS assay antioxidation activity was 66.88±6.30 μg/ml and 53.65±7.24 μg/ml, respectively. Discussion: Our cancer cell line studies using the MTT assay demonstrated DREs potent and dosedependent inhibition of murine leukemia cell line (P-388: 35.28±4.07% of cell viability remaining), as well as of human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human oral cavity carcinoma (KB), and human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cell lines in that order of magnitude. Conclusion: Three identifiable flavonoids (rutin, isoquercitrin and myricetin) with high antioxidation activity and potent and dose-dependent inhibition of murine leukemia cell line and five other cancer cell lines were documented in the DRE. The extract’s lack of cytotoxicity in 3 normal cell lines is a rare advantage not usually seen in current antineoplastic agents. Yet another challenge of the DRE was its low dissolution rate and long-term storage stability, issues to be resolved before a future product can be formulated.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Science"

METHODS: The authors compared the incidence of SMNs after radiotherapy (RT) for medulloblastoma in patients treated in 1973-2014 with the incidence in the general population with the multiple primary–standardized incidence ratio function of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9. Observed-to-expected incidence (O/E) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for the entire cohort and by disease site according to age at diagnosis, treatment era, and receipt of chemotherapy. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 1294 patients with medulloblastoma who received RT, 68 developed 75 SMNs. The O/E ratio for SMNs among all patients was 4.49 (95% CI, 3.53-5.62; P <.05). The site at highest risk was the central nervous system (CNS; O/E, 40.62; 95% CI, 25.46-61.51), which was followed by the endocrine system (O/E, 15.95; 95% CI, 9.12-25.91), bone (O/E, 14.45; 95% CI, 1.75-52.21), soft tissues (O/E, 9.01; 95% CI, 1.09-32.56), the digestive system (O/E, 5.03; 95% CI, 2.51-9.00), and the lymphatic/hematopoietic system (O/E, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.35-6.94). The O/E ratio was higher for patients given chemotherapy and RT (O/E, 5.52; 95% CI, 3.75-7.83) than for those given RT only (O/E, 3.96; 95% CI, 2.88-5.32). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with medulloblastoma are at elevated risk for SMNs in comparison with the general population. Variations in O/E for SMNs by organ systems were found for treatment modality, age at diagnosis, and time of diagnosis. The most common site, the CNS, was involved more often in younger patients and those given chemotherapy with RT.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

However, a typical role of LIN28B in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is primarily unknown. In this study, the tumorigenic potential of LIN28B in the cholangiocyte context was investigated. Methods: Stable LIN28B expression in MMNK-1 cells was generated by infecting with retrovirus-containing LIN28B gene. LIN28B-overexpressing cells were further validated the amount of released cytokines by using human cytokine arrays. After treatment of chemo-drugs, cell viability was subsequently measured using MTT assay. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was determined using ALDEFLUOR assay Kit and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels were respectively assayed by RT-qPCR and western blot. Results: Cytokine release results showed that numerous inflammatory cytokines-chemokines related to cancer initiation and development, such as IL-8, IL-6, VEGF, MCP1, TNF-α were significantly increased in LIN28B-overexpressing MMNK-1 cells. Drug sensitivity test showed that LIN28B-overexpressing MMNK-1 treated cells had a high percentage of cell viability compared to MMNK-1-control treated cells. Activity and expression level of a cancer stem cell marker, ALDH was significantly elevated in LIN28B-overexpressing MMNK-1 cells. Moreover, the activation of an oncogenic signaling pathway, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was enhanced in LIN28B-overexpressing MMNK-1 cells. Whereas, growth capacity of LIN28B-overexpressing MMNK-1 cells was found to be reduced in STAT3 inhibition. Conclusion: LIN28B can regulate the inflammatory response and resistance to chemotherapy of cholangiocytes through modulation of STAT3 signaling pathway.A recent study suggests that activated cholangiocytes can be induced by regulation of LIN28B/STAT3 pathway and this may partially contribute to the initiating CCA. Here, LIN28B and its downstream signaling could be considered as an attractive therapeutic target in patients with CCA.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

The second objective was to explore the impacts of the differences between observed and predicted EQ-5D-5L index scores on the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) using 5 hypothetical scenarios. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis. A total of 800 outpatients with chronic diseases were recruited from 2 university hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand, between July 2014 and March 2015. The 800 patients were randomly divided into 2 samples: estimation and validation samples. The estimation sample was used to assess the relationships between the EQ-5D-5L index score and 4 WHOQOL-BREF dimension scores and to find the best-fit model and its equation. For the validation sample, the equation of the best-fit model from the estimation sample was used to calculate predicted EQ-5D-5L index scores. Results: A multiple linear regression showed that only the physical domain of the WHOQOL-BREF was significantly associated with the EQ-5D-5L. Among 11 regression models, the curve estimation found that the inverse model was the best-fit model. The prediction equation of EQ-5D-5L was equal to 1.385 minus 7.572/physical domain of the WHOQOL-BREF. The impacts of the differences between the observed and predicted EQ-5D-5L index scores on ICUR were only 0.4% to 1.8% from the base case. Conclusions: A nonlinear relationship between the physical domain of the WHOQOL-BREF and EQ-5D-5L utility was shown. The impacts of the differences between the observed and predicted EQ-5D-5L index scores on ICUR were minimal.",medical,"Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

We sought to understand the effect of kidney function decline on alterations of body composition patterns among pre-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: Body composition was measured by multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Low muscle mass was defined as appendicular muscle mass (kg) adjusted to the square of height in meters < 7.0 and 5.7 kg/m2 in men and women, respectively. The designation of obesity by percent body fat was ≥ 25% in men and ≥ 30% in women. Alternative definition of obesity by BMI was ≥ 25 kg/m2. Visceral fat area cut point was > 100 cm2 as indication of abdominal obesity. Results: Mean age of participants was 61.3 ± 13.8 years (n = 103). The average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 34.0 ± 24.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. By BIA, the prevalence of low muscle mass was 16.5% and was comparable between both sexes. Obesity by percent body fat was identified in 71.8% of patients and 38.2% had abdominal obesity. Using BMI criteria, the prevalence of obesity was less common (55.3%) and associated with under-identification of obesity by 27.0%. Low muscle mass and obesity by percent body fat were more prevalent in the more advanced stages of CKD. By multivariable regression analysis, a 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 decline in GFR was associated with a 0.59 kg reduction of total body muscle mass (p = 0.01), but not fat mass or BMI, after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Low muscle mass was prevalent among pre-dialysis CKD patients. BMI commonly classified obese CKD individuals by percent body fat criteria as non-obese.

Silanization involves functionalization of alkyl groups by coupling trimethoxy (propyl) silane (MPS), and esterification functionalizes WF with ester groups, using acetic anhydride (Ac). Modified WF was incorporated into recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to form reHDPE/mod-WF composite system. Both modifications produced highly hydrophobic WF surfaces which improved the dispersion in the reHDPE matrix; resulting in a significant difference in impact strength, specifically at 20 wt% filler, from 74.5 Jm−1 to 146.3 Jm−1 and 113.5 Jm−1, that is, up to 96% and 52% for MPS-WF and Ac-WF, respectively. However, filler agglomeration higher than 20 wt% reduces the composite impact strength. The results herein demonstrate that alkyl-functionalized WF show excellent dispersion in the reHDPE system and is the preferred technique to improve system mechanical resilience as compared to esterification.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

However, corrosion of the aluminium (Al) anode is a critical problem limiting their practical applications. In this study, a decrease in the corrosion and an increase in the discharge performance of the Al anode were demonstrated through the use of nano-yttrium-stabilized zirconium (nano-YSZ). Three weight ratios of nano-YSZ blended with Al were prepared via mechanical stir casting. The surface hardness of the new Al alloys was determined using nano-indentation method and phase transition. Crystallite size measurements were conducted using X-ray diffraction analysis. Subsurface morphologies were conducted using scanning electron microscopy. Corrosion studies were carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry. The discharge and short-circuit studies of the prepared Al–air battery were undertaken using different Al alloy anodes. The results demonstrated that the Al anode having a higher ratio of nano-YSZ (5 wt%) had the highest discharge behaviour and excellent corrosion resistance making it a potential candidate as an electrode for the Al–air battery.

Objectives: To determine the population pharmacokinetic parameters of meropenem and evaluate the covariates affecting population pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on 35 patients. A total of 160 blood samples were collected and determined free of drug concentrations of meropenem. Population pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using NONMEM software. Internal validation methods, including bootstrapping and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks, were applied to evaluate the robustness and predictive power of the final model. Results: A one-compartment model with first-order elimination showed the best fit to the data. The typical clearance (CL) values and volume of distribution (Vd) were 1.33 L/h and 2.27 L, respectively. Weight and creatinine clearance were influential covariates for CL, while weight was a significant covariate for Vd of meropenem. The model evaluation results suggested robustness and good predictability of the final model. The standard dosage regimens of meropenem achieved 40% f T>MIC but not enough if a more aggressive target of 80% f T>MIC at MIC value of ≥ 16 µg/mL is desired.

Therefore, our objective was to assess perioperative outcomes after TKA in patients who were not candidates for the additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in a multimodal pain control regimen. Methods: Propensity score matching for age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and preoperative hemoglobin level was conducted on patients undergoing unilateral TKA, and thereby 52 patients remained in each group. The control group comprised patients who received parenteral parecoxib every 12 hours during the first 48 hours after TKA. The No- NSAIDs group did not receive NSAIDs because of known contraindications. Identical postoperative pain control including intravenous patient-controlled analgesia was applied for all patients. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, knee flexion, blood loss, serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT), and length of stay (LOS) were determined. Results: The No-NSAIDs group had significantly higher VAS scores in 6–96 hours and consumed more morphine at 24 hours and 48 hours after the surgery than the control group. The No-NSAIDs group had significantly less knee flexion at 48 hours (p = 0.045) and tended to have more emesis and longer LOS than the control group. The blood loss of the No-NSAIDs and control group was 552.52 mL and 397.65 mL (p = 0.02), respectively, and blood transfusion rate was 23.1% and 17.3% (p = 0.63), respectively. The cTnT of the No-NSAIDs group rose over the first 48 hours and was significantly higher than that of the control group at 48 hours. Conclusions: Patients who were not candidates for NSAIDs had significantly higher pain scores and consumed more morphine after TKA. They also tended to have greater blood loss and the rising of cardiac biomarkers during the first 48 hours after TKA. Hence, these patients may benefit from supplementary analgesia and appropriate perioperative monitoring.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

At 60 min and temperature of 300 °C with 1 wt% of heterogeneous catalyst the upgraded HDO-bio-oil yield reached 38.4 wt% with deoxygenation percentage of 70%. The properties of upgraded bio-oil are HHV of 44.74 MJ/kg, Kinematic viscosity of 6.23 mm2/s and density 923 kg/m3 respectively. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for modeling and optimizing the upgraded bio-oil yield. The optimized RSM conditions for upgraded bio-oil yield (44.5 wt%) are temperature of 280 °C, catalyst load of 0.6 wt%, and time of 120 min. The physiochemical properties of upgraded bio-oil are in agreement with ASTM standards. Equal proportion of bio-oil to diesel (D50: B50) reduced the brake thermal efficiency to 6.66% with reduced NOx emission and slight increase in CO emission. This study highlights that microalga fuels are better renewable energy resource with reduced greenhouse gas emission.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The dehydration of sorbitol was carried out in a high-pressure reactor under a nitrogen gas atmosphere at a fixed initial pressure of 2 MPa. It was found that the Purolite CT269 catalyst gave the highest sorbitol conversion of 100% and an isosorbide selectivity of 42% after 6 h at 453 K. The results showed that an increase in the reaction temperature gave rise to sorbitol conversion. However, the solid - compound was formed during the reaction at high temperature by polymerization of the product. The high acidity could catalyze the dehydration process; however, strong acid such as sulfuric acid gave low selectivity to isosorbide. Thus, the acidity of the catalyst plays a vital role in catalytic performance for the sorbitol dehydration to isosorbide.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Differences in virulence and antifungal drug susceptibility of species in these complexes indicate the value of full differentiation to species level in diagnostic procedures. MALDI-TOF MS has been reported to sufficiently discriminate these species. Here, we sought to re-evaluate sample pre-processing procedures and create a set of publicly available references for use with the MALDI Biotyper system. Peak content using four different pre-processing protocols was assessed, and database entries for 13 reference strains created. These were evaluated against a collection of 153 clinical isolates, typed by conventional means. The use of decapsulating protocols or mechanical disruption did not sufficiently increase the information content to justify the extra hands-on-time. Using the set of 13 reference entries created with the standard formic acid extraction, we were able to correctly classify 143/153 (93.5%) of our test isolates. The majority of the remaining ten isolates still gave correct top matches; only two isolates did not give reproducible identifications. This indicates that the log score cut-off can be lowered also in this context. Ease to identify cryptococcal isolates to the species level is improved by the workflow evaluated here.

The interfacial drag force is formulated by the product of the overall drag coefficient and the area-averaged relative velocity between two phases. The area-averaged relative velocity for gas-dispersed two-phase flows has been formulated with the aid of the distribution parameter, which expresses the covariance due to the distributions of void fraction and mixture volumetric flux. It has been pointed out that the term due to void fraction covariance is missing in the formulation of the area-averaged relative velocity adopted in one-dimensional thermal-analysis codes. This study has been conducted to develop void fraction and relative velocity covariance models for gas-dispersed two-phase flows in horizontal pipes. The database of local void fraction distributions for horizontal bubbly flows was established, and an artificial database for intermittent horizontal flows was modeled with assumed distributions of local void fractions. The developed void fraction covariance model for gas-dispersed horizontal two-phase flows could reproduce the data with the mean relative deviation (i.e., bias) of 8.33% and the mean absolute relative deviation (i.e., random uncertainty) of 21.4%.

It can function as a membrane bound protein or as a cleaved soluble protein (sSema4D). We sought to investigate the translational potential of plasma sSema4D as an immune marker in plasma of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Paired peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples of 104 patients with HNSCC were collected at the same time point to allow for real time analysis. Scoring of the histological inflammatory subtype (HIS) was carried out using Sema4D immunohistochemistry on the tumor tissue. sSema4D was detected in plasma using direct ELISA assay. Defining elevated sSema4D as values above the 95th percentile in healthy controls, our data showed that sSema4D levels in plasma were elevated in 25.0% (95% CI, 16.7–34.9%) of the patients with HNSCC and showed significant association with HIS immune excluded (HIS-IE) (p = 0.007), Sema4D+ve tumor cells (TCs) (p = 0.018) and PD-L1+ve immune cells (ICs) (p = 0.038). A multi-variable logistic regression analysis showed that HIS was significantly (P = 0.004) associated with elevated sSema4D, an association not explained by available patient-level factors. Using the IO-360 nanoString platform, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis of 10 HNSCC tumor tissues showed that patients with high sSema4D in plasma (HsS4D) clustered as IFN-γ negative tumor immune signature and were mostly HIS-IE. The IC type in the HsS4D paired tumor tissue was predominantly myeloid, while the lymphoid compartment was higher in the low sSema4D (LsS4D). The Wnt signaling pathway was upregulated in the HsS4D group. Further analysis using the IO-360, 770 gene set, showed significant non-inflamed profile of the HsS4D tumors compared to the LsS4D. In conclusion, our data reveals an association between sSema4D and the histological inflammatory subtype.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The SiNW array was prepared by electroless chemical etching and its length controlled by the etching time of a Si wafer. The average lengths for the SiNW array were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The relationship between the reflection spectrum and the length of the SiNW array was investigated. The ratio of percent reflectance from 900 to 550 nm exponentially increased from 1.8 ± 0.1 to 22.2 ± 1.3 when the average length increased from 184 ± 12 to 1237 ± 23 nm. Optical sensing for characterization of the length of SiNW was further developed into a simple and practical technique using a smartphone camera as a detector. A 3D printed tool was assembled to the smartphone to control the light path and the reflected image of the SiNW array was acquired. The reflected intensity ratio obtained from the reflected images with long pass to short pass filters increased analogously to the spectroscopic results. This optical-sensing-based smartphone showed simple and rapid detection for determining the lengths of a SiNW array and a SiNW array coated with a polymer film. This platform is compact and capable of on-site detecting and is promising for the characterization of reflective materials.,"fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, physics, environmental","Chemical Engineering (all), Instrumentation, Environmental Science (all)"

Hydrogen (H2) is an important feedstock required in thermochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals such as methanol. The cost and availability of H2 affect the cost of CO2 conversion. This study is focused on the process simulation of H2 production from ethanol feedstock. Steam reforming of ethanol is compared with dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 with valued products including ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde. Form this study, steam reforming of ethanol presents the lowest cost of H2 production at 1.58 USD/kg H2 while dehydrogenation of ethanol presents the cost at 3.24 and 1.97 USD/kg H2, respectively. Although presenting the lowest cost, steam reforming of ethanol provides a net positive CO2 emission in the overall CO2 conversion to methanol process. In contrast, ethanol dehydrogenation to H2 and byproducts, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde, promotes a net negative CO2 emission of −819.20 kg/ton methanol and −5.42 kg/ton methanol, respectively. The results present a decreasing CO2 emission with an increasing cost of H2 production.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This systematic review evaluated global findings from clinical trials and real-world studies of topical calcipotriol and the two-compound formulation of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis (including scalp psoriasis). PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE were searched for relevant English-language publications along with Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Latin American publication databases. Identified articles were screened by title and abstract against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis of key efficacy and safety findings from the full papers of selected publications was developed. Thirty-seven relevant papers were identified (25 English, 11 Chinese and one Japanese-language study) including 28 randomized controlled trials. While there was significant heterogeneity in study length, treatment intensity and clinical measures, following a critical review of the published data combined with expert opinion, the following clinical practice recommendations were agreed in order to assist healthcare providers: in adults, long-term treatment with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate is well tolerated and efficacious for up to 1 year on an ‘as needed’ basis, and for up to 16 weeks on a fixed-treatment regimen. Calcipotriol is also well tolerated and efficacious when used long term (up to 52 weeks) ‘as needed’ and for up to 20 weeks on a fixed-treatment regimen. Used on an ‘as needed’ basis for up to 1 year, the safety and efficacy profile of fixed-dose combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate is more favorable than calcipotriol alone; regular consultation between patients and their dermatologist/primary care physician is required to review psoriasis symptoms and adjust treatment accordingly; a specific treatment goal should be agreed on initiation of topical agent(s) to determine when long-term treatment can begin or if a regimen change is warranted; and application frequency during the continued treatment phase should consider the patients’ treatment expectations and goals.",medical,Dermatology

The role of different alkali metal atom sizes plays in resulting pore structure has been studied for the first time. The influence of standard reduction potentials on the pore structure and electrochemical performance of the activated biocarbon are also investigated. The biocarbons activated with KOH or NaOH exhibit a microporous characteristic and a wide range of specific surface area of 1323–3040 m2/g, while the one activated with LiOH exhibits a mesoporous nature. The comparatively small atom size of Li and its low standard reduction potential may have caused the slow reactivity of LiOH with carbon matrix. This leads to the low specific surface area of 1134 m2/g and the formation of tiny lithium particles that could intercalate into biocarbon structure more readily than potassium or sodium particles. Mesoporosity tends to be generated by using alkali activating agent with small metal atom size and low standard reduction potential, whereas microporosity has an opposite trend. Cyclic voltammetry curves and charge-discharge profiles confirm the dominant EDLC behavior along with partial pseudocapacitance for activated biocarbons. The maximum specific capacitance is 195.3 F/g at 0.25 A/g for biocarbon activated with KOH at 4:1. This value is reduced to 69.4% of its original values at 4 A/g. The biocarbons activated with LiOH or NaOH retain the rate capability by 82.9% and 80.4%, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

This study characterized the microbial community compositions of malodorous canal sediments at six locations along the Saen Saep Canal in Thailand. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina) revealed dominant genera classified as fermentative bacteria, methanogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), all of which emphasized anaerobic environments. SRB, as the primary producers of malodorous hydrogen sulfide, accounted for 8.2–30.4% of the total sequences. dsrB gene clone libraries further identified the SRB species. A constrained correspondence analysis demonstrated a spatial pattern of SRB that correlated with physicochemical parameters in which nitrate and sulfate in sediments were the most influencing factors. Overall, a better understanding of the SRB and other related microorganisms in canal sediments can assist in the future implementation of appropriate olfactory abatement and management methodologies in urban canals.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

However, the DR of a particular system strongly depends on the technical configuration such as PV module and array, inverter configuration, and also the climatic conditions. Therefore, a real operation dataset of DR is necessary to PV engineer in order to estimate energy performance and the LCOE for a particular system. This article presents the annual DR for a group of PV systems in Bangkok, Thailand which share the same monocrystalline silicon (Mono-Si) solar cell and inverter brand, over a four-year period. Instead of using simple linear regression, we apply the linear mixed effects method to estimate the DR value, which is suitable to formula a time-series data. The annual DR was found about 2.7% per year, with the 95% confidence interval from 0.7% to 4.6% per year. Hence, the operation lifetime of PV system until it reaches 80% of their initial energy conversion performance is about 7 years, with the 95% confidence interval from 4 years to 28 years. The resulting DR is informative and useful for further study on PV system performance and cost of investment in tropical region. Furthermore, we are the first group in Thailand to estimate the DR of PV station at system scale based on the mixed effects method. Finally, our study has enriched the knowledge about the operation of Mono-Si PV station in real operation condition.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, there is scant information concerning the cracked tooth risk factors. This study aimed to explore the oral functional behaviors and tooth factors associated with posterior cracked teeth. Methods: Fifty-six patients underwent their oral functional behavior assessment via a questionnaire. The intraoral parameters at the patient level (remaining teeth, occluding tooth pairs, overbite, overjet, and occlusal guidance type) and tooth level (remaining marginal ridge number, restored surface number, restorative materials, and cuspal inclination) were examined. The posterior teeth were stained with methylene blue dye and inspected for cracks using a microscope. The correlations between each patient-level parameter and the cracked tooth number/subject were determined using linear regression analysis. The cracked teeth were matched with their contralateral noncracked teeth, and binary regression analysis was used to analyze the association between tooth-level parameters and a cracked tooth. Multivariate regression analysis was performed if more than 1 parameter had a P value ≤.1. Results: One hundred thirty-five cracked teeth were found. Eating hard food was significantly related to the cracked tooth number (P < .05). In molars, the occlusal surface restoration and cuspal inclination were significantly related to a cracked tooth, except the mesiobuccal cusp. In the multivariate analysis, the distolingual cusp inclination significantly predicted a cracked tooth (P < .05). In premolars, the lingual cusp inclination was associated with a cracked tooth (P < .05). Conclusions: Eating hard food, occlusal surface restoration, and steep cuspal inclination were associated with posterior cracked teeth.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The purpose was to demonstrate how a diagnosis can still be achieved using a simplified approach that combines clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical, and fewer molecular assays than typically performed. This algorithm starts with tumor location (midline vs. non-midline) with diffuse midline glioma identified by H3 K27M immunostaining. All other tumors are placed into one of 6 categories, based on morphologic features rather than specific diagnoses. Molecular testing is limited to IDH1/IDH2 mutations, plus co-deletion of 1p/19q for cases with oligodendroglial features and TERT promoter mutation for cases without such features. Additional testing for co-deletion of 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation and BRAF mutations are only used in selected cases to refine diagnosis and prognosis. With this approach, we were able to reach the integrated diagnosis in 117/118 cases, saving 50 % of the costs of a more inclusive testing panel. The demographic data and tumor subtypes were found to be similar to series from other regions of the world.

However, ethyl acetate and water were generated as byproducts from the reaction. The byproducts formed azeotrope mixture with methanol and led to a complex product purification. Therefore, in this study, molecular sieves (MS) were introduced to adsorb the byproducts. The effect of different MS (3A and 5A) was studied. It was found that MS helped enhancing methanol yield. The highest methanol yield (42.8%) was obtained when adding MS_3A to adsorb water. The MS_5A could separate methanol and ethyl acetate, providing high methanol purity. The effect of operating conditions was also investigated. When reducing temperature to 130 °C, methanol yield decreased but methanol selectivity (>98%) significantly increased.

Here, we analyzed HIV-specific antibody quantities and qualitative differences like antibody-mediated functions, Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) binding, and IgG Fc glycosylation as well as cytokine profiles and cellular HIV DNA and RNA levels in 23 ART-suppressed individuals prior to undergoing an analytical ART interruption (ATI). We found that antibodies with distinct functional properties and Fc glycan signatures separated individuals into early and delayed viral rebounders (≤4 weeks versus >4 weeks) and tracked with levels of inflammatory cytokines and transcriptional activity of the viral reservoir. Specifically, individuals with early viral rebound exhibited higher levels of total HIV-specific IgGs carrying inflammatory Fc glycans, while delayed rebounders showed an enrichment of highly functional antibodies. Overall, only four features, including enhanced antibody-mediated NK cell activation in delayed rebounders, were necessary to discriminate the groups. These data suggest that antibody features can be used as sensitive indicators of HIV disease activity and could be included in future ATI studies. IMPORTANCE Plasma viremia reoccurs in most HIV-infected individuals once antiretro-viral therapy is interrupted, and interindividual differences in the kinetics of viral rebound have been associated with virological and immunological factors. Antibody features, including Fc functionality and Fc glycosylation, have been identified as sensitive surrogates for disease activity in multiple diseases. Here, we systematically analyzed HIV-specific antibody quantities and qualitative differences in 23 ART-suppressed individuals prior to undergoing an analytical ART interruption (ATI). We found that antibodies with distinct functional properties and Fc glycan signatures separated individuals into early and delayed viral rebounders and tracked with levels of inflammatory cytokines and transcriptional activity of the viral reservoir. These data suggest that antibody features can be used as sensitive indicators of HIV disease activity and could be included in future HIV eradication studies.",Immunology,"Microbiology, Virology"

However, the BSCF still suffers from chemical instability. In this study, the B-site of BSCF is partially substituted by a higher valence Ta5+ (5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%) to improve its structural stability - Ba0·5Sr0·5(Co0·8Fe0.2)1-xTaxO3-δ (BSCFTax, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20). It is found that doping with higher valence Ta5+ increases both chemical stability and electrochemical performance of BSCF. Although the BSCFTa0.10 shows the lowest oxygen vacancies indicating by the ratio of adsorbed oxygen vacancies (Oadsorbed) to lattice oxygen (Olattice), the electrochemical performance increases. The decrease in Co3+/Co4+ ratio results in increasing electronic conductivity in the anode. It is likely that proper amount of Ta5+ doping provide a balance between ionic and electronic conductivity in the anode and improved electrochemical performance. The symmetrical half-cells with electrolyte support (BSCFTa/YSZ/BSCFTa) are fabricated to determine the area specific resistance (ASR) and activation energy of conduction - BSCFTa0.10 shows the best performance. Cathode-supported Ni-YSZ/YSZ/BSCFTa0.10 also shows higher durability than Ni-YSZ/YSZ/BSCF (operating at current density −0.45 A cm−2 in electrolysis mode, 80 h, 800 °C and H2O to H2 ratio of 70:30).","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The completed system was composed of a card-sized electrochemical NFC tag sensor integrated with a smartphone and antibody-modified electrode sensor. Screen-printed graphene electrodes (SPGE) were modified with gold nanoparticles, increasing high sensitivity while β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was electropolymerized on the surface to capture antibodies. The modification and immobilization processes were verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The NFC-based electrochemical immunosensor was then used to quantify Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using amperometric detection by measuring the current from the (Fe(CN)6)3−/4− redox couple before and after addition of HBsAg. The linear calibration curve and limit of detection for HBsAg were found to be 10−200 μg/mL and 0.17 μg/mL, respectively. The sensor was then tested with chronic HBV infected serum samples and the system showed a good correlation with traditional immunoassays. This electrochemical immunosensor has the potential to be an alternative platform for portable, simple, sensitive and selective tools that can readily assess a variety of health indicators using a low-cost sensor system operated from a smartphone.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

As a result of this non-destructive approach, the physical and mechanical property of the original BC were well-preserved within the resulting BC/CMC hydrogel. As a BC/CMC-based colorimetric pH sensor, it exhibited a rapid response with an easy color differentiation between each pH by the naked eye, and wide linear range of pH 4.0–9.0 with good linearity. For the detection of glucose in sweat, the BC/CMC-based colorimetric glucose sensor provided a low limit of detection (25 μM) with a wide linear detection range (0.0–0.5 mM) and high accuracy. These BC/CMC based sensors could potentially be applied as non-invasive semi-quantitative sensors for on-skin health monitoring.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Magnetite nanoparticles (MNP) with a capacity of 373 pmol PNA/mg and coated with poly(N-acryloylglycine) (PNAG) showed a good response to magnetic field. The PNA probe immobilized on the MNP discriminated between non-complementary and complementary DNA using fluorophore-tagged DNA as a model. We applied this system for the enrichment of the zein gene from maize in eight cereal product samples. After DNA desorption from the MNP, and its amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis indicated that only cereal samples containing the zein gene from maize yielded positive results, indicating a high binding specificity between the PNA used and the complementary DNA. This PNA-functionalized MNP is potentially useful as an effective nano-solid support for DNA enrichment from other samples.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"

This paper aims to observe the moment redistribution behavior occurring due to flexural and shear loading in Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer-(GFRP) reinforced continuous concrete beams. A rectangular cross-section was adopted in this study with dimensions of 200 mm in width and 300 mm in depth with a constant shear span-to-depth ratio of 3. The reinforcement ratio for the top and bottom were equal at sagging and hogging moment regions. A finite element model was created using Analysis System (ANSYS) and validated with the existing experimental results in the literature review. Based on the literature review, the parametric study was conducted on twelve beam specimens to evaluate the influence of concrete compressive strength, transversal GFRP stirrups ratio, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio on the redistribution of the moment in beams. Several codes and guidelines adopted different analytical models. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) S806 adopted the modified compression field theory in predicting the shear capacity of the simply supported beams. Recently, various researchers encountered several factors and modifications to account for concrete contribution, longitudinal, and transverse reinforcement. A comparison between the predicting shear capacity of the generated finite element model, the analytical model, and the existing data from the literature was performed. The generated finite element model showed a good agreement with the experimental results, while the beam specimens failed in shear after undergoing significant moment redistribution from hogging to sagging moment region. The moment distribution observed about 21.5% from FEM of beam specimen GN-1.2-0.48-d, while the experimental results achieved 24% at failure load. For high strength concrete presented in beam specimen GH-1.2-0.63-d, the result showed about 20.2% moment distribution, compared to that achieved experimentally of 23% at failure load.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In essence, the solubility of DMPA is a function of temperature. When temperature increases, molecular interactions between DMPA and solvent molecules are accelerated. Thereby, the solubility of DMPA is enhanced. It was found that the mole fraction solubility of DMPA in mono solvents from high to low is in the order: 1,4-dioxane > gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) > gamma-valerolactone (GVL) > methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) > ethylacetate > butylacetate > cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME). The experimental solubility data are recorded and fit well with the Apelblat equation, Buchowski–Książczak λh equation, the NRTL model and the Wilson model. Thermodynamic properties of DMPA are analyzed viz. ΔsolH, ΔsolS, ΔmixG, ΔmixH and ΔmixS. The polymorphic transitions of DMPA in the various solvents have been studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

We studied the natural history and evaluated the performance of prognostic models in ACLF patients. Methods: Prospectively collected data of ACLF patients from APASL-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) was analyzed for 30-day outcomes. The models evaluated at days 0, 4, and 7 of presentation for 30-day mortality were: AARC (model and score), CLIF-C (ACLF score, and OF score), NACSELD-ACLF (model and binary), SOFA, APACHE-II, MELD, MELD-Lactate, and CTP. Evaluation parameters were discrimination (c-indices), calibration [accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV)], Akaike/Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC/BIC), Nagelkerke-R2, relative prediction errors, and odds ratios. Results: Thirty-day survival of the cohort (n = 2864) was 64.9% and was lowest for final-AARC-grade-III (32.8%) ACLF. Performance parameters of all models were best at day 7 than at day 4 or day 0 (p < 0.05 for C-indices of all models except NACSELD-ACLF). On comparison, day-7 AARC model had the numerically highest c-index 0.872, best accuracy 84.0%, PPV 87.8%, R2 0.609 and lower prediction errors by 10–50%. Day-7 NACSELD-ACLF-binary was the simple model (minimum AIC/BIC 12/17) with the highest odds (8.859) and sensitivity (100%) but with a lower PPV (70%) for mortality. Patients with day-7 AARC score > 12 had the lowest 30-day survival (5.7%). Conclusions: APASL-ACLF is often a progressive disease, and models assessed up to day 7 of presentation reliably predict 30-day mortality. Day-7 AARC model is a statistically robust tool for classifying risk of death and accurately predicting 30-day outcomes with relatively lower prediction errors. Day-7 AARC score > 12 may be used as a futility criterion in APASL-ACLF patients.",medical,Hepatology

Therefore, GSP program was developed as a knowledge-based curriculum. This study aimed to describe the development and architecture of the GSP curriculum by analyzing patients’ information and students’ evaluation to move toward a competency-based curriculum. Comparisons with the original GSP curriculum and future direction are discussed. Methods: Development and architecture of the GSP curriculum were described. Information of 130 patients attending the GSP clinic, and those who participated in a maintenance recall was analyzed. Students’ evaluation was performed using a 21-item questionnaire within seven domains based on the ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) checklist. The responses were made using a five-point ordinal scale ranging from totally agree to totally disagree. Results: Only 50% of the patients attended a maintenance recall. Among the recalled patients, 74.2% reported emerging problems. The AUN-QA questionnaire responses indicated that students mostly agreed with the program specification, teaching and learning approach, students’ assessment methods, student quality, and support domains. The modified curriculum was developed based on the patients’ information and students’ evaluation. The original and modified GSP curricula were compared. Conclusions: Information analysis of the patients and students’ evaluation are essential to move a knowledge-based curriculum for geriatric and special patient care dentistry toward a competency-based curriculum that is appropriate for patients’ condition and serves students’ requirements. Oral health care in elderly and special care patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, and should encompass oral disease problems, behavior, and social context.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"
Root biomechanical properties of Chrysopogon zizanioides and Chrysopogon nemoralis for soil reinforcement and slope stabilisation,"Phan T.N., Likitlersuang S., Kamchoom V., Leung A.K.",2021-10-01,"Biomechanical properties, Morphological traits, Orientation relationship, Root reinforcement, Soil bioengineerings, Soil erosion controls, Soil shear strength, Uniaxial tensile test, root morphological traits, root tensile strength, soil bioengineering, soil reinforcement, vetiver grass","Plant root reinforcement in soil bioengineering has gained increasing interest as a means of sustainable and environmentally friendly soil reinforcement and stabilisation. While Chrysopogon zizanioides is widely distributed in tropical regions worldwide and has been advocated for use in slope stabilisation and soil erosion control, C. nemoralis is normally distributed in mountainous areas in Southeast Asian countries, and its potential to reinforce soil has rarely been explored in the soil bioengineering literature. With the importance of root properties in soil bioengineering, this study was carried out to provide a comprehensive dataset of root biomechanical properties, morphological traits, and root reinforcement of these two contrasting vetiver species. A series of experiments, including root observation with a rhizobox system, uniaxial tensile test, and direct shear test, was performed. Results showed that Young's modulus and diameter of C. nemoralis roots were almost 1.4- and 1.3-times greater than those of C. zizanioides roots (p < 0.05). By contrast, no significant difference between the two vetiver species was observed in terms of tensile strength, 'side' root area ratio (RARS), and root orientation (p > 0.05). The diameter–strength (R2 = 0.55–0.56, p < 0.05) and diameter–modulus relationships (R2 = 0.51–0.6, p < 0.05) of both species were consistent with negative power-law models. Conversely, their diameter–orientation relationship followed a linear model (R2 = 0.85–0.89; p > 0.05). The soil shear strength in terms of cohesion greatly increased in the presence of the roots of C. nemoralis (Δc = 4.9 kPa) and C. zizanioides (Δc = 4.4 kPa). Therefore, C. nemoralis could be an alternative to C. zizanioides in soil bioengineering applications.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, sociology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Development, Environmental Science (all), Soil Science"

However, instead of an ischemic stroke, motor aura was suspected. Case presentations: A 24 year-old Thai female presented with left hemiparesis fifteen minutes after receiving CoronaVac. She also had numbness of her left arm and legs, flashing lights, and headaches. On physical examination, her BMI was 32.8. Her vital signs were normal. She had moderate left hemiparesis (MRC grade III), numbness on her left face, arms, and legs. Her weakness continued for 5 days. A brain CT scan was done showing no evidence of acute infarction. Acute treatment with aspirin was given. MRI in conjunction with MRA was performed in which no restricted diffusion was seen. A SPECT was performed to evaluate the function of the brain showing significant hypoperfusion of the right hemisphere. The patient gradually improved and was discharged. Discussions: In this study, we present the first case of stroke mimic after CoronaVac vaccination. After negative imaging studies had been performed repeatedly, we reach a conclusion that stroke is unlikely to be the cause. Presumably, this phenomenon could possibly have abnormal functional imaging study. Therefore, we believed that it might be due to cortical spreading depression, like migraine aura, which we had conducted a literature review.","genergyal, medical","Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

We find that the critical transition pressure to the 2H phase increases almost linearly with increasing temperature. Through the inspection of the phonon density of states, 2H-WTe2 is dynamically stable not only at high pressure, but also at zero pressure, indicating possible existence of 2H-WTe2 also at ambient conditions. On the other side, our results demonstrate that, at relevant temperature and pressure, the thermodynamic stability of 1T′-WTe2 is comparable to that of Td-WTe2, and further analysis reveals substantial similarities in terms of structural behavior between Td-WTe2 and 1T′-WTe2. These findings suggest not only that the two polytypes are likely to coexist in practical samples of WTe2 due probably to grains/regions either with tiny difference in stress, for example, or with different growth history, but also that the designation of 1T′, having been regularly used to described the compound under pressure in the literature, might actually be a mixture of Td and 1T′ polytypes, whose WTe2 layers laterally slide via low transition barrier induced probably by the applied pressure, resulting in the splitting of (101) and (113) peaks as observed in the diffraction experiments.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering, physics, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computational Mathematics"

The results are compared with other image labeling state of the art (SOTA) methods, such as global convolutional network (GCN) and ViT. Extensive experiments show that our Swin Transformer (SwinTF) with decoder designs reached a new state of the art on the Thailand Isan Landsat-8 corpus (89.8% F1 score), Thailand North Landsat-8 corpus (63.12% F1 score), and competitive results on ISPRS Vaihingen. Moreover, both our best-proposed methods (SwinTF-PSP and SwinTF-FPN) even outperformed SwinTF with supervised pre-training ViT on the ImageNet-1K in the Thailand, Landsat-8, and ISPRS Vaihingen corpora.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)
Discordant reporting of VTE in pancreatic cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of thromboprophylaxis versus chemotherapeutic trials,"Chiasakul T., Patell R., Maraveyas A., Carrier M., Zwicker J.I.",2021-02-01,"Anticoagulants, Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight, Humans, Pancreatic Neoplasms, Pulmonary Embolism, Venous Thromboembolism, anticoagulants, pancreatic neoplasms, thromboembolism, thrombosis, venous thromboembolism","Background: Despite the frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pancreatic cancer, it is inconsistently reported as an adverse event in clinical trials. We hypothesized that reported rates of VTE in pancreatic cancer clinical trials are influenced by the objectives of the trial, with higher rates reported in thromboprophylaxis compared with chemotherapeutic trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCT) in pancreatic cancer to quantify differences in reported rates of VTE in thromboprophylaxis and chemotherapeutic trials. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible thromboprophylaxis RCTs were required to report rates of thrombosis in non-anticoagulant pancreatic cancer cohorts. Eligible chemotherapy studies were RCTs evaluating chemotherapy regimens in advanced pancreatic cancer and reported thrombosis as adverse events. Pooled event rates of VTE and arterial thrombosis were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: The pooled VTE rate in 13 chemotherapy studies (5694 patients) was 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-9.0%) compared with 16.5% (95% CI, 11.7%-23.3%; P <.001) in 9 thromboprophylaxis studies (631 patients). The pooled symptomatic VTE rate from chemotherapy studies was 5.4% (95% CI, 3.5%-8.3%), which was significantly lower than the pooled rate from thromboprophylaxis studies of 10.5% (95% CI, 7.3%-14.9%; P =.02). Conclusion: The VTE incidence reported in chemotherapy RCTs in pancreatic cancer is significantly lower than reported in thromboprophylaxis studies. This finding highlights the underrecognition of VTE in chemotherapeutic trials and emphasizes the need to standardize approaches towards monitoring and reporting of VTE in clinical trials.",medical,Hematology

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are a proxy for fecal pollution; however the accuracy of their representation of fecal pollution health risks at recreational beaches impacted by non-point sources is disputed due to non-human derivation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between FIB and a range of culturable and molecular-based microbial source tracking (MST) markers and pathogenic bacteria, and physicochemical parameters and rainfall. Forty-two marine water samples were collected from seven sampling stations during six events at two tourist beaches in Thailand. Both beaches were contaminated with fecal pollution as evident from the GenBac3 marker at 88%–100% detection and up to 8.71 log10 copies/100 mL. The human-specific MST marker human polyomaviruses JC and BK (HPyVs) at up to 4.33 log10 copies/100 mL with 92%–94% positive detection indicated that human sewage was likely the main contamination source. CrAssphage showed lower frequencies and concentrations; its correlations with the FIB group (i.e., total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci) and GenBac3 diminished its use as a human-specific MST marker for coastal water. Human-specific culturable AIM06 and SR14 bacteriophages and general fecal indicator coliphages also showed less sensitivity than the human-specific molecular assays. The applicability of the GenBac3 endpoint PCR assay as a lower-cost prescreening step prior to the GenBac3 qPCR assay was supported by its 100% positive predictive value, but its limited negative predictive values required subsequent qPCR confirmation. Human enteric adenovirus and Vibrio cholerae were not found in any of the samples. The HPyVs related to Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and 5-d rainfall records, all of which were more prevalent and concentrated during the wet season. More monitoring is therefore recommended during wet periods. Temporal differences but no spatial differences were observed, suggesting the need for a sentinel site at each beach for routine monitoring. The exceedance of FIB water quality standards did not indicate increased prevalence or concentrations of the HPyVs or Vibrio spp. pathogen group, so the utility of FIB as an indicator of health risks at tropical beaches maybe challenged. Accurate assessment of fecal pollution by incorporating MST markers could lead to developing a more effective water quality monitoring plan to better protect human health risks in tropical recreational beaches.","environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

E-waste mismanagement caused by illegal transport of WEEE has intensified public health and environmental concerns. Computers are processed in recycling industries, but they still contain vulnerable metal remnants, such as gold. High-grade components, such as Random-Access Module (RAM), for example, are often extracted by hydrometallurgical processes through different leaching chemicals along with their related methods. Gold leaching agents, including aqua regia and cyanide-based solutions, were considered to extract gold from computer RAM in this study. Environmental impacts of the two extracting processes were investigated using material flow analysis and life cycle assessment, based on 1 kg of recovered gold. The effect of pulp density was also measured. The comparison between the two leaching processes without waste management demonstrated that the cyanide-based solution provided 8.5 times lower in terrestrial ecotoxicity and 6.4 times lower in human carcinogenic toxicity than aqua regia due to the lower overall chemical consumption. Nevertheless, proper wastewater treatments and a combination of incineration and landfill for solid waste treatment are potential options to minimize these impacts.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

In this study, protein hydrolysates from shiitake mushroom were hydrolyzed to prepare ACE-inhibitory peptides. Optimum process conditions for the hydrolysis of shiitake mushrooms using Alcalase were optimized using response surface methodology. Monitoring was conducted to check the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE inhibitory activity. In the results, the optimum condition with the highest DH value of 28.88% was 50.2 °C, 3-h hydrolysis time, and 1.16 enzyme/substrate ratios. The highest ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 of 0.33 μg/mL) was under 47 °C, 3 h 28 min hydrolysis time, and 0.59 enzyme/substrate ratios. The highest activity was fractionated into 5 ranges of molecular weight, and the fraction below 0.65 kDa showed the highest activity with IC50 of 0.23 μg/mL. This fraction underwent purification using RP-HPLC, meanwhile the peak which offered a retention time of about 37 min showed high ACE inhibitory activity. Mass spectrometry identified the amino acid sequence of this peak as Lys-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Phe-Asp-Val-Thr (KIGSRSRFDVT), with a molecular weight of 1265.43 Da. The synthesized variant of this peptide produced an ACE inhibitory activity (IC50) of 37.14 μM. The peptide KIGSRSRFDVT was shown to serve as a non-competitive inhibitor according to the Lineweaver–Burk plot findings. A molecular docking study was performed, which showed that the peptide binding occurred at an ACE non-active site. The findings suggest that peptides derived from shiitake mushrooms could serve either as useful components in pharmaceutical products, or in functional foods for the purpose of treating hypertension.

The effect of different CO32- to PO43- molar ratios on the properties, morphology, and Pb(II) removal performance of the synthesized materials was investigated. Varying the molar ratios of CO32- to PO43-, from 0:19 (HAP) to 5:14 (CHAP5), 10:9 (CHAP10), and 15:4 (CHAP15), resulted in smaller particle size, lower crystallinity, and higher surface area of materials with higher CO32- concentrations. Consequently, CHAP15 demonstrated significantly superior maximum adsorption capacity (1697 mg g-1) among all the synthesized materials. The isotherm and kinetics of Pb(II) adsorption by CHAP15 were satisfactorily described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, respectively. The dominant mechanism for Pb(II) removal by CHAP15 was the dissolution of adsorbent followed by the reaction of Pb(II) ions with phosphate ions and with carbonate ions to form poorly-soluble compounds: Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2 and Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The presence of βAsp affects the proteolytic stability of the protein. Formation of the isomerized Asp plays a diverse and crucial role in aging, cancer, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. A number of methods have been developed to detect βAsp, and they are usually used in conjunction. Because of identical mass, differentiation of βAsp and Asp residues is challenged. Degradation of βAsp is still unclear and needed to be explored. The energetics and mechanism of five possible pathways for cleavages at βAsp in peptide model have been investigated by DFT/B3LYP/6–311 + + G(d,p) level of the theory. The calculations show that peptide bond cleavage at α-chain (amino side) due to αOC → αCN ring closure is the most favorable reaction. The result is in agreement with experiment utilizing PSD/CRF method. The second most favorable pathway is due to αOC → βC ring closure results in β-chain cleavage. The cleavage products βAsp and Asp fragments can be used to signify an abundance of βAsp residue in nonenzymatic condition. Other three cyclizations initiated by either α- or β-amino nitrogen result in various cleavages, isomerization to Asp, and reconversion to original βAsp. These three cyclization pathways are obstructed because they require mostly high activation barriers and their intermediates are quite less thermodynamically stable. Thus, computational results also confirm that βAsp → Asp is prohibited in case of nonenzymatic condition which means that protein l-isoaspartyl O-methyl transferase (PIMT) is needed for this modification.

Seizure frequency after taking PER at 3 and 12 months were compared with baseline seizure frequency within the same time period prior to starting PER. Secondary outcomes were retention rate, side effects, and predictors for a response to PER. Descriptive statistics and the Kernel regression model were employed. Results: Forty-one patients received PER treatment during the study period. Six patients who had no baseline seizure frequency recordings were excluded, for a total of 35 patients included for analysis. Mean age was 40.06 years (SD 12.34).

This phenomenon poses a potential security risk in various black-box systems that rely on image classifiers. One of the observations on networks that have transferability of adversarial examples between them is the similarity of their architectures. Networks with high architectural similarity tend to share high transferability as well. Thus, in this study, we address this problem from a novel perspective by investigating the contribution of network architecture to transferability. Specifically, we propose an architecture searching framework that employs neuroevolution to evolve network architectures and gradient misalignment loss to encourage networks to converge into dissimilar functions after training. Our findings indicate that the proposed framework successfully discovers architectures that reduce transferability from four standard networks, including ResNet and VGG, while maintaining good accuracy on unperturbed images. In addition, the evolved networks trained with gradient misalignment exhibit significantly lower transferability than a standard network trained with gradient misalignment, which indicates that network architecture plays an important role in reducing transferability. We demonstrate that designing or exploring proper network architectures is a promising approach to tackle the transferability issue and train adversarially robust image classifiers.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

A rehabilitation method is also reported. The CSC wall consisted of precast reinforced concrete walls, soil-cement walls, and soil-cement columns encased with a stabilized mat. The original CSC wall configuration was designed based on the maximum soft clay thickness of 4 m found in the excavation areas from seven soil boreholes, providing an FSglobal of 1.61. However, a 50-m-long section of the composite wall failed unexpectedly. The field observation revealed that the wall collapsed from the loss of internal wall stability, namely, broken wall structures caused by bending failure. Continuous circular failure was observed due to the shear failure of the surrounding clays. This failure's primary cause was the unexpected soft clay thickness of 7 m induced by insufficient previous soil explorations. Finite element analyses confirmed that the unanticipated 7-m-thick soft clay facilitated significant failure since the FSglobal value was lower than 1.00. The soil and wall bodies exhibited a collapse because the shear and tensile failure points were fully developed in whole soil bodies and wall structures, respectively. Rehabilitation was performed by revising the original CSC wall configuration for supporting 7-m-thick soft clay, namely, increasing the embedded wall structure lengths and soil-cement rows to strengthen the CSC wall. The revised wall configuration improved the FSglobal during excavation to a value of 1.78, resulting in no visual failure after implementing the rehabilitation.

Dispersants with a low environmental impact are necessary for fuel oil spill remediation. This study aimed to formulate bio-based dispersants by mixing anionic biosurfactant (lipopeptides from Bacillus subtilis GY19) with nonionic oleochemical surfactant (Dehydol LS7TH). The synergistic effect of the anionic-nonionic surfactant mixture produced a Winsor Type III microemulsion, which promoted petroleum mobilization. The hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) equations for ionic and nonionic surfactant mixtures were compared, and it was found that the ionic equation was applicable for the calculation of lipopeptides and Dehydol LS7TH concentrations. The best formula contained 6.6% w/v lipopeptides and 11.9% w/v Dehydol LS7TH in seawater, and its dispersion effectiveness for bunker fuels A and C was 92% and 78%, respectively. The application of bio-based dispersants in water sources was optimized by Box-Behnken design. The efficiency of the bio-based dispersant was affected by the dispersant-to-oil ratios (DORs) but not by the water salinity. A suitable range of DORs for different oil contamination levels could be identified from the response surface plot. The dispersed fuel oil was further degraded by adding an oil-degrading bacterial consortium to the chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAFs). After 7 days of incubation, the concentration of fuel oil was reduced from 3692 mg/L to 356 mg/L (88% removal efficiency). On the other hand, the abiotic control removed less than 40% fuel oil from the CEWAFs. This bio-based dispersant had an efficiency comparable to that of a commercial dispersant. The process of dispersant formulation and optimization could be applied to other surfactant mixtures.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; water pollution; control, pollution control and remedicalation, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Objective: This study aimed to prospectively assess patients' perceptions before and after treatment with dental implants and to identify the impact of patients' characteristics on their perceptions. Materials and methods: Patients' perceptions on implant therapy were prospectively assessed by means of purpose-made questionnaire, rating the extent of agreement/disagreement with a set of statements on a visual analog scale. The questionnaire was collected before initial consultation with the implant dentist and post-treatment at least 1 month after prosthetic loading of the implant. Changes in patients' perceptions were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Pretreatment questionnaire was collected from 359 patients. While 245 of them proceeded with implant therapy, 145 received final restoration within the timeframe of the study and completed the post-treatment questionnaires between 1 and 6 months after prosthesis delivery. The most common source of information was dental professions (72.4%). Although patients' perceptions were more realistic at post-treatment, few improper perceptions persisted as only 51% of patients agreed with the statement “There is a chance of dental implant failure,” 28% agreed with the statement “Dental implants last longer than natural teeth,” and higher percentage of patients agreed with “Dental implant therapy is appropriate for all patients.”. Conclusions: Although patients appear to harbor more realistic perceptions of implant therapy, certain improper perceptions still persist at post-treatment. The design of appropriate patient educational program might be essential to correct misperceptions that might affect long term success of implant therapy.

Given the lack of solid information regarding the possible effects of caffeine, one of the most consumed natural psychoactive substances, on molecular signaling pathways implicated in the aggressive behavior of lung cancer, our study aimed to evaluate the effect and mechanism of caffeine on metastasis-related mechanisms. The results revealed that caffeine treatment at concentrations of 0-500 μM caused no direct cytotoxic effects on NCI-H23 cells. Treatment of cells with caffeine showed good potential to inhibit cell proliferation at 48 h and induced significant cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Concerning metastasis, caffeine was shown to reduce filopodia formation, inhibit migration and invasion capability, and reduce the ability of cancer cells to survive and grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Moreover, caffeine could attenuate the formation of 3D tumor spheroids in cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched populations. With regard to mechanisms, we found that caffeine significantly altered the integrin pattern of the treated cells and caused the downregulation of metastasis-associated integrins, namely, integrins αv and β3. Subsequently, the downstream signals, including protein signaling and transcription factors, namely, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and c-Myc, were significantly decreased in caffeine-exposed cells. Taken together, our novel data on caffeine-inhibiting mechanism in relation to metastasis in lung cancer could provide insights into the impact of caffeine intake on human diseases and conditions.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Among the four common supports (Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2) evaluated, single-atom Pt species were identified on Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2, among which ZrO2 was the best to stabilize atomically dispersed Pt. Compared to single-atom Pt catalysts prepared through the conventional impregnation method, samples synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis displayed excellent catalytic performance in CO oxidation, methane combustion and methane partial oxidation reactions. Characterization results revealed that flame spray pyrolysis favoured the formation of tetragonal-monoclinic phase of ZrO2 with improved redox property, thus leading to enhanced catalytic activity in high-temperature applications.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Catalysis, Environmental Science (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

The studies of cytotoxicity towards human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7, indicated that p-tert-butylphenoxy analogue 2m showed significant inhibitory activity against Huh7 with IC50 = 5.67 ± 0.57 µM. More importantly, 2m showed low cytotoxicity against human embryonal lung fibroblast cell line, MRC-5, with IC50 > 100 µM, suggesting its highly selective cytotoxic activity (SI > 17.6) towards Huh7 which is much superior to that of Sorafenib (SI = 6.73). The molecular docking studies revealed that the analogue 2m bound B-RAF near the binding position of Sorafenib, while it interacted VEGFR2 efficiently at the same binding position of Sorafenib. However, 2m exhibited moderate inhibitory activity toward B-RAF, implying that its anti-Huh7 effect might not strictly relate to inhibition of B-RAF. Wound healing and BrdU cell proliferation assays confirmed anti-cell migration and anti-cell proliferative activities towards Huh7. With its inhibitory efficiency and high safety profile, 2m has been identified as a promising candidate for the treatment of HCC.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

However, the mainstay antiepileptic pharmacotherapies can induce severe side effects. While the benefit of playing Mozart K.448 music has been studied as an alternative, supplementary, nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy, the literature features limited few randomized controlled trial studies of children. Objective: We aimed to study the effect of Mozart K.448 for two pianos on interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with epilepsy. Methods: We employed a single-blinded randomized trial design with a placebo control. The treatment group listened to the first 8 min of Mozart K.448 for two pianos during EEG recording. The control group underwent an EEG recording of the same duration in a quiet environment. Interictal epileptiform discharges were manually counted for 8 min before, during, and after the song was plated. Quantitative electroencephalogram and HRV were analyzed in each period. Result: A total of 32 patients aged 0–18 years were enrolled. There were 12 patients in the music group and 14 patients in the control group; 67% of the patients in the former exhibited significantly decreased IEDs while listening to the music compared with 42% of the patients in the quiet group (RR [Relative Risk Reduction]: 0.72, p-value: < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69–0.74). During music exposure, qEEG demonstrated an increase in the delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio relative to that of controls (median in music: + 3% and control: − 6%, p-value: 0.520). Heart rate variability analyses showed a decrease in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF), which represents parasympathetic activity during music exposure (decrease of 34%, p-value: 0.382). Conclusion: The present study showed that Mozart K.448 reduced the number of IEDs in children with epilepsy and that Mozart K.448 could enhance parasympathetic activity. However, possibly because of the small study population, statistical significance was not reached. Our study revealed the considerable potential of music in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Behavioral Neuroscience"

However, it is not clear whether changes in cesium, rubidium, and rhenium are associated with activated immune-inflammatory pathways, cognitive impairments, and the symptomatology of SCZ. Methods: This study measured cesium, rubidium, and rhenium, cognitive impairments (using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia [BACS]), and the levels of cytokines/chemokines interleukin (IL)-ip, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and eotaxin (CCL11) in 120 patients with SCZ and 54 healthy controls. Severity of illness was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating (FF) Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Results: Serum cesium was significantly lower in patients with SCZ as compared with controls. Further, serum cesium was significantly and inversely associated with CCL11 and TNF-a, but not IL-1 b, in patients with SCZ; significant inverse associations were also noted between serum cesium levels and BPRS, FF, HAM-D, and SANS scores. Finally, cesium was positively correlated with neurocognitive probe results including the Tower of London, Symbol Coding, Controlled Word Association, Category Instances, Digit Sequencing Task, and List Learning tests. Conclusion: The results suggest that lowered serum cesium levels may play a role in the pathophysiology of SCZ, contributing to specific symptom domains including negative, depressive and fatigue symptoms, neurocognitive impairments (spatial working, episodic, and semantic memory and executive functions), and neuroimmune pathways.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

Under a continued overload of traffic action on the pavement, the hole can potentially collapse, leading to creation of potholes. This phenomenon is commonly known as a trapdoor problem. Even though there are several previous works considering this problem, the stability solutions of trapdoors in two-layered soils have not yet been studied. To estimate the undrained stability of active trapdoors in two-layered clays under plane strain conditions, numerical solutions based on the finite element method have been developed. The influence parameters include the coverage depth of the trapdoor, and the thickness and undrained shear strength of the clay layers. The effects of these parameters on the stability of active trapdoors as well as their associated failure mechanisms are examined and discussed in this paper. The solutions are presented in the form of dimensionless charts that can be used for the design of trapdoor systems in two-layered clays with different thicknesses and undrained shear strengths.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

The disorder is categorized into three phenotypes: GD type 1 or nonneuronopathic GD; GD type 2 or acute neuronopathic GD; and GD type 3 or chronic neuronopathic GD. The purposes of this study were to describe clinical characteristics of Thai GD in patients diagnosed and/or followed up during 2010–2018 and to perform re-genotyping including analysis of GBA recombinant alleles which had not been investigated in Thai patients before. Results: There were 27 patients from seven medical centers, enrolled in the study. All the cases had pediatric onset. GD3 (44.5%) was the most common phenotype, followed by GD2 (40.7%) and GD1 (14.8%), with one case of neonatal GD. The median age of onset for GD1, GD2, and GD3 was 72, 4 and 12 months, respectively, suggesting relatively earlier onset of GD1 and GD3 in Thai patients. All patients with GD1 and most patients with GD3 received ERT. Four patients with GD3 had ERT followed by HSCT. Patients with GD3 who received no or late ERT showed unfavorable outcomes. We identified 14 variants including two novel (p.S384F and p.W533*) and 12 reported pathogenic variants: p.L483P, p.N409S, p.R159W, p.P305A, p.A175G, p.D448H, p.V414L, IVS2+1G>A, IVS6-1G>C, IVS7+1G>C, IVS9-3C>G, and Rec1a. The p.L483P was the most prevalent allele found in this study, at 66% (33/50 alleles), followed by IVS2+1G>A, Rec1a, and IVS6-1G>C. Twenty-four percent of patients were reassigned with validated genotypes, most of whom (4 of 6) were patients with GD2. The [p.S384F + p.W533*] being compounded with p.L483P, was found in the patient with neonatal GD, suggesting that the p.S384F could potentiate the deleterious effect of the p.W533*, and/or vice versa. Conclusions: Neuronopathic GD was strikingly prevalent among Thai affected population. Homozygous p.L483P was the most common genotype identified in Thai patients. Recombinant allele Rec1a and splicing mutations were associated with GD2 and severe cases of GD3.

From molecular dynamics simulations, two possible inclusion complexes formed by the chromone ring (C-ring, Form I) and the phenyl ring (P-ring, Form II) of 3HF insertion to -CD were observed. Form II is likely more stable because of lower fluctuation of 3HF inside the hydrophobic cavity and lower water accessibility to the encapsulated 3HF. Next, the conformation analysis of these models in the ground (S0) and the first excited (S1) states was carried out by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, respectively, to reveal the photophysical properties of 3HF influenced by the -CD. The results show that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding (interHB) between 3HF and -CD, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding (intraHB) within 3HF are strengthened in the S1 state confirmed by the shorter interHB and intraHB distances and the red-shift of O-H vibrational modes involving in the ESPT process. The simulated absorption and emission spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data. Significantly, in the S1 state, the keto form of 3HF is stabilized by -CD, explaining the increased quantum yield of keto emission of 3HF when complexing with -CD in the experiment. In the other word, ESPT of 3HF is more favorable in the -CD hydrophobic cavity than in aqueous solution.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Activated oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), inflammatory pathways, and increased atherogenicity are shared pathways underpinning CVD and mood disorders. Methods: The current study examined the effects of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and malondialdehyde (MDA) on systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in 96 mood disordered patients and 60 healthy controls. Results: A large part of the variance in SBP (31.6%) was explained by the regression on a z unit-weighted composite score (based on LOOH, AOPP, SOD, NOx) reflecting nitro-oxidative stress toxicity (NOSTOX), coupled with highly sensitive C-reactive protein, body weight and use of antihypertensives. Increased DBP was best predicted (23.8%) by body mass index and NOSTOX. The most important O&NS biomarkers predicting an increased SBP were in descending order of significance: LOOH, AOPP and SOD. Higher levels of the atherogenic index of plasma, HOMA2 insulin resistance index and basal thyroid-stimulating hormone also contributed to increased SBP independently from NOSTOX. Although there were no significant changes in SBP/DBP in mood disorders, the associations between NOSTOX and blood pressure were significant in patients with mood disorders but not in healthy controls. Conclusions: Activated O&NS pathways including increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, which indicates hypochlorous stress, are the most important predictors of an increased BP, especially in patients with mood disorders.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Powder injection moulding is one of the most effective composite processing essentially for small and complex parts. Moulding of feedstock is the key step determining green and sintered properties. This research investigated effects of moulding parameters which are % solid loading and moulding speed on microstructure and properties of aluminium composite. Commercial aluminium alloy powder and SiC particulate at 15 vol.% addition were formulated at 55 % and 60 % solid loading. Injection moulding were operated using a horizontal screw driven typed machine at 1600-1800 rpm speed and 280-300o C moulding temperature. After sintering at 655o C, property assessment via microstructure, density, % shrinkage, distortion and hardness were carried out. It was found that feedstock of 55 % solid loading occasionally led to flash problem while that of higher solid loading experienced higher viscosity to fulfill four-cavity mould. Moulding speed investigated did not significantly affect mould filling and overall properties. Sintered microstructures generally showed well-distributed SiC particulate in the aluminium matrix. The optimum injection moulding condition was the feedstock prepared at 60% solid loading, moulding at 1800 rpm speed, which offered theoretical density of greater than 98.5 % and micro Vickers hardness of 125.2 Hv.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Entomological risk assessment for scrub typhus and rickettsial disease in Phu Chi Fah village-Chiang Rai was performed to determine areas at greatest risk for disease transmission in order to increase awareness of diseases to travelers and healthcare workers. Methods: From 2016 to 2018, rodents and chiggers were collected from 7 sites covering residential, grassland, and forest areas to determine the prevalence of pathogen of interest. The correlation between land type and vector-host-pathogen interaction system was investigated. Result: High prevalence of O. tsutsugamushi-infected and Rickettsia-infected chiggers was observed especially in areas with grassland and forest ecotones. Chigger and rodent species composition were negatively associated with the level of human disturbance. Increased density of rodents was responsible for a higher abundance of chigger population and increased prevalence of O. tsutsugmaushi infection in chigger in the following year. Conclusion: Communities in the study areas have an increased exposure risk to scrub typhus and potentially spotted fever group rickettsiosis. Travellers to this endemic area should pay more attention pathogen risks so as to avoid vector and disease exposure. Seasonal rodenticidal activity may help migitate the risk of pathogen transmission.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical","Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Thailand has implemented a two-dose MMR vaccination policy since 2010. This study aimed to describe the seroprevalence rate of rubella among children and adolescents in Thailand. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 132 healthy children (aged 3–9 years) who had received 2 doses of rubella vaccine and 424 adolescents (aged 10–18 years) who were expected to receive at least 1 dose of rubella vaccine. Stored serum samples from healthy children and recently drawn serum samples from adolescents were tested for rubella IgG antibody using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (EUROIMMUN). Seroprotection was defined as a rubella IgG level ≥ 10 IU/mL. The rubella seroprevalence rate among children and adolescents who had 2 documented doses of MMR was 97.0% (95 %CI 92.5–99.2%) and 85.4% (95% CI 78.8–90.6%, p < 0.01) respectively. The geometric mean titer of rubella was higher in children, 38.3 (95% CI 33.5–43.9) compared to adolescents, 22.5 (19.4–25.9) IU/mL. We observed an inverse correlation between the rubella titer and time interval from the second rubella containing vaccine dose (R = -0.30, p < 0.01). A 2-dose MMR vaccination course produces a high seroprevalence of rubella immunity in children, which decreases with time, suggesting waning of immunity.

Ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence sensor based on nitrogen-decorated carbon dots for Listeria monocytogenes determination using a screen-printed carbon electrode,"Jampasa S., Ngamrojanavanich N., Rengpipat S., Chailapakul O., Kalcher K., Chaiyo S.",2021-09-15,"'current, A green methodology, Carbon dots, Electrochemiluminescence sensors, Food-borne pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes, Nitrogen-decorated carbon dot, Poor performance, Screen-printed carbon electrodes, Ultra sensitives, Biosensing Techniques, Carbon, Electrochemical Techniques, Electrodes, Graphite, Listeria monocytogenes, Luminescent Measurements, Nitrogen, Quantum Dots, A green methodology, Electrochemiluminescence sensor, Listeria monocytogenes, Nitrogen-decorated carbon dots, Screen-printed carbon electrode","Current method for identification of foodborne pathogens suffers from its relatively poor performance, consequently limiting its use. Herein, we first describe an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based on nitrogen-decorated carbon dots (NCDs) for Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) determination using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Citric acid serves as carbon source, and ethylenediamine, a molecule containing nitrogen atom, is employed to synthesize CDs. Approximately 4 nm NCD with homogenous size distribution can be produced via a single step green microwave-assisted methodology. The construction of ECL sensor is initiated by the immobilization of capture antibody (Ab1) onto the carboxyl graphene (GOOH)-modified SPCE, where immunocomplexes (antigen and the NCD-labelled secondary antibody (Ab2-NCD)) are formed, resulting in a substantial increment in the ECL signal response in the presence of K2S2O8. The GOOH allows direct formation of the capture antibodies and enhances the electrochemical properties. Under optimal parameters, this sensor exhibits wide linearity (2 to 1.0 × 106 CFU mL−1), high sensitivity (0.104 or 1.0 × 10−1 CFU mL−1) and specificity over the nontargeting studied pathogens and is successfully applied to determine L. monocytogenes in food products. These promising results together with its performance suggest that this proposed platform may serve as an alternative device to effectively control the spread of foodborne diseases.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Adsorbents were directly submerged in continuously flowing discharged brine concentrate. Studied adsorbents were amidoximated polymer gel prepared from gamma irradiation, amidoximated polymer gel prepared from UV radiation curing, amidoximated polyacrylonitrile fibers, and chromic-acid-treated low-density polyethylene fibers grafted with amidoxime functional group using gamma radiation. Uranium concentration in brine concentrate and input seawater was analyzed to be 4.8 and 3.1 ppb, respectively. Gel adsorbent synthesized by gamma irradiation exhibited the highest uranium loading capacity of 1.39 mg/g-ad with 20 000 L/h rejected brine flow-rate after 6 weeks of soaking. The estimated uranium recovery cost is 406.81 USD/kg uranium. If the adsorption capacity was increased to 2 mg/g-ad, the projected cost was reduced to 338.95 USD/kg. Under this land-based recovery scheme, no work is performed in an open ocean environment, thus, ensuring safety and reducing cost and time, especially the costs associated with ships, personnel, and diesel fuel to bring the materials to the ocean and back to the shore. The present study demonstrates that direct uranium recovery from discharged brine concentrate is possible using amidoxime-based adsorbents developed to study uranium extraction from natural seawater. This should pave the way for further experimental studies in larger seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants for the possible future energy source. A proposed large-scale, yet very simple, deployment strategy at a hypothetical SWRO plant is also presented. Novelty statement: Successful uranium adsorption by directly submerging adsorbents in continuously flowing discharged brine concentrate from seawater reverse osmosis plant Mooring and recovery costs largely eliminated because of land-based deployment Highest uranium uptake capacity of 1.39 mg/g adsorbent after 6 weeks of soaking.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Traditional methods of evaluating liquefaction potential involve standard penetration test (SPT) or cone penetration tests. This research augmented experimental results with numerical methods to evaluate the liquefaction potential of Mae Lao Sand in Chiang Rai province of northern Thailand. SPT and downhole seismic test data collected during a field investigation at the Mae Lao site were compared to a 1D site response model analysis of the site. A series of undrained monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests was conducted on Mae Lao Sand specimens with different initial void ratios and confining pressures. Cyclic triaxial test results with varying deviator stress amplitudes were used to draw liquefaction resistance curves. Results from numerical simulation of sand liquefaction were used to characterise the stress–strain-pore water pressure response of Mae Lao Sand. 1D site response analysis determined seismic responses with different geological and groundwater conditions. All put together, the results showed that pore water pressure ratio decreases with increasing sand stiffness, the thickness of a soil layer significantly increases its liquefaction potential, and in-situ conditions and groundwater depths have major influences on the liquefaction potential of sand layers.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Balancing injury risk and power development by weighted jump squat through controlling eccentric loading. J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 2999-3005, 2021-Weighted jump squat (WJS) training is highly effective for increasing neuromuscular power but entails higher injury risk than traditional resistance training because of the impact of landing. Braking mechanisms can be used to control the landing impact; however, the optimal eccentric loading condition that balances injury risks and power output is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess different eccentric braking conditions. Twenty-two male varsity basketball players aged 20.8 6 1.1 years and a 1 repetition maximum (1RM) of back squat-to-body mass ratio of 2.0 6 0.2 participated in the study. The subjects performed 2 sets of WJS of 6 repetitions with additional 30% of 1RM load under 4 randomly assigned conditions: (a) traditional load, no braking (B0), (b) 25% braking load reduction during landing (B25), (c) 50% braking load reduction during landing (B50), and (d) 100% braking load reduction during landing with release at touchdown (B100R). A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine differences of dependent variables: peak power output, peak force, peak velocity, and impulse. B100R resulted in statistically lower eccentric peak force and impulse for the first 50 milliseconds than the other 3 conditions (p, 0.05), but the largest concentric peak power. Furthermore, B0 resulted in statistically lower concentric peak power and peak velocity than the other 3 conditions (p, 0.05). We suggest that B100R was a more favorable loading condition that balanced injury risk and power production in WJS.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

We examined whether impairment per cognitive function screening is associated with adherence and performance in the intervention. Methods: Thirty dialysis patients were randomly assigned to a 3-month pedometer-based intervention with weekly goals. Participants were administered the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS), a test of global mental status. We examined the association of levels of impairment on the TICS (≥33: unimpaired, 26-32: ambiguous impairment, 21-25: mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) with adherence, achieving weekly goals, and increasing steps, physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB), and self-reported physical function (PF) through multivariable linear mixed-model and logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, BMI, dialysis modality, baseline steps, baseline SPPB, and stroke status. Results: One-third of participants were unimpaired, and 13% had MCI. Participants with worse results on cognitive function screening missed more calls and completed fewer weekly goals than participants with better results. During the intervention, a worse result on cognitive function screening was associated with smaller increases in steps compared to those without impairment: (ambiguous: -620 [95% CI -174, -1,415], MCI: -1,653 [95% CI -120, -3,187]); less improvement in SPPB (ambiguous: -0.22 points [95% CI -0.08, -0.44], MCI: -0.45 [95% CI -0.13, -0.77]); and less improvement in PF (ambiguous: -4.0 points [95% CI -12.2, 4.1], MCI: -14.0 [95% CI -24.9, -3.1]). During the postintervention period, a worse result on cognitive function screening was associated with smaller increases in SPPB (ambiguous: -0.54 [95% CI -1.27, 0.19], MCI: -0.97 [95% CI -0.37, -1.58]) and PF (ambiguous: -3.3 [95% CI -6.5, -0.04], MCI: -10.5 [95% CI -18.7, -2.3]). Discussion/Conclusion: Participants with worse results on cognitive function screening had worse adherence and derived less benefit from this pedometer-based intervention. Future exercise interventions should be developed incorporating methods to address cognitive impairment, for example, by including caregivers when planning such interventions.",medical,Nephrology

Methods We collected data on 429 patients with ICPi-AKI and 429 control patients who received ICPis contemporaneously but who did not develop ICPi-AKI from 30 sites in 10 countries. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ICPi-AKI and its recovery. A multivariable Cox model was used to estimate the effect of ICPi rechallenge versus no rechallenge on survival following ICPi-AKI. Results ICPi-AKI occurred at a median of 16 weeks (IQR 8-32) following ICPi initiation. Lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, and extrarenal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were each associated with a higher risk of ICPi-AKI. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis was the most common lesion on kidney biopsy (125/151 biopsied patients [82.7%]). Renal recovery occurred in 276 patients (64.3%) at a median of 7 weeks (IQR 3-10) following ICPi-AKI. Treatment with corticosteroids within 14 days following ICPi-AKI diagnosis was associated with higher odds of renal recovery (adjusted OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.58 to 4.41). Among patients treated with corticosteroids, early initiation of corticosteroids (within 3 days of ICPi-AKI) was associated with a higher odds of renal recovery compared with later initiation (more than 3 days following ICPi-AKI) (adjusted OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.79). Of 121 patients rechallenged, 20 (16.5%) developed recurrent ICPi-AKI. There was no difference in survival among patients rechallenged versus those not rechallenged following ICPi-AKI. Conclusions Patients who developed ICPi-AKI were more likely to have impaired renal function at baseline, use a PPI, and have extrarenal irAEs. Two-thirds of patients had renal recovery following ICPi-AKI.

Various studies have reported on the nasal septal cartilage as a donor site for Caucasian and Asian populations. However, studies regarding the Thai nasal septal cartilage dimensions are rare. This study aimed to examine the length, height, area, and thickness of the nasal septal cartilage, along with implications of the size and quantity of the available cartilage, for grafting in Thai cadavers. Methods: We analyzed the nasal septal cartilage in 42 Thai cadavers. The length, height, area, and thickness were digitally measured using ImageJ 1.52 software, along with the size and area of the available cartilage for grafting after preserving a 10-mm L-strut. Data were compared between sexes. Results: The mean height, length, and area of the nasal septal cartilage were 30.96 ± 5.90 mm, 26.13 ± 6.90 mm, and 636.10 ± 196.13 mm2, respectively. The length did not differ significantly between sexes. However, the height and area in male cadavers were greater than those in female cadavers. The mean thickness ranged from 0.77 to 1.02 mm depending on the area, with the thickest and thinnest areas being the superoposterior and inferoposterior parts, respectively. The mean height, length, and area of the harvestable cartilage were 20.96 mm, 16.13 mm, and 384.84 mm2, respectively, after excluding the L-strut. Conclusion: Our results provide major anatomical data of the Thai nasal septal cartilage. Its implication for use of the septal cartilage for grafting is 21 mm in height and 16 mm in length, which is sufficiently safe to maintain nasal support.

The aim of this study is to examine the biomarker, neurocognitive and symptomatic correlates of physiosomatic symptoms in schizophrenia. We recruited 115 schizophrenia patients and 43 healthy controls and measured the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating (FF) scale, schizophrenia symptom dimensions, and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. We measured neuro-immune markers including plasma CCL11 (eotaxin), interleukin-(IL)-6, IL-10, Dickkopf protein 1 (DKK1), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and endogenous opioid system (EOS) markers including κ-opioid receptor (KOR), μ-opioid receptor (MOR), endomorphin-2 (EM2) and β-endorphin. Patients with an increased FF score display increased ratings of psychosis, hostility, excitement, formal though disorders, psycho-motor retardation and negative symptoms as compared with patients with lower FF scores. A large part of the variance in the FF score (55.1%) is explained by the regression on digit sequencing task, token motor task, list learning, IL-10, age (all inversely) and IL-6 (positively). Neural network analysis shows that the top-6 predictors of the FF score are (in descending order): IL-6, HMGB1, education, MOR, KOR and IL-10. We found that 45.1% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from cognitive test scores, schizophrenia symptoms and the FF score was explained by HMGB1, MOR, EM2, DKK1, and CCL11. Physiosomatic symptoms are an integral part of the phenome of schizophrenia. Neurotoxic immune pathways and lowered immune regulation coupled with alterations in the EOS appear to drive the physiosomatic symptoms of schizophrenia.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; schizophrenia and psychologyhoses, biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The successful incorporation of acrylic acid and lignin units in the nanogels was confirmed by FT-IR, H-NMR and XPS spectroscopies. TEM and dynamic light scattering analysis demonstrated that the nanogels were spherical and uniformly dispersed in the aqueous phase. AFM nanoindentation and thermal analysis indicated that the nanogels were mechanically and thermally durable. Lignin-based nanogels exhibited a pH-responsive swelling at high amounts of acrylic acid. Various hydrophobic payloads were encapsulated in high yield and could be preferentially released in alkaline conditions.

The temperature, voltage, and current of the stack are monitored, and the energy efficiency is calculated at various stack power levels. The results of the system with a lab-developed controller are compared with the commercial system with a built-in controller. It is found that the fan speed should be minimum to reduce the auxiliary power consumption and that the stack should be efficiently heated to enhance the electrochemical reaction. In addition, it is noticed that the stack performance dramatically drops when the stack temperature is above 75 °C, due to the membrane dehydration. Overall, the results show that the stack temperature is an important indicator for controlling the fan speed for optimization of energy efficiency, and for stack powers of 50, 60, 70, and 80 W, the peak values of energy efficiencies are 38.0%, 38.3%, 38.5%, and 38.3% at the duty cycles of 0.2, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3, respectively, which are 28–38% higher than the commercially available OCPEMFC system.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
TiO2-Coated CsPbI3Quantum Dots Coupled with Polyoxometalates for On/Off Fluorescent Photoswitches,"Pramata A.D., Akaishi Y., Kodama N., Mokuge Y., Kawashima S., Shimoyoshi M., Sairot C., Nuket P., Vas-Umnuay P., Kida T.",2021-04-23,"Halide perovskites, Optoelectronic properties, Photo-induced electron transfer, Photoluminescence emission, Quenching mechanisms, Resonance energy transfer, Super resolution imaging, Time-resolved PL measurement, CsPbI3, On/Off switching, photoluminescence, polyoxometalates, quantum dots","Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted significant attention because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. In this study, we focused on reversibly modulating the photoluminescence (PL) emission of perovskite QDs using a redox cluster of polyoxometalates (POMs). Three different CsPbBrxI3-x (x = 0, 0.4, and 0.7) QDs of 9.6∼12.8 nm diameter were synthesized, stabilized by TiO2 coating, and coupled with (Bu4N)4[W10O32] (tetra-n-butylammonium decatungstate: TBADT) in organic solution. The TiO2-coated CsPbBrxI3-x (CsPbBrxI3-x@TiO2 core/shell) QDs showed bright PL emissions at 705, 678, and 605 nm, which were efficiently quenched by one-electron-reduced W10O325- (POM-) via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Particularly, the PL emission at 705 nm of CsPbI3@TiO2 QDs was most efficiently quenched by 95% via PET and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) because of a large spectral overlap between the QD emission and POM- absorbance. The quenching mechanism was analyzed by steady-state and time-resolved PL measurements. CsPbI3@TiO2 QDs was found to photocatalytically reduce POM to POM- by visible light. The PL emission from CsPbI3@TiO2 QDs was reversibly switched between On and Off states by alternately exposing the QD-POM system to intense visible light (PL quenching via PET and FRET) and reoxidation of POM- in ambient air (PL recovery). The obtained results open the possibility of constructing perovskite QD-based photoswitches for super-resolution imaging, optical data storage, smart display, and bioimaging.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: Osteoclast profile in comparison with osteoradionecrosis of the jaw and osteomyelitis of the jaw,"Ngoc Thuy Tran V., Chaisuparat R.",2021-08-01,"Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw, Bone Density Conservation Agents, Diphosphonates, Humans, Osteoblasts, Osteoclasts, Osteomyelitis, Osteoradionecrosis, immunohistochemistry, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, osteoclast","Background: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a pathology condition of jaw bone caused by a side effect of medications prescribed for skeletal disease. The mechanism of MRONJ is still unknown now. Osteoclasts are cells directly influenced by the medication and the modification in cells metabolisms by the drugs lead to MRONJ. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the osteoclasts morphology, quantity, and comparing with other necrotic diseases. Methods: Thirty-eight (38) subjects, including cases with MRONJ (n = 11), osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (n = 9), osteomyelitis of the jaw (n = 9), and normal jaw bone (n = 9), were studied. Hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained slides of these diagnosed cases were used to evaluate osteoclasts’ characteristics. Immunohistochemistry of TRAP was performed to observed the function of osteoclasts. These characteristics of osteoclasts were also evaluated in the relationship with the histological features using regression analysis. Results: The results showed that osteoclasts in MRONJ enhance activity by increasing the size and the quantity (p < 0.05). The presence of osteoblasts, inflammatory cells, and bacterial colonies showed a strong correlation with the change in morphology and the number of osteoclasts (p < 0.05). However, the TRAP-positive mean number and the TRAP intensity of osteoclasts in MRONJ did not show a significant difference with those in other groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, osteoclasts in MRONJ increase the number and become bigger with multi-nuclei which might relate to the presence of osteoblasts, inflammation, and microorganisms. This finding supports the idea osteoclasts might be the main key to investigate MRONJ.","genergyal, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Cancer Research, Periodontics"
5-phenoxy primaquine analogs and the tetraoxane hybrid as antimalarial agents,"Jansongsaeng S., Srimongkolpithak N., Pengon J., Kamchonwongpaisan S., Khotavivattana T.",2021-07-01,"Adult, Antimalarials, Erythrocytes, Female, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum, Male, Middle Aged, Plasmodium falciparum, Primaquine, Tetraoxanes, Antimalarial activity, Heme polymerization inhibition activity, Hybrid drug, Primaquine, Structure–activity relationship, Tetraoxane","The rapid emergence of drug resistance to the current antimalarial agents has led to the urgent need for the discovery of new and effective compounds. In this work, a series of 5-phenoxy primaquine analogs with 8-aminoquinoline core (7a–7h) was synthesized and investigated for their antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum. Most analogs showed improved blood antimalarial activity compared to the original primaquine. To further explore a drug hybrid strategy, a conjugate compound between tetraoxane and the representative 5-phenoxy-primaquine analog 7a was synthesized. In our work, the hybrid compound 12 exhibited almost a 30-fold increase in the blood antimalarial activity (IC50 = 0.38 ± 0.11 µM) compared to that of primaquine, with relatively low toxicity against mammalian cells (SI = 45.61). Furthermore, we found that these 5-phenoxy primaquine analogs and the hybrid exhibit significant heme polymerization inhibition, an activity similar to that of chloroquine, which could contribute to their improved antimalarial activity. The 5-phenoxy primaquine analogs and the tetraoxane hybrid could serve as promising candidates for the further development of antimalarial agents.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

In the absence of SERT, 5-HT remains in the interstitial space and has the potential to aberrantly activate the many 5-HT receptors distributed on the epithelium, immune cells and enteric neurons. Perturbation of SERT is common in many gastrointestinal disorders as well as mouse models of colitis. Select commensal microbes regulate intestinal SERT levels, but the mechanism of this regulation is poorly understood. Additionally, ethanol upregulates SERT in the brain and dendritic cells, but its effects in the intestine have never been examined. We report that the intestinal commensal microbe Limosilactobacillus (previously classified as Lactobacillus) reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 secretes 83.4 mM ethanol. Consistent with the activity of L. reuteri alcohol dehydrogenases, we found that L. reuteri tolerated various levels of ethanol. Application of L. reuteri conditioned media or exogenous ethanol to human colonic T84 cells was found to upregulate SERT at the level of mRNA. A 4-(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl)-1-methylpyridinium (APP+) uptake assay confirmed the functional activity of SERT. These findings were mirrored in mouse colonic organoids, where L. reuteri metabolites and ethanol were found to upregulate SERT at the apical membrane. Finally, in a trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid model of acute colitis, we observed that mice treated with L. reuteri maintained SERT at the colon membrane compared with mice receiving phosphate buffered saline vehicle control. These data suggest that L. reuteri metabolites, including ethanol, can upregulate SERT and may be beneficial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis with respect to serotonin signalling.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"

To this end, a Thai monosyllabic word and picture list called NCU-20 (NECTEC-CU-20) is proposed. The word lists for Thai vowel and consonant hearing tests are designed with an awareness of phonetic environments. Regarding Thai vowels, both monophthongs and diphthongs, with all qualities and quantities, are examined. Initial consonants are categorized based on places and manners of articulation. The effectiveness of the list is objectively and subjectively verified through Thai Textbook Corpus, Thai National Corpus, Zipf scores, a listening test of preschoolers with normal hearing, and our proposed ranking systems referred to as Tier-1st, Tier-3/3, and Overall Tier.

To ensure widespread vaccination, it is crucial to analyze vaccine willingness and its determinants among physicians, key health care influencers. This study aimed to assess acceptance rate and identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among Thai physicians. Methods: A cross-sectional online-based questionnaire was distributed to all physicians at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during March 31, 2021 to April 30, 2021 in order to assess their attitudes toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for vaccine acceptance and refusal as well as predictors of vaccine hesitancy were analyzed by bivariate and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 705 complete responses were received with 95.6% (n = 675) of physicians expressing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Only one of the 31 physicians (4.4%) who expressed a hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated was a faculty member; the others were physicians-in-training. Approximately one-fifths of physicians surveyed were also not willing to recommend the vaccine to their family members (21.4%, n = 151) or patients (18.7%, n = 132). Using multivariable logistic regression, vaccine hesitancy was independently associated with preference for particular vaccines over the government allocated option, especially for mRNA vaccine (aOR 8.86; 95% CI 1.1–71.54; p = 0.041). Vaccine literacy showed an inverse relationship (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13–0.9; p = 0.029) with vaccine hesitancy. Uncertainty of the vaccine efficacy (83.9%) and fear of adverse events (48.4%) were major concerns contributing to vaccine hesitancy. Conclusion: This study revealed a high rate of physician willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine especially among staffs; however, a significant proportion would not currently suggest vaccination to their families or patients. Restrictions on vaccine choice and vaccine illiteracy, together with concerns over adverse effects and uncertainty of efficacy, were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccination. To raise acceptance of the vaccination program, efforts should be made to balance individual preference for vaccine type in addition to increasing the availability of accurate data on safety and efficacy for each vaccine.",medical,Infectious Diseases

Outcomes: Use, availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of HD care. Analytical Approach: Descriptive statistics. Results: Overall, representatives from 160 (88%) countries participated. Median country-specific use of maintenance HD was 298.4 (IQR, 80.5-599.4) per million population (pmp). Global median HD use among incident patients with kidney failure was 98.0 (IQR, 81.5-140.8) pmp and median number of HD centers was 4.5 (IQR, 1.2–9.9) pmp. Adequate HD services (3-4 hours 3 times weekly) were generally available in 27% of low-income countries. Home HD was generally available in 36% of high-income countries. 32% of countries performed monitoring of patient-reported outcomes; 61%, monitoring of small-solute clearance; 60%, monitoring of bone mineral markers; 51%, monitoring of technique survival; and 60%, monitoring of patient survival. At initiation of maintenance dialysis, only 5% of countries used an arteriovenous access in almost all patients. Vascular access education was suboptimal, funding for vascular access procedures was not uniform, and copayments were greater in countries with lower levels of income.

Conclusions: In summary, findings reveal substantial variations in global HD use, availability, accessibility, quality, and affordability worldwide, with the lowest use evident in low- and lower-middle–income countries.",medical,Nephrology
Autism-related transcription factors underlying the sex-specific effects of prenatal bisphenol a exposure on transcriptome-interactome profiles in the offspring prefrontal cortex,"Kanlayaprasit S., Thongkorn S., Panjabud P., Jindatip D., Hu V.W., Kikkawa T., Osumi N., Sarachana T.",2021-12-01,"Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Benzhydryl Compounds, Disease Models, Animal, Estrogen Receptor alpha, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Molecular Docking Simulation, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 1, Phenols, Prefrontal Cortex, Pregnancy, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Rats, Receptors, Androgen, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Sex Characteristics, Transcription Factors, Autism spectrum disorder, Bisphenol A, Endocrine-disrupting chemical, Interactome, Molecular docking, Prefrontal cortex, Prenatal exposure, Sex differences, Transcription factor, Transcriptome","Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). BPA exposure dysregulates ASD-related genes in the hippocampus and neurological functions of offspring. However, whether prenatal BPA exposure has an impact on genes in the prefrontal cortex, another brain region highly implicated in ASD, and through what mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the transcriptome–interactome profiles of the prefrontal cortex of neonatal rats. Interestingly, the list of BPA-responsive genes was significantly enriched with known ASD candidate genes, as well as genes that were dysregulated in the postmortem brain tissues of ASD cases from multiple independent studies. Moreover, several differentially expressed genes in the offspring’s prefrontal cortex were the targets of ASD-related transcription factors, including AR, ESR1, and RORA. The hypergeometric distribution analysis revealed that BPA may regulate the expression of such genes through these transcription factors in a sex-dependent manner. The molecular docking analysis of BPA and ASD-related transcription factors revealed novel potential targets of BPA, including RORA, SOX5, TCF4, and YY1. Our findings indicated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts ASD-related genes in the offspring’s prefrontal cortex and may increase the risk of ASD through sex-dependent molecular mechanisms, which should be investigated further.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In this method, a titrant in an increasing microliter-volume was added to a set of sample aliquots containing an indicator covering both sides of the equivalence point. The solutions were subsequently photographed in one shot, in a dark box using a smartphone camera and an illuminating screen of a tablet or light emitting diode lamps arranged below a white acrylic sheet as a light source. After the colors of the solutions were delineated to Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values, 1/log G was used to construct a plot in which the equivalence point was located at the intersection of the two lines in the region before and after the equivalence point. The technique was successfully applied to the miniaturized titration of sodium chloride injections, showing the good linear relationship of equivalence points to the sodium chloride concentration in the range of 0.4163–0.9675% w/v (R2 of 0.9998). The assay was accurate (% recovery of 98.92–100.52), precise (% relative standard deviation ≤ 1.20), and unaffected by the use of different types of microplates, smartphones, and RGB analysis tools. Additionally, it required no expensive nor complicated equipment and offered the possibility of performing analysis on a single smartphone device when it was used with a mobile application developed to aid data processing and immediate production of reports of analytical results.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

The pyrrolidinyl PNA with the four-membered ring spacer (1S,2S)-2-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (acbcPNA) are among the best performed members of the pyrrolidinyl PNA family. However, these PNA suffer some limitations such as aqueous solubility and non-specific interactions due to their extreme hydrophobicity. In the present work, a hydroxy group is introduced onto the cyclobutane ring spacer of the acbcPNA with the aim of decreasing its hydrophobicity. To this end, a Fmoc/tBu ether-protected 4-hydroxy-2-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid building block was synthesized and resolved by chiral HPLC. Each enantiomer was used to synthesize the hydroxy-modified acbcPNA employing Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. DNA/RNA binding studies indicated that the introduction of the hydroxy group to the acbcPNA decreases the binding affinity toward complementary DNA and RNA while maintaining the sequence and directional specificity of unmodified acbcPNA. The hydrophobicity of the hydroxy-modified acbcPNA decreased with the number of hydroxy groups added as indicated by the decrease in the logP values. Only two modifications were sufficient to decrease the logP by an order of magnitude without excessively lowering the binding affinity nor the specificity. This work thus demonstrated that the specific structural modifications for this type of PNA model can be performed in a modular fashion, which paves the way toward the future realization of improving hydrophilicity and nucleic acid binding affinity as well as specificity.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, chemistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Biomaterials, Organic Chemistry"

In 2020 May-June, six solar energetic ion events were observed by the Parker Solar Probe/IS IS instrument suite at ≈0.35 AU from the Sun. From standard velocity-dispersion analysis, the apparent ion path length is ≈0.625 AU at the onset of each event. Aims. We develop a formalism for estimating the path length of random-walking magnetic field lines to explain why the apparent ion path length at an event onset greatly exceeds the radial distance from the Sun for these events. Methods. We developed analytical estimates of the average increase in path length of random-walking magnetic field lines, relative to the unperturbed mean field. Monte Carlo simulations of field line and particle trajectories in a model of solar wind turbulence were used to validate the formalism and study the path lengths of particle guiding-center and full-orbital trajectories. The formalism was implemented in a global solar wind model, and the results are compared with ion path lengths inferred from IS IS observations. Results. Both a simple estimate and a rigorous theoretical formulation are obtained for field-lines' path length increase as a function of path length along the large-scale field. From simulated field line and particle trajectories, we find that particle guiding centers can have path lengths somewhat shorter than the average field line path length, while particle orbits can have substantially longer path lengths due to their gyromotion with a nonzero effective pitch angle. Conclusions. The long apparent path length during these solar energetic ion events can be explained by (1) a magnetic field line path length increase due to the field line random walk and (2) particle transport about the guiding center with a nonzero effective pitch angle due to pitch angle scattering. Our formalism for computing the magnetic field line path length, accounting for turbulent fluctuations, may be useful for application to solar particle transport in general.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Hydrological alteration of the natural flow regime is considered to have a significant damaging and widespread impact on river ecosystems and livelihoods. Therefore, understanding the hydrological alteration of rivers and the potential driving factors affecting such alterations are crucial to effective water resources management. This study analyses the impact of changes in land use, climate, and hydropower development on the hydrological regime of the Srepok River Basin in the Lower Mekong Region. The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) in Southeast Asia is known for its agriculture, forests, fisheries, wildlife, and diverse natural ecosystems. Historical land use and climate change are quantified (utilising European Space Agency land cover and observed meteorological data) and correlated with the hydrological indicators using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) software. Moreover, pre and post impacts on the hydrological regime by hydropower development are quantified using the Range of Variability Approach (RAV) in IHA software. The results reveal that land use, rainfall, and temperature affect different aspects of the hydrological regime, with corroborating evidence to support variation among the most correlated IHA and environmental flow component (EFC) parameters with the three drivers. The highest and lowest correlations among the IHA and EFC parameters under each driver are against land use (0.85, −0.83), rainfall (0.78, −0.54), and minimum and max temperatures (0.42, −0.47). Among the parameters, the fall rate has the most significant effect on hydrological alteration of all drivers. Hydropower development in the basin mostly affects the fall rate and reversal. Identifying the connection between these multiple drivers and hydrological alteration could help decision-makers to design more efficient and sustainable water management policies.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental exploitation; land use and environmentalronmental impact assessment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Modalities of renal replacement therapy and clinical outcomes of patients with acute kidney injury in a resource-limited setting: Results from a SEA-AKI study,"Panaput T., Peerapornratana S., Sirivongrangson P., Kulvichit W., Lumlertgul N., Jonny J., Praditpornsilpa K., Tungsanga K., Eiam-Ong S., Srisawat N.",2021-10-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Cohort Studies, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy, Humans, Intensive Care Units, Renal Dialysis, Renal Replacement Therapy, Acute kidney injury, Mortality, Renal replacement therapy, Transition mode of RRT","Purpose: To determine the effects of modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on the 30-d mortality and renal recovery in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Materials and methods: A multicenter cohort study was conducted in 17 hospitals from Thailand and Indonesia. We recruited patients who were admitted to the Intensive care unit and diagnosed with AKI. Relevant mode of RRT, as intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or sustained low efficiency dialysis (SLED), was initiated as indicated. Results: From 2844 patients with AKI, 449 cases (8.1%) received RRT. There were no significant differences in the 30-d mortality between those initially treated with CRRT, PD, and SLED compared to those treated with IHD. The renal recovery was similar for each RRT mode. The three independent factors of death were the primary diagnosis of kidney disease, higher APACHE II score, and non-renal SOFA score. Only 48 (10.7%) patients had been switched to another mode of RRT. Conclusions: All four modes of RRT (IHD, CRRT, PD, and SLED) are acceptable treatments for severe AKI and gave a similar survival rate.","urology and nephrology, medical",Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

Necroptosis is a recently characterized form of programmed cell death but has not been examined in BA. We, therefore, explored the potential involvement of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of BA by evaluating the correlation between necroptosis-related factors and clinicopathological features of BA patients. We studied liver biopsy specimens of 59 patients with BA and 30 with congenital biliary dilatation (CBD). We also evaluated 14 surgical BA cases, who eventually underwent liver transplantation and 9 normal liver from neonates and infants obtained at autopsy. Necroptosis-related factors including toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), receptor-interacting protein kinase1 (RIP1), receptor-interacting protein kinase3 (RIP3), mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (pMLKL) in these liver specimens were immunolocalized. TLR3, RIP1, MLKL in the intrahepatic cholangiocytes was significantly higher in BA than CBD. pMLKL immunoreactivity was significantly greater at an earlier age of BA patients. The native liver survival period was significantly prolonged in the high RIP3 group. The low RIP3 status could serve as an adverse clinical prognostic factor for the native liver survival among the necroptosis-related factors examined in this study.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Molecular Biology"

They possessed broad substrate specificities toward various PAHs and aliphatic compounds as sole carbon sources. These strains exhibited promising characteristics, including biosurfactant production, high cell hydrophobicity, biofilm formation and no antagonistic interactions, and contained genes encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes. The mixed bacterial consortium combining S103, J101 and Y502, showed more effective syntrophic degradation of two types of refined petroleum products, diesel and fuel oils, than monocultures. The defined consortium immobilized on plastic balls achieved over 50% removal efficiency of high fuel oil concentration (3000 mg L−1) in a synthetic medium and contaminated freshwater. Furthermore, the immobilized cells simultaneously degraded more than 46% of total fuel oil adsorbed on plastic balls in both culture systems. SEM imaging confirmed that the immobilized consortium exhibited biofilm formation with the bacterial community covering most of the bioball surface, resulting in high bacterial survival against toxic contaminants. The results of this study showed the potential use of the cooperative interaction between Rhodococcus and Mycolicibacterium as immobilized bioballs for the bioremediation of fuel oil-contaminated environments. Additionally, this research has motivated further investigations into the development of bioremediation products for fuel oil degradation.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; water pollution; control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

We assessed immunological and virological responses, AIDS-defining events and mortality among PWID receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: We investigated HIV treatment outcomes among people who acquired HIV via injecting drug use in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) between January 2003 and March 2019. Trends in CD4 count and viral suppression (VS, HIV viral load <1000 copies/mL) were assessed. Factors associated with mean CD4 changes were analysed using repeated measures linear regression, and combined AIDS event and mortality were analysed using survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 622 PWID from 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific, 93% were male and the median age at ART initiation was 31 years (IQR, 28 to 34). The median pre-ART CD4 count was 71 cells/µL. CD4 counts increased over time, with a mean difference of 401 (95% CI, 372 to 457) cells/µL at year-10 (n = 78). Higher follow-up HIV viral load and pre-ART CD4 counts were associated with smaller increases in CD4 counts. Among 361 PWID with ≥1 viral load after six months on ART, proportions with VS were 82%, 88% and 93% at 2-, 5- and 10-years following ART initiation. There were 52 new AIDS-defining events and 50 deaths during 3347 person-years of follow-up (PYS) (incidence 3.05/100 PYS, 95% CI, 2.51 to 3.70). Previous AIDS or TB diagnosis, lower current CD4 count and adherence <95% were associated with combined new AIDS-defining event and death. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improved outcomes over time, our findings highlight the need for rapid ART initiation and adherence support among PWID within Asian settings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a cellular environmental sensor, might aggravate activity of the lupus-like condition. As such, 1,4-chrysenequinone (1,4-CQ), an Ahr-activator, alone did not induce supernatant cytokines from macrophages, while the 24 h pre-treatment by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a representative inflammatory activator, prior to 1,4-CQ activation (LPS/1,4-CQ) predominantly induced macrophage pro-inflammatory re-sponses. Additionally, the responses from FcgRIIb-/- macrophages were more prominent than wild-type (WT) cells as determined by (i) supernatant cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), (ii) expression of the inflammation associated genes (NF-κB, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, iNOS, IL-1β and activating-FcgRIV) and cell-surface CD-86 (a biomarker of M1 macrophage polarization), and (iii) cell apoptosis (Annexin V), with the lower inhibitory-FcgRIIb expression. Moreover, 8-week-administration of 1,4-CQ in 8 week old FcgRIIb-/- mice, a genetic-prone lupus-like model, enhanced lupus characteristics as indicated by anti-dsDNA, serum creatinine, proteinuria, endotoxemia, gut-leakage (FITC-dex-tran), and glomerular immunoglobulin deposition. In conclusion, an Ahr activation worsened the disease severity in FcgRIIb-/- mice possibly through the enhanced inflammatory responses. The deficiency of inhibitory-FcgRIIb in these mice, at least in part, prominently enhanced the pro-inflam-matory responses. Our data suggest that patients with lupus might be more vulnerable to environmental pollutants.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Determining the role of oxygen vacancies in palmitone selectivity and coke formation over acid metal oxide catalysts for the ketonization of methyl palmitate,"Guntida A., Rattanachartnarong T., Jongsomjit B., Sooknoi T., Weerachawanasak P., Praserthdam S., Praserthdam P.",2021-11-25,"Coke formation, Hydrogen trapping, Ketonization, Lewis Acid, Liquid Phase, Liquid phasis, Long chains, Long-chain methyl ester, Methyl esters, Methyl palmitate, Catalyst deactivation, Hydrogen trapping, Ketonization, Liquid phase, Long-chain methyl ester, Oxygen vacancies","In the present study, TiO2, CeO2, MnO2, and ZrO2 catalysts were used to investigate the catalytic performance in methyl palmitate ketonization. The reaction was accelerated by weak Lewis acid, while the oxygen vacancies promoted the palmitone selectivity. The use of various characterization techniques revealed that oxygen vacancies played an important role for trapping the hydrogen atom and inhibited its spillover. This caused the suppression of the Lewis acid transformation to new Bronsted acid. Thus, the cracking of palmitone over the new Bronsted acid was diminished, leading to the decrement of selectivity to undesired products. However, when the hydrogen atom was trapped in the oxygen vacancies, the coke deposition was dominant. This phenomenon arose because hydrogen could not suppress the deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the transformation of aliphatic coke to aromatic coke. The role of oxygen vacancies was determined, and it had the positive effect on the palmitone selectivity, whereas it raised the coke formation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The terminal relaxation time—determined by measuring the linear viscoelasticity—was increased by adding the UHMW component. The increase in the melt elasticity produced by adding the UHMW component was observed by measuring the steady-state shear flow, although the shear viscosity was not greatly affected. Owing to the long characteristic time of the Rouse relaxation of the UHMW component, PP with the UHMW component formed highly oriented structures through a shear-induced crystallization process. The addition of the UHMW component enhanced the orientation and regularity of crystalline structure for extruded films. Therefore, the Young’s modulus, yield stress, and strength were higher in the PP film containing the UHMW component than in one without the UHMW component, irrespective of the direction of tensile deformation.","chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Due to the synergism between the Ti3C2 MXene conductive frameworks and NiFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH/ Ti3C2 MXene shows a superior electrochemical property for lithium storage. Its reversible capacity is 898.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and even at 1 A g-1, it still has 726.1 mAh g-1, without capacity reduction in lithium-ion half-cells. In addition, the corresponding lithium-ion capacitor shows a higher energy density and power density, showing huge application prospect in lithium storage.","energygy storage, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Development of decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleeding, and/or hepatic encephalopathy) and hepatocellular carcinoma were considered clinical endpoints. Results: A total of 35 different EHAIDs were diagnosed in 440 (28.3%) patients with PBC. Patients with EHAIDs were more often female (92.5% vs 86.1%, P < 0.001) and seropositive for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (88% vs 84%, P = 0.05) and antinuclear antibodies and/or smooth muscle antibodies (53.8% vs 43.6%, P = 0.005).

In the last few decades, we have made great strides in understanding the causes and mechanisms underlying FAs, prompting guideline updates. Earlier guidelines recommended avoidance of common food allergens during pregnancy and lactation and delaying the introduction of allergenic foods in children aged between 1 and 3 years. Recent guidelines for allergy prevention recommend consumption of a healthy and diverse diet without eliminating or increasing the consumption of allergenic foods during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Early introduction of allergenic foods is recommended by most guidelines for allergy prevention after a period of exclusive breast-feedng (6 months [World Health Organization] or 4 months [European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology]). New diagnostics for FA have been developed with varied availability of these tests in different countries. Finally, the first oral immunotherapy drug for FA was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency in 2020.

Herein, such a drawback is overcome by introducing a facile method of sequential addition of ester monomer and glycidyl methacrylate into the reaction. Two different hydroxyl beginning monomers, that is, ethylene glycol and glycerol, were utilized. The chemical structures and molecular weights of the resultant copolymers were analyzed using 1H-NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography, respectively. The effects of the copolymer structures on the properties of both resins formulated with and without hydroxyapatite, for example, rheological behavior and printability, and DLP-printed specimens, for example, mechanical property and cytotoxicity, were assessed. By controlling the beginning monomer to monomer feeding ratio from 1:6 to 1:14, the Mn values of the resultant copolymers fell in the range of 1.7 to 2.5 kDa. The DLP-printed specimens possessed compressive moduli in the range of 10.20 ± 0.16 MPa and 18.65 ± 0.75 MPa. The cytotoxicity result suggested that the DLP-printed specimens were noncytotoxic to porcine chondrocytes. Altogether, these methacrylate-containing polyesters simply synthesized via a concise one-pot reaction revealed great potential for DLP printing resins in biomedical applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

CCv4.0 continued upon prior versions by subtyping achalasia into type I, type II, and type III on HRM. The achalasia subgroup of the CCv4.0 Working Group developed both conclusive and inconclusive statements for the HRM diagnoses of achalasia subtypes. Conclusive achalasia on HRM is defined as an abnormal median integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) in the primary position of wet swallows along with 100% failed peristalsis, with type I achalasia having 100% failed peristalsis without panesophageal pressurization (PEP), type II achalasia with PEP in at least 20% of swallows, and type III achalasia having at least 20% of swallows premature with no appreciable peristalsis. An inconclusive HRM diagnosis of achalasia can arise when there is an integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) that is borderline or at the upper limit of normal in at least one position, there is an abnormal IRP in both positions but evidence of peristalsis with PEP or premature swallows, or there is peristalsis in the secondary position after apparent achalasia in the primary position. In patients with dysphagia and an inconclusive HRM diagnosis of achalasia, supportive testing beyond HRM such as a timed barium esophagram (TBE) for functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) is recommended. The review recommends a diagnostic algorithm for achalasia, discusses therapeutic options for the disease, and outlines future needs on this topic.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Physiology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Gastroenterology"
Personalized Preference Drift Aware Sequential Recommender System,"Sritrakool N., Maneeroj S.",2021-01-01,"'current, Benchmark datasets, Neural-networks, Preference pattern, User preference patterns, machine learning, Neural networks, recommender systems","The user preference patterns are highly dynamic and develop over time. To address the drift of user preference patterns, most of the prior works for sequential recommendation categorize the user preference patterns into different patterns, e.g., short-term and long-term preference. However, the number of user preference patterns is pre-defined and identical for every user, resulting in the drift patterns regardless of the user's actual drift points. Moreover, existing works recommend the next item by considering the whole historical sequence, which contains the noises from interactions irrelevant to the current user preference pattern. In this work, we propose a model to personalized detects drift of user preference patterns, called PPD. Our proposed method determines the actual drift of user preference patterns by capturing the changes in the characteristics of consecutive items throughout the historical sequence. The detected drift pattern allows PPD to partition the historical sequence into various sub-sequences which contain only a particular preference pattern. As a result, PPD delivers the recommendations relevant to the current user preference pattern by considering only the sub-sequences with similar preference patterns instead of utilizing the whole historical sequence. We conduct the experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing PPD with the baselines aiming to model the user drift pattern for the recommendation. The experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the baselines on three benchmark datasets. Additionally, the experiment further shows that PPD delivers superior results when considering only the relevant periods rather than the whole sequence.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

This study presents the inter-comparison of atmospheric dispersion calculations performed by different calculation codes employing Lagrangian particle model or Gaussian puff model with Southeast Asia weather data during the northeast monsoon period. The test case is a hypothetical accident in Fangchenggang NPP with a hypothetical source term. Radionuclide concentration and radiation dose distribution maps along with specified values at specific locations are compared to demonstrate the similarities and differences of each calculation code. All calculation codes can generally capture the dispersion pathway, though only those employing Lagrangian particle model can record microscale changes in wind direction. Analysis of predicted exposure extent and lead time shows that radioactive plume contributing to the radiation dose of several μSv/day can reach one or more ASEAN countries within the 24-h timeframe. This information can be used to design appropriate risk communication strategy to dispel unnecessary public anxiety or to plan for more extensive radiation monitoring capability. For this purpose, Gaussian puff model can be used to provide initial information which can be later confirmed by Lagrangian particle model.","the atmosphere, energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

Fifteen previously reported cases of biallelic KLF1 mutations were identified from a literature review. All except one presented with severe haemolytic anaemia in the neonatal period. Our finding substantiates that compound heterozygous KLF1 mutations are associated with severe neonatal haemolytic anaemia and expands the haematologic phenotypic spectrum.

The VSD is made of four helical transmembrane segments (S1–S4) that form a structurally conserved scaffold through inter-transmembrane residue-residue interactions. Details about these interactions are yet to be fully understood in the context of the unique structural and physical characteristics of the voltage sensor unit. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate transmembrane helix-helix interactions via residue-based nonbonding energies using the activated and resting state conformations of VSD from Hv1, CiVSP, KvAP and NavAb. Inter-transmembrane interaction energies within the VSD were determined. Analysis of electrostatic and van der Waals components revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the interactions between each pair of transmembrane segments. In all cases the S4 helix had the highest electrostatic contribution to favor the key role as the voltage sensitive segment. Electrostatic interactions for the S1–S2 pair as well as the S1–S3 pair were relatively weak. Van der Waal interaction energies between adjacent segments were on average greater than that between diagonally opposite segments. Salt bridge interactions between S4-arginines and the negatively charged residues in other segments appear to contribute more to stabilizing the energy than the van der Waals interactions between nonpolar residues. The overall behavior of residue-residue contacts is similar among the transmembrane domains, reflecting the common inter- transmembrane interaction pattern in the VSD. In addition, analysis of the residue positions suggested that subtle differences in the orientation of the salt-bridges can be attributed to the difference in the inter-transmembrane interaction strengths inside the VSDs.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The experiments were conducted by exposing the solution to magnetic fields. The characteristics of reprecipitated CaCO3 were investigated. The aragonite/calcite ratios were proportional to magnetic flux densities. The physicochemical properties of CaO catalysts from thermal decomposition of CaCO3 depended on polymorphic ratios. The performances of the catalysts for biodiesel reaction were studied. The transesterifications of palm oil and methanol were comparatively performed using CaO catalysts prepared from different CaCO3 polymorphs. The transesterification reacted by CaO prepared from all polymorphic ratios yielded more than 85% of biodiesel under optimal conditions. Some amount of calcium was leached into the reaction medium depending on different polymorphic ratios of precursors. However, the leached calcium did not enhance the biodiesel yield. In addition, CaO-600 mT catalyst is the most promising considering that it is a residual catalyst from shell waste. This green innovation shows major potential of producing biodiesel from plants with environmental and social benefits.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Herein, exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing LAB strain KM01 was isolated from Thai fermented dessert, Khao Mak, which was then identified as Leuconostoc holzapfelii. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that the KM01 EPS comprises α-1,6-linked glucosides. The molecular weight of KM01 EPS was around 500 kDa, but it can form large aggregates formation (MW > 2000 kDa) in an aqueous solution, judged by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering to be around 150 nm in size. Furthermore, this KM01 EPS form highly viscous hydrogels at concentrations above 5% (w/v). The formation of hydrogels and nanoparticle of KM01 EPS was found to be reversible. Finally, the suitability of KM01 EPS for biomedical applications was demonstrated by its lack of cytotoxicity and its ability to form complexes with quercetin.

In addition, the assay time (1 h) using the newly developed strains was shorter than that (4 h) previously reported. Furthermore, the snq2-minus strains were most effective for detection of estrogenic activity while the pdr5-minus strains were most effective for detection of antiestrogenic activity. The efficacy of the new methods was evaluated and confirmed by testing with 23 Thai medicinal plant species. The new strains were also tested for detection of xenoestrogens.

Satellite-based technology is promising to monitor these changes and even non-specialists in geospatial analysis can use it through cloud-based open platforms. This study aims to give scientific interpretation on the causes of the atmospheric changes based on these governmental controls on human activity. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were monitored in Ayutthaya Province in Thailand in an urban area including industrial zones during January 1 to April 30, 2020. An analysis was conducted with Google Earth Engine by using four datasets including NO2 data from Sentinel-5P. The mean value of NO2 density in 2020 decreased 12.5% compared with that in 2019. The closure of industrial facilities by the government seemed to be a key cause of the phenomena. The decline was statistically tested and resulted in a significant difference between the two periods. As the new daily cases decreased to single digits, the difference became non-significant from May 1, 2020. Single timeseries analysis on NO2 density change enabled visualization of the brief impact of responses and policies made by the government and subsequent economic activities; however, further atmospheric and industrial activity data are required for further assessment.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Hardware and Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Control and Optimization, Instrumentation"

Methods: The original 13-item BDAS was developed based on Buddhist perspectives toward death and life and was translated from Thai into Vietnamese. Item content checking with five Vietnamese local experts suggested three items of the original BDAS were irrelevant in Vietnamese culture and hence should be excluded. Psychometric properties of the 10-item BDAS Vietnamese version were tested using a convenience sample of 193 Vietnamese Buddhists with cancer. Results: The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.73. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the 10 items of the BDAS Vietnamese version constituted 2 factors, explaining 51.1% of the variance of death acceptance. The first factor was “acceptance of natural process of death” and the second was “preparing for death.” Both factors reflected explicitly Buddhist viewpoints toward death acceptance and were consistent with the original Thai BDAS. However, although similar factors were found, some items in the Vietnamese BDAS did not load to same factors as in the Thai BDAS. Conclusions: The BDAS Vietnamese version provides an initial suitable measurement for death acceptance among Vietnamese Buddhists. Its availability will enable cross-cultural research to investigate death acceptance among Buddhist patients with cancer in Vietnam. However, the differences in item loadings between the Thai and Vietnamese scales suggest that further conceptual and empirical works to refine the measurement are needed.",Nursing,Nursing (all)

The correlation between microbial population (total microorganisms, yeast and mold, E. coli and S. aureus) and DMDC concentration using zero-order kinetic and first-order kinetic was also determined. In addition, the effect of DMDC compared with pasteurization (90 °C, 100 s) on quality of mixed mango and passion fruit smoothie during the cold storage (4 °C) was studied. The results showed that microbial inactivation was best-described by first-order kinetic model due to a higher coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, DMDC did not affect the decreasing trend of total soluble solid, color difference (∆E*) and total phenolic compound as compared to control during the cold storage. DMDC also hindered the increasing trend in microbial population and prevented the loss of antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assays) and total flavonoid content and decreased the PPO activity as compared with the control during the cold storage. In summary, DMDC showed the potential to maintain the quality and to extend the shelf life of mango and passion fruit smoothie during cold storage.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; food preservatives and anti-microbials, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

With TEM observation, the co-precipitation provided the catalysts containing a highly crystalline CeO2 of a (111) plane structure with d-spacing of 3.15–3.24 Å. The obtained CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited a pseudo-spherical shape with a size range of 10.8–12.1 nm. Based on HR-TEM analyses, NiO nanoparticles with a large size range of 48.8–51.2 nm were found to be incorporated within the CeO2 nanostructure. By N2 sorption measurement, all Ni/CeO2 catalysts possessed a mesoporous characteristic with a specific surface area range of 70.5–75.7 m2/g and an average pore diameter of 30 nm. XRD results revealed that NiO species could be completely transformed into Ni0 species by the H2 reduction process. XPS analyses further confirmed the presence of Ni0 species with a prominent peak at an energy bandgap of 852.6 eV. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) confirmed that α and β peaks of NiO species were completely reduced at a temperature lower than 500 °C. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst prepared by MW method exhibited a higher strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Ni and CeO2 revealed by H2 consumption results. The Ni/CeO2 catalysts prepared by MW, HM, EP methods exhibited the CO2 methanation activity with TOF of 13.6, 10.8 and 5.8 s−1, which could be correlated with the Ni crystallite sizes of 42.2, 50.5 and 52.8 nm, respectively. All prepared Ni/CeO2 catalysts exhibited the stable catalytic performances with a negligible drop in CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity over 72 h-time-on-stream test. In comparison, the MW method with a rapid and uniform heating under autogenous pressure could result in the Ni/CeO2 catalyst with the superior catalytic activities due to the higher dispersion of Ni.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

However, whether antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis given to exposed vertically infected children exerts similar effects remains unknown. Methods: We measured total and integrated HIV DNA, as well as the frequency of CD4 T cells producing multiply spliced RNA (msRNA) after stimulation (inducible reservoir) in vertically infected Thai infants. Eighty-five infants were followed longitudinally for up to 3 years. We compared the size of the reservoir in children who received continuous ARV prophylaxis since birth vs those who never received or discontinued prophylaxis before initiating ART. We used samples from a cross-sectional cohort of 37 Thai children who had initiated ART within 6 months of life to validate our findings. Results: Before ART, levels of HIV DNA and the frequencies of cells producing msRNA were significantly lower in infants who received continuous ARV prophylaxis since birth compared to those in whom ARV prophylaxis was discontinued or never initiated (P <. 020 and P <. 001, respectively). Upon ART initiation, total and integrated HIV DNA levels decayed significantly in both groups (P <. 01 in all cases). Interestingly, the initial differences in the frequencies of infected cells persisted during 3 years on ART. The beneficial effect of prophylaxis on the size of the HIV reservoir was confirmed in the cross-sectional study. Importantly, no differences were observed between children who discontinued prophylactic ARVs before starting ART and those who delayed ART initiation without receiving prior prophylaxis.

The results showed that the CF enhanced the mechanical properties of geopolymer containing RCA through the increased nucleation sites for geopolymerization reaction and the bridging effect of the fiber. For the mix with 100% RCA, the incorporation of 0.2% CF resulted geopolymer mortar with higher compressive and splitting tensile strengths. For the flexural strength and surface abrasion resistance, best results were obtained with the use of 50%RCA with significant improvement in both flexural strength and surface abrasion resistance. The incorporation of CF thus increases the use of recycled fine aggregate without resort to natural fine aggregate.","lubrication, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

Herein, molecular recognition between SARS-CoV-2 S1 C-end rule (CendR) heptapeptide including small-molecule antagonists (EG00229 and EG01377) and the NRP1 was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations based on MM-PBSA method. The binding affinity and the number of hot-spot residues of EG01377/NRP1 complex were higher than those of CendR/NRP1 and EG00229/NRP1 systems, in line with the reported experimental data as well as with the lower water accessibility at the ligand-binding site. The (i) T316, P317, and D320 and (ii) S346, T349, and Y353 residues of NRP1 were confirmed to respectively form H-bonds with the positively charged guanidinium group and the negatively charged carboxyl moiety of all studied ligands. Moreover, Rosetta protein design was employed to improve the binding affinity between CendR peptide and NRP1. The newly designed peptides, especially R683G and A684M, exhibited higher binding efficiency than the native CendR heptapeptide as well as the small-molecule EG00229 by forming more H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions with NPR1, suggesting that these designed peptides could be promising NRP1 inhibitors to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Background: Glass-ionomer cement (GIC) is frequently used to restore root caries in elders. Many studies of GIC have been conducted using young dentin; however, few studies have assessed adhesion and microleakage of GICs to aged dentin. Materials and methods: Seventy-eight non-carious human molars (patient age 16-30 = 39; patient age ≥ 65 = 39) were tested with three GICs (Fuji II LC, Equia Forte Fil and Fuji BULK). For µSBS, teeth were horizontally sectioned, embedded in resin and three tubes attached to the sectioned surface. Materials were mixed and injected into the tubes, allowed to set and the tubes removed leaving the GIC cylinders. Specimens were stored in deionised water for 24 hours and tested in a universal testing machine. For microleakage, a buccocervical cavity was prepared, restored with GIC and stored in deionised water. The specimens were polished, coated with varnish, placed in 0.5% basic fuchsin for 24 hours, sectioned at the midpoint and evaluated for microleakage under a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope. Results: For µSBS, Fuji II LC showed the highest bond strength among three products. There was no significant difference between age groups. (P =.93) For microleakage, Fuji II LC had more dye penetration (P <.01) and there was significant difference between age groups. Conclusion: After bonding of GICs, aged dentin showed no difference in µSBS but less microleakage when compared to young dentin.","dentistry, medical","Dentistry (all), Geriatrics and Gerontology"

This mutation is mostly prevalent in Taiwanese and Han-Chinese individuals. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and comprehensive neurophysiological profiles of ATTRA97S-PN in Thai patients. Methods: The clinical profiles and serial neurophysiologic studies (nerve conduction study (NCS), quantitative sensory test (QST), and comprehensive autonomic function test (AFT)) of symptomatic ATTRA97S-PN patients who had been followed-up at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during 2010–2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Nine symptomatic patients (55.6 % were male) from four unrelated families were included. All were Thais of mixed Thai Chinese descent. The mean age of onset was 48.3 (32–60) years. The mean age at diagnosis was 54.8 (33–66) years. Three patients developed early-onset (< 40y) polyneuropathy. The mean Neuropathy Impairment Score was 41.33 (10–92) at diagnosis. Sensory (9/9) and autonomic (9/9) neuropathies were more frequent than motor neuropathy (5/9), which appeared in the late stage of disease. Hypoesthesia in the feet, and gastrointestinal autonomic symptoms were frequently reported as the initial symptoms. The course of neuropathy progressed over years to decades. The worsening of neuropathy tended to progress faster once motor nerves were affected in both clinical and neurophysiological aspects. Concurrent cardiac amyloidosis was found in 6/9 patients. NCS showed length-dependent sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy in 5/9 patients, and median neuropathy at the wrist (mostly bilateral) in 7/9 patients. QST showed abnormalities in the vibratory detection threshold, the cold detection threshold and the heat pain sensation in 8/9, 8/9 and 7/7 tested patients, respectively. AFT results were abnormal in all. The mean composite autonomic severity score was 5 (3–9). Conclusions: This clinical study is the first of ATTRA97S-PN in Thai patients. The mixed polyneuropathy-cardiopathy phenotype was the most common manifestation. In this cohort, the age of onset was lower, and the course of neuropathy was relatively longer, than that in previous studies. Some patients may develop early-onset polyneuropathy. This mutation has not yet been documented in any population other than Han Chinese-related populations, probably suggesting a founder effect. Further studies are warranted.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, medical",Neurology (clinical)

This paper describes the processes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 from the initial infection and subsequent destruction of type II alveolar epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. Main body: The activation of alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the release of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and their translocation into the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of these inflammatory mediators in the vascular compartment leads to the activation of vascular endothelial cells platelets and neutrophils and the subsequent formation of platelet neutrophil complexes. These complexes in concert with activated endothelial cells interact to create a state of immunothrombosis. The consequence of immunothrombosis include hypercoagulation, accelerating inflammation, fibrin deposition, migration of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) producing neutrophils into the alveolar apace, activation of the NLRP3 inflammazome, increased alveolar macrophage destruction and massive tissue damage by pyroptosis and necroptosis Therapeutic combinations aimed at ameliorating immunothrombosis and preventing the development of severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

Medial remodeling is a structural change of the pulmonary artery seen with PH. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are suggested as causes of medial remodeling. To demonstrate the histopathological changes of the pulmonary artery in dogs affected with PH secondary to degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared with DMVD without PH and control dogs. Animals: Lung samples obtained from the carcasses of 19 older small-breed dogs (Control, n = 5; DMVD, n = 7; DMVD + PH, n = 7). Materials and methods: Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. Results: The internal diameters of the pulmonary artery in the three groups were not different. Masson's trichrome staining revealed no collagen deposition in the intimal layer of the pulmonary artery in all dogs. The external diameter, percentage of medial thickness (%MT), percentage of SMC layer and collagen deposition areas, average number of SMCs, and the percentage of PCNA positive cells (%PCNA) of the pulmonary artery were increased in the DMVD and DMVD + PH groups compared with the control group. The %PCNA in the DMVD + PH group was significantly decreased when compared with the DMVD group. Conclusions: Medial remodeling was found in left-sided heart failure DMVD dogs with and without PH. The medial remodeling in DMVD dogs with and without PH is related to SMC hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and collagen deposition, leading to an increased medial layer thickness of the pulmonary artery.","biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science","Physiology, Veterinary (all)"

Further, the biochar obtained from the H. lacustris residue was explored for iron oxide reduction using hematite iron ore through a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The alga H. lacustris cultivated in a low-cost polythene made photobioreactor (PBR) for a period of 32 days. During cultivation, several parameters were optimized for the enhanced biomass and astaxanthin accumulation. The results revealed that the highest biomass productivity of 3 g L−1 was found in acetate amended culture medium. Similarly, the addition of an extra carbon source (acetate) supported the highest astaxanthin productivity of 203 mg L−1, and it was observed during the red phase on day 32. The PBR volumetric biomass productivity of H. lacustris was estimated at up to 79.8 tonnes/acre/year. In this study, the alga H. lacustris grown in polythene made PBR produced the highest natural astaxanthin yield of 6.76%/cell dry weight (CDW). Further, the residual biomass was pyrolyzed through a non-catalytic process to obtain the maximum biochar yield. A mini pellet was synthesized using H. lacustris biochar and hematite (Fe2O3), and it was taken for metallic iron production under a nitrogen atmosphere. The results revealed that the biochar was supported for maximum metallic iron (Fe) production at ≥975 °C. This is the first study demonstrating the utilization of microalgae H. lacustris for natural astaxanthin production and biomass residue for metallic iron (Fe) production at low-cost methods.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, and trial registries up to February 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with prediabetes or T2DM. Eligible trials compared probiotics versus either placebo, no intervention, or comparison probiotics, or compared synbiotics versus prebiotics. Primary outcomes were mean change in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to short term (<12 wk) and long term (≥12 wk). We performed meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We included 28 RCTs (1947 participants). Overall, probiotics reduced FBG more than the placebo/no intervention group with a mean difference (MD) of -12.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.55, -2.42; P value: 0.016) over the short term; and -2.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -5.84, -0.13; P value: 0.040) over the long term. There was also some evidence for reduced HbA1c in the probiotics group at both short term (MD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.02; P value: 0.084) and long term (MD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.34, 0.06; P value: 0.172), however, these did not reach statistical significance possibly because only a few trials reported HbA1c as an outcome. Subgroup analyses showed a greater reduction in HbA1c in participants not receiving insulin therapy than those receiving insulin therapy. Furthermore, the effect of probiotics on the reduction of FBG was more pronounced in participants with FBG >130 mg/dL and those not receiving insulin therapy than their counterparts. Probiotics were also effective in lowering serum cholesterol over the short and long term. In conclusion, we found that probiotics may have a glucose-lowering effect in T2DM participants. The effect appeared to be stronger in participants with poorly controlled diabetes and those not on insulin therapy.

Functional textile containing antimicrobial agents is one potential solution to eliminate bacteria on textile surfaces. Despite their advantages there are concerns that antimicrobial agents have a detrimental impact on the environment, therefore in this study we consider antimicrobial agents added to the surface of fibers that have minimal environmental concerns. Suspended nanocellulose – prepared by isolating cellulose fibers from sugarcane bagasse waste and then reducing their size to nanometer scale using a steam explosion machine and a high-pressure microfluidizer – was used as a coating material. The cellulose nanofibers modified with various organosilanes (in amino silane and quaternary ammonium silane form) were used as a modifying agent for improving antimicrobial and water-repellent behaviors of cotton fabric.

However, several scholars noted that in the East, where the concept originated, mindfulness may be understood differently. In Eastern cultures such as Thailand, mindfulness is not only employed to deal with suffering but also to promote well-being. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been undertaken to evaluate the relationship between traditional mindfulness and eudaimonic well-being in Eastern contexts. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between mindfulness and eudaimonic well-being in Thai contexts. We also explored the mediating roles of rumination and emotion dysregulation on this relationship. Data were collected from 312 Thai undergraduates who completed a measure of Eudaimonic Well-Being, the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Results largely supported our hypotheses. Mindfulness was found to have a positive and direct association with eudaimonic well-being. Rumination and emotion dysregulation partially mediated this association. Additionally, both rumination and emotion dysregulation had negative and direct association with eudaimonic well-being. The findings highlight the positive influences of mindfulness on well-being.

To investigate the factors affecting behavior of mobile phone use while driving, 1106 respondents from four different regions in Thailand participated in the questionnaire survey study. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain these factors including two additional extended factors which are risk perception and law enforcement knowledge. The outcome of this part shows that attitude, norm, and law enforcement knowledge significantly affect the intention and behavior of the drivers. Even though approximately 90 percent of drivers realized that using a mobile phone while driving was dangerous and against the law, they have reported that they still use mobile phone while driving. To determine the effect of mobile phone use on driving performance, a 2-lane, straight rural highway, with a leading vehicle and an unexpected “STOP” sign, were simulated in order to examine the driving performance of drivers “without a phone”, “talking on a phone call”, and “texting a message” conditions. The results found that using mobile phone while driving can reduce speed and following distance, but increase lateral deviation, steer deviation, steer speed, perception-reaction time, and number of near misses leading to higher risks for road crashes.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering, medical","Human Factors and Ergonomics, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Comparing the safety and effectiveness of treatments for vasomotor symptoms is limited by the use of inconsistent outcome measures, and uncertainty as to which outcomes are most important to symptomatic women. To address this, we have developed a Core Outcome Set (COS) for use in clinical trials of treatments for VMS.Methods:We systematically reviewed the primary outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials of treatments for VMS. These were refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey completed by clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women between November 2019 and March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from ""not important"" to ""critically important."" Two international consensus meetings were held to finalize the COS.Results:Based on the systematic review, 13 separate outcomes were included in the Delphi process.

Methods: We enrolled patients with claudication who underwent MIS-TLIF from January 2017 to June 2019. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), walking distance, and perioperative outcomes were compared between groups. Preoperative and 3-month postoperative magnetic resonance imaging assessed changes in canal cross-sectional area, foraminal height, and lateral recess area. Results: Sixty-five consecutive patients with ≥1 year of follow-up were enrolled. VAS scores and ODI were not significantly different between groups (VAS and ODI, respectively, at 1 month follow-up, P = 0.62 and 0.88; 3 months follow-up, P = 0.96 and 0.53; 6 months follow-up, P = 0.10 and 0.85; and 12 months follow-up, P = 0.10 and 0.66). Operative time and blood loss between groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.43 and P = 0.55). There was also no difference in the length of hospital stay (P = 0.24). Canal dimensions increased in each group without significant differences between groups (cross-sectional area, P = 0.92; foraminal height [approach and contralateral side, respectively], P = 0.62 and 0.66; and lateral recess area [approach and contralateral side, respectively], P = 0.68 and 0.50). Conclusions: A unilateral approach with ipsilateral side direct decompression and contralateral indirect decompression in MIS-TLIF is sufficient for early clinical improvement in patients with claudication.","genergyal, medical","Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

The aptamer was modified in this research with an additional short chain adenine and a fluorescein molecule. The aptamer-based SERS method could differentiate between S. enterica subsp. Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) and S. enterica subsp. Gaminara (S. Gaminara) and allowed the in-vitro detection of S. Enteritidis at 3 log CFU/mL. The SERS characteristic peaks of the aptamer at 1184 and 730 cm−1 were used as reporters for the presence of S. Enteritidis as it binds specifically to that bacterium. Whereas, those peaks were not observed in the spectra of S. Gaminara, suggesting that the aptamer-based SERS was specific to S. Enteritidis but not S. Gaminara. The efficacy of the method to detect S. Enteritidis contaminated in ground beef (93% lean) was also determined. The observed increase of peak intensity at 726-732 cm−1 in the SERS spectra of S. Enteritidis (4 log CFU/g) inoculated samples apparently confirmed that the method can be a promising tool to specifically detect the presence of S. Enteritidis in ground beef with a total running time of 4 h.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; spoilage and contamination, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Materials and methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized two group parallel experiment, using a 14-day non-brushing half-mouth model. The test group was randomly assigned to the mixed 0.12% CHX and 1.5% H2O2 mouthrinse, whereas the control group used 0.12% CHX. Sixty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study and received scaling and polishing 2 weeks prior to the experiment and then rinsed with the allocated mouthrinses twice daily for 2 weeks. The plaque, stain, and gingivitis scores were evaluated and recorded by a calibrated investigator. Results: Fifty-two subjects completed the study (CHX + H2O2n = 25/CHX n = 27). There were significant differences between the control and test groups for plaque index (CHX 0.64 ± 0.41 vs. CHX + H2O2 0.46 ± 0.36, p = 0.035) and stain intensity at proximal areas (CHX 0.26 ± 0.36 vs. CHX + H2O2 0.09 ± 0.14, p = 0.019) at the end of the experimental non-brushing side. However, the gingival indices did not differ significantly (CHX 0.61 ± 0.34 vs. CHX + H2O2 0.62 ± 0.31, p = 0.938) between groups. Conclusions: In the absence of oral hygiene practice, the mixed CHX + H2O2 mouthrinse was slightly superior in reducing plaque scores and stain compared with CHX alone. Clinical relevance: The clinical effectiveness of CHX + H2O2 is comparable with CHX mouthwash alone. Therefore, the use of the mixed mouthrinse is beneficial compared with CHX for minimizing biofilm and tooth staining.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

However, the sustainability of such a process is questioned in terms of emissions, energy savings, and economic benefits. Microalgae based WW treatment has been proposed as a viable alternative to conventional WW treatment. In microalgae treatment, WW including organics and nutrients gets converted to algae, while reclaimed water is discharged back to the environment. Microalgae could be used as a precursor for biochemicals, biofuels or other bio-based products. There are different technologies within microalgae-based WW treatment including adsorption, accumulation, and immobilization of algae. This review attempts to understand the mechanisms of these technologies on how nutrients and organics are removed from WW. Though it is a viable alternative, there are several challenges and limitation that exist in this technology which needs to be addressed to have a commercial perspective. Algae based WW treatment is analysed for its limitation and has been reported here. Beyond WW treatment, this method should also be looked as an emission reduction strategy through CO2 fixation.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that the dried BC exhibited an interpenetrating fibrous mat. The BC films harvested for 5, 10, and 15 days were 15–19, 14.4–24, and 30–31 μm thick, respectively. Then, BC/graphene oxide (GO) composite films were prepared via the exhaust dyeing method. GO sheets penetrated the BC matrix, resulting in the formation of a BC/GO composite, as revealed by the SEM analysis results. The mechanical properties of the composite films were investigated. Compared with virgin BC, the tensile strength of the composite films was higher, while the %E at break was lower, resulting in a significant increase in the Young's modulus. The X-ray diffraction results indicated that an increase in the dyeing time (0.5–2 h) gradually induced cellulose crystalline conformation, which in turn affected the swelling ability, mechanical properties, and electrical properties of the BC/GO composite films. After the reduction of GO to reduced GO (rGO), flexible conductive BC/rGO films were obtained, as confirmed by their resistivity values. Thus, flexible conductive composite films with excellent mechanical properties were successfully fabricated.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

A set of transforming rules are proposed to map a given YAWL workflow with time constraints into the resulting timed automata. The tasks and their decorators indicating the splitting and joining of the workflow, would be considered, and transformed into synchronizing channels in timed automata. The time duration of a task would be handled using the relevant local clock in the timed automata.

In particular targeting immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed-death protein 1 (PD-1), by specific monoclonal antibodies is a current treatment for many malignances. A possible innovation in this field is based on the induction of humoral responses in the host by suppressing the effects of such immune checkpoints and as consequence favoring the activation of cellular immunity against the tumor cells. In this study, chimeric protein comprising the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin as carrier and the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 (LTB-CTLA4) was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. The recombinant protein was accumulated up to 1.29 μg/g of leaves fresh weight on 4 day-post-infiltration. The integrity of the plant-made LTB-CTLA4 antigen was confirmed by western blot analysis and ELISA. Immunogenicity of the plant-made LTB-CTLA4 was assessed in BALB/c mice and the results showed that humoral responses were induced against both the LTB and CTLA-4 moieties. The plant–made LTB-CTLA4 stands as a promising candidate for the design of advanced protection studies against cancer in murine models.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Our results suggest that the glacial emergence of the Sunda Shelf likely altered the atmospheric circulation pattern in Southeast (SE) Asia and led to the realignment of rainfall patterns between Thailand and Indonesia during the last glacial period. We also propose that the long-term hydrological regime change in the tropical Asian-Pacific region during MIS 3 was mainly influenced by an El Niño-like mechanism. An intense El Niño-like condition led to strong aridity in SE Asia during mid MIS 3. By late MIS 3, an enhanced seasonality dampened the intensity of the El Niño-like conditions, thus, leading to muted aridity in SE Asia. The alternating warm and wet summer months and droughts during winter favoured the proliferation of C4 plant types in Northern Thailand from mid MIS 3 to late MIS 3.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; environmentalronments, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

PLA was melt-mixed with three weight percentages (10–30 wt %) of ENR-30 using an internal mixer, followed by compression molding. The 80/20 PLA/ENR-30 blend showed the highest impact strength and elongation at break, indicating the optimally possible improvement in the toughness of PLA. This composition was further chosen for fabricating nanocomposites with nSiO2 at 1–3 phr. Nanocomposite at 2 phr nSiO2 revealed the highest impact strength with 1.8-fold over the neat blend, but the tensile properties of all nanocomposites decreased with the increasing nSiO2 contents. The scanning electron microscopy analysis showed a preferential distribution of nSiO2 in the ENR-30 phase rather than in the PLA phase.

A chalcone derivative, isoliquiritigenin (ISLQ), has been shown to have various pharmacological properties. Since several studies have shown that ISLQ could inhibit CFTR channel activity, it is interesting to see whether it can inhibit renal cyst enlargement. The present study was aimed to determine an inhibitory effect and the mechanism of chalcone derivatives on MDCK cyst progression and Pkd1 mutant cells. Methods: MDCK cyst growth and cyst formation experiments, MTT assay, Ussing chamber experiment, BrdU cell proliferation assay and western blot analysis were performed in this study. Results: Among four compounds of chalcone derivatives tested, CHAL-005 (100 µM) was found to inhibit MDCK cyst growth in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. It inhibited short-circuit current of chloride secretion as well as CFTR protein expression in MDCK cells. CHAL-005 significantly suppressed cell proliferation. In addition, CHAL-005 strongly reduced phosphorylation ERK1/2 and phosphorylation S6 kinase in MDCK and Pkd1 mutant cells. Interestingly, CHAL-005 activated phosphorylation of AMP kinase protein expression in MDCK and Pkd1 mutant cells. Conclusion: CHAL-005 slowed MDCK cyst progression by inhibiting CFTR expression and reducing ERK1/2 and mTOR/S6K signaling pathways as well as activating AMPK expression.

The objective was to evaluate IS risk factors and imaging variables as predictors of short-term disability and mortality in IS. Consecutive 106 IS patients were enrolled. We examined the accuracy of IS severity using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid stenosis (both assessed using ultrasonography with doppler) predicting IS outcome assessed with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) three months after hospital admission. Poor prognosis (mRS ≥ 3) at three months was predicted by carotid stenosis (≥ 50%), type 2 diabetes mellitus and NIHSS with an accuracy of 85.2% (sensitivity: 90.2%; specificity: 81.8%). The mRS score at three months was strongly predicted by NIHSS (β = 0.709, p < 0.001). Short-term mortality was strongly predicted using a neural network model with cIMT (≥ 1.0 mm versus < 1.0 mm), NIHSS and age, yielding an area under the receiving operator characteristic curve of 0.977 and an accuracy of 94.7% (sensitivity: 100.0%; specificity: 90.9%). High NIHSS (≥ 15) and cIMT (≥ 1.0 mm) increased the probability of dying with hazard ratios of 7.62 and 3.23, respectively. Baseline NIHSS was significantly predicted by the combined effects of age, large artery atherosclerosis stroke, sex, cIMT, body mass index, and smoking. In conclusion, high values of cIMT and NIHSS at admission strongly predict short-term functional impairment as well as mortality three months after IS, underscoring the importance of those measurements to predict clinical IS outcome.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Textural properties characterization showed that the BC-PCH samples exhibited higher specific surface area (SBET) 644–738 m2/g than that of B-PCH and C-PCH sample and slightly smaller pore size because the size of micelles in solution system from mixed surfactant decreases, which was confirmed by Dynamic Light Scattering analysis (DLS). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis (FE-SEM) illustrated the rough surface structure of mesoporous BC-PCH samples. The dielectric properties were measured by using the Inductance–Capacitance–Resistance meter (LCR). The dielectric constant (at 103 Hz) increased from 9 and 10 of single CTAB and CTAC surfactant template B-PCH and C-PCH to 15–17 of mixed surfactant series BC-PCHs, almost two-fold was obtained. The improvements of dielectric constant in BC-PCH samples are achieved by the increasing of interfacial polarization. Considering these results, BC-PCH materials can be further applied as candidates for an attractive filler to enhance the dielectric properties of polymer nanocomposite.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Characteristics of plasma of the plasma jet depend on type of gas, flow rate of gas, design of electrodes, power and frequency of the power source. In this research, the argon gas is flowed through a hollow tube is investigated. Alternating high voltage power supply connected to electrodes is operated with frequency of 50 Hz. It was found that the lengths of the plasma jet generated by this system ranges from 0.5 cm and 1 cm. The minimum and the maximum electron temperature of the plasma was 0.44 eV and 0.86 eV respectively. The electron temperature increased as the applied voltage was increased. However, the electron temperature decreased when the operating voltage was increased above 6.5 kV to 7.5 kV. It can be explained by the effect of arcing between the electrodes which causes the lost in energy. Also, increasing of the flow rate over a critical limit produces turbulence that also causes reduction in electron temperature of the plasma jet.","fluid mechanics, physics",Physics and Astronomy (all)
The effects on Thailand of China’s import restrictions on waste: measures and challenges related to the international recycling of waste plastic and e-waste,Sasaki S.,2021-01-01,"Business opportunities, Illegal activities, Permit systems, Philippines, Plastic wastes, Recycling of wastes, Southeast Asia, Viet Nam, Circular economy, Customs, Illegal imports, The Basel Convention, Trade statistics","This paper has outlined the measures and challenges facing Thailand, which was forced to address a surge in imports of plastic waste and e-waste after China imposed restrictions on its own imports of waste material. Thailand had imposed import restrictions and created an import permit system prior to China’s decision. However, the nation was not prepared for the extent of the subsequent smuggling and other illegal activities, as evidenced by the various problems related to the permit system and customs enforceability in 2018. In response, Thailand banned imports of plastic waste and e-waste, resulting in a loss of business opportunities for companies with legal import permits. Other nations in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines, witnessed a similar surge in imports of plastic waste and e-waste after China’s decision to restrict waste imports. These nations subsequently also imposed import bans and/or restrictions. However, the enforceability of such bans and restrictions may be limited in Asia. Thus, exporting countries must secure an appropriate international recycling mechanism.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

The study found that under the epidemic control measure during 11 May–19 June 2020, the average concentrations of atmospheric air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO were reduced to 42.15 µg m–3, 128.68 µg m–3, 27.31 ppb, and 0.83 ppm respectively, and were 73.85%, 46.48%, 63.43%, and 50.18% lower than the pre-COVID-19 level of January 2020, respectively. The steep fall of PM2.5, NO2, and CO was due to a drastic reduction in vehicular emission, but PM10 did not fall below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Between January 2020 to 11 May–19 June 2020 period, the pollutants O3 and SO2 increased significantly by 217.33% and 57.58 % respectively. The rise of SO2 in Delhi was due to long-distance transfer, power plant emissions, and biomass burning. The sharp increase of O3 happened due to accumulation in the atmosphere. During the peak COVID-19 phase (9 April–10 May 2020) Delhi had unprecedented improved AQI classes of II and III only. However, the pivotal pollutants in terms of their cumulative contribution to the AQI classes were PM10 and O3. Low RH and low-temperature situations exhibited positive correlations with the new COVID-19 infection cases in Delhi. Comparatively lower NO2 level in the air demonstrated a significant negative correlation with new COVID-19 cases while average SO2 concentration in the air, when increased to 24.05 ppb, showed a negative correlation with new COVID-19 cases in Delhi. This study indicated a possibility of O3 exhibiting a positive correlation with new COVID-19 cases under the condition of comparatively low temperature and low humidity.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution"
Ozone nanobubble treatments improve survivability of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) challenged with a pathogenic multi-drug-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila,"Thanh Dien L., Linh N.V., Sangpo P., Senapin S., St-Hilaire S., Rodkhum C., Dong H.T.",2021-09-01,"Aeromonas hydrophila, Animals, Aquaculture, Bacterial Load, Cichlids, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Fish Diseases, Gills, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Nanostructures, Ozone, Water Microbiology, Aeromonas hydrophila, antimicrobial resistance, multidrug resistance, non-antibiotic approach, ozone nanobubbles","A rapid increase in multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in aquaculture highlights the risk of production losses due to diseases and potential public health concerns. Previously, we reported that ozone nanobubbles (NB-O3) were effective at reducing concentrations of pathogenic bacteria in water and modulating fish immunity against pathogens; however, multiple treatments with direct NB-O3 exposures caused alterations to the gills of exposed fish. Here, we set up a modified recirculation system (MRS) assembled with an NB-O3 device (MRS-NB-O3) to investigate whether MRS-NB-O3 (a) were safe for tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), (b) were effective at reducing bacterial load in rearing water and (c) improved survivability of Nile tilapia following an immersion challenge with a lethal dose of MDR Aeromonas hydrophila. The results showed no behavioural abnormalities or mortality of Nile tilapia during the 14-day study using the MRS-NB-O3 system. In the immersion challenge, although high bacterial concentration (~2 × 107 CFU/ml) was used, multiple NB-O3 treatments in the first two days reduced the bacteria between 15.9% and 35.6% of bacterial load in water, while bacterial concentration increased from 13.1% to 27.9% in the untreated control. There was slight up-regulation of non-specific immune-related genes in the gills of the fish receiving NB-O3 treatments. Most importantly, this treatment significantly improved survivability of Nile tilapia with relative percentage survival (RPS) of 64.7% – 66.7% in treated fish and surviving fish developed specific antibody against MDR A. hydrophila. In summary, the result suggests that NB-O3 is a promising non-antibiotic approach to control bacterial diseases, including MDR bacteria, and has high potential for application in recirculation aquaculture system (RAS).","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

Food scientists are therefore motivated to search for natural protein sources and innovative technologies to modify their chemical structure for desirable functionality and thus utilization. Deamidation is a viable, efficient, and attractive approach for modifying proteins owing to its ease of operating, specificity, and cost-effective processes. Over the past three decades, the knowledge of protein deamidation for food applications has evolved drastically, including the development of novel approaches for deamidation, such as protein-glutaminase and ion exchange resin, and their practices in new protein substrate. Thanks to deamidation, enhanced functionalities of food proteins from cereals, legumes, milk, oil seeds and others, and thereby their processabilities as food ingredients have been achieved. Moreover, deamidated proteins have been used to fabricate engineered food colloids, including self-assembled protein particles, protein–metallic complexes, and protein–carbohydrate complexes, which have demonstrated tailored physicochemical properties to modulate oral perception, improve gastrointestinal digestion and bioavailability, and protect and/or deliver bioactive nutrients. Novel bioactivity, altered digestibility, and varied allergenicity of deamidated proteins are increasingly recognized. Therefore, deamidated proteins with novel techno-functional and biological properties hold both promise and challenges for future food applications, and a comprehensive review on this area is critically needed to update our knowledge and provide a better understanding on the protein deamidation and its emerging applications.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

A burgeoning family of catalysts that currently serve in such hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) are artificial metalloenzymes and metallopolymers, which were manifested through the direct syntheses between HER-active metal complexes and protein matrices or water-soluble polymers. The direct synthetic method often poses some limitations on active site variants and synthetic feasibility. Here, we propose the first HER-active metallopolymer catalyst manifested through the bottom-up synthetic strategy and a facile postpolymerization modification. With the advent of this method, the tridentate ligation (N-[2-(aminopropylthio)phenyl]-2-pyridinemethamine (NNS-PrNH2)) and the water-solubilizing (amino-containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2)) pendent units were furnished onto polymer backbone with quantitative precision. The readily synthesized polymers were self-folding in water, and subsequently formed the polymeric nanoassemblies upon nickel-coordination complexation to give a high concentration of active sites in hydrophobic compartments. The stable metallopolymers showed practical usage in the electrochemical HER in a pH 7 aqueous solution, under ambient conditions, resulting in 41 ± 9 μmol of H2 evolved in 1 h with the satisfactory faradaic efficiencies of 58 ± 2%.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, chemistry","Process Chemistry and Technology, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

Osteogenic differentiation was examined by Alizarin red staining, and gene expressions of bone/cementum or dentin-related genes were examined by polymerase chain reaction. Lipopolysaccharide did not affect cell proliferation and migration in both groups. Lipopolysaccharide at 1 and 5 µg mL−1 increased Alizarin red staining in apical papilla cells from early-stage but not the late-stage cells.

Two types of essential oil were compared including clove essential oil (CEO) and turmeric essential oil (TEO). The EO-loaded CSNPs were prepared by a two-step method; oil-in-water (o/w) emulsification followed by ionic gelation using different ratios of chitosan:EO (i.e., 1:0.25, 1:0.50, 1:0.75, and 1:1.00 w/w). The increasing amount of EO caused more aggregate structure as observed from SEM images. The TEO-loaded CSNPs showed a higher extent of aggregation than the CEO-loaded CSNPs. The adhesiveness of the semi-solid PVA hydrogels containing TEO-loaded CSNPs was the highest. The use of EO-loaded CSNPs in the semi-solid PVA hydrogel helped to sustain and prolong the release rate of EO from the hydrogels as compared to just the EO alone. The studied semi-solid PVA hydrogels were non-toxic to both NCTC clone 929 and NHDF cells.

Single media use was associated with child’s behavioural problems in previous studies. However, the associations between SMM since early childhood and behavioural problems in school-age children had not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the association between SMM from age 6 months to 4 years and behavioural problems in 6-year-old children. Two hundred and ninety-one (52.6% girls) healthy children were enrolled since age 6 months and 259 participants were followed-up until age 6 years. SMM was obtained at age 6, 12, 18, 24 months, 3 and 4 years. Behavioural concerns were assessed at age 4 years by the Child Behaviour Checklist and by both the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire with the Conners Kiddie Continuous Performance Test at age 6 years. Parenting style, cognitive ability, and baseline characteristics were also ascertained. Partial least squares path modelling was performed to determine both direct and indirect relationships among variables. Results showed that children who had been exposed to SMM for longer duration, specifically at age 18 months, showed more behavioural problems at age 4 and 6 years. Positive parenting during preschool and behavioural concerns at age 4 years were main mediators of those associations. Moreover, SMM in minutes at age 18 months was related to decreased preschool cognition. To minimise behavioural problems in school-age children, SMM should be avoided before 2 years of age so that positive parenting may be successfully implemented since early childhood.","medical, psychology","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Correct and stable sorting for overflow streaming data with a limited storage size and a uniprocessor,"Chaikhan S., Phimoltares S., Lursinsap C.",2021-01-01,"Fundamental operations, Limited storage, Sorting algorithm, Sorting process, Space complexity, Streaming data, Time complexity, Uniprocessors, Algorithm design and analysis, Algorithms, Computational intelligence, Memory, Sorting","Tremendous quantities of numeric data have been generated as streams in various cyber ecosystems. Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations to gain knowledge from data. However, due to size restrictions of data storage which includes storage inside and outside CPU with respect to the massive streaming data sources, data can obviously overflow the storage. Consequently, all classic sorting algorithms of the past are incapable of obtaining a correct sorted sequence because data to be sorted cannot be totally stored in the data storage. This paper proposes a new sorting algorithm called streaming data sort for streaming data on a uniprocessor constrained by a limited storage size and the correctness of the sorted order. Data continuously flow into the storage as consecutive chunks with chunk sizes less than the storage size. A theoretical analysis of the space bound and the time complexity is provided. The sorting time complexity is O (n), where n is the number of incoming data. The space complexity is O (M), where M is the storage size. The experimental results show that streaming data sort can handle a million permuted data by using a storage whose size is set as low as 35% of the data size. This proposed concept can be practically applied to various applications in different fields where the data always overflow the working storage and sorting process is needed.","data storage, equipment and techniques, fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)

Due to the possible coexistence between SE and CT infection in the same patient, characteristics of the polymicrobial biofilms from both organisms might be different from those of the biofilms of each organism. Then, the exploration on biofilms, from SE with or without CT, and an evaluation on l-cysteine (an antibiofilm against both bacteria and fungi) were performed. As such, Candida incubation in preformed SE biofilms (SE > CT) produced higher biofilms than the single- (SE or CT) or mixed-organism (SE + CT) biofilms as determined by crystal violet staining and fluorescent confocal images with z-stack thickness analysis. In parallel, SE > CT biofilms demonstrated higher expression of icaB and icaC than other groups at 20 and 24 h of incubation, suggesting an enhanced matrix polymerization and transportation, respectively. Although organism burdens (culture method) from single-microbial biofilms (SE or CT) were higher than multi-organism biofilms (SE + CT and SE > CT), macrophage cytokine responses (TNF-α and IL-6) against SE > CT biofilms were higher than those in other groups in parallel to the profound biofilms in SE > CT. Additionally, sepsis severity in mice with subcutaneously implanted SE > CT catheters was more severe than in other groups as indicated by mortality rate, fungemia, serum cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and kidney and liver injury. Although CT grows upon preformed SE-biofilm production, the biofilm structures interfered during CT morphogenesis leading to the frailty of biofilm structure and resulting in the prominent candidemia. However, l-cysteine incubation together with the organisms in catheters reduced biofilms, microbial burdens, macrophage responses, and sepsis severity. In conclusion, SE > CT biofilms prominently induced biofilm matrix, fungemia, macrophage responses, and sepsis severity, whereas the microbial burdens were lower than in the single-organism biofilms.

The delay and non-delay channels created on nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) using wax-printing method were used to deliver immunoassay and AuNPs enhancement reagents to the detection zone sequentially. For the enhancing step, AuNPs were enlarged by the catalytic reaction of KAuCl4 and NH2OH⋅HCl. Under optimal conditions, a calibration curve was found in a range of 0.1−5 μg⋅mL−1 with a good linear correlation (R2 = 0.9953). The limits of detection (LOD) were found to be 0.1 and 0.001 μg⋅mL-1 for naked eye observation and calculation (3SD/slope), respectively. Furthermore, the device shows no cross-reactivity with common interferences for CRP. The platform was successfully applied to detect CRP in certified human serum samples within 15 min, demonstrating the simplicity and speed of the AuNPs enhancement strategy platform. These promising results suggest that the new device may be used as an alternative tool for CRP detection and other biomarkers for POCT analysis.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The role of percussive technology in the daily subsistence strategies of our earliest ancestors has seen renewed focus recently. Studies of modern primate tool use highlight the diverse range of behaviours potentially associated with percussive technology. This has prompted significant methodological developments to characterize the associated damage marks (use-wear) on hammerstones and anvils. Little focus has, however, been paid to identifying whether these techniques can successfully differentiate between the damage patterns produced by specific and differing percussive behaviours. Here, we present a novel workflow drawing on the strengths of visual identification and three-dimensional (3D) surface quantification of use-wear. We apply this methodology firstly to characterize macaque percussive use-wear and test the efficacy of 3D surface quantification techniques in differentiating between percussive damage and natural surface topography. Secondly, we use this method to differentiate between use-wear associated with various wild macaque percussive behaviours. By combining analyst-directed, 3D surface analysis and use-wear dimensional analysis, we show that macaque percussive behaviours create specific diagnostic signatures and highlight a means of quantifiably recording such behavioural signatures in both primate and hominin contexts.","lubrication, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering"

Understanding the interaction between Notch and IL15 is essential to reveal molecular mechanism. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether IL15 participates in the Notch signaling-induced mineral deposition in human dental pulp cells (hDPs). Methods: hDPs were explanted from dental pulp tissues. To activate Notch signaling, the cells were seeded on Jagged1-immobilized surfaces. The mRNA expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. hDPs were treated with 5–50 ng/mL IL15. Cell viability and proliferation were determined using an MTT assay. Mineral deposition was examined using alizarin red s and Von Kossa staining. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with a JAK inhibitor prior to stimulation. Results: Jagged1 induced IL15 and IL15RA expression in hDPs. IL15 treatment significantly increased mineral deposition at 14 d and upregulated ALP, OCN, OSX, ANKH, and ENPP1 mRNA expression. IL15-induced mineralization was attenuated by JAK inhibitor pretreatment. Further, JAK inhibitor pretreatment inhibited the effect of Jagged1 on hDP mineral deposition.

The morphology and structural properties of InSb QDs can be varied by the change of controlled growth conditions. Optical phonons scatterings of the embedded InSb QDs are revealed by Raman spectroscopy. The low-temperature PL emission energy of InSb/GaAs QDs is in the range of 1.18–1.29 eV. The power-dependent PL spectroscopy confirms the type-II band alignment in this system. The thermal activation energies (22.7 meV and 146.5 meV) are extracted from the temperature-dependent PL spectroscopy (10–140 K). The polarization-dependent PL spectroscopy is performed and exhibits the polarization degree of ~ 18%, which is attributed to the shape anisotropy of buried InSb QDs.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
The response of adipose tissues to mycoplasma pulmonis and sendai virus infection in c57bl/6 and dba/2 mice,"Boonyarattanasoonthorn T., Sato K., Okamatsu-Ogura Y., Morimatsu M., Agui T.",2021-01-01,"Adipose Tissue, Brown, Adipose Tissue, White, Animals, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Inbred DBA, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Rodent Diseases, Virus Diseases, Adipose tissue, Brown adipose tissue, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Sendai virus, Uncoupling protein 1","Adipose tissues in mammals are categorized into white and brown adipose tissues in which cellular morphology, cell functions, and tissue distribution are different. White adipose tissue (WAT) plays a major role in energy reservation, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) mainly relates to the thermoregulation of the body. One interesting function of adipose tissue is the response to the infection, especially the pathogens that cause pneumonia. We have previously reported that DBA/2 (D2) mice are susceptible to pathogens causing pneumonia, Mycoplasma (M.) pulmonis and Sendai virus (SeV), whereas C57BL/6 (B6) mice are resistant to them. Furthermore, morphological alteration of mediastinal fat tissue (MFT) was seen after infection of M. pulmonis in D2 mice but not in B6 mice. In this study, we aimed to exhibit the difference in adipose tissue response in other areas, including interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT), and perigonadal WAT (perigoWAT) between resistant strain, B6 and susceptible strain, D2 after challenging them with M. pulmonis and SeV. Compared with B6 mice, D2 mice showed an increase in fat-associated lymphoid cluster in MFT, an increase in BAT in both iBAT and ingWAT after M. pulmonis and SeV infection. The results of this study indicate that pneumonia caused by M. pulmonis and SeV infection induces browning of adipocyte, suggesting that BAT plays a role in pathogen infection and inflammation.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
Structural dynamics and susceptibility of anti-HIV drugs against HBV reverse transcriptase,"Kammarabutr J., Mahalapbutr P., Okumura H., Wolschann P., Rungrotmongkol T.",2021-01-01,"Anti-HIV Agents, Hepatitis B virus, HIV Infections, Humans, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Stavudine, Zidovudine, Antiviral drug discovery, hepatitis B virus, nucleoside analogue inhibitors, reverse transcriptase","Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a small enveloped DNA virus, attacks the human liver causing both acute and chronic diseases. Current therapeutic drugs use the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) as a competitive inhibitor against HBV reverse transcriptase (HBV-RT), an essential enzyme pivotally involved in viral replication. Unfortunately, this treatment still causes the development of resistant variants of HBV against NAs. As HBV-RT is homologous to the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT), it is reasonable to treat HBV-RT with anti-HIV drugs. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the structural dynamics and susceptibility of the known anti-HIV drugs (stavudine [d4T], didanosine [DDI], and zidovudine [ZDV]) against HBV-RT enzyme in comparison to the anti-HBV drug lamivudine (3TC) and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) substrate using several computational approaches. The (Formula presented.) calculations revealed that seven polar residues (K32, R41, D83, S85, D205, N236, and K239) and three hydrophobic residues (A86, A87, and F88) of HBV-RT as well as the adjacent DNA strands play an important role in the ligand binding. In addition, the H-bond pattern of d4T is similar to that of 3TC, especially at the residues A86 and A87. Such interactions promote the favorable conformation of ligand in the HBV-RT binding pocket, while the several different conformations of ligand are found in the unbound state. The predicted binding free energy results based on QM/MM-GBSA and MM/GB(PB)SA methods suggested that the susceptibility towards HBV-RT of d4T and ZDV is higher than that of 3TC and dTTP. Altogether, this work sheds light on the potentiality of d4T and ZDV as a promising drug for HBV-infected patients harboring 3TC resistance. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Furfural is among the important bio-based chemicals in biorefineries. However, the conventional process of furfural production using a reaction-separation network entails low product yield but high fixed and operating costs owing to the complex process of separation. In this study, a process of furfural production via reactive distillation (RD) was investigated and designed based on the concept of process intensification. Exergy and exergoeconomic analyses were applied to evaluate the process performance. When the RD column was operated at its optimal configuration, furfural production of 81.78 kg h−1 was achieved with xylose conversion and furfural yield of 97.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The exergy efficiency of furfural production was 56.41%, while the RD column exhibited the maximum exergy destruction rate among all components with an exergy efficiency of 69.82%. The exergy destruction rate declined with decrease in the reboiler duty of the RD column and increase in xylose concentration. The exergoeconomic analysis revealed that decreasing the reboiler duty had the highest impact on the total cost of furfural production. Decreases in feedstock and catalyst costs as well as interest rate additionally lowered the total cost rate of the system.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Energy (all), Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Anthracene, phenanthrene or fluorene facilitated complete pyrene degradation within 9 days, while fluoranthene delayed pyrene degradation. Interestingly, fluoranthene degradation was enhanced in the presence of pyrene. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that Mycolicibacterium strains were the key PAH-degraders during the cometabolism of pyrene and fluoranthene. Notably, the transcription of genes encoding pyrene-degrading enzymes were shown to be important for enhanced fluoranthene degradation. NidAB was the major initial oxygenase involved in the degradation of pyrene and fluoranthene mixture. Other functional genes encoding ribosomal proteins, an iron transporter, ABC transporters and stress response proteins were induced in strains PO1 and PO2. Furthermore, an intermediate pyrene-degrading Novosphingobium strain contributed to protocatechuate degradation.

At a constant-pressure consideration, the lattice constants and the volume of the supercell were decreased with an increasing concentration of Fe. The average bond length of Fe–O is lower than that of Ce–O. As a result, Fe doping induces the reduced volume of the cell, which is in good agreement with previous experiments. At high pressure (~ 30 GPa), it was found that the transition pressure from the fluorite to the cotunnite orthorhombic phase decreases at a higher concentration of Fe, indicating that the formation energy of the compound is induced by Fe-doping. Furthermore, compression leads to interesting electronic properties too. Under higher pressures, the bandgap increases in the cubic structure under compression and then suddenly plummets after the transition to the orthorhombic phase. The 3d states of Fe mainly induced the impurity states in the bandgap. In both the undoped and Fe-doped systems, the bandgap increased in the cubic phase at high pressure, while the gap and p-d hybridization decrease in the orthorhombic phase.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all)"

In this study, DOM in process water during advanced drinking water treatment was fractionated sequentially by three solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges based on the polarity and charge of DOM molecules. By sequential SPE with unknown screening analysis, over 3000 DOM features were found in raw water, whereas around 2000 were obtained by a single SPE. The hydrophobic neutral (HPON) fraction contained CHO features with highest averaged molecular weight followed by hydrophobic acid (HPOA) and then hydrophilic acid (HPIA). The average degree of carbon double bond equivalents and carbon oxidation states indicated that the HPON fraction contained molecules that were more unsaturated and less oxidized than those of the HPOA and HPIA fractions. Ozone selectively decomposed (1) more unsaturated and less oxidized HPON features, (2) more unsaturated HPOA compounds, and (3) less oxidized HPIA molecules. Oxidation by-products were mostly HPON and HPIA compounds that were more oxidized than the decomposed molecules. During biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration, less oxidized HPON were preferentially removed, whereas HPOA were removed without selectivity. HPON and HPIA molecules with more oxidized character were found to be refractory to BAC treatment. HPON with more unsaturated and HPIA with more oxidized characters were decomposed by chlorine. Many types of HPIA decomposed during chlorination were the oxidation by-products of ozonation that were refractory to BAC treatment. Sequential SPE with unknown screening analysis provided previously unknown details of the molecular characteristics of DOM and its changes during advanced water treatment.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This research presents the mechanical and microstructural properties of dredged sediments treated with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fly ash (FA). A large amount of FA was utilised for the purpose of cost-effectiveness. The dredged sediments were mixed with 1.5%–5% OPC and 5%–20% using exclusively OPC, exclusively FA and a combination of OPC and FA. The experiments in this study consisted of unconfined compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, California bearing ratio, resilient modulus, and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests. The results showed that the mechanical properties were improved by the addition of FA and that the maximum values of these properties were observed with a combination of 5% OPC and 10% FA. In addition to evaluating the mechanical properties, microscale analyses were also conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to understand the behaviour of the dredged sediment with respect to the OPC and FA contents.

The results showed that the use of borax instead of sodium silicate reduced both the compressive and flexural strengths. The strength decreases when borax was used were related to the increase in the crystalline nature of the reaction products caused by the decreases in the Si/Al ratios of the gel phases formed. Moreover, incorporating 3.6–6.0% RHA into geopolymer mortars containing either hydrated borax or anhydrous borax led to an improvement in the compressive strength due to the formation of a Ca-modified N-A-S-H gel with a high Si/Al ratio during the reaction.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

The reported results are based on proton-proton collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded in 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 136 fb-1. Results obtained from lead-lead collision data collected at √sNN=5.02 TeV are also presented. Innovative techniques are used to reconstruct the electron and photon signals in the detector and to optimize the energy resolution. Events with electrons and photons in the final state are used to measure the energy resolution and energy scale uncertainty in the recorded events. The measured energy resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays in proton-proton collision data ranges from 2 to 5%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material. The energy scale in the same range of energies is measured with an uncertainty smaller than 0.1 (0.3)% in the barrel (endcap) region in proton-proton collisions and better than 1 (3)% in the barrel (endcap) region in heavy ion collisions. The timing resolution for electrons from Z boson decays with the full 2016-2018 proton-proton collision data set is measured to be 200 ps.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

The global coronavirus pandemic beginning in 2020 altered the seasonality and prevalence of these respiratory infections in Thailand. We aimed to characterize the upsurge of HRV and the subsequent RSV infection observed among young children who sought medical care at a hospital in Bangkok. Methods: From July to December 2020, nasopharyngeal swabs from children ≤5 years of age presented with influenza-like illness were tested for RSV and HRV using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were Sanger sequenced. Genotyping was performed using sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Results: Upsurge of HRV infection began in July and was subsequently replaced by a surge of RSV infection from September onward. In 6 months, HRV was detected in 27.5% (158/574) of the samples, of which 44% (69/158) were HRV-A, 7% (11/158) were HRV-B, and 36% (57/158) were HRV-C. Meanwhile, RSV was detected in 40.4% (232/574) of the samples, of which 78% (181/232) were RSV-A and 6% (14/232) were RSV-B. RSV peaked in October 2020, approximately 2 months later than typically seen in previous years. All RSV-A were of subgenotype ON1. Codetection of HRV and RSV was found in 5.1% (29/574). Conclusions: HRV and RSV infection among young children coincided with relaxed local coronavirus public health measures, including the return to in-class schooling. The delayed RSV season in 2020 was predominantly associated with RSV-A.",medical,"Epidemiology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

It causes various life-threatening diseases. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) releases the manual for sleep data scoring. Patients with SDB are prescribed to be monitored at the sleep clinic where several physiological data are recorded, called polysomnogram (PSG). The massive PSG data must be scored by the well-trained expert before being diagnosed by the physician. Our research is to use the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in sleep data scoring, particularly in respiratory events detection. Three ready-made Convolution Neural Networks (CNN); AlexNet, ResNet-50, and VGG-16, with transfer learning were applied to classify 5 overnight PSG data from Chulalongkorn hospital. Our preliminary results showed that all networks provide higher classification result in European Data Format (EDF) than in the text (ASCII) formats (71% vs 54%). The ResNet-50 model structure performed better than the other two networks on both data formats. As expected, the visualized (EDF) data is better than the unconditioned (ASCII) data. Our future development is modifying learning model to increase the scoring performance from more recruited PSG data.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Signal Processing, Acoustics and Ultrasonics"

Therefore, a sensitive and affordable point-of-care sensing device is needed for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases. Herein, we demonstrated an electrochemical paper-based analytical device (ePAD) coupled with a label-free immunoassay for simultaneous determination of three important CVDs biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin I (cTnI), and procalcitonin (PCT). The ePAD was created by stacking a wax-patterned paper and a transparency film using laser-cut double-sided adhesive to define the sample inlet, three separate detection zones for each analyte, and fluidic channels that connect the inlet and detection zones. Antibodies to the target biomarkers were immobilized on graphene oxide (GO)-modified carbon electrodes stencil-printed on the ePAD. Concentrations of the CVDs biomarkers were determined by square wave voltammetry (SWV). A significant decrease in current response in a concentration-dependent manner was observed in the presence of the cardiac biomarkers while there was no observable change in current response in the absence of the biomarkers. Good linearity (R2 > 0.99), low detection limits (0.38 ng mL−1, 0.16 pg mL−1, and 0.27 pg mL−1 for CRP, cTnI, and PCT, respectively), and good reproducibility (RSD < 5 %) were achieved for the quantifications. Furthermore, the immunosensor has been applied to simultaneously detect the three biomarkers in serum samples with satisfactory results. The proposed immunosensor can be a great alternative for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases at the point-of-care.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

In a double-blind randomized controlled study, 153 infants born by elective C-section received an infant formula supplemented with either synbiotic, prebiotics, or unsupplemented from birth until 4 months old. Vaginally born infants were included as a reference group. Stool samples were collected from day 3 till week 22. Multi-omics were deployed to investigate the impact of mode of delivery and nutrition on the development of the infant gut microbiome, and uncover putative biological mechanisms underlying the role of a compromised microbiome as a risk factor for NCD. Results: As early as day 3, infants born vaginally presented a hypoxic and acidic gut environment characterized by an enrichment of strict anaerobes (Bifidobacteriaceae). Infants born by C-section presented the hallmark of a compromised microbiome driven by an enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae. This was associated with meta-omics signatures characteristic of a microbiome adapted to a more oxygen-rich gut environment, enriched with genes associated with reactive oxygen species metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and depleted in genes involved in the metabolism of milk carbohydrates. The synbiotic formula modulated expression of microbial genes involved in (oligo)saccharide metabolism, which emulates the eco-physiological gut environment observed in vaginally born infants. The resulting hypoxic and acidic milieu prevented the establishment of a compromised microbiome. Conclusions: This study deciphers the putative functional hallmarks of a compromised microbiome acquired during C-section birth, and the impact of nutrition that may counteract disturbed microbiome development.

It affects up to 20% of children and 1-3% of adults in most countries worldwide, and leads to significant treatment costs and morbidity. These guidelines are developed in accordance with evidence-based publications and expert opinions. Following simple algorithms, the guidelines aim to assist adult and pediatric physicians in the better care of patients with AD. As with other diseases, there have been several diagnosis criteria proposed over time. Nonetheless, the classical Hanifin and Rajka criterion with no pathognomonic laboratory biomarkers is still the most widely used worldwide for the diagnosis of AD. The management of AD must be considered case by case to provide suitable care for each patient. Basic therapy is focused on avoiding specific/unspecific provoking factors and hydrating skin. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments such as glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors are suggested for disease flare, and proactive therapy is best for long-term control. Other therapies, including antimicrobial agents, systemic antihistamines, systemic anti-inflammatory agents, immunotherapy, phototherapy, and psychotherapy, are reviewed in these guidelines. Crisaborole, a new topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, can be used twice daily in AD patients over three months old. Dupilumab, a biological drug for patients with moderate-to-severe AD, may be considered in patients with no improvement from other systemic treatments.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Objectives: This study tested components of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Readiness to Change, based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), to identify useful constructs for developing alcohol use interventions for youth. Methods: A sample of 825 Thai student drinkers (65% female), between the ages of 14 and 19, were recruited in Bangkok, Thailand. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test components of the TPB and Readiness to Change as predictors of intention to reduce/stop alcohol use while controlling for age, gender and alcohol use. Results: The model accounted for 58% of the variance of intentions. The TPB components accounted for a significant increase in variance beyond that explained by age, gender and alcohol use, ΔR 2 =.23, p <.001; Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) was the strongest predictor (β =.41, p <.001), followed by Attitudes (β=.13, p <.001), and Subjective Norms (β =.09, p =.002). Readiness to Change composite scores (β=.54, p <.001) were added last and accounted for a further significant increase, ΔR 2 =.24, p <.001. Conclusions: The findings suggest that interventions should assess Readiness to Change and utilize effective processes in facilitating change at each stage. Other suggestions are to improve participants’ PBC and to further examine the role of specific social norms and attitudes regarding perceived benefits and disadvantages of alcohol use.","sociology, medical","Health (social science), Medicine (miscellaneous), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Asparaginase antibody production may cause a subtherapeutic level and result in an inferior outcome. The aim of this study was to prove the efficacy of current native E.coli asparaginase-based protocol. Moreover, does subtherapeutic result appeared in small group of the trial?. Methods: A prospective study of asparaginase activity among patients who received native E.coli asparaginase 10,000 IU/m2 intramuscularly according to The Thai Pediatric Oncology Group (ThaiPOG) protocol was done. The plasma asparaginase activity was measured by the coupled enzymatic reaction. Pharmacokinetic data including peak activity (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC0-48h) being elucidated. Results: Eight patients (five males and three females), median age 9.5 years, were enrolled. The median asparaginase activity of seven cases who were eligible for calculation reached Tmax within 24 hours (range 6-48 hours) with mean±SD of Cmax 3.60±0.34 (range 3.02-4.11) IU/ml. Mean±SD of AUC0-48h is 143.23±36.94 IU.h/mL (range 71.07 – 180.12 IU.h/mL). The post-48-hour activity showed a mean±SD of 3.19±0.24 IU/ml (range 2.77-3.51 IU/ml) which implied an adequacy of activity over 48 hours and proper for the 12-day period. One relapsed ALL patient showed an extremely low AUC of asparaginase activity which coincided with urticaria after asparaginase injection. Subsequently, the asparaginase antibody was demonstrated in this patient. Conclusion: Native E. coli asparaginase-based protocol provides a compelling pharmacokinetic effect. Asparaginase activity and/or antibody testing is recommended for all cases especially in a relapsed patient, history of high accumulative dose of asparaginase or suspected allergic reaction. Patients with low asparaginase activity or allergy may benefit from switching to an alternative form of asparaginase to maintain treatment efficacy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

From a previous report, silk fibroin (SF) has been used as a bio-material for tissue engineering due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non‐toxicity and robust mechanical properties which provide a potential as material for 3D‐printing. In this study, SF‐based hydrogels with different formulations and SF concentrations (1–3%wt) were prepared by natural gelation (SF/self‐gelled), sodium tetradecyl sulfate‐induced (SF/STS) and dimyristoyl glycerophos-phorylglycerol‐induced (SF/DMPG). From the results, 2%wt SF‐based (2SF) hydrogels showed suitable properties for extrusion, such as storage modulus, shear‐thinning behavior and degree of structure recovery. The 4‐layer box structure of all 2SF‐based hydrogel formulations could be printed without structural collapse. In addition, the mechanical stability of printed structures after three-step post‐treatment was investigated. The printed structure of 2SF/STS and 2SF/DMPG hydrogels exhibited high stability with high degree of structure recovery as 70.4% and 53.7%, respectively, compared to 2SF/self‐gelled construct as 38.9%. The 2SF/STS and 2SF/DMPG hydrogels showed a great potential to use as material for 3D‐printing due to its rheological properties, printability and structure stability.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Neural network analysis showed that (a) aberrations in recall was the most important feature of aMCI versus HC with impairments in language and orientation being the second and third most important features and (b) aberrations in visuospatial skills and executive functions were the most important features of AD versus aMCI and that impairments in recall, language, and orientation but not attention, concentration, and working memory, further discriminated AD from aMCI. Conclusions: The MoCA-Thai is an appropriate cognitive assessment tool to be used in the Thai population for the diagnosis of aMCI and AD.","medical, neuroscience","Geriatrics and Gerontology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
Insights into the phylogeny and transcriptional response of serine proteases in a halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418,"Patipong T., Kageyama H., Waditee-Sirisattha R.",2021-01-01,"Adaptation, Physiological, Cyanobacteria, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Phylogeny, Salt Stress, Salt-Tolerant Plants, Serine Proteases, Synechococcus, Transcriptional Activation, freshwater cyanobacterium, Halothece, Halotolerant cyanobacterium, salt stress, serine protease, Synechococcus","Serine proteases are a class of versatile proteolytic enzymes. They are necessary for protein catabolism, intracellular amino acid turnover, and regulation of proteins involved in diverse molecular and cellular processes across taxa. In this study, bioinformatic analyses revealed a significantly large number of serine proteases in the halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece 7418) compared to the model freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (hereafter referred to as S. elongatus 7942). The cyanobacterial serine proteases are likely derived from different linages since no conserved motifs were detected. The presence of highly diverse serine proteases in Halothece 7418 implicated an evolutionary-mediated modification of several proteases, which may play numerous physiological roles. We also examined the gene expression patterns of 34 serine protease encoding genes in Halothece 7418 exposed to salt stress. Our results revealed that several serine protease genes were drastically up–regulated under salt with high concentration but remained unchanged under salt with low concentration. All four clp genes (H1996, H1997, H0950, and H3375) and H3553 gene (which encodes a putative HtrA protease) were significantly induced upon salt stress. These responses support the roles of the housekeeping pathways in both the degradation of damaged proteins induced by salt stress and regulation of proteins involved in the molecular recovery from salt stress. Since serine proteases share several biochemical features and physiological functions, the results from this study provide an insight into diversification of serine proteases in cyanobacteria. Further, these results will increase our understanding of several mechanisms at the subcellular level.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science

Materials and methods: This study was a secondary analysis of a single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted in xerostomic post-radiotherapy head and neck cancer patients. Candida colonization, stimulated salivary flow rate (SSFR), saliva pH, and buffering capacity (BC) were measured at 0, 1, and 2 months after each intervention. Candida colonization was quantified by colony counts and species identified by Candida Chromagar, polymerase chain reaction, and API 20C AUX system. Statistical significance level was 0.05. Results: A total of 56 participants in OMJ (N = 30) and GC (N = 26) groups completed the study. OMJ significantly increased saliva pH (p = 0.042) and BC (p = 0.013) after 1-month use, while GC only improved saliva pH (p = 0.027). Both interventions tended to increase SSFR but only GC had a significant increase at 2 months (p = 0.015). GC and OMJ significantly decreased the number of Candida species at 1 and 2 months, respectively. Both groups tended to reduce Candida counts but not significant. Conclusions: Both OMJ and GC saliva gels could improve saliva pH and decrease the number of Candida species. OMJ is superior to GC in its buffering capacity, while GC may better improve salivary flow rate. Long-term and large-scale study is warranted to test the efficacy of artificial saliva in oral health improvement. Clinical relevance: OMJ and GC gel could decrease the number of Candida species and improve saliva properties in post-radiation xerostomic patients.

The OPL-CLEAs with the highest immobilization yield (74.8% ± 8.9%) were prepared using 40 g/100 mL ammonium sulfate, 15 U/mL OPL, and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in a 4 h cross-linking reaction. Compared with those of the free enzyme, the obtained OPL-CLEAs had a broader pH range for catalysis (pH 3–12) and displayed a higher optimum temperature. Moreover, the stability of OPL was significantly improved after immobilization, indicated by an increase in melting temperature and operational duration. Product analysis showed that the OPL-CLEAs could synthesize a similar LFOS profile as free enzymes, with a yield of up to 51%. Additionally, OPL-CLEAs could retain more than 50% of the initial activity after six cycles of reuse. Finally, the potential application of OPL-CLEAs in fruit juices was demonstrated by transforming up to 65%–75% of total sucrose in moderately acidic fruit juices. This study suggests the high potential for application of OPL-CLEAs in food industries.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

The endocannabinoidome in neuropsychiatry: Opportunities and potential risks,"Morris G., Walder K., Kloiber S., Amminger P., Berk M., Bortolasci C.C., Maes M., Puri B.K., Carvalho A.F.",2021-08-01,"Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Brain, Central Nervous System Agents, Endocannabinoids, Humans, Memory, Mental Disorders, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neuroinflammatory Diseases, Neuronal Plasticity, Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1, Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2, Synaptic Transmission, Affective disorders, Bipolar disorder, Depression, Endocannabinoid receptors, Neuro-immune, Neurodegeneration, Neuroscience, Neurotoxicity, Oxidative stress, Psychiatry, Schizophrenia","The endocannabinoid system (ECS) comprises two cognate endocannabinoid receptors referred to as CB1R and CB2R. ECS dysregulation is apparent in neurodegenerative/neuro-psychiatric disorders including but not limited to schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and potentially bipolar disorder. The aim of this paper is to review mechanisms whereby both receptors may interact with neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways, which play a pathophysiological role in these disorders. CB1R is located in the presynaptic terminals of GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons where it regulates the retrograde suppression of neurotransmission. CB1R plays a key role in long-term depression, and, to a lesser extent, long-term potentiation, thereby modulating synaptic transmission and mediating learning and memory. Optimal CB1R activity plays an essential neuroprotective role by providing a defense against the development of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, which is achieved, at least in part, by impeding AMPA-mediated increase in intracellular calcium overload and oxidative stress. Moreover, CB1R activity enables optimal neuron-glial communication and the function of the neurovascular unit. CB2R receptors are detected in peripheral immune cells and also in central nervous system regions including the striatum, basal ganglia, frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala as well as the ventral tegmental area. CB2R upregulation inhibits the presynaptic release of glutamate in several brain regions. CB2R activation also decreases neuroinflammation partly by mediating the transition from a predominantly neurotoxic “M1” microglial phenotype to a more neuroprotective “M2” phenotype. CB1R and CB2R are thus novel drug targets for the treatment of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative disorders including schizophrenia and affective disorders.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise timing using an individualized approach on PPG in overweight or obese young men. Methods: Twenty men [age: 23.0 ± 4.3 y; BMI (kg/m2): 27.4 ± 2.8] each completed three 240-min trials in a randomized order separated by 6-14 d: 1) sitting (SIT), 2) walking initiated at each participant's PPG-peak time (PPGP) (iP), and 3) walking initiated 20 min before the PPGP (20iP). For each participant, PPGP was predetermined using continuous glucose monitoring. Walking was performed at 50% maximal oxygen consumption for 30 min. Venous blood was collected at 15- and 30-min intervals for 0-120 min and 120-240 min, respectively. The primary outcome was plasma PPG. Generalized estimating equations were used for comparison between trials. Results: Compared with SIT, the 4-h incremental AUCs (iAUCs) for plasma PPG (-0.6 mmol · L-1 · h; P = 0.047) and insulin (-28.7%, P < 0.001) were reduced in 20iP only, and C-peptide concentrations were lower after iP (-14.9%, P = 0.001) and 20iP (-28.7%, P < 0.001). Plasma insulin (-11.1%, P = 0.006) and C-peptide (-8.3%, P = 0.012) were lower due to the 20iP compared with iP treatment. Finally, PPG reductions due to iP and 20iP occurred only in men with a BMI > 27.5 kg/m2 (iP, -11.2%; 20iP, -14.7%; P = 0.047) and higher glucose iAUC values during SIT (iP, -25.5%; 20iP, -25.7%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Walking initiated 20 min before PPGP lowered PPG and plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations in young men with overweight or obesity, in particular in those with high BMI or glucose iAUC values during SIT; it also lowered plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations more effectively than did exercise initiated at PPGP.

Patient 1 harbored the novel compound heterozygous variants, c.257T>G (p.Val86Gly) and c.400G>A (p.Val134Met), whereas patient 2 possessed the homozygous variant, c.400G>A (p.Val134Met), in PYCR2. Haplotype analysis revealed that the two families' members shared a 2.3 Mb region covering the c.400G>A variant, indicating a common ancestry. The variant was estimated to age 1450 years ago. Since the c.400G>A was detected in three out of four mutant alleles and with a common ancestry, this variant might be common in Thai patients. We also reviewed the phenotype and genotype of all 35 previously reported PYCR2 patients and found that majorities of cases were homozygous with a consanguineous family history, except patient 1 and another reported case who were compound heterozygous. All patients had microcephaly and developmental delay. Hypotonia and peripheral spasticity were common. Hypomyelination or delayed myelination was a typical radiographic feature. Here, we report the first two Thai patients with HLD10 with the novel PYCR2 variants expanding the genotypic spectrum and suggest that the c.400G>A might be a common mutation in Thai patients.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

Methods: Adult germ-free mice were treated with sterile media, live Bifidobacterium dentium, heat-killed B dentium, or live Bacteroides ovatus. Mouse and human enteroids were used to assess the effects of B dentium metabolites on 5-HT release from enterochromaffin cells. In vitro and in vivo short-chain fatty acids and 5-HT levels were assessed by mass spectrometry. Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase, short-chain fatty acid receptor free fatty acid receptor 2, 5-HT receptors, and the 5-HT re-uptake transporter (serotonin transporter) were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. RNA in situ hybridization assessed 5-HT–receptor expression in the brain, and 5-HT–receptor–dependent behavior was evaluated using the marble burying test. Results: B dentium mono-associated mice showed increased fecal acetate. This finding corresponded with increased intestinal 5-HT concentrations and increased expression of 5-HT receptors 2a, 4, and serotonin transporter. These effects were absent in B ovatus-treated mice. Application of acetate and B dentium–secreted products stimulated 5-HT release in mouse and human enteroids. In situ hybridization of brain tissue also showed significantly increased hippocampal expression of 5-HT–receptor 2a in B dentium–treated mice relative to germ-free controls. Functionally, B dentium colonization normalized species-typical repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors previously shown to be linked to 5-HT–receptor 2a.

Although this disease is generally benign and self-limiting, distinguishing it from other diseases that cause lymphadenopathy (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, and infectious diseases) is challenging. A lymph node biopsy is a definitive diagnostic technique for KFD and only requires skillful pathologists. There are no specific symptoms or laboratory tests for KFD, and more than 50% of KFD patients have suffered from being misdiagnosed with lymphoma, which leads to improper treatment. In this study, lymph node tissue samples from KFD patients were used to reveal their exomes and transcriptomes using a high-throughput nucleotide sequencer. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as candidate KFD markers and were compared with a healthy lymph node exome dataset. The mutation of these genes caused disruptive impact in the proteins. Several SNPs associated with KFD involve genes related to human cancers, olfaction, and osteoblast differentiation. According to the transcriptome data, there were 238 up-regulated and 1,519 down-regulated genes. RANBP2-like and ribosomal protein L13 were the most up-regulated and down-regulated genes in KFD patients, respectively. The altered gene expression involved in the human immune system, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription. A comparison of KFD and healthy datasets of exomes and transcriptomes may allow further insights into the KFD phenotype. The results may also facilitate future KFD diagnosis and treatment.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

Resistance is worst in the Greater Mekong subregion. Monitoring genetic markers of resistance can help to guide antimalarial therapy. Markers of resistance to artemisinins (PfKelch mutations), mefloquine (amplification of P. falciparum multidrug resistance-1 [PfMDR1]), and piperaquine (PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification and specific P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter [PfCRT] mutations) were assessed in 6,722 P. falciparum samples from Vietnam, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar between 2007 and 2019. Against a high background prevalence of PfKelch mutations, PfMDR1 and PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification closely followed regional drug pressures over time. PfPlasmepsin2/3 amplification preceded piperaquine resistance- associated PfCRT mutations in Cambodia and reached a peak prevalence of 23/28 (82%) in 2015. This declined to 57/156 (38%) after first-line treatment was changed from dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine to artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) between 2014 and 2017. The frequency of PfMDR1 amplification increased from 0/293 (0%) between 2012 and 2017 to 12/156 (8%) in 2019. Amplification of PfMDR1 and PfPlasmepsin2/3 in the same parasites was extremely rare (4/6,722 [0.06%]) and was dispersed over time. The mechanisms conferring mefloquine and piperaquine resistance may be counterbalancing. This supports the development of ASMQ plus piperaquine as a triple artemisinin combination therapy.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
CeO2/CuO/TiO2heterojunction photocatalysts for conversion of CO2to ethanol,"Seeharaj P., Vittayakorn N., Morris J., Kim-Lohsoontorn P.",2021-09-10,"Catalyzed conversion, CO2 adsorption, Composite photocatalysts, Different mass, Electron hole recombination rate, Lower energies, Photoconversion, Photogenerated charge, CO2 photoconversion, composite, photocatalyst, titanium dioxide","An attempt to reduce CO2 emissions has led to the development of CeO2/CuO/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts for photoconversion of CO2 to useful products, e.g. ethanol. Composite photocatalysts were simply prepared by mixing TiO2 (P25) with different mass ratios of CeO2 (1 wt%) and CuO (2 or 3 wt%) by ball milling. The prepared photocatalysts had uniformly distributed CeO2 and CuO phases, throughout the TiO2 phase. The integration of CeO2 and CuO into TiO2 at 1 wt% CeO2 and 3 wt% CuO produced a composite, with a reduced band gap of 2.88 eV, allowing absorption of lower energy light and a lower electron-hole recombination rate. The 1%CeO2/3%CuO/TiO2 photocatalysts yielded ethanol at 30.5 μmol gcat-1 h-1, almost three times higher than the yield from pure TiO2. This improved CO2 conversion efficiency was due to contributions from properties of both additives: CeO2 increased light absorption, while CuO acted as an electron trap and enhanced CO2 adsorption. In addition, the heterojunction at the interfaces facilitated the photogenerated charge separation, which, in turn, increased the charge participation in the catalyzed conversion reactions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The surface silanol structure changed upon Al and tungsten loadings; however, loading of 1 wt% Al2O3 appeared to be the threshold for preserving the Si(OH)Al with isolated bridge after impregnation of 7 wt% W. The 7W/SiO2–1Al2O3 (1 wt% Al2O3) was also found to exhibit the lowest ratio of Bronsted to Lewis acid with the highest amount of Lewis acid sites and the best catalyst performances in propene self-metathesis at 550 °C in terms of both propene conversion and ethylene/butene selectivity. Despite its low tungsten dispersion, the metathesis activity was correlated well with the higher amount of tungsten carbene species, which were formed on the catalysts containing higher isolated bridge silanol and the presence of higher Lewis acid sites.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The production of OPC creates large amounts of carbon dioxide. Mortar is one of the building materials that uses cement as the main ingredient, including the use of natural sand as a fine aggregate. Therefore, to reduce the use of cement and natural materials, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum was used instead of OPC, and water treatment sludge (WTS) was used instead of fine sand to create cement mortar. This research used both materials as ingredients in the production of cement mortar and helped to reduce waste in the environment. The objective is to study the suitable ratios of FGD gypsum and WTS in the production of cement mortar. As for the binder, FGD gypsum was used instead of OPC at 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. Instead of fine sand, WTS was used at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%. The cement mortar was tested after 7 days for compressive strength. It was found that the cement mortar made with increased ratios of FGD gypsum and WTS decreased in compressive strength.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Pilot hole preparation through the cortical bone is considered beneficial to avoid such microdamage, while an overly large pilot hole impairs primary stability. Hence, we used a human bone analogue to evaluate the microdamage and primary stability to estimate the optimal pilot hole size that would minimize the screw loosening risk. Ti6Al4V orthodontic miniscrews and 1.0-mm-thick synthetic cortical bone pieces were prepared. Various compressive loads were applied in indentation tests to test pieces’ surfaces, and the microdamaged areas were confirmed as stress-whitening zones. Screw insertion tests were performed in which a miniscrew was inserted into the test pieces’ pilot hole with a diameter of 0.7–1.2 mm in 0.1-mm intervals, and the stress-whitening area was measured. The insertion and removal torque were also measured to evaluate primary stability. The stress-whitening areas of the 1.0–1.2 mm pilot hole diameter groups were significantly smaller than those of the other groups (p < 0.05), whereas the 0.9 and 1.0 mm pilot hole diameter groups showed higher primary stability than other groups. In conclusion, the bone analogue could be utilized to evaluate microdamage in cortical bones and the primary stability of miniscrews.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

A typical air electrode fabricated using conductive carbon and a polymeric binder suffers rapid degradation during charging, stemming from oxygen bubbles erosion and carbon corrosion. This work presents a durable air electrode having a self-supported sulfur-doped manganese oxides (MnOx-S) electrocatalyst prepared through hydrothermal process followed by ambient temperature sulfurization. Upon sulfurization, MnO2 nanoflakes are transformed into MnOx-S having a heterostructure of Mn3O4, MnO2 and MnSx. MnOx-S provided superior electrochemical properties for both oxygen reduction reaction (Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec) and oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slope of 80 mV/dec). Self-supported electrodes using MnOx-S and MnO2 electrocatalysts were scrutinized in a bi-electrode rechargeable ZAB having a stagnant electrolyte. In the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode, both significant discharge peak power density (74 mW/cm2 at 135 mA/cm2) as well as low voltage difference between charge and discharge processes (0.75 V) were observed. In addition, for charge-discharge cycling at 20 mA/cm2, the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode achieved stable cycling through 2000 cycles without apparent degradation. The air electrode having the self-supported MnOx-S paves the way for a more durable and higher performance favoring practical application for rechargeable ZABs.","corrosion, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Obtaining maximum biomass and fatty acid production was a prerequisite. Three bioreactor designs were used: stirred tank bioreactor (STB), bubble bioreactor (BB) and internal loop airlift bioreactor (ILAB). The bioreactors were evaluated for their influence on oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa), using various spargers, mixing speed, and aeration rates. Biomass and DHA production from STB, BB, ILAB were then compared with an incubator shaker, using batch culture experiments. Results showed that a bundle of eight super-fine pore air stones was the best type of aeration sparger for all three bioreactors. Optimal culture conditions in STB were 600 rpm agitation speed and 2 vvm aeration rate, while 2 vvm and 1.5 vvm aeration provided highest biomass productivity in BB and ILAB, respectively. Antifoam agent was needed for all reactor types in order to reduce excessive foaming. Results indicated that with optimized conditions, these bioreactors are capable of thraustochytrid cultivation with a similar efficiency as cultivation using a rotary shaker. STB had the highest kLa and provided the highest biomass of 43.05 ± 0.35 g/L at 48 h. BB was simple in design, had low operating costs and was easy to build, but yielded the lowest biomass (27.50 ± 1.56 g/L).

Suppose that k denotes the maximum number of input edge pairs such that a particular node can be in. Inspired by experimental results, the first case is for when k is not large. While there is a simple polynomial-time algorithm for the problem when k is one, we show that the problem is NP-hard when k is greater than one. We also devise an efficient O(k)-approximation algorithm for the problem. For the second case, every pair of nodes in the same partition of the input bipartite graph are labeled with one of χ colors. We want to match, between the two partitions, a pair of nodes to a pair of nodes with the same color.

Mean-level differences in optimism were computed along with their relationships with individual and country-level variables. Results: Worldwide, mean optimism levels were above the midpoint of the scale. Perhaps surprisingly, country-level optimism was negatively related to gross domestic product per capita, population density, and democratic norms and positively related to income inequality and perceived corruption. However, country-level optimism was positively related to projected economic improvement. Individual-level optimism was positively related to individual well-being within every country, although this relationship was less strong in countries with challenging economic and social circumstances.

The CSglu beads in frozen dried form showed highly adsorption capacity (714.29 mg.g−1) for malachite green (MG) but they are not favorable for indigo carmine (IND). In order to probe the atomistic-level detail between these two dyes and CSglu, molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) have been applied to determine detailed analysis of binding site of the complexes. MG is more preferable to bind with CSglu than IND due to its complementary of the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) to the CSglu surface.

Methods: Radiation dose measurements were performed for a commercially available dental SCBCT. Scans were obtained at different exposure times and fields of view (FOV), both for non-spectral (25×18 cm, 14×18 cm, 14×12 cm, 9×9 cm, 6×6 cm) and spectral modes (14×18 cm, 14×12 cm, 9×9 cm, 6×6 cm) with the tube voltage alternating between 80 and 110 kV for spectral mode, and fixed at 110 kV for non-spectral mode. An ion chamber was used for air kerma and dose area product (DAP) measurements. The effective dose was estimated based on the mAs using previously published logarithmic curves for CBCT units with a similar X-ray spectrum. Results: The adult effective dose, in non-spectral mode, was 44-269 µSv for small FOVs, 131-336 µSv for the medium FOV, and 163-476 µSv for the large FOV. In spectral mode, the estimated adult effective doses were 96-206 µSv for small, 299 µSv for medium and 372 µSv for large FOV protocols. Paediatric effective doses were estimated to be 75% higher than corresponding adult doses. Conclusion: SCBCT showed comparable doses with other CBCT devices, but DAP values were generally above currently published DRLs. Spectral imaging might allow for artefact reduction at comparable dose levels, which should be assessed in further image quality studies at both a technical and diagnostic levels.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

Sustainability of the family based longterm care model is challenged by the chronic burden on family caregivers and by smaller family sizes. We aimed to introduce a new service model, Community Integrated Intermediary Care (CIIC), TCTR20190412004, including free of charge intermediary care services at CIIC centers in the local community, to help older adults whose caregivers are temporarily unable to sustain care at home. Since Thai society upholds values of gratefulness, it is better to estimate willingness to use such an intermediary care service first, before introducing the service. Methods: A total of 867 pairs of senior citizens and their family caregivers were interviewed with structured-questionnaires in 2019. Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression were applied to determine the predictors of family caregivers’ willingness to use the CIIC service, guided by Anderson’s model of health services use. Results: About 26.8% of elderly participants and 24.0% of family caregivers were willing to use an intermediary care service. The family caregiver determinants of predisposing factors (kinship: spouse caregivers, other relatives, maid or friends; job types: own business and private company staff), enabling factors (original community residents and monthly income ≤9000 baht), and need factors (caregiver burden total scores ≥24, taking leave for caregiving, and having diabetes), were found to be significantly associated with willingness to use the CIIC service. Conclusions: The baseline survey data noted that caregivers’ sociodemographic factors and burden determined their willingness to use the intermediary care service, although the dependency of care recipients was low in this study. This, nonetheless, indicated that there is need for a backup respite care to strengthen current family based long-term aging care in Thailand.","genergyal, public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

To suppress As contamination to the nearby environments, As immobilization by Ca–Fe–AsO4 compounds is considered one of the most promising techniques; however, this technique is only applicable when As concentration is high enough (>1 g/L). To immobilize As from wastewater with low As concentration (~10 mg/L), this study investigated a two-step process consisting of concentration of dilute As solution by sorption/desorption using schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)8–2x(SO4)x; where (1 ≤ x ≤ 1.75)) and formation of Ca–Fe–AsO4 compounds. Arsenic sorption tests indicated that As(V) was well adsorbed onto schwertmannite at pH 3 (Qmax = 116.3 mg/g), but its sorption was limited at pH 13 (Qmax = 16.1 mg/g). A dilute As solution (~11.2 mg/L As) could be concentrated by sorption with large volume of dilute As solution at pH 3 followed by desorption with small volume of eluent of which pH was 13. The formation of Ca–Fe–AsO4 compounds from As concentrate solution (2 g/L As(V)) was strongly affected by temperature and pH. At low temperature (25–50 °C), amorphous ferric arsenate was formed, while at high temperature (95 °C), yukonite (Ca2Fe3–5(AsO4)3(OH)4–10·xH2O; where x = 2–11) and johnbaumite (Ca5(AsO4)3OH) were formed at pH 8 and 12, respectively.

Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Consequently, this study investigated the effects of seasonal variation on the biodegradation rates of low (150 mg kg−1), moderate (600 mg kg−1), and high (1200 mg kg−1) phenanthrene-contaminated mangrove sediments using a microcosm study and identified potential key phenanthrene-degrading bacteria using high throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene and quantitative-PCR of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHDα) genes. The biodegradation rates of phenanthrene in all treatments were higher in the wet-season sediments (11.58, 14.51, and 8.94 mg kg−1 sediment day−1) than in the dry-season sediments (3.51, 12.56, and 5.91 mg kg−1 sediment day−1) possibly due to higher nutrient accumulation caused by rainfall and higher diversity of potential phenanthrene-degrading bacteria. The results suggested that the mangrove sediment microbiome significantly clustered according to season. Although Gram-negative phenanthrene-degrading bacteria (i.e., Anaerolineaceae, Marinobacter, and Rhodobacteraceae) played a key role in both dry and wet seasons, distinctly different phenanthrene-degrading bacterial taxa were observed in each season. Halomonas and Porticoccus were potentially responsible for the degradation of phenanthrene in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The knowledge gained from this study contributes to the development of effective and rationally designed microbiome innovations for oil removal.","fluidex; related topics, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This study examined PD use and practice patterns across the globe. Study Design: A cross-sectional survey. Setting & Participants: Stakeholders including clinicians, policy makers, and patient representatives in 182 countries convened by the International Society of Nephrology between July and September 2018. Outcomes: PD use, availability, accessibility, affordability, delivery, and reporting of quality outcome measures. Analytical Approach: Descriptive statistics. Results: Responses were received from 88% (n = 160) of countries and there were 313 participants (257 nephrologists [82%], 22 non-nephrologist physicians [7%], 6 other health professionals [2%], 17 administrators/policy makers/civil servants [5%], and 11 others [4%]). 85% (n = 156) of countries responded to questions about PD. Median PD use was 38.1 per million population. PD was not available in 30 of the 156 (19%) countries responding to PD-related questions, particularly in countries in Africa (20/41) and low-income countries (15/22). In 69% of countries, PD was the initial dialysis modality for ≤10% of patients with newly diagnosed kidney failure. Patients receiving PD were expected to pay 1% to 25% of treatment costs, and higher (>75%) copayments (out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients) were more common in South Asia and low-income countries. Average exchange volumes were adequate (defined as 3-4 exchanges per day or the equivalent for automated PD) in 72% of countries. PD quality outcome monitoring and reporting were variable. Most countries did not measure patient-reported PD outcomes. Limitations: Low responses from policy makers; limited ability to provide more in-depth explanations underpinning outcomes from each country due to lack of granular data; lack of objective data. Conclusions: Large inter- and intraregional disparities exist in PD availability, accessibility, affordability, delivery, and reporting of quality outcome measures around the world, with the greatest gaps observed in Africa and South Asia.",medical,Nephrology

The reasons for chronic facial pain vary, and currently, the methods of treating chronic facial pain are expensive, invasive, and, based on current findings, ineffective. The purpose of this study is to develop and test an effective, cost-friendly method to treat patients with chronic facial pain. This study will examine the effectiveness of a novel treatment of a patient suffering from trigeminal neuralgia. Case presentation: A 70-year-old Thai female visited the advanced general dentistry clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. She was suffering from facial pain on her left side and was diagnosed by a physician as having trigeminal neuralgia. She experienced a sharp shooting pain that was triggered by facial movements such as chewing, speaking, or brushing teeth, and touching certain areas of her face. Bouts of pain lasted from a few seconds to several minutes, and episodes of several attacks lasted days, weeks, months, or longer prior to her visit to the advanced general dentistry clinic at Mahidol University. Physician designed an occlusal equilibration appliance for treating the patient by inserting the appliance in the mouth for dental occlusal equilibration (deprogram). The patient used this appliance by placing it in the mouth continuously (day and night) and removed it only when eating. After using the appliance for 2 weeks, the patient appeared to feel and look better prior to taking medication and was able to eat normally. The patient was pain free after treatment for a duration of 9 months. However, after 9 months, the pain reoccurred and manifested itself. Conclusion: This novel treatment of recurrent facial pain showed an improvement of the patient’s chronic facial pain and serves as evidence to being a novel method for treating those suffering from trigeminal neuralgia.",medical,Medicine (all)

Then, expression of immunometabolism-associated genes and BAM15, a mitochondrial uncoupling agent, was explored in a proinflammatory model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Accordingly, the decreased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins was demonstrated by transcriptomic analysis on metabolism-associated genes in macrophages (RAW246.7) and by polymerase chain reaction in LPS-stimulated RAW246.7 and hepatocytes (Hepa 1-6). Pretreatment with BAM15 at 24 h prior to LPS in macrophages attenuated supernatant inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10), downregulated genes of proinflammatory M1 polarization (iNOS and IL-1β), upregulated anti-inflammatory M2 polarization (Arg1 and FIZZ), and decreased cell energy status (extracellular flux analysis and ATP production). Likewise, BAM15 decreased expression of proinflammatory genes (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and iNOS) and reduced cell energy in hepatocytes. In LPS-administered mice, BAM15 attenuated serum cytokines, organ injury (liver enzymes and serum creatinine), and tissue cytokines (livers and kidneys), in part, through the enhanced phosphorylated αAMPK, a sensor of ATP depletion with anti-inflammatory property, in the liver, and reduced inflammatory monocytes/macrophages (Ly6C +ve, CD11b +ve) in the liver as detected by Western blot and flow cytometry, respectively. In conclusion, a proof of concept for inflammation attenuation of BAM15 through metabolic interference-induced anti-inflammation on macrophages and hepatocytes was demonstrated as a new strategy of anti-inflammation in sepsis.",medical,Immunology and Allergy

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of short peptides ubiquitously found in all living forms, including plants, insects, mammals, microorganisms and play a significant role in host innate immune system. These peptides are considered as promising candidates to treat microbial infections due to its distinct advantages over conventional antibiotics. Given their potent broad spectrum of antimicrobial action, several AMPs are currently being evaluated in preclinical/clinical trials. However, large quantities of highly purified AMPs are vital for basic research and clinical settings which is still a major bottleneck hindering its application. This can be overcome by genetic engineering approaches to produce sufficient amount of diverse peptides in heterologous host systems. Recently plants are considered as potential alternatives to conventional protein production systems such as microbial and mammalian platforms due to their unique advantages such as rapidity, scalability and safety. In addition, AMPs can also be utilized for development of novel approaches for plant protection thereby increasing the crop yield. Hence, in order to provide a spotlight for the expression of AMP in plants for both clinical or agricultural use, the present review presents the importance of AMPs and efforts aimed at producing recombinant AMPs in plants for molecular farming and plant protection so far.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The molecular target of gigantol from Dendrobium draconis in suppressing cancer metastasis is largely unknown. Materials and Methods: Proteins affected by gigantol treatment were subjected to proteomic and bioinformatic analysis. Protein–Protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and hub gene were used to enrich the dominant pathways. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to validate the effect of gigantol on the target protein and signaling. Results: Gigantol down-regulates 41 adhesion proteins and 39-migratory proteins, while it up-regulates 30 adhesion-related proteins and 22 proteins controlling cell migration. The key components of our constructed PPI network comprised 41 proteins of cell adhesion enriched in 40 nodes with 25 edges, 39 proteins of cell migration enriched in 39 nodes with 76 edges in down-regulated proteins, 30 proteins of cell adhesion enriched in 30 nodes with 21 edges, and 22 proteins of cell migration enriched in 22 nodes with 22 edges in up-regulated protein. c-Met was identified as a central protein of the PPI network in the largest degree. KEGG mapper further suggested that c-Met, PI3K, and AKT were the regulatory proteins affected by gigantol. To confirm, the effects of gigantol on c-Met, the p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT, and AKT proteins were investigated by western blotting and the results showed a consistent effect of gigantol in the suppression of the c-Met/PI3K/AKT signal. Next, immunofluorescence showed a dramatic decrease in c-Met, PI3K and AKT activation in response to gigantol. Conclusion: c-Met is an important target of gigantol treatment in lung cancer cells.

On/Off control is mostly developed using rule-based distance triggering that turns on/off the system when occupants enter/exit a specific perimeter. This article proposes a plug-And-play HVAC control system with an adaptive cloud machine learning (ML) framework that utilizes room current ambient conditions together with the historical adjustment log to automatically adjust room temperature according to the user comfort using Support Vector Classification (SVC). This system can also turn on air conditioner automatically using predictive control which implements GPS location and the occupant's data on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Furthermore, cloud deployment can solve problems in processing power and storage of an end device, also provide scalability for future development.

It is very tough to separate all those diverse groups of contaminants using a single process or single material. Rather a sustainable and environment friendly processes should be adapted to restrict the secondary pollution generation. Nanoclay and its nanocomposites are one of the most used adsorbents that have been modified and used for the separation of almost all types of pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals, fluoride, nitrate, ammonia, emerging pollutants and bacteria. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to exploit and relatively maintenance-free. Thus, recent research bloomed for developing suitable adsorbents, including clay nanocomposites. The advantages and drawbacks of all the clay nanocomposites-based processes have been discussed critically in this article. Nano-clays or other nanoparticles incorporated synthetic and natural polymers-based clay nanocomposites were synthesized, and it was found that they can remove dyes in the range between 48 mg/g and 1994 mg/g. Similarly, they separate a diverse group of heavy metal ions, including As, Cu, Co, Pd, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Hg, in the range of 0.073–1667 mg/g. The clay nanocomposites also showed fluoride removal efficacy in the range of 0.134–23 mg/g. They are also useful for the separation of emerging pollutants like pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, trace elements, and particulate matters in the range of 0.1–651 mg/g the clay nanocomposites showed considerable nitrate, ammonia and bacteria removal efficacy too. Though it seems promising, more investigations with real wastewater and pilot-scale studies are recommended to explore large-scale wastewater treatment capabilities.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; physicsical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Poultry and poultry products are considered as major sites for Campylobacter infection in humans. The extensive uses of antibiotics mostly as growth promoters and for therapeutic purposes have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of foodborne pathogens including Campylobacter. A key tenet of this paper is the need for reviewing the previous studies conducted around the globe on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter spp. isolates in duck to better understand the sources and trends of infection. Based on published data, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in duck and duck-related samples ranged from 0% to 100% and was largely influenced by the isolation method. Among Campylobacter spp., C. jejuni was the predominant cause of campylobacteriosis, followed by C. coli. Campylobacter spp. from ducks were mostly resistant to fluoroquinolones and tetracycline and a lesser extent to gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin. Some studies showed that ducks may pose a risk for acquiring campylobacteriosis because they had genotypes quite similar to human isolates detected previously. A continued monitoring approach is needed, at national and international levels, with enhanced surveillance and reporting of trends, as well as harmonization of surveillance systems toward a one-health approach to monitoring antimicrobial resistance in animal production particularly if increased resistance rates are being demonstrated.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

An obvious metal concentration gradient in response to the intensity of urbanization was found at inter-watershed and intra-watershed scales. Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) exceedances of several metals (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and high ecological risk were primarily identified at the down streams of Chao Phraya and Thachin watersheds, where the social-economic center of the country with intensive industries is located. Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed significant correlations between studied metals and catchment land use pattern (with p < 0.0001 except for Ni and Cr). Particularly, urban land use showed remarkable effect on sedimentary Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn loads with high coefficients over 0.65. The results of cluster analysis and principal component analysis indicated the dominated urban/industrial sources for Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn, mixed natural and industrial sources for Cr and Ni, and diffuse sources for Hg and As in the watersheds, respectively.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; freshwater, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Brainwave classification for character-writing application using EMD-based GMM and KELM approaches,"Phapatanaburi K., Kokkhunthod K., Wang L., Jumphoo T., Uthansakul M., Boonmahitthisud A., Uthansakul P.",2021-01-01,"Artificial neural network classifiers, Conventional methods, Electroencephalogram signals, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Extreme learning machine, Gaussian Mixture Model, Intrinsic Mode functions, Standard measurements, Brainwave classification, Character-writing application, EMD, GMM, KELM, Score combination","A brainwave classification, which does not involve any limb movement and stimulus for character-writing applications, benefits impaired people, in terms of practical communication, because it allows users to command a device/computer directly via electroencephalogram signals. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) features along with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM)-based classifiers. For this purpose, firstly, we introduce EMD to decompose EEG signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which actually are used as the input features of the brainwave classification for the character-writing application. We hypothesize that EMD along with the appropriate IMF is quite powerful for the brainwave classification, in terms of character applications, because of the wavelet-like decomposition without any down sampling process. Secondly, by getting motivated with shallow learning classifiers, we can provide promising performance for the classification of binary classes, GMM and KELM, which are applied for the learning of features along with the brainwave classification. Lastly, we propose a new method by combining GMM and KELM to fuse the merits of different classifiers. Moreover, the proposed methods are validated by using the volunteer-independent 5-fold cross-validation and accuracy as a standard measurement. The experimental results showed that EMD with the proper IMF achieved better results than the conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) feature. Moreover, we found that the EMD feature along with the GMM/KELM-based classifier provides the average accuracy of 77.40% and 80.10%, respectively, which could perform better than the conventional methods where we use DWT along with the artificial neural network classifier in order to get the average accuracy of 80.60%. Furthermore, we obtained the improved performance by combining GMM and KELM, i.e., average accuracy of 80.60%. These outcomes exhibit the usefulness of the EMD feature combining with GMM and KELM based classifiers for the brainwave classification in terms of the Character-Writing application, which do not require any limb movement and stimulus.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, Mathematics, engineering, computer science","Biomaterials, Modeling and Simulation, Mechanics of Materials, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Since the proper management of nitrogen and suspended solids are important for nutrient utilization efficiency, their optimization was evaluated. The RAS integrated with filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter provided complete nitrification without solid accumulation. Under the optimal treatment condition for 16 d, the treated water was low in ammonia (0 mg-N/L) and high in nitrate (> 6 mg-N/L) concentrations, which was appropriate for use in the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The RAS was then incorporated with hydroponics at a 5:1 fish: plant weight ratio. Moreover, the simplified APS was compared with a typical APS system that incorporated filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter. The natural growth of nitrifying microorganisms in the simplified APS could perform complete nitrification after 20 d of operation giving low ammonia and nitrite concentrations. The nutrient removal efficiency of the simplified APS resembled the typical system. During the aquaponics, the hydroponic unit in the aquaculture system was sufficient to control the nutrient concentrations within the appropriate levels for fish cultivation, i.e. nitrate (< 20 mg-N/L) and phosphate (< 3 mg-P/L).",environmental,Environmental Engineering

An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in β2-adrenergic agonist drug. Case presentation: A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission.

Even though the treatments for asthma have been highly developed, there are a high number of patients with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled, particularly those with nocturnal asthma in which symptoms occur during the night and interfere with sleep. Moreover, nocturnal asthma also causes poor sleep quality, impairs quality of life, and deteriorates daytime cognitive performance. Overall, the prevalence of nocturnal asthma is estimated to be between 44-61% of patients with asthma. Pathophysiological mechanisms of nocturnal asthma included circadian rhythmicity and diurnal variation of inflammatory process, beta 2-adrenergic receptor polymorphism, and polluted environments. Furthermore, co-morbid conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease, may contribute to nocturnal asthma. In addition to optimal medical treatment, management of co-morbid conditions should be considered. Utilization of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to significantly improve nocturnal symptoms in patients with co-existing obstructive sleep apnea as supported by numerous studies, but improvement of pulmonary function is still controversial. In addition, several studies also demonstrate that use of proton-pump inhibitors may assist those patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease resulting in an increase of peak expiration flow rate and/or FEV1.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

This cadaveric study identified the location and thickness of the bone at the central patella ridge for bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) harvesting. Materials and methods: Fifty cadaveric knees were assessed. First, the morphology, length, width, and location of the central patellar ridge were recorded. Then, we transversely cut the patella 25 mm from the lower pole and measured the thickness of the anterior cortex, cancellous bone, and cartilage from both the mid-patella and the central ridge location. Finally, the depth of the remaining cancellous bone at the mid-patella was compared to the bone at the central ridge. Results: The location of the central-patellar ridge deviated medially from the mid-patella in 46 samples with an average distance of 4.36 ± 1 mm. Only 4 samples deviated laterally. The mean patella length was 41.19 ± 4.73 mm, and the width was 42.8 ± 5.25 mm. After a transverse cut, the remaining cancellous bone was significantly thicker at the central ridge compared to the bone at the mid-patella. Conclusions: Most of the central patellar ridge deviated medially, approximately 4 mm from the mid-patella.

As epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known for potentiating metastasis, this study aimed to elucidate the effect of ovalitenone on the suppression of EMT and metastasis-related behaviors, including cell movement and growth under detached conditions, and cancer stem cells (CSCs), of lung cancer cells. Methods: Cell viability and cell proliferation were determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazo-liumbromide (MTT) and colony formation assays. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed using a wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber assay, respectively. Anchorage-independent cell growth was determined. Cell protrusions (filopodia) were detected by phalloidin-rhodamine staining. Cancer stem cell phenotypes were assessed by spheroid formation. The proteins involved in cell migration and EMT were evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Results: Ovalitenone was used at concentrations of 0–200 µM. While it caused no cytotoxic effects on lung cancer H460 and A549 cells, ovalitenone significantly suppressed anchorage-independent growth, CSC-like phenotypes, colony formation, and the ability of the cancer to migrate and invade cells. The anti-migration activity was confirmed by the reduction of filopodia in the cells treated with ovalitenone. Interestingly, we found that ovalitenone could significantly decrease the levels of N-cadherin, snail, and slug, while it increased E-cadherin, indicating EMT suppression. Additionally, the regulatory signaling of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (AKT), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) was suppressed by ovalitenone. Conclusions: The results suggest that ovalitenone suppresses EMT via suppression of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, ovalitenone exhibited potential for the suppression of CSC phenotypes. These data reveal the anti-metastasis potential of the compound and support the development of ovalitenone treatment for lung cancer therapy.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

However, the practical realization of the alloy by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) - the two main growth technologies - is fraught with difficulties. Here, using standard solid-source MBE, GaAsPBi films, and GaAsPBi/GaAs multiple quantum wells (MQW) have been grown lattice-matched to (001) GaAs. The structural integrity of the films/MQW is investigated and confirmed by various in- and ex-situ diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. All GaAsPBi structures - films and MQWs - are luminescent at room temperature. Photoluminescence shows that all the samples exhibit an S-shape temperature dependency, indicating strong localizations. Of most significance to practical applications is the observation that the emission from GaAsPBi MQWs is more efficient than their non-quantum well (QW) counterparts (up to 30× at room temperature). These results confirm the long-known benefits of carrier confinements by QWs, demonstrated here for the first time in the GaAsPBi-based system despite the challenge of the crystal growths.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

However, the role of BAFF in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) undergoing antiviral therapy is unknown. Methods: Patients with HBeAg-positive CHB treated with 48-week pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN; n = 42), who had stored plasma samples during treatment were recruited. Serial plasma levels of BAFF and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) during therapy were measured. Results: Combined response (CR), defined as HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL plus HBsAg decline ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL at 24 weeks post-treatment, was achieved in 11 (26.2%) patients. BAFF levels were elevated during treatment but decreased to pre-treatment levels after PEG-IFN cessation in both responders and non-responders. Low baseline BAFF (< 770 pg/ml) and high CXCL10 (≥ 320 pg/ml) levels were independently associated with CR in multivariate analysis. Baseline CXCL10/BAFF ratio of ≥ 0.45 was predictive of CR with positive and negative predictive values of 61.5 and 89.7%, respectively. Conclusions: In summary, low baseline BAFF and high CXCL10 levels were associated with treatment response to PEG-IFN. The combined measurement of these immune markers may help individualized decision-making in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB.",medical,Medicine (all)

Herein, ten kinds of transition metal (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir and Pt) were doped in Ni3S2 matrix to design TM-Ni3S2 candidates, and their catalytic activities for overall water splitting were systematically explored based on density functional theory. Our results demonstrated that doping TM atoms is an effective tactic to boost the catalytic activity of Ni3S2 matrix. Among these candidates, Mn-Ni3S2, Fe-Ni3S2, and Ru-Ni3S2 exhibit the outstanding catalytic activity for water splitting, with the much lower overpotentials being just 0.02/0.29 V, 0.11/0.29 V and 0.01/0.33 V for HER/OER, respectively, which are equivalent to or even superior to the prevailing bifunctional catalysts. Particularly, d-band center was employed to reveal the origin of OER activity. Our findings may open up new routes for the design of advanced Ni3S2-based catalysts for water splitting and realize the wide-range applications of Ni3S2-based catalysts in fields of clean and renewable energy.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"
Effect of metal ions released from orthodontic mini-implants on osteoclastogenesis,"Charoenpong H., Ritprajak P.",2021-07-01,"Dental Alloys, Dental Implants, Humans, Ions, Orthodontic Anchorage Procedures, Osteogenesis, Biocompatibility, Cytotoxicity, Metal ion, Orthodontic mini-implant, Osteoclast","Background. Orthodontic mini-implants can undergo corrosion and the release of metal ions can affect cellular behavior. Osteoclasts are involved in orthodontic tooth movement and implant stability. Osteo-clasts and their precursors can be exposed to metal ions released from orthodontic mini-implants. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the effect of metal ions released from orthodontic mini-implants on human osteoclastogenesis. Material and methods. Stainless steel and titanium alloy mini-implants were separately immersed in culture media for 14 days (days 1–14), and then moved to new media for a further 14 days (days 15–28). The concentration of the released metal ions was measured. Osteoclast precursors derived from human CD14+ monocytes were cultured in these media and in a control medium without mini-implant immer-sion. Cell viability, the number of osteoclasts and the area of resorption were investigated. Results. A higher concentration of metal ions was detected during the first 14 days as compared to the control. The concentration of these metal ions then declined after this period. The viability of osteoclast precursors was not affected by the released metal ions. There was a significant reduction in the number of osteoclasts when cultured in the medium with the titanium alloy mini-implants immersed for days 1–14. The area of resorption was also significantly reduced in this group. The media with the titanium alloy mini-implants immersed for days 15–28 and with the stainless steel mini-implants immersed for both study periods did not show statistically significant changes in the number of osteoclasts. Conclusions. Metal ions were released from orthodontic mini-implants in the early period and declined thereafter. Metal ions released from titanium mini-implants in the early period inhibited osteoclasto-genesis, while metal ions from stainless steel mini-implants had no effect on osteoclast differentiation.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Prominent cortical atrophy around left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is a classical imaging feature of LPA. This study investigated cortical thinning pattern in clinically diagnosed LPA patients using non-demented subjects as a control group. We also aimed to explore whether there was prominent thinning of other cortical area additional to the well-recognized left TPJ. Methods: Thicknesses of all cortical regions were measured from brain magnetic resonance images using an automated command on Freesurfer software. Cortical thickness of the LPA and control groups were compared by two methods: 1) using a general linear model (GLM) in SPSS software; and 2) using a vertex-by-vertex GLM, performed with Freesurfer’s QDEC interface. Results: Besides the well-recognized left TPJ, cortical regions that were significantly thinner in the LPA group by both comparison methods included left caudal middle frontal gyrus (CMFG) (p = 0.006 by SPSS, p = 0.0003 by QDEC), left rostral middle frontal gyrus (p = 0.001 by SPSS, p = 0.0001 by QDEC), left parahippocampal gyrus (p = 0.008 by SPSS, p = 0.005 by QDEC) and right CMFG (p = 0.005 by SPSS, p = 0.0001 by QDEC). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that thinning of middle frontal gyri may be an additional feature in clinically diagnosed LPA patients. Involvement of left parahippocampal gyrus may reflect the underlying neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease in majority of the LPA patients.",medical,Neurology (clinical)

Herein, we fabricated a nanohybrid ink of bacterial cellulose nanocrystal (BCNC) and UV-responsive ZnO QD via electrostatic self-assembly for improving solvent resistance and message encryption process. Under investigations on the printed areas, the nanohybrid can slightly infiltrate into the paper fibers and form a thin layer on the top of paper substrates, conferring an enhanced print permanence against wetting conditions while maintaining the daylight unobservability and its luminescent stability. The water resistance of the proposed nanohybrid ink enables developing a higher security level that the prints can be submerged in CuCl2 aqueous solutions to quench the luminescent message. The concealed message can eventually be revealed under UV light again after submerging in EDTA solution. Our ZnO QD/BCNC nanohybrid with eco-friendly nature therefore exhibits great potential as security marking ink for counterfeit protection with sustainable uses.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Our research group has studied supply-demand scheduling and operation with PV systems and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs),which are called PV-battery systems in this study. We mainly focused on those for bulk power systems in our previous studies. However,since many PV-battery systems are introduced into a distribution system,the distribution system analysis is necessary. In this paper,aggregators that operate and control consumers' resources including PV-battery systems in distribution systems are assumed. The aggregators make supply-demand schedules to gain profits by electricity purchase and selling with the aggregated consumers' resources. However,because they do not consider the network constraints,the voltages or other power flow conditions might violate the distribution network constraints. Thus,the distribution system operator (DSO) needs to check the network constraints and occasionally limit the operation of the aggregated resources. In this paper,we evaluate the supply-demand schedule and operation for the DSO and the aggregators in distribution system by numerical simulations.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization"
Tuning the sensitivity of polydiacetylene-based colorimetric sensors to UV light and cationic surfactant by co-assembling with various polymers,"Pankaew A., Traiphol N., Traiphol R.",2021-01-05,"Color transition, Colorimetric sensors, Dimethyl acrylamide, Local interactions, N-vinyl formamides, Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, UV-light irradiation, Watersoluble polymers, Nanocomposite, Polydiacetylene, Polymeric additive, Sensitvity, Sensor","This study introduces a simple approach for fine-tuning the sensitivity of polydiacetylene(PDA)-based colorimetric sensors to UV light and cationic surfactant. The PDA assemblies were prepared by co-assembling of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) monomer and 3 types of water-soluble polymers, including poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), poly(N-vinyl formamide) (PNVF) and poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMA). X-ray diffraction reveals the intercalation of these polymers with PDA bilayers. Infrared spectroscopy also observes the variation of local interactions within PDA/polymers assemblies, depending on the structure of polymeric side chain. The incorporation of these polymers strongly affects the color-transition behaviors of PDA upon exposure to UV light and cationic surfactant. The PDA/polymer assemblies show significant improvement in UV light sensitivity. The color transition upon prolonged exposure to UV light can also be controlled. The addition of PVP and PNVF chains provides the sensors that change color at relatively long UV light irradiation time. The use of PDMA, however, causes the opposite result. The same approach is utilized for preparing quantitative-colorimetric sensors of cationic surfactant. The variation of polymeric side chain or molecular weight provides the PDA/polymer assemblies that change color at different concentration of the cationic surfactant.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Bibenzyl analogue DS-1 inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and sensitizes apoptosis in lung cancer cells,"Putri H.E., Nutho B., Rungrotmongkol T., Sritularak B., Vinayanuwattikun C., Chanvorachote P.",2021-05-01,"Adult, Aged, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Bibenzyls, Cell Line, Tumor, Cisplatin, Female, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Middle Aged, Molecular Docking Simulation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2, Signal Transduction, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Bibenzyl, Chemosensitizer, DS-1, Lung cancer, MDM2, p53","Background: Lung cancer is a leading fatal malignancy due to the high incidence of treatment failure. Dysfunction of the tumor suppressor p53 contributes to cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Targeting MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, has recently attracted interest in cancer drug research as it may restore tumor suppressive function. Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of 3,4-dihydroxy-5,4′-dimethoxybibenzyl (DS-1) on targeting MDM2 and restoring p53 function in lung cancer cells. Methods: The efficacy of DS-1 alone or in combination with cisplatin in lung cancer cells was determined by MTT, nuclear staining, and annexin V/PI assay. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was determined by western blot analysis. To evaluate the role of DS-1 on the stabilization and degradation of p53, cycloheximide chasing assay and immunoprecipitation were conducted, and the active form of p53 was investigated by immunofluorescent staining assay. To confirm and demonstrate the site interaction between DS-1 and the MDM2 protein, in silico computational analysis was performed. Results: DS-1 exhibited a cytotoxic effect and sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. DS-1 caused a significant increase in the cellular level of p53 protein, while the active form of p53 (phosphorylation at Ser15) was unaltered. DS-1 treatment in combination with cisplatin could enhance activated p-p53 (Ser15) and p53 downstream signaling (Bax, Bcl-2, and Akt), leading to a higher level of apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that DS-1 decreased the p53-ubiquitin complex, a prerequisite step in p53 proteasomal degradation. Molecular docking simulation further evidenced that DS-1 interacts with MDM2 within the p53-binding domain by carbon–hydrogen bond interaction at Lys27, π–alkyl interactions at Ile37 and Leu30, and van der Waals interactions at Ile75, Val51, Val69, Phe67, Met38, Tyr43, Gly34, and Phe31. Treatment by DS-1 and cisplatin in patient-derivated primary lung cancer cells showed consistent effects by increasing cisplatin sensitivity. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that DS-1 is an MDM2 inhibitor and its underlying mechanism involves MDM2 binding and p53 induction, which may benefit the development of this compound for lung cancer treatment.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled community-living older adults (N = 5271; 51.1% females) aged ≥ 50 years (mean age = 63.2, standard deviation = 9.0) from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA), Ireland. At baseline, participants completed a handgrip assessment. Depression was defined by a score ≥ 16 in the Center of Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D) tool and anxiety was considered when participants scored ≥ 8 on the anxiety section of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Outcomes were incident and persistent depression and anxiety at two years follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were built for each outcome. Results: After controlling for age, sex, education, marital status, employment status, smoking, body mass index, number of chronic conditions, physical activity, and cognitive function, low handgrip strength indicative of dyapenia (< 30 Kg for men and < 20 Kg for women) was associated with a greater likelihood for incident depressive (OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.08–1.92) as well as for persistent depressive (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.01–2.58) and anxiety (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.20–2.14) symptoms. Conclusions: Dynapenia was associated with a higher odds of developing depressive symptoms as well as a greater likelihood to persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults. Our data suggest that interventions targeting muscle strength may prevent the onset of late-life depression and also may hold promise as novel therapeutic opportunities for depression and anxiety in later life.","Nursing, medical","Psychiatric Mental Health, Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Such integration could be beneficial for clerkship years and students’ future career. Hence, we aimed to share our process of organising an integrative teaching approach in a large class of pre-clerkship medical students and to reflect the students’ perspective toward the teaching process in this observational study. In addition, we tested effectiveness of this integrative approach compared with the traditional teaching (lecture). Methods: We organised a two-dimensional (2D)-integrative teaching for 309 students in selected topics of cardiovascular physiology of the medical curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. The first dimension of integration is the incorporation of physiology of other organ systems into the cardiovascular physiology class. The second is the integration of multiple teaching methods and strategies, including small group discussion, student presentation, wrap-up, quiz, and question-and-answer sessions. Unless opting out, students evaluated this integrative teaching by filling in a questionnaire. The summative scores were also used to determine their comprehensive understandings of the content. Results: The course evaluation showed that most students (81.9–91.2%) had positive attitudes toward all organised sessions, i.e. this teaching method helps promote their basic and applied physiology knowledge, critical thinking, information searching, presentation, and teamwork skills. In general, students at all performance levels attained higher scores in the summative exam for the 2D-integrative-class–relevant questions (74.4±16.1%) than for the lecture-pertinent questions (65.2±13.6%). Conclusions: In a large class size of pre-clerkship students, 2D-integrative teaching strategies with careful planning and preparation can be successfully implemented, based on positive attitudes and relatively high summative scores of students in this study. Hence, this comprehensive teaching could be incorporated in current medical curriculums, particularly for the complex learning topics.",sociology,Education
Variation of leaf-level gas exchange rates and leaf functional traits of dominant trees across three successional stages in a Southeast Asian tropical forest,"Tor-ngern P., Chart-asa C., Chanthorn W., Rodtassana C., Yampum S., Unawong W., Nathalang A., Brockelman W., Srinoppawan K., Chen Y., Hasselquist N.J.",2021-06-01,"Forest succession, Functional traits, Gas exchange rate, Leaf level, Leaf mass per area, Old-growth forest, Stomatal conductance, Successional stages, Tropical forest, Vapor pressure deficit, Forest succession, Functional traits, Photosynthesis, Stomatal conductance, Tropical forests","Deforestation has created heterogeneous patches of old-growth and secondary forests throughout Southeast Asia, posing challenges for understanding the hydrological and carbon cycles. In addition to changes in species composition, environmental conditions differ across successional stages which in turn can influence forest water use and productivity. Here, we investigated leaf-level area-based photosynthesis (Aarea) and stomatal conductance (gs) of 11 tree species dominating an old-growth (OF; >200 years), an intermediate (IF; ~44 years), and a young forest (YF; ~4 years) in Thailand during both the wet and dry season. Specifically, we compared Aarea and gs and assessed the sensitivity of gs to vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We also examined relationships between gas exchange parameters and key functional leaf traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and chlorophyll concentration. All three forests showed comparable Aarea and gs in the wet season, whereas significantly lower values were observed in IF during the dry season. All forest stages displayed similar sensitivity of gs to VPD. Among the leaf functional traits considered, LMA, N and P were significantly higher in YF compared to the other two successional stages. Our results suggested that forest succession may not influence gas exchange, rather, canopy development associated with forest stage produced the main effect. Furthermore, the young forest was the most active in resource acquisition with its high LMA and leaf nutrient concentrations, which could result in high photosynthetic rates. However, low soil water availability in YF possibly limit the gas exchange rates thereby making them similar to those in the old-growth forest. These findings highlight the potential effects of canopy characteristics inherent in successional forests on water and carbon exchanges between trees and the atmosphere and their sensitivity to atmospheric drought. These results call for the need for further studies to identify the main factors influencing forest productivity during secondary succession in the tropics, particularly in the Southeast Asian region where such information is lacking.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Forestry, Nature and Landscape Conservation, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

The effects of the synthesis gel composition and alkalinity on the phase formation and crystallinity of the product were investigated. All studied zeolites were evaluated for their catalytic activities in ethanol conversion reactions from 473 K to 673 K and at 1 atm. The results suggested that the formation pathways of CAN and ANA are highly dependent on the alkalinity of the synthesis solution and the type of starting material regardless of synthesis template. The use of natural MOR zeolite (MORNZ) in the synthesis can contribute to highly crystalline ANA structures comparable to the ANA products obtained from fumed silica and sodium aluminate (NaAlO2). The quantity and locations of the acidic-cationic dual active sites of the proton-form product zeolites are suitable for synthesizing acetaldehyde from ethanol with over 90% product selectivity. However, further development of synthesis procedures to enhance the surface area is needed to improve the ethanol conversion of the resulting zeolites. This work provides a new perspective on highly crystalline and pure-phase zeolitic structural formations from natural zeolite and their potential application in ethanol conversion.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Mechanics of Materials"

On the other hand, power generation still relies on fossil fuels. A ground source heat pump (GSHP) is an alternative to reducing the energy required for cooling and heating in many countries. The use of a GSHP in a tropical climate like Southeast Asia is mainly for cooling (i.e., heat rejection), and the temperature differences between soil background and atmosphere are low throughout the year. This paper addresses the potential use of GSHP in Southeast Asia based on short-term performance data. Four GSHP systems have been installed in Thailand and Vietnam. Data gathered from the short-term operations provides important insights on GSHP performance. A comparison with an air source heat pump (ASHP) indicates that a GSHP installed at the Bangkok, using two vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs), achieves a maximum of 33% electricity reduction. Similarly, GSHPs installed at the Saraburi site using horizontal GHEs achieves a maximum of 18.5% and 40.3% less electricity during highest and lowest temperature seasons, respectively, compared with an ASHP. The results also show that parallel–series arrangement improves the thermal performance than those of series–parallel arrangements. Considering the wide temperature climate range of Hanoi, a GSHP can also be used for heating purposes during a short winter period. While the short-term results discussed in this paper suggest the potential use of GSHP in Southeast Asia, further long-term analysis, cost evaluations and system optimization are required.","process equipment, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the OBEST, a new mobile/tablet-based application in reducing weight and encouraging healthy eating behaviors and quality of life in children with obesity. The application could assist healthcare professionals to treat children and adolescents with obesity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the hospital and school settings in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Seventy-seven children and adolescents with obesity were randomized into two groups; one received standard care combined with the OBEST application, and the other received only standard care. The outcomes were changes in weight, healthy eating behaviors, and quality of life assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) from baseline to six-month follow-up between the two groups. Results: The results showed that the intervention group reduced more body mass index (BMI) and had a higher number of participants engaging in healthy eating behaviors than the standard care group but did not reach a statistically significant level, except for less frequent consumption of fast food. The participants in the intervention group had 4.5 times higher odds of decreased engaging in fast-food consumption than the standard care group at 6 months follow-up (odds ratio, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.41 to 14.35]). There were no statistically significant changes in PedsQL scores over 6 months in between groups. Conclusions: The current study was unable to detect a significant effect of the OBEST application as an adjunct tool to the standard treatment on reducing weight in obese children and adolescents. However, the mobile application might help to increase engaging in healthy eating behaviors. Further studies with a larger sample are needed to confirm our findings.

In Thailand, DTMUV has been detected sporadically in ducks since the first report in 2013. However, information on the patterns of DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand is limited. In this study, a serological survey of DTMUV on ducks raised in farming and free-grazing systems was conducted during 2015-2016. Blood samples of farm ducks (n = 160) and free-grazing ducks (n = 240) were collected in the summer, rainy, and winter seasons during 2015-2016 and tested for DTMUV infection. Our results showed that DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand occurred all year-round; however, the patterns of DTMUV infection varied between 2 duck-raising systems. Significant seasonal pattern was found in free-grazing ducks, whereas no seasonality was observed in farm ducks. Notably, DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand was highest in the winter season. In conclusion, our data indicate distinct patterns of DTMUV infection between farm and free-grazing ducks, and the year-round circulation of DTMUV in ducks in Thailand, with peaks in the winter season. This information will help reduce the risk of DTMUV transmission through prevention and control strategies focusing on the peak period. Routine surveillance of DTMUV in ducks is essential for early detection of DTMUV allowing the implementation of control measures in a timely manner.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology
Efficacy of a one-session fractional picosecond 1064-nm laser for the treatment of atrophic acne scar and enlarged facial pores,"Puaratanaarunkon T., Asawanonda P.",2021-01-01,"Acne Vulgaris, Atrophy, Cicatrix, Face, Humans, Hypertrophy, Lasers, Solid-State, Treatment Outcome, acne, acne scar, Facial pores, laser, picosecond laser","A picosecond-domain laser reportedly elicits positive treatment outcomes for acne scar and enlarged pores, but multiple sessions are often required. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of one-session fractional picosecond 1064-nm laser in treating atrophic acne scar and conspicuous pores. Fifty-nine acne scar patients with skin phototypes III and IV were treated with picosecond 1064-nm laser with microlens array (MLA) (8 mm spot, 0.8 J/cm2, 10 Hz) for one session. The efficacy of acne scar was evaluated by Antera® 3D CS, whereas facial pore counts and diameter were evaluated by VISIA-CR and dermoscopic images, respectively. All measurements were performed at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. Acne scar volume and facial pore counts showed a statistically significant reduction at 1 week and subsequent follow-up period when compared to baseline (weeks 1–6; P < .001). The volume of acne scars and the number of enlarge pores decreased by 22.03% and 15.13%, respectively. Of note, there was no significant change in diameter of facial pores. The adverse events, including erythema and folliculitis, were mild and short-lived. A single session of picosecond 1064-nm laser with MLA was safe and effective in improving atrophic acne scar and the number of enlarged pores.",medical,"Surgery, Dermatology"

This paper aims to identify the possible causes of the existing damage and the potential modes of failure of the bridge's girder using nonlinear finite-element analysis (FEA). Failure analysis of the bridge girder will consider the effects of supplying the bridge with different dapped reinforcements and subjecting the bridge's prestressed tendons to losses in their prestressing forces. Various failure scenarios and cases will be simulated in numerical models. Numerical analysis results will be compared with design guidelines for bridge girders. Overall, the investigative results indicated that the combined impacts of insufficient hanger reinforcement and prestress losses in the girder's end-section was the probable cause of the bridge's re-entrant corner diagonal crack.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction"
Effects of cathode coating materials and operational time on the mercury removal performance of electrokinetic remediation system for marine sediment,"Bunditboondee C., Lohwacharin J., Khan E., Kulyakoon S., Laohhasurayotin K.",2021-06-15,"Electrodes, Environmental Restoration and Remediation, Geologic Sediments, Manganese Compounds, Mercury, Oxides, Soil Pollutants, Cu foam, Electrokinetic remediation (EK), Hg migration, Manganese oxide (MnO2), Marine sediment","Electrokinetic remediation (EK) is a promising in-situ technique for removing mercury (Hg) from contaminated sites; yet it demands long operational periods when conventional electrodes are used. Herein, we investigate the effectiveness of lab-prepared cathodes (Cu foam coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or manganese oxide (MnO2)) to enhance Hg removal rates from sediment by EK. Although short term (2 h) Hg removal rates were insignificantly different (p-value > 0.05) when using the uncoated and coated Cu foam cathodes, long term (60 h) operations saw greater Hg removal by coated Cu foam cathodes over pure Cu foam, probably owing to the time required for Hg to migrate towards the electrodes from sediment. The highest Hg removal at the cathode was achieved when an αMnO2-coated Cu foam cathode was used with a strong-base anion exchange membrane (AEM) in the system. Using H3PO4, as a cathodic electrolyte resulted in a higher Hg removal efficiency than using NaCl and HCl electrolytes. Electromigration was found to be the dominant Hg-ions (e.g. HHgO2−, Hg2+) transport mechanism in the marine sediment during remediation. Overall, this research demonstrates that employing enhanced electrodes and AEMs can enhance Hg removal by EK processes in relatively shorter operating times than conventional EK processes.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Blood samples from 318 dogs and 321 cats were tested for T. gondii antibodies by modified agglutination test (cut-off 1:25). Additionally, 18 dogs and 20 cats were longitudinally sampled for T. gondii antibodies during the same study period, between June and July 2019. The overall seroprevalence in dogs and cats was 7.9% (25/318; 95% CI 4.9-10.8%) and 18.7% (95% CI 14.4-23.0%), respectively. For dogs, risk factors identified were being a mixed-breed animal and living totally outdoors, while increasing age was shown to be a risk factor for cats. Seroconversion was not detected and titres from positive animals remained constant over longitudinal study. The present study indicates that there is a prominent presence of T. gondii in urban and peri-urban areas of Bangkok, suggesting that outdoor dogs and cats should be considered as a possible risk factor for humans.","Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Animal Science and Zoology, Infectious Diseases"

The detector uses large-size 20 inches photomultiplier tubes to detect photons from a liquid scintillator. The large PMTs are sensitive and easily affected such that the detection efficiency loses about 60% under the geomagnetic field intensity (∼500 mG). It has a significantly negative effect on the detector performance, and a compensation system is necessary for geomagnetic field shielding. As permalloys are easily rusted in water, a better way for the geomagnetic shielding is to apply an active compensation coils system. The simulations show that a set of 32 circular coils can meet the experiment requirement. The residual magnetic field is less than 0.05 G in the Central Detector Photomultiplier Tube (CD-PMT) region (38.5-39.5 m in diameter). A prototype coil system with a 1.2 m was built to validate the simulation and the design. The measured data of prototype and simulation results are consistent with each other, and geomagnetic field intensity is effectively reduced by coils, verifying the shielding coils system design for JUNO. This study is expected to provide practical guidance for the PMT magnetic field shielding for future large-scale detector designs.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

In this study, we identified and functionally characterized the GST gene family in the halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418. Four putative Halothece-GSTs had very low homology, which implies evolutionary divergence. Of these, H0647, H0729 and H3557 were differentially expressed by oxidative stress whereas H3557 was highly and specifically upregulated under salt stress. In vitro analysis revealed that the recombinant H3557 exhibited GST activity toward 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH). H3557 displayed a broad range of activity at pH 6.5–10.5. Kinetic parameters showed the apparent Km for CDNB and GSH was 0.14 and 0.75 mM, respectively. H3557 remained catalytically active in the presence of NaCl. Structural modelling supported that H3557 is salt-adaptive enzyme with highly acidic residues on the protein surface. The vital function of H3557 in heterologous expression system was evaluated. The H3557-expressing cells were more tolerant to H2O2-induced oxidative stress compared with other GST-expressing cells and conferred salt tolerance. Taken together, the findings of this study provide insights into the molecular and cellular functions of GST in cyanobacteria, particularly under salt stress, which is less understood compared with other species.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science"

The chemical looping combustion (CLC) was proposed to serve power plants with higher efficiency. The objectives of this study consisted of (1) examine the sustainability of power production between PC and CLC and (2) investigate the high sustainability operation conditions. There are 6 case studies which were simulated using the Aspen plus program with the Peng-Robinson-Boston-Mathias model. All cases were evaluated by three quantitative aspects of thermal efficiency, economic, and emergy analyses. The best case from each analysis was different. Since emergy analysis expressed a holistic aspect, including resource usage, economic performance, and environmental burden, this indicator would be used for selecting the proper technology. In this study, the decision had made into two aspects. From a global viewpoint, the CLC with high energy recovery and HAT cycle would be selected since it had the lowest UEV, reflecting the least natural resource consumption. On the other hand, from a local viewpoint, the CLC without HAT would be selected since it had the highest ESI, which implied its sustainability since the process was less reliant on external resources.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Materials and Methods: Male C57BL/6MLac mice were separated into three groups as follows: group 1—defect without graft as control, group 2—DFDBA, and group 3—DBBM. Affymetrix DNA microarrays were used to characterize gene expression in bone after 3 months of graft healing. Differential expression of designated genes discovered by microarray analysis was confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared with normal bone healing, 355 and 1,108 coding genes of bone grafted with DFDBA were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in chemokine signaling, macrophage activity, osteoclast activity, cytokine expression, T-cell receptor signaling, apoptosis, and MAPK signaling. The downregulated genes were predominantly involved in calcium regulation in cardiac cells, chemokine signaling, MAPK signaling, and adipogenesis. A total of 306 and 817 coding genes of bone grafted with DBBM were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in osteoclast activity, chemokine signaling, B cell receptor signaling, macrophage activity, and signaling of T-cell receptor, MAPK, IL-5, and IL-1. The downregulated genes were predominantly involved in calcium regulation in the cardiac cell and osteoclast activity. Real-time PCR revealed that the DFDBA and DBBM groups showed a higher mRNA level of MMP12, Bcl2A1, S100A4, and Postn compared with the control (P <.05). Histology showed that, compared with the control, the volume of new bone was higher in both types of bone grafts. Immunohistochemistry using an MMP12 antibody confirmed the microarray results because the MMP12 immunoreactivity intensified, and a positive expression of MMP12 increased significantly in the DFDBA and DBBM groups. Conclusion: Both DFDBA and DBBM had a gene expression network involved in new bone formation, which coincided with an increased expression of MMP-12 and osteoclast activity. Both types of graft materials appeared to connect with genes that stimulate bone remodeling at 3 months of bone grafting.

Most developing countries are facing significant challenges associated with recycling practices. In Thailand, 90% of the plastic recycling businesses are categorized as small-scale enterprises. There is still a dearth of research on health risk assessments associated with indoor exposure in small-scale waste recycling. This research aims to apply a holistic approach of integrated health risk and life cycle assessment concepts in investigating occupational exposure to all potential hazards in small-scale polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) recycling plants in Thailand. The results indicated that all exposure levels of heat stress in wet bulb globe temperature in the melting/extrusion stage exceeded the Thai and global Occupational safety and health (OSH) threshold limits for workers with heavy workloads. For workers’ exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the average total VOCs concentrations emitted from PP and PE recycling were 1625 μg/m3 and 1190 μg/m3, respectively. Hexane and toluene were remarkably found in the extrusion process. The non-cancer hazard quotients (HQs) and hazard indices (HIs) were higher in PP than in PE. The adverse non-cancer risks were concerned in plants that recycle only PP wastes at full capacity (100%) loaded operation (HQs and HIs >1). Recycling facility concentrating more on PE recycling tends to reduce risk to workers. By integrating the revised one box model into the life cycle impact assessment, the results demonstrate that the health impact from indoor VOCs exposure due to the production of 1 kg of recycled PP or PE resin was significantly greatest. Workers in the extrusion process were considered at higher risk of exposure to VOCs and heat. This research makes important contributions to the literature by providing insights into environmental health management and implications for cleaner production in plastic waste recycling. The promotion of effective engineering controls and development of collaborative circular business models in plastic waste recycling sector were highly recommended to increase resource efficiency and promote sustainable production patterns.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

It has been detected in healthy dogs and dogs with diarrhea, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, and vasculitis. It comprises five genotypes and is frequently found as a coinfection with canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2). Aim: To characterize canine circovirus genotypes co-circulating with CPV-2 in Vietnam. Method: PCR assessment of 81 CPV-2-positive fecal samples from Vietnamese diarrheic dogs up to seven months of age for other viral enteric pathogens, including canine bocavirus, canine adenovirus, paramyxovirus, canine coronavirus, porcine circovirus-3 and canine circovirus. In addition, eight selected full genome sequences of Vietnamese canine circovirus were analyzed and used for phylogeny. Results: In total 19.8% of samples were found to be positive for canine circovirus. Phylogeny revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus strains were clustered in two different genotypes (genotype-1 and -3). The genetic diversity among Vietnamese canine circovirus was 86.0–87.2%. The nucleotide discrepancy among both genotypes altered the deduced amino acid sequence in 14 and ten residues of the replicase and capsid proteins, respectively. Genetic recombination analysis revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus-6 strain has the American and Chinese canine circovirus as its major and minor parents, respectively. Only a single dog revealed triple detections of CPV-2c, Canine circovirus and canine adenovirus (1.2%). Conclusion: The co-circulation of two different genotypes of canine circovirus and CPV-2c in dogs in Vietnam has been illustrated.

The transesterification reaction between glycerol and DMC was typically limited by mass transfer because of the immiscible nature of the reactants. By varying the stirring speed, it was observed that the mass transfer limitation could be neglected at 800 rpm. The presence of the CaO solid catalyst made the mass transport-limited reaction process more prominent. Mass transfer intensification using a simple kitchen countertop blender as an alternative to overcome the external mass transfer limitation of a typical magnetic stirrer was demonstrated. A lower amount of the catalyst and a shorter reaction time were required to achieve 93% glycerol conversion or 91% GC yield, and the turnover frequency (TOF) increased almost 5 times from 1.5 to 7.2 min−1 when using a conventional magnetic stirrer and countertop blender, respectively. In addition, using a simple kitchen countertop blender with 7200 rpm, the reaction temperature of 60◦C could be reached within approximately 3 min without the need of a heating unit. This was the result of the self-frictional heat generated by the high-shear blender. This was considered to be heat transfer intensification, as heat was generated locally (in situ), offering a higher homogeneity distribution. Meanwhile, the trend toward energy intensification was promising as the yield efficiency increased from 0.064 to 2.391 g/kJ. A comparison among other process intensification techniques, e.g., microwave reactor, ultrasonic reactor, and reactive distillation was also rationalized.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this study, U concentrations is proven to be useful in highlighting organic-rich rocks in low K and Th concentration successions due to its ability to be fixed in clay minerals and organic materials under an anoxic condition. Thus, the U spectral gamma ray is suggested to combine with conventional gamma ray log for depositional environment and recognition of organic-rich rocks.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Here, we examined the activity of millettocalyxin B, extracted from the stem bark of Millettia erythrocalyx, in lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The viability of human lung cancer cells was investigated by the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Migration and invasion assays were performed. Phalloidin-rhodamine staining was used to determine the formation of filopodia. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were used to identify the signaling proteins involved in migration regulation. Results: Non-toxic concentrations (0-25 μM) of millettocalyxin B reduced migration and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells. Filopodia were significantly reduced in millettocalyxin Btreated cells. The migration regulatory proteins including integrin α5, active FAK, active Akt, and Cdc42 were significantly decreased in Millettocalyxin B-treated cells. Conclusion: Our findings revealed a novel anti-migration and anti-invasion effects and the underlying mechanism of millettocalyxin B, which may be exploited for cancer treatment.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

We sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the Orsiro SES in unselected Thai population. Methods: The Thailand Orsiro registry was a prospective, open-label clinical study evaluating all patients with obstructive coronary artery disease implanted with Orsiro SES. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months. TLF is defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Patients with diabetes, small vessels (≤ 2.75 mm), chronic total occlusions (CTOs), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were pre-specified subgroups for statistical analysis. Result: A total of 150 patients with 235 lesions were included in the analysis. Half of the patients (53.3%) presented with AMI, and 24% had diabetes. Among 235 lesions, 93(39.4%) were small vessels, and 24(10.2%) were chronic total occlusions. The primary endpoint, TLF at 12 months, occurred in eight patients (5.3%), predominately caused by cardiac death. By contrast, the incidences of TVMI and CD-TLR were null. The outcomes in pre-specified subgroup were not different from the overall population (all p > 0.05). One definite late stent thrombosis(0.7%) was incidentally observed during primary percutaneous coronary intervention to the non-target vessel. Conclusion: The safety and efficacy of the ultrathin strut sirolimus-eluting stent in unselected cases are confirmed in the Thailand Orsiro registry. Despite the high proportion of pre-specified high-risk subgroups, the excellent stent performance was consistent with the overall population.

A simple distance paper-based analytical device for the screening of lead in food matrices,"Katelakha K., Nopponpunth V., Boonlue W., Laiwattanapaisal W.",2021-03-01,"Carminic acid, Competitive binding, Distance paper-based device, Food matrixes, Lead detection, Paper based devices, Paper-based analytical devices, Poly(ethyleneimine), Simple++, Standard addition, Colorimetry, Food Analysis, Lead, Limit of Detection, Paper, Polyethyleneimine, Spectrophotometry, Atomic, Water, Carminic acid, Distance paper-based device, Food matrices, Lead detection, Polyethyleneimine, Standard addition","A simple and rapid distance paper-based analytical device (dPAD) for the detection of lead (Pb) in foods is proposed herein. The assay principle is based on competitive binding between carminic acid (CA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) to Pb in a food sample. The paper channels were pre-immobilized with PEI, before reacting with a mixture of the sample and CA. Pb can strongly bind to the CA; hence, the length of the red color deposition on the flow channel decreased as a lower amount of free CA bound to PEI. The dPAD exhibited good linear correlation, with ranges of 5–100 µg·mL−1 (R2 = 0.974) of Pb. Although, the limit of detection (LOD) of this platform was rather high, at 12.3 µg·mL−1, a series of standard additions (8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 µg·mL−1) can be used to interpret the cutoff of Pb concentrations at higher or lower than 2 µg·mL−1. The presence of common metal ions such as calcium, magnesium, nickel, and zinc did not interfere with the color distance readout. The validity of the developed dPAD was demonstrated by its applicability to screen the contamination of Pb in century egg samples. The results obtained from the dPAD are in accordance with the concentration measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) (n = 9). In conclusion, this proposed dPAD, combined with the standard addition method, could be applied for screening Pb contamination in food matrices. This platform is, therefore, potentially applicable for field measurements of Pb in developing countries, because it is cheap and rapid, and it requires no significant laborious instruments.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, engineering, physics","Analytical Chemistry, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Instrumentation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Clinical Biochemistry"
Repurposing of high-dose erythropoietin as a potential drug attenuates sepsis in preconditioning renal injury,"Chancharoenthana W., Udompronpitak K., Manochantr Y., Kantagowit P., Kaewkanha P., Issara-Amphorn J., Leelahavanichkul A.",2021-11-01,"Aged, Animals, Bacteremia, Cytokines, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Repositioning, Erythropoietin, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Hep G2 Cells, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Kidney, Lipopolysaccharides, Liver, Macrophage Activation, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Middle Aged, Proportional Hazards Models, RAW 264.7 Cells, Receptors, Erythropoietin, Sepsis, Treatment Outcome, Cecal ligation and puncture, Erythropoietin, LPS, Macrophages, Mortality rate, Sepsis","Due to (i) the uremia-enhanced sepsis severity, (ii) the high prevalence of sepsis with pre-existing renal injury and (iii) the non-erythropoiesis immunomodulation of erythropoietin (EPO), EPO was tested in sepsis with pre-existing renal injury models with the retrospective exploration in patients. Then, EPO was subcutaneously administered in mice with (i) cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) after renal injury including 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx-CLP) and bilateral nephrectomy (BiNx-CLP) or sham surgery (sham-CLP) and (ii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, along with testing in macrophages. In patients, the data of EPO administration and the disease characteristics in patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (sepsis-AKI) were evaluated. As such, increased endogenous EPO was demonstrated in all sepsis models, including BiNx-CLP despite the reduced liver erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), using Western blot analysis and gene expression, in liver (partly through hepatocyte apoptosis). A high-dose EPO, but not a low-dose, attenuated sepsis in mouse models as determined by mortality and serum inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, EPO attenuated inflammatory responses in LPS-activated macrophages as determined by supernatant cytokines and the expression of several inflammatory genes (iNOS, IL-1β, STAT3 and NFκB). In parallel, patients with sepsis-AKI who were treated with the high-dose EPO showed favorable outcomes, particularly the 29-day mortality rate. In conclusion, high-dose EPO attenuated sepsis with preconditioning renal injury in mice possibly through the macrophage anti-inflammatory effect, which might be beneficial in some patients.",medical,Medicine (all)

In the considered scenario, the European airspace is still highly fragmented, i.e. capacity is provided by individual Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) on a local/country level, but the assumption is that cross-border capacity provision is possible and is optimized in the capacity planning process led by the NM. Capacity planning usually starts a long time ahead of the day of operation to ensure that sufficient resources, including Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) are available to safely manage traffic. At the time of making capacity decision, i.e. allocation of ATCO resources for a day of operation, one of the main challenges is considerable uncertainty regarding the demand: overall traffic volume and demand spatio-temporal distribution. The fundamental trade-off is between reducing the capacity provision cost (within-border and cross-border provision) at the expense of increasing expected displacement cost arising from re-routing or delays. To tackle this, we extend a decomposition approach that we proposed in [1] to allow capacity planning for cross-border provision. Furthermore, we present a numerical study based on real capacity and demand (traffic) data to study the effect of allowing cross-border capacity provision. The results suggest that there may be significant potential for cost reduction in cross-border control, especially for risk-averse decision makers.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, sociology","Computer Science Applications, Aerospace Engineering, Control and Systems Engineering, Geography, Planning and Development, Transportation, Communication"

Oxyresveratrol (ORV) exhibits a poor solubility in aqueous environments, thereby resulting in a poor bioavailability. Extensive cocrystal screening of ORV with 67 cocrystal formers (coformers) bearing various functional groups was therefore conducted using grinding, liquid-assisted grinding, solvent evaporation, and slurry methods. Six cocrystals (ORV with betaine (BTN), L-proline (PRL), isonicotinamide, nicotinamide, urea, and ethyl maltol) were found, including four novel cocrystals. Powder X-ray diffraction, low frequency Raman spectroscopy, and thermal analysis revealed unique crystal forms in all obtained samples. Conventional Raman and infrared data differentiated the cocrystals by the presence or absence of a hydrogen bond interacting with the aromatic ring of ORV. The crystal structures were then elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Two new cocrystals consisting of ORV:BTN (2:3) and ORV:PRL:H2O (1:2:1) were identified, and their crystal structures were solved.

We previously employed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model with inducible expression of the CDT catalytic subunit from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, AaCdtB, and showed that a wide variety of host factors play a role in facilitating the activity of CdtB. Our observation that a yeast H2B mutant defective in chromatin condensation was partially resistant to CdtB implies that chromatin structure may affect CDT function. In this study, we identified host chromatin regulatory genes required for CdtB cytotoxicity. We found that the deletion of HTZ1 or certain subunits of SWR, INO80, and SIR complexes increased cellular resistance to CdtB. We hypothesized that CdtB may interact with Htz1 or the chromatin, but immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect physical interaction between CdtB and Htz1 or the chromatin. However, we observed reduced nuclear localization of CdtB in several mutants, suggesting that impaired nuclear translocation may, at least partly, explain the mechanisms of CdtB resistance. In addition, mutations in chromatin regulatory genes induce changes in the global gene expression profile, and these may indirectly affect CdtB toxicity. Our results suggest that decreased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport-related genes that may be involved in CdtB transport and/or increased expression of DNA repair genes may contribute to CdtB resistance. These results suggest that the functions of chromatin regulators may contribute to the activity of CDT in host cells.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

Pre-treatment erythropoietin (EPO) level and previous bloodtransfusion requirement are the two major predictors for response to ESAs. However, most evidence was derivedfrom Western countries whereas there have been limited data in patients with Asian background. Methods: Weretrospectively collected data on patients with low-risk MDS who received ESAs. Erythroid response was evaluatedaccording to IWG 2006 criteria. MDS subtypes, r-IPSS, baseline hemoglobin (Hb), ESAs dosage and erythropoietinlevel were reviewed from medical records. Gene mutations were analyzed in patients’ blood or bone marrow atdiagnosis by 40-gene myeloid panel targeted sequencing. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared betweenerythroid responder and non-responder groups. Results: A total of 47 patients were recruited in the study. The medianage at diagnosis of the patients in this cohort was 77 years (IQR, 70-83) and 44.7% were male. The median revisedinternational prognostic scoring system (R-IPSS) score of patients was 2.5. Response rate to ESAs was 46.8% (22/47).Median EPO level in responders was significantly lower than non-responders (27.7 vs. 59.1 U/L, p=0.02). MedianESAs dosage in responder group was 30,000 units per week. Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 27.3% and24% of the responder and non-responder groups, respectively. Of 22 patients with available 40 gene mutation targetedsequencing, ASXL1, IDH2 and TET2 represented the 3 most common mutations and were found in 22%, 22% and17%, respectively. There were no differences in cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations between groups. Patientswho responded to ESAs showed a higher 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to non-responders (5-year OS 75%vs. 60.9%; p=0.008).

The XRD analysis confirmed the generation of Ni-Cu and Co-Cu alloys after the reduction in presence of H2. The interaction between Cu and Ni or Co resulted in a simplicity of the reduction behavior of Ni and Co species observed in H2-TPR experiments. It was evident from pyridine adsorption FTIR analysis that the formation of bimetallic Ni-Cu and Co-Cu alloys apparently improved the stronger Lewis acidic sites. The influences of reaction temperature and time were examined and optimized to maximize the yields of furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran. The highest two major products yield and selectivity with lower by-products were obtained over the NiCuAl and CoCuAl catalysts compared with the CuAl and NiAl catalysts. The superior performance of the bimetallic catalysts was attributed to the stronger Lewis acidic centre on the catalyst surface. The CoCuAl catalyst was found to have lower catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition among the CuAl and NiCuAl catalysts under H2-free atmosphere.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Hypokalemic patients had significantly lower dietary potassium intake (24.4 ± 11.1 vs. 30.5 ± 9.4 mEq/day, p = 0.031) and lower total potassium excretion (28.5 ± 8.4 vs. 36.7 ± 11.2 mEq/day, p = 0.006) compared to normokalemic patients. Both groups had comparable values of ICW and ECW. On logistic regression, there was no significant correlation between hypokalemia and daily PD exchange volume, total Kt/Vurea, residual renal function, concurrent medications (insulin, diuretics, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitor, and beta-blockers) or ICW. Low dietary potassium was an independent risk factor for hypokalemia. Conclusion: Low dietary potassium intake, rather than increased potassium excretion or intracellular shift, is the major contributing factor of hypokalemia in Thai chronic PD patients. Dietary intervention or potassium supplement protocol should be implemented.",medical,"Nephrology, Urology"
Enhanced and Selective MALDI-MS Detection of Peptides via the Nanomaterial-Dependent Coffee Ring Effect,"Yukird J., Kaminsky C.J., Chailapakul O., Rodthongkum N., Vachet R.W.",2021-07-07,"Coffee rings, Complex mixture, MALDI-MS, Net charges, Peptide ionization, Signal enhancement, Models, Chemical, Nanostructures, Peptides, Protein Binding, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Surface Properties, Coffee ring effect, MALDI-MS, nanomaterials, particle-peptide binding efficiency, signal enhancement","Nanomaterials have been explored as alternative matrices in MALDI-MS to overcome some of the limitations of conventional matrices. Recently, we demonstrated a new means by which nanomaterials can improve peptide ionization and detection in MALDI-MS analyses by exploiting the tendency of nanomaterials to form ""coffee rings""upon drying from liquids. In the current work, we investigate how nanomaterial size and composition affect the signal enhancement of peptides through the coffee-ring effect. From studies of eight different types of nanomaterials ranging in size and composition, we find that most nanomaterials can provide signal enhancement ranging from 2-to 10-fold for individual peptides, as long as a coffee ring is formed. However, when a mixture of peptides is present in a sample, the signal enhancement is the greatest for peptides whose net charge is complementary to the nanomaterial's surface charge. These results suggest that careful design of NM surface properties could allow for selective, enhanced MALDI-MS detection of specific peptides in complex mixtures.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Structural Biology, Spectroscopy"

We report on this thinking approach to Thailand's strategic health workforce planning for the next 20 years (2018–2037). Methods: A series of group model building (GMB) sessions involving 110 participants from multi-sectors of Thailand's health systems was conducted in 2017 and 2018. We facilitated policymakers, administrators, practitioners and other stakeholders to co-create a causal loop diagram (CLD) representing a shared understanding of why the health workforce's demands and supplies in Thailand were mismatched. A stock and flow diagram (SFD) was also co-created for testing the consequences of policy options by simulation modelling. Results: The simulation modelling found hospital utilisation created a vicious cycle of constantly increasing demands for hospital care and a constant shortage of healthcare providers. Moreover, hospital care was not designed for effectively dealing with the future demands of ageing populations and prevalent chronic illness. Hence, shifting emphasis to professions that can provide primary care, intermediate care, long-term care, palliative care, and end-of-life care can be more effective. Conclusions: Our SD modelling confirmed that shifting the care models to address the changing health demands can be a high-leverage policy of health workforce planning, although very difficult to implement in the short term. of health workforce planning, although very difficult to implement in the short term.","sociology, medical","Public Administration, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"
More efficient ethanol synthesis from dimethyl ether and syngas over the combined nano-sized ZSM-35 zeolite with CuZnAl catalyst,"Feng X., Yao J., Zeng Y., Cui Y., Kazumi S., Prasert R., Liu G., Wu J., Yang G., Tsubaki N.",2021-06-01,"Argon atmospheres, Cu-based catalyst, Dimethyl ethers, Methyl acetates, Nano sized, Reaction conditions, Solid state method, Syn-gas, CuZnAl catalyst, DME, Ethanol synthesis, Nano-sized ZSM-35 zeolite, Syngas","Converting syngas into ethanol (EtOH) is highly attractive but remains challenge. Dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation with CO to methyl acetate (MA) on zeolite and its further hydrogenation to EtOH on Cu-based catalyst open a new EtOH synthesis route from syngas. In this work, a nano-sized ZSM-35 (NZ35) zeolite, possessing abundant active sites and porosity and short diffusion path, is found to realize much better activity of DME to MA than that of the conventional ZSM-35 zeolite (CZ35). In addition, a simple formic-acid-assisted solid-state method is employed for preparation an auto-reduced CuZnAl (CZAargon) catalyst under argon atmosphere. The prepared CZAargon catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity for conversion of produced MA to EtOH. By investigating the effects of different integration manners of NZ35 zeolite and CZAargon catalyst, we find that EtOH can be synthesized only when the NZ35 zeolite and CZAargon catalyst pack in a dual-catalyst bed reactor. After optimizing the reaction conditions for EtOH synthesis with the combination of NZ35 zeolite and CZAargon catalyst, it is found that the DME conversion and MA selectivity are stabilized at 47.0 % and 45.6 % respectively, at 220 °C and 2.5 MPa.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

The GpdQ has attracted recent attention as a promising enzyme for bioremediation. This enzyme utilizes two metal ions located in the α and β sites of the enzyme active site for catalysis and is found to bind to Fe(II) ion preferentially. In this study, we aimed to investigate the binding interactions of three organophosphate pesticides (i.e., profenofos, diazinon and chlorpyrifos) to the GpdQ using computational approaches. Firstly, each pesticide molecule was separately docked into the active site of the GpdQ using molecular docking. Then, 500-ns MD simulations were carried out on the systems without (apo enzyme) and with pesticides bound. The MD results showed that the Feβ binds well with the GpdQ active site in the presence of pesticide. It is also seen that the binding of the pesticide could stabilize the enzyme structure in the active conformation, allowing the substrate to be catalysed into less harmful products. Therefore, the ability of in silico analysis presented here could be informative for enhancing enzyme stability and activity in the future.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan (CHI) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation applied at different concentrations to suspension cells of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) on the contents of isoflavonoid, antioxidant, and antiaging activities. Six standards of isoflavonoids, namely, daidzein, genistein, daidzin, genistin, khwakhurin and puerarin, were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To our knowledge, SA elicitation was first reported in this study and showed the highest accumulation of daidzein (2.37 mg/g DW), khwakhurin (1.05 mg/g DW), genistin (0.14 mg/g DW) and puerarin (5.13 mg/g DW). CHI elicitation gave favorable results, and the amounts of daidzein, genistein, khwakhurin and puerarin quantified were 2.24, 0.29, 1.04, and 1.80 mg/g DW, respectively. MeJA elicitation was the least effective method of all three elicitors. The results from DPPH-based assays suggested that extract from SA elicitation had the greatest antioxidant activity, followed by nonelicited cells (control), CHI, and MeJA elicitation. We also further evaluated the biological activities of PM extracts with elicitors on human dermal fibroblasts. We found that salicylic acid is the most promising elicitor to enhance the biological activities of PM extracts. The PM extract from SA-elicited cells promoted the proliferation of fibroblasts by approximately 20%. Furthermore, pretreatment with SA-elicited extract can prevent fibroblasts from experiencing oxidative insults, such as H2O2. The pharmacological data on fibroblasts support the antioxidant activities, implying the antiaging activities of PM extract. Taken together, our study clearly supports the potential utility of cell suspension culture of PM in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries to enhance the production of isoflavonoids and other active components.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Horticulture

Methane formation kinetics were measured at different pHs and [HCO3−]o conditions. Langmuir Hinshelwood K and k constants were readily obtained. Their values at different pHs are explained in terms of the TiO2 surface charge and the adduct and radical anion intermediates stabilities. DFT calculations show the monodentate HCO3-TiO2 adduct as the most stable interaction. HCO3-TiO2 with a nearby Ov (oxygen vacancy), H2O, OH and O were also simulated to mimic different TiO2 surface conditions. The results support the experimental findings. Solvent isotope effects also confirm the proposed mechanism. Non-constant with time product ratios reveal two paths for CH4, CO and H2 formation. [CO]/[CH4] t = 0 extrapolation gives the kinetic ratio that corresponds to the cleavage of the adduct at the CB, and meanwhile, at t > 0, a higher ratio value corresponds to the cleavage of the adduct at Ov. This cleavage fills the vacancy and produces additional CO and H2. To avoid the last CO contribution, P25 was sonicated to load the anatase phase on the rutile phase. This loading induces charge separation, where electrons and holes are redirected to the anatase conduction band and rutile valence band, respectively. As a result, the CH4 rate and its selectivity increase up to 4 times.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

This is a term popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, the term ‘social distancing’ can be misleading, as it may imply that individuals should stop socializing. However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term ‘distant socializing’ as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of root canal configurations of mandibular premolars according to Vertucci classification in a Thai population. Methods: Total of 1159 CBCT images of Thai patients who received radiographic imaging at the Department of Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University in 2017–2018 was evaluated. The data were reported using descriptive statistics and the relationship between the prevalence of the root canal complexities and sex was analyzed using the chi-squared test. Results: The most common root canal configuration was Vertucci type I, with a 63.1% and 98% prevalence in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. More than 98% of mandibular premolars had a single root. The prevalence of a bifurcation was 28.5% and 1.5% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. The prevalence of a trifurcation was 3.2% in the mandibular first premolar. A C-shaped root canal was observed at 23.7% and 0.7% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. The level of branching was mostly found at the middle 1/3 of the root. Bilateral appearance of the same root canal configuration was identified in 80.3% and 95.9% in the mandibular first and second premolars, respectively. There was no relationship between sex and the prevalence of a bifurcation, trifurcation, or C-shaped root canal.

Oxygen therapy possibly affects the timing of swallows, which may alter airway protective mechanisms. Objectives: To compare the coordination between swallowing and respiration during water infusion in post-extubation patients using high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) with the coordination in those using low flow nasal oxygen (LFNO). Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled crossover study in post-extubation patients. The patients extubated within 48 h were randomly assigned to two groups, namely, HFNO and LFNO. The eligible patients in each group received either HFNO with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 0.35, flow 50 L per minute (LPM), and temperature 34 °C or LFNO 5 LPM for 5 min. The coordination between swallowing and respiration was observed during continuous infusion of 10-ml water one minute three times. Respiratory phases and swallowing were monitored using electrocardiogram (EKG)-derived respiratory signals and submental electromyography (EMG), respectively. The swallowing frequency and timing of swallows in relation to respiratory phases were recorded. The coordination between swallowing and respiration was classified into 4 patterns, namely I, E, I-E, and E-I swallows. (I; inspiration and E; expiration) Subsequently, after a 5-min washout period, the patients were switched to the other type of oxygen therapy using the same procedure. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 22 patients with a mean age of 56 years were enrolled in the study. The major indication for invasive mechanical ventilation was pneumonia with a median duration of endotracheal intubation of 2.5 days. The median total swallowing numbers (three minutes) were 18.5 times in the HFNO period and 21 times in the LFNO period (p = NS). The most common swallowing pattern was E-swallow. The patients using HFNO had higher numbers of E-swallow pattern (74.3% in HFNO vs 67.6% in LFNO; p = 0.048) and lower numbers of I-swallow pattern (14.3% in HFNO vs 23.1% in LFNO; p = 0.044). The numbers of other swallowing patterns were not different between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Compared with LFNO, HFNO significantly increased the E-swallow and decreased the I-swallow in post-extubation patients.

Firstly, physical model tests were conducted to observe the load-settlement response and load-transfer mechanism. Subsequently, a series of three-dimensional (3D) finite-element analyses was performed to investigate the effect of the stiffness and length of the geogrid encasement. The results indicated that the geogrid encasement effectively improves the Qult of the DCM piles by a factor of two. With the additional confinement provided by the geogrid encasement, the geogrid can also provide a greater contribution to the loading transfer. The increase in Qult became more significant with a lower strength of the DCM. For a particular amount of geogrid, the EDCM pile with a thicker geogrid provided a higher Qult than that with a longer geogrid. The optimum length of the geogrid-EDCM pile was found to be approximately twice that of the pile diameter. Finally, a chart for estimating the efficient effect of geogrid encasements on the Qult of EDCM piles was proposed.","mixing and separation, influence of dynamic loads, earth sciences",Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology

Furthermore, the surface of the polyHIPE was modified by LbL technique to increase the adsorption efficiency. This technique consisted of two main layers, the primary layer of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) and the secondary layer, which was the CO2 adsorbing layer, of polyethylene imine (PEI) or tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA). Poly(S/DVB)HIPE modified by PEI terminated as the secondary coating showed the highest CO2 adsorption capacity, with up to 42% (from 0.71 to 1.01 mmol/g).

Anaerobic treatment is an effective process with double advantages of waste stabilization and energy production. However, high organic compound and sodium toxicity in high-salinity wastewaters adversely affect the performance of anaerobic treatment. In this study, anaerobic hybrid (AH) and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were investigated for their efficiencies to alleviate the negative effects of high-salinity wastewater. RESULTS: Double increases in the NaCl concentration drastically deteriorated the performances of both reactors. The activities of acetoclastic methanogens (ACM) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HTM) in both reactors decreased to 22–28% and 36–40% compared to the previous period, respectively. However, the methanogen population (Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales) was not affected negatively. The AH reactor exhibited excellent performance during the recovery and restart periods, which only required 7 days to complete the recovery period. Furthermore, during the restart period, the AH reactor showed high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, methane (CH4) production and yield as ≈90%, 2600 mL day−1 and 0.30 m3 CH4 kg−1 CODremoved, respectively.

The concentration of attached biomass in the packed zone of the AH reactor gradually increased indicating the growth of an active microbial biofilm. CONCLUSION: The excellent performance of the AH reactor was presumably a result of its packed zone configuration which provided the supporting media to entrap smaller microbial aggregates, reduce biomass washout and support the growth of active biofilm. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, energy, environmental, chemistry","Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Objectives: This study examined colistin and carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli and Salmonella from pigs, pig carcasses, and pork in Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia border provinces. Methods: The phenotypic and genotypic resistance to colistin and meropenem was determined in E. coli and Salmonella obtained from pigs, pig carcasses, and pork (n = 1,619). A conjugative experiment was performed in all isolates carrying the mcr gene (s) (n = 68). The plasmid replicon type was determined in the isolates carrying a conjugative plasmid with mcr by PCR-based replicon typing (n = 7). The genetic relatedness of mcr-positive Salmonella (n = 11) was investigated by multi-locus sequence typing. Results: Colistin resistance was more common in E. coli (8%) than Salmonella (1%). The highest resistance rate was found in E. coli (17.8%) and Salmonella (1.7%) from Cambodia. Colistin-resistance genes, mcr-1, mcr-3, and mcr-5, were identified, of which mcr-1 and mcr-3 were predominant in E. coli (5.8%) and Salmonella (1.7%), respectively. The mcr-5 gene was observed in E. coli from pork in Cambodia. Two colistin-susceptible pig isolates from Thailand carried both mcr-1 and mcr-3. Seven E. coli and Salmonella isolates contained mcr-1 or mcr-3 associated with the IncF and IncI plasmids. The mcr-positive Salmonella from Thailand and Cambodia were categorized into two clusters with 94%–97% similarity. None of these clusters was meropenem resistant. Conclusions: Colistin-resistant E. coli and Salmonella were distributed in pigs, pig carcasses, and pork in the border areas.

A collection of business frameworks has been created to control oil spills, such as the utilization of agricultural wastes as sorbents. This paper demonstrates the use of raw and modified fibre from empty bunches of palm fruit, a low-cost adsorbent material for the oil spill in the marine environment. To improve fibre's sorption capacity, the fibre was modified by esterification using oleic acid. The modified fibre was tested to adsorb crude oil in a batch system (Tapis and Arabian). The extent of modification was given according to weight percent gain (WPG), which was calculated on the basis of difference in weight before and after the treatment. To increase the esterification productivity, an optimization study was conducted at various concentrations of oleic acid and temperature, and achieved higher WPG (with 4.32%) and subsequently higher oil sorption capacity of 5.8 and 5.96 g/g for Tapis and Arabian crude oil, respectively. Besides, this study also focused on correspondence of surface functional groups of the adsorbent using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, surface morphology by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and measure the contact angle using Interfacial Tension. Two well-known adsorption kinetic and isotherm models of sorbents were utilized to explain the mechanism of adsorption of oil onto the modified OPEFB fibre. The predicted result exemplified that, Pseudo-second-order model from the kinetic and Langmuir model from isotherm study were well represented to remove crude oil onto the treated OPEFB fibre regarding the highest correlation coefficient (R2) and closely of maximum crude oil adsorption in theoretical (q0) and experimental (qe) data.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Science (all), Soil Science, Plant Science"

PDA-based materials are normally synthesized via a self-assembly in an aqueous medium. In this study, we explored important experimental parameters including concentration, incubating temperature, and solvent media, that affected the self-assembly of monocarboxylic PDA and reversible thermochromic PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites. The critical concentration (C*), the lowest concentration for topotactic photopolymerization in each system, was determined. We achieved, for the first time, direct synthesis of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites in toluene. Furthermore, it was possible to synthesize the nanocomposites at ambient conditions, simplifying the process for large-scale production. The addition of co-solvent, ethanol, resulted in a significant increase in blue-phase concentration. The presence of ethanol in the solvent medium also caused the morphological change from sheet-like to ribbon-like structures. The ability to synthesize the nanocomposite in nonpolar media allowed the fabrication of solid-state sensors by mixing with various polymers such as polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(4-vinylpyridine). Reversible thermochromic smart inks were prepared by simple mixing with acrylic paint.

"Sources of atmospheric lead (Pb) after quarter century of phasing out of leaded gasoline in Bangkok, Thailand","Kayee J., Bureekul S., Sompongchaiyakul P., Wang X., Das R.",2021-05-15,"Bangkok, Lead (pb) in thai aerosol, Leaded gasoline, Monsoon winds, Pb isotope ratios, Pb isotopes, PM$-2.5$, Thailand, Trace metal, Unleaded gasoline, Lead (Pb) in Thai aerosol, Pb isotope ratios, PM2.5, Trace metals, Unleaded gasoline","After global phasing out of leaded gasoline, anthropogenic sources of atmospheric lead (Pb) are dominated by coal combustion emissions, high-temperature metallurgical processes, and vehicle exhausts. Thailand was one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to completely phase out leaded gasoline by the year 1994. This study investigates the sources of atmospheric Pb in Thai aerosols, a quarter-century after phasing out of leaded gasoline using a multiproxy approach, Pb isotopes in conjunction with trace metal composition of PM2.5. Aerosol samples were collected for 1 year from January 2018 to April 2019 from Bangkok and Chonburi to understand the influence of seasonal variation on aerosol chemistry. Bangkok is the only megacity in Thailand and notorious for traffic congestion and Chonburi is a coastal town, 80 km southeast of Bangkok where the inter monsoon winds make landfall. Aerosol Pb concentrations significantly decreased in 25 years from 74 ± 5 ng/m3 in 1994–1995 to 14 ± 13 ng/m3 measured in Bangkok during Northeast (NE) monsoon winds. Concentrations of all the metals are higher in Chonburi compared to Bangkok in the NE monsoon wind, owing to the addition of local emissions from the megacity over the long-range transported metals before the winds reach the coastal town. The Pb isotope ratios have a wide range (206Pb/207Pb range 1.1343–1.1685 and 208Pb/207Pb range 2.4138–2.4450) but the average ratios are not significantly different in Bangkok and Chonburi for all three seasons. However, present day 206Pb/207Pb ratios are more radiogenic than those measured 25 years ago in Bangkok. The Pb isotopes from both locations in all seasons have considerable overlap with unleaded gasoline and diesel used in Southeast Asia indicating automobile exhaust as an important source. Additionally, the NE monsoon winds are influenced by mixing of crustal dust (Al/Pb ratios correlates well with 206Pb/207Pb, r2 = 0.63) with coal combustion emission (strong inter-correlation of Pb, Zn, As and Cd, r2 from 0.72 to 0.94) from China and Vietnam. Pb isotopes of the Southwest (SW) monsoon winds are also influenced by crustal dust and falls on the mixing line between coal combustion and ore processing emission from India in a Pb triple isotope plot. Chemical composition of aerosols in the inter-monsoon winds are similar to SW monsoon winds. After a quarter-century of leaded gasoline banning in Thailand, the atmospheric Pb sources have changed from less radiogenic leaded gasoline exhaust and Chinese ore processing to more radiogenic unleaded gasoline and diesel exhaust and coal combustion.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; atmospheric pollution; chemistryical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, the atmosphere, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Atmospheric Science"

Currently, there is no information regarding the economic burden of NASH in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden of NASH in Thailand as a lesson learned for LMICs. Methods: To estimate the healthcare costs and prevalence of NASH with significant fibrosis (fibrosis stage ≥ 2) in the general Thai population, an eleven-state lifetime horizon Markov model with 1-year cycle length was performed. The model comprised Thai population aged 18 years and older. The cohort size was based on Thailand Official Statistic Registration Systems. The incidence of NASH, transitional probabilities, and costs-of-illness were based on previously published literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The age-specific prevalence of NASH was based on Thai NASH registry data. Costs were expressed in 2019 US Dollars ($). As we undertook analysis from the payer perspective, only direct medical costs were included. All future costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The estimated total number of patients with significant NASH was 2.9 million cases in 2019, based on a NASH prevalence of 5.74%. The total lifetime cost of significant NASH was $15.2 billion ($5,147 per case), representing approximately 3% of the 2019 GDP of Thailand. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the lifetime costs of significant NASH varied from $11.4 billion to $18.2 billion. Conclusions: The economic burden associated with NASH is substantial in Thailand. This prompts clinicians and policy makers to consider strategies for NASH prevention and management.",medical,Gastroenterology

Global estimation of mangrove soil organic carbon (SOC) storage requires detailed regional studies, but estimates of SOC data in deep soils are currently missing in many countries. Furthermore, little is explored on the molecular composition of mangrove SOC. Here, we assessed the SOC stock in a Trat mangrove forest (Thailand) by collecting deep soils (3.5 m) and analyzed the SOC composition for better understanding its potential sources and influencing factors. The Trat mangrove forest had four times higher SOC stock than has been considered for Thai mangrove forests, with the per-area SOC stock of nearly 1000 Mg C ha–1 which rivals that of Indo-Pacific mangrove forests. The SOC composition analyzed by C/N ratios and spectroscopic techniques differed by tree species and depth. Compositional data principal component analysis revealed that a biological factor (root abundance) had stronger influences than the soil texture (sand versus clay) on the abundance and composition of mangrove SOC. Although surface soil (~1 m) C density was largely controlled by the recent vegetation, deep soil C density reflected other historical processes. This study contributed to a refined estimate of Thailand mangrove SOC stock and revealed that factors influencing SOC abundance and composition differ by tree species and depth.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; ecology of communities/ecosystems; community/ecosystem processes; nutrient cycling and decomputer scienceosition, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

ABF pigs showed enrichment of Prevotella (33%) and Lactobacillus (13%), whereas Escherichia coli (40%), Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides (each at 4%) were notably observed in the C group. Distinct clusters of cecal microbiota of ABF and C pigs were revealed; however, microbiota of some C pigs (C1) appeared in the same cluster as ABF and were totally separated from the remaining C pigs (C2). For AMR genes, the most abundant genes, tet(Q) (35.7%) and mef(A) (12.7%), were markedly observed in the ABF group, whereas tet(Q) (26.2%) and tet(W) (10.4%) were prominently shown in the C group. tet(Q) was positively correlated with Prevotella in ABF and C1 samples. In the C2 group, the prominent tet(W) was positively correlated with Fusobacterium and Bacteroides. The pigs studied here have never received tetracycline, but pregnant sows received chlortetracycline once every 7 days before parturition. Chromosomal Cu and Zn resistance genes were also shown in both groups regardless of the received Cu and Zn feed additives. A higher abundance of multimetal resistance genes was observed in the C group (44%) than with the ABF group (41%). In conclusion, the microbiome clusters in some C pigs were similar to that in ABF pigs. Highabundance tetracycline resistance genes interrelated to major bacteria were observed in both ABF and C pigs. MRGs were also observed. IMPORTANCE AMR is an increasing problem in farm animals, and raising farm animals without antibiotics is one method that could solve this problem. Our study showed that only some tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes, tet(Q), tet(W), and mef (A), were markedly abundant in ABF and C groups. The tet(Q) and tet(W) genes interrelated to different predominant bacteria in each group, showing the potential role of major bacteria as reservoirs of AMR genes. In addition, chromosomal Cu and Zn resistance genes were also observed in both pig groups, independent of the use of Cu and Zn additives on both farms. The association of MRGs and AMR genotypes and phenotypes, together with the method to resensitize bacteria to antibiotics, should be studied further to unveil the cause of genes conferring high-level resistance and solve these problems.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental, Immunology","Biotechnology, Food Science, Ecology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Valid reproductive seasonality data are also still lacking for many wild macaque populations because the majority of birth data are from captive animals living outside of their geographic range. We evaluated whether the reproductive seasonality of wild northern pig-tailed macaques falls as expected by the ecological (latitude) or phylogenetic inertia hypotheses in comparison with other macaque species. We recorded monthly occurrences of births (N = 22), copulations (N = 563), and females exhibiting sex skin swellings (N = 18) in one group at Khao Yai National Park (KYNP), Thailand. Births, copulations, and females exhibiting sex skin swellings were significantly different from a random distribution. Using measures of circular statistics and the van Schaik and colleagues’ (Schaik et al. Lee (ed), Comparative primate socioecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999) seasonality categorizations, the population at KYNP is best characterized as moderately seasonal breeding. Despite some inconsistency, macaque reproductive seasonality was significantly influenced by latitudinal location. We broadly found that: (1) non-seasonal breeding macaque populations (birth r-vector < 0.3) lived at latitudes close to the equator between 1°S and 3°N, (2) moderately seasonal breeding macaque populations (0.3 < birth r-vector < 0.7) were found between 3°N and 14°N and at 5°S, and (3) strictly seasonal breeding macaque populations (birth r-vector > 0.7) ranged ≥ 12°N. A strong phylogenetic signal in reproductive seasonality on the macaque phylogeny was also detected. However, further studies of wild macaque populations are still needed to better characterize reproductive seasonality in this taxon.","animal ecology; mammals; autecology and behaviour, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Animal Science and Zoology

Generally, Camp and Stein G t parameter is recommended to evaluate clarifier efficiency, where G stands for a global velocity gradient and t a characteristic time scale (contact time). In this work, a quasi-two-dimensional jet clarifier is developed to make easier the hydrodynamic analysis of the flocculation zone of a jet clarifier. Measurements of instantaneous velocity field are performed by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV). PIV data are processed to visualise the strong circulation induced by the jet in the flocculation zone. Characteristic time scales related to macromixing are then extracted. Based on PIV data processing, local and instantaneous shear rate are estimated. The analysis of space averaged velocity gradient G is presented. The range of G is 2–15 s−1 whereas the residence time decreases from 4 to 1 h. Based on the hydrodynamic analysis, the parameter Gt is shown to be constant around 30,000 for different jet flow rates. Efficiency of such jet clarifier can thus be foreseen.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Methods: This was a cross sectional study of 6,045 seventh grade students selected using a multistage design. Self-administered questionnaires relating to the socio-demographic characteristics, history of cigarette and e-cigarette uses, friends’ and family’s use of e-cigarettes, knowledge and perception of e-cigarette use, history of alcohol uses, and life assets were gathered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the variables and their association with e-cigarette use. Results: Prevalence of ever e-cigarette use was 7.2% and current e-cigarette use was 3.7%. We found that current cigarette smoking (AOR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.05-8.94), parental e-cigarette use (AOR 6.08, 95% CI: 2.81-13.17), peer e-cigarette use (AOR 3.82, 95% CI: 2.19-6.65), peer approval of smoking (AOR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.11-3.41), and unaware of e-cigarettes’ risk (AOR 5.25, 95% CI: 2.67-10.34). were significantly associated with current use of e-cigarettes. Male sex, poor academic achievement, and poor life assets (power of wisdom) were only significantly associated with ever e-cigarette use. Conclusion: Prevalence of current e-cigarette use among Thai middle school students did not change significantly since the government banned importation and sales of e-cigarettes in 2015, suggesting that the Thai ban has been a success. Factors associated with e-cigarette use among Thai youth were consistent with other countries. Ever e-cigarette use, increased, but less than in countries without a ban.

Live attenuated vaccine produced from a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant strain of L. interrogans serovar Manilae M1352 (Live M1352) stimulated better protective efficacy than heat killed M1352 (HK M1352) against a heterologous challenge with L. interrogans serovar Pomona. To identify antigens of Live M1352 potentially responsible for cross protection, in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT), a powerful tool to identify in vivo-induced (ivi) genes expressed during infection, was employed in this study. Pooled sera from hamsters immunized with Live M1352 were sequentially adsorbed with various preparations of in vitro grown M1352. The pre-adsorbed sera were used to screen a genomic expression library of M1352. Nineteen strongly reactive clones were selected for DNA sequencing. These ivi genes are conserved in most Leptospira strains. Four selected genes including LIMLP_04965 (tolB), LIMLP_01535, LIMLP_06785 (fliI), and LIMLP_14930 were confirmed for their upregulated expression in kidneys of infected hamsters by RT-qPCR, suggesting their role in leptospiral infection. These ivi proteins represent potential targets for vaccine candidates that warrant further investigation for their protective efficacy.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Veterinary (all)"

Materials and methods: Medical data from the questionnaires and physical examinations of 1850 participants aged 47‒73 years from EGAT study were gathered. Random half-mouth periodontal examination of each participant was performed by calibrated periodontists, and periodontal status was defined. The incidence of new CVD events, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, was verified by cardiologists. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). Results: The prevalence of no/mild, moderate and severe periodontitis in the study participants was 11.7%, 52.7% and 35.6%, respectively. During the 13-year follow-up, CVD events occurred in 110 (5.9%) participants, with 82 (4.4%) from CHD and 28 (1.5%) from stroke. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, a significant association between severe periodontitis and the incidence of CHD was found compared with the no/mild periodontitis group with an HR of 4.53 (95% confidence intervals: 1.08‒19.02). However, no significant association was seen when considering total CVD events and stroke outcome. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that severe periodontitis is associated with an increased incidence of CHD, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.",dentistry,Periodontics
Incorporating biological networks into high-dimensional Bayesian survival analysis using an ICM/M algorithm,Pungpapong V.,2021-10-01,"Algorithms, Bayes Theorem, Genomics, Humans, Proportional Hazards Models, Cox model, empirical Bayes variable selection, gene regulatory network, high-dimensional data, iterated conditional modes/medians, Survival analysis","The Cox proportional hazards model has been widely used in cancer genomic research that aims to identify genes from high-dimensional gene expression space associated with the survival time of patients. With the increase in expertly curated biological pathways, it is challenging to incorporate such complex networks in fitting a high-dimensional Cox model. This paper considers a Bayesian framework that employs the Ising prior to capturing relations among genes represented by graphs. A spike-and-slab prior is also assigned to each of the coefficients for the purpose of variable selection. The iterated conditional modes/medians (ICM/M) algorithm is proposed for the implementation for Cox models. The ICM/M estimates hyperparameters using conditional modes and obtains coefficients through conditional medians. This procedure produces some coefficients that are exactly zero, making the model more interpretable. Comparisons of the ICM/M and other regularized Cox models were carried out with both simulated and real data. Compared to lasso, adaptive lasso, elastic net, and DegreeCox, the ICM/M yielded more parsimonious models with consistent variable selection. The ICM/M model also provided a smaller number of false positives than the other methods and showed promising results in terms of predictive accuracy. In terms of computing times among the network-aware methods, the ICM/M algorithm is substantially faster than DegreeCox even when incorporating a large complex network. The implementation of the ICM/M algorithm for Cox regression model is provided in R package icmm, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).","biochemistryistry, computer science","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Computer Science Applications"

In this study, the depressurized regeneration using a circulating fluidized bed downer was proposed and the significance of its operating parameters was identified. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics were employed to systematically investigate the effects of operating parameters on carbon dioxide depressurized regeneration with potassium carbonate solid sorbent particles. The simulated model was based on a laboratory scale circulating fluidized bed downer. The chemical equilibrium model for predicting the highest outlet carbon dioxide mass fraction was then used. A central composite design was employed to identify the main, quadratic, and interaction effects of operating parameters to the regeneration process. The operating parameters consisted of the outlet system pressure, inlet gas velocity, and inlet solid circulation rate, while the response variable was the released outlet carbon dioxide mass fraction. Among the multiple operating parameters, there were two main operating parameters and their combinations, namely the inlet gas velocity, outlet system pressure, square of inlet gas velocity, and interaction between inlet gas velocity and outlet system pressure, which had great impacts on the regeneration. All the main, quadratic, and interaction effects were explained. Then, the optimal operating conditions were obtained through the response surface method.",physics,Condensed Matter Physics
Pyrrolidinyl Peptide Nucleic Acid Probes Capable of Crosslinking with DNA: Effects of Terminal and Internal Modifications on Crosslink Efficiency,"Muangkaew P., Vilaivan T.",2021-01-05,"Cross-Linking Reagents, DNA, Molecular Structure, Peptide Nucleic Acids, Pyrrolidines, Crosslinks, DNA, furan, interstrand crosslinking (ICL), PNA","In this study, we describe a furan-modified acpcPNA as a probe that can form an interstrand crosslink (ICL) with its DNA target upon activation with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). To overcome the problem of furan instability under acidic conditions, a simple and versatile post-synthetic methodology for the attachment of the furan group to the PNA probe was developed. Unlike in other designs, the furan was placed at the end of the PNA molecule or tethered to the PNA backbone with all the base pairs in the PNA ⋅ DNA duplexes fully preserved. Hence, the true reactivity of each nucleobase towards the crosslinking could be compared. We show that all DNA bases except T could participate in the crosslinking reaction when the furan was placed at the end of the PNA strand. The crosslinking process was sensitive to mispairing, and lower crosslinking efficiency was observed in the presence of a base-mismatch in the PNA ⋅ DNA duplex. In contrast, when the furan was placed at internal positions of the acpcPNA ⋅ DNA duplex, no ICL was observed; this was explained by the inability of a hydrogen-bonded nucleobase to participate in the crosslinking reaction. The crosslinking efficiency was considerably improved, despite lower duplex stability, when an unpaired base (in the form of C-insertion) was present in the complementary DNA strand close to the furan modification site.","genetics and molecular biology; molecular genetics; molecular biology techniques, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Organic Chemistry"

At least half of RSV-related deaths are estimated to occur in the community, but clinical characteristics of this group of children remain poorly characterized. Methods: The RSV Global Online Mortality Database (RSV GOLD), a global registry of under-5 children who have died with RSV-related illness, describes clinical characteristics of children dying of RSV through global data sharing. RSV GOLD acts as a collaborative platform for global deaths, including community mortality studies described in this supplement. We aimed to compare the age distribution of infant deaths <6 months occurring in the community with in-hospital. Results: We studied 829 RSV-related deaths <1 year of age from 38 developing countries, including 166 community deaths from 12 countries. There were 629 deaths that occurred <6 months, of which 156 (25%) occurred in the community. Among infants who died before 6 months of age, median age at death in the community (1.5 months; IQR: 0.8-3.3) was lower than in-hospital (2.4 months; IQR: 1.5-4.0; P<.0001). The proportion of neonatal deaths was higher in the community (29%, 46/156) than in-hospital (12%, 57/473, P<0.0001). Conclusions: We observed that children in the community die at a younger age. We expect that maternal vaccination or immunoprophylaxis against RSV will have a larger impact on RSV-related mortality in the community than in-hospital. This case series of RSV-related community deaths, made possible through global data sharing, allowed us to assess the potential impact of future RSV vaccines.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

In this study, the integrated spatial technology between remote sensing, digital mapping, GIS, and RUSLE were used to conduct the approach in deciding the source of contamination in the basin. According to the results, the significant anthropogenic activity which can release the highest cadmium's level was determined as the cornfield in the upstream. With the potential cadmium flux from erosion ranged from 279.86 to 703.73 t/ha/year and 0.77 correlation factor to the cadmium contamination level in the creeks, the soil surface and corn collected from the upstream were investigated using FAAS and Micro XRF for validation. The cadmium transported by upstream soil surface may not affect the Cd contamination in the downstream so that the contamination's source be from other anthropogenic activities.

Methods A 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up was conducted among healthy but high-risk office workers. Participants were recruited from six organizations in Bangkok, Thailand (N=193) and randomly assigned at cluster level into active break intervention (N=47), postural shift intervention (N=46), and control (N=100) groups. Participants in the intervention groups received a custom-designed apparatus to facilitate designated active breaks and postural shifts during work. Participants in the control group received a placebo seat pad. The primary outcome measure was new onset of neck and low-back pain during 6-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results One-hundred and eighty-six (96%) predominantly female participants were successfully followed up over six months. New onset of neck pain during the 6-month follow-up occurred in 17%, 17%, and 44% of the participants in the active break, postural shift, and control groups, respectively. For new onset of low-back pain, these percentages were 9%, 7%, and 33%, respectively.

However, acetabular parameters in small-breed dogs are rarely reported. Objectives: To investigate acetabular parameters using radiography and computed tomography (CT) in small-breed dogs with Maltese and Shih Tzu dogs used as model breeds. Methods: Standard calibrated, extended hip radiographs and CT images were obtained. Subsequently, acetabular width (AW) in various directions was measured using radiography and CT, whereas acetabular depth (AD) was obtained by CT. Acetabular index (AI) is a ratio calculated from AD and AW. Results: The values of AW and AD were much higher in Shih Tzu than in Maltese dogs. Male Shih Tzus showed higher values of these parameters than females, while sex-based differences in most of the parameters could not be detected in Maltese. Body weight, but not age, influenced AWs and ADs. While AWs and ADs were influenced by several factors, AI was comparable among the assessed factors and between Maltese and Shih Tzu dogs (p = 0.172; 31.42 ± 1.35 and 32.60 ± 1.80, respectively). Also, AI did not vary with breed, sex, or body size.

Herein, lignin depolymerization was investigated over Ni2P catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped activated carbon (Ni2P/AC_N). The catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness co-impregnation method followed by reduction with H2 gas. The presence of nitrogen-containing functional groups on the activated carbon surface resulted in the dispersion of Ni2P particles. The good distribution and small crystal size of Ni2P significantly increased the active surface area, which enhanced both the catalytic activity and phenol selectivity. Investigations of the catalytic activity at different reaction temperatures and lignin-to-catalyst ratios using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the highest phenol selectivity of 80% was achieved using the Ni2P/AC_N25% catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism involves lignin depolymerization via C–O and C–C cleavage with subsequent phenol formation by demethoxylation. Owing to its high phenol selectivity, the Ni2P/AC_N catalyst has good potential for the transformation of lignin to phenol.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study of 2888 Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) employees aged 44–78 years was conducted. The severity of periodontitis was evaluated based on mean clinical attachment level (CAL). The percentage of sites with CAL ≥ 5 mm was used to divide the extent of periodontitis into healthy (0%), localized (> 0–< 30%), and generalized (≥ 30%). The CAVI value, a novel blood pressure-independent arterial stiffness parameter, was analyzed as both continuous and categorical data (low: < 9 or high: ≥ 9). Regression analysis was used to estimate the level of association. Results: The participants demonstrated a mean CAL, % sites with CAL ≥ 5 mm, and a CAVI value of 3.2 ± 1.2 mm, 16.0 ± 20.8%, and 8.24 ± 1.12, respectively. Higher mean CAVI was observed with greater mean CAL and % sites with CAL ≥ 5 mm.

Virtual power plant (VPP) provides a framework for solar power aggregation and optimization to participate in wholesale energy trading while also behaving more permissible concerning grid cooperation. This paper presents a solar power aggregation framework for VPP operation which consists of multiple solar power plants, each of which is rated 10 MW or above, also defined as a small power producer (SPP) by contracted capacity. The formulated optimization problem is to obtain the maximum profit of the VPP operation in energy trading of a day-ahead market (DAM), and to comply with the required hourly ramp-rate limit of the aggregated power. In this study, DAM price is assumed hourly varying, with reference to New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The optimal solution of the hourly SPPs' generated power commitments is solved by linear programming (LP). Test results from the case studies with 6 SPPs combined, at most, show that profit per capacity can be improved by 1.22%, and profit coefficient of variation can be improved by 8.14%. Furthermore, the aggregated power characteristics can be more effectively smoothen using the constraints of ramp-rate limit and the bias term of ramp-rate cost.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Strategy and Management, Computer Networks and Communications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Hydroclimate variability of central Indo-Pacific region during the Holocene,"Chawchai S., Tan L., Lowemark L., Wang H.-C., Yu T.-L., Chung Y.-C., Mii H.-S., Liu G., Blaauw M., Gong S.-Y., Wohlfarth B., Shen C.-C.",2021-02-01,"Drought conditions, Early Holocene, Insolation gradients, Intertropical convergence zone, Positive changes, Southeast Asia, Southern oscillation, Southern Thailand, Central Indo-Pacific region, Holocene, ITCZ, Stalagmite, Thai-Malay peninsula","Here we present a decadal-resolved hydroclimate record covering the past 11 thousand years based on δ18O data of three stalagmites from Klang Cave (TK) on the Thai-Malay Peninsula, southern Thailand. The δ18O values indicate wetter conditions/more rainfall during the early Holocene from 11 to 7 thousand years before present (kyr BP). A large increase of 2‰ in δ18O is observed from 7.0 to 6.0 kyr BP, indicating a millennial drying period followed by drought conditions between 6.0 and 5.2 kyr BP. After a long hiatus (5.2–2.7 kyr BP), δ18O data show a millennium-long trend toward dry conditions. An abrupt positive change of 0.8–1.0‰ in δ18O is noticed between 8.29 and 8.17 kyr BP, reflecting the 8.2-ka event; however, the amplitude of the δ18O shift is much smaller comparing to that of the event of 6.0–5.2 kyr BP. On orbital time-scales, the TK record agrees with insolation-dominated speleothem records in the Asian-Australian monsoon realm. Noticeable inconsistencies among records in the Southeast Asia region (between 8°N and 4°N–8°S) have been documented on multi-centennial scales. Lower δ18O values are likely associated with the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A new reconstruction of Holocene ITCZ shifts index within the central Indo-Pacific region, based on stalagmite δ18O records from Klang Cave (8°N) and Liang Luar Cave (8°S), shows that the ITCZ played an important role in hydroclimate variability in the Asian-Australian monsoon regions. The southward shift of the ITCZ in the central Indo-Pacific region, controlled by the interhemispheric extratropical insolation gradient, may strongly correlate with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities in the Holocene.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; environmentalronments, the atmosphere, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

All films exhibited a hexagonal wurtzite structure with a high preferential c-axis orientation. The surface morphology showed a good uniformity with cracks and wrinkles. The transmittance decreased with thickness. The bandgap energy was inversely varying with coating number. Photoluminescence spectra showed ultraviolet with strong and weak blue and weak green emission peaks. Density functional theory and Hubbard (DFT + U) method was then applied to study the structural, electronic, and optical properties of pure and 6.25% Mn-doped ZnO materials. A decrease in bandgap energy from pure to 6.25% Mn-doped ZnO material was shown using the DFT + U method. It also found that the Mn3d states were distributed far from Fermi level with a coexistence of both ionic and covalent nature bonds. A slight shift toward the lower energy was noticed for optical properties by Mn doping. The theoretical findings showed a similar behavior to those obtained by experiment.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 490 postmenopausal Thai women with osteopenia. All had no known history of low-trauma fracture, no underlying diseases, or history of taking medications that affect bone metabolism. Morphometric VFs were assessed by thoracolumbar spine x-rays, using the Genant semiquantitative method, and interpreted independently by three radiologists. Results: Mean age of participants was 59.9±7.8 years and mean body mass index was 24.3±3.4 kg/m2. Morphometric VFs were present in 29% (142/490) of women (grade 1: 62.0%, grade 2: 19.3%, and grade 3: 18.7%). Of these, 4.9% were aged 50 years or less, 40.1% were aged 50-59 years, 38% were aged 60-69 years, and 16.9% were aged over 70 years. Age and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) scores for hip and major osteoporotic fracture, with or without bone mineral density, were positively correlated with VF. No differences in fracture prevalence among those with various degrees of osteopenia. Applying the current guidelines for VF screening results in discoveries of less than a half of osteopenic women who have had morphometric VF. Conclusions: Almost one third of apparently healthy postmenopausal women with osteopenia had morphometric VF.

While the current control measures on traffic pollution have reduced particulate matter, new solutions by emerging vehicular technologies can help protect citizens from exhaust-gas emissions. The electric vehicle (EV) is a promising solution to alleviate traffic-induced pollution in urban areas. However, traffic flow will be mixed with fuel vehicles (FVs) and EVs before the FV would be phased out. In this paper, traffic management by road pricing is introduced to reduce the tailpipe emission of the protected area by imposing environmental capacity constraints for network traffic mixed with EVs and FVs. Second-best toll pricing schemes are formulated as side constrained user equilibrium problems for both fixed demand and elastic demand cases. Both the tailpipe emission of FVs and the energy consumption of EVs are assumed to depend nonlinearly on network traffic conditions. Although the EVs do not contribute to the tailpipe emission, all vehicles contribute to congestion externality that induces more emission of FVs. Therefore, both types of vehicles are charged, but the toll on FVs is significantly higher than that on EVs. A new projected dynamics based algorithm is introduced to solve the toll from the Lagrange multiplier associated with the environmental constraint apart from the equilibrium flow. Numerical examples are conducted to evaluate the equilibrium cost and toll, and to analyze the impacts of EV penetration rate on the pricing scheme.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Automotive Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications"

To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the microplastic distribution in Bandon Bay, one of the most important maricultural areas of Thailand. Water and sediment samples from the Tapi-Phumduang River system (n = 10) and Bandon Bay (n = 5) were collected. Water sampling at the river mouth was carried out during a complete tidal cycle to estimate the microplastic flux to the bay during the wet season. Moreover, two commercial bivalve species grown in the bay, the green mussel (Perna viridis) and lyrate Asiatic hard clam (Meretrix lyrata), were analyzed. More items of microplastics were found in the river system than in the bay. During the tide cycle, one-third of the microplastics entering the bay were washed back upstream during high tide. This backflow consisted mainly of larger microplastics. The average daily load of microplastics to the bay was 22.4 × 109 items day−1. The load during low tide was approximately 4–5 times higher than that during high tide. The overall accumulation of microplastics in the bottom sediments of the river and in the bay was similar (p < 0.05). Green mussels showed significantly higher contamination with microplastics than clams. Notably, the small-sized shellfish contained more particles (items/g) than the large ones (p < 0.05). Fibers were detected in virtually all samples: water (98%), sediment (94%), mussels (100%), and clams (95%). Among these, microfibers (<1 mm) were detected in water (71%), sediment (63%), green mussels (63%), and clams (52%). Blue and white particles were the two most frequently observed colors, while the most dominant polymers were rayon, followed by polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and nylon. To this end, we posit that river discharge was a significant source of microplastics in Bandon Bay, with minor additional contributions from fishing and mariculture activities within the bay. Ultimately, these microplastics may end up in the sediments and living organisms.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; marine, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Detailed studies, particularly in the pediatric population, have not been performed. The primary purpose of this study is to describe clinical characteristics, polysomnographic findings, and management of children treated with VNS. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records and polysomnography data was performed in patients ages 0–20 years old receiving VNS therapy for refractory epilepsy at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Results: 22 subjects met the inclusion criteria. 50% were male. The mean age at the time of VNS insertion was 8.4 ± 4.0 years. The mean age at the first PSG was 10.6 ± 4.3 years. Common presentations to sleep clinics included snoring (77.3%), frequent nighttime awakening (68.1%), and parasomnias (63.6%). The median apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 4.5/hr (IQR 3.0–13.1) and the median obstructive index (OI) was 4.1/hr (1.5–12.8). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was diagnosed after VNS insertion in 19 patients (86.4%), 8 of which (36.3%) had severe OSA. Six patients (27.3%) had significant hypoventilation. For management, 6 patients (27.2%) were treated with bilevel PAP, 3 patients (13.6%) with CPAP, 2 patients (9.1%) with ventilator, 4 patients (18.2%) with upper airway surgeries, and 9 patients (40.9%) received medications only. Conclusions: SDB is common in pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy managed with VNS who were referred to sleep medicine clinics. Both OSA and nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation are relatively common in this population. Management of SDB often involves the use of positive airway pressure therapy or upper airway surgeries. Further studies are needed to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and the effect of treatments on epilepsy control. This study highlights the need for screening of SDB prior to and following VNS implantation.",medical,Medicine (all)
Spatial and temporal distributions of stable isotopes in precipitation over Thailand,"Laonamsai J., Ichiyanagi K., Kamdee K., Putthividhya A., Tanoue M.",2021-01-01,"Correlation coefficient, Isotopically enriched, Meteoric water lines, Negative correlation, Rayleigh distillation, Seasonal precipitations, Spatial and temporal distribution, Spatial and temporal variation, d-excess, monsoon, rainfall, stable isotopes in precipitation; isotopic fractionation effect, δ18O","Spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic composition of precipitation over Thailand were investigated. The local meteoric water line for Thailand deviates slightly from the global meteoric water line, with lower slopes (7.62 ± 0.07, 7.59 ± 0.08) and intercepts (6.42 ± 0.39, 6.22 ± 0.42) using ordinary and precipitation weighted methods. Differences in spatial and temporal δ18O distributions between the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climate zones were found due to differing moisture source contributions and seasonal precipitation patterns. The temporal data reveals that the northeast monsoon rains originate from isotopically-enriched local moisture with isotope values of −9.36 to −0.09‰ (mean − 3.73 ± 0.42‰), whereas the southwest monsoon clouds had a more significant rainout effect from Rayleigh distillation, with isotope values of −9.56 to −1.78‰ (mean − 5.40 ± 0.38‰). The precipitation amount at each site was negatively correlated with δ18O (−0.24 to −3.20‰ per 100 mm, R2 = 0.1–0.9). Furthermore, δ18O was negatively correlated with geography (latitude, altitude) for the southwest monsoon periods, as expected based on other observed correlations. However, an inverse correlation was seen in the northeast monsoon due to differing moisture transportation as part of the continental effect. The correlation coefficient (R) was higher in the southwest monsoon (−0.84 for latitude effect, −0.64 for altitude effect) than the northeast monsoon (0.67 for latitude effect, 0.35 for altitude effect). The spatial pattern of isotopic composition reflects the southwest monsoon more clearly than the northeast monsoon, but the two monsoons also have a cancelling impact on orographic patterns. An agreement of the δ18O and deuterium excess (d-excess) was a negative correlation and found to reflect precipitation sources and re-evaporation processes. The d-excess was slightly higher for the northeast monsoon, bringing moisture from the Pacific Ocean and travelling across the continent before reaching the observed stations. By contrast, the d-excess was relatively lower for the Indian Ocean's moisture in the southwest monsoon.","precipitation quality, environmental",Water Science and Technology

In this present work, a set of alkaloids and flavonoids against AChE enzyme were screened by computational chemistry techniques. The docking results showed that among alkaloid compounds the oxindole alkaloid namely mitragynine oxidole B (MITOB) and the indole alkaloids namely mitragynine (MIT) exhibited a good binding affinity towards AChE. These two compounds were then studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding free energy calculation and ligand–protein binding pattern suggested that both alkaloids could interact with AChE very well. Since MIT is the main alkaloid constituent of Mytragyna speciose leaves, this compound was isolated from M. speciose leaves and tested for anti-AChE activity. As a result, the isolated MIT had an inhibitory activity with pIC50 value of 3.57. This finding provided that the mitragynine compound has the potential to be as a therapeutic agent for further anti-AChE drug development in treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

The surgical options for correction of the angular deformity of the MCP joint in Wassel type IV thumb polydactyly were retrospectively reviewed. The preoperative angular deformity of the MCP joint and the last postoperative residual deformity at MCP joint were measured from the radiograph of thumb posteroanterior view. The cut-off point of the preoperative MCP angulation that provided less residual deformity in patients who were treated by soft tissue procedures alone was identified from receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 45 patients with 46 thumb polydactyly (Wassel type IV) were studied. Mean pre and postoperative MCP angulation were 24.01 (range 0-68°) and 14.65 (range 0-39°), respectively. Thirty-four thumbs from 33 patients (73.91%) were operated on by soft tissue procedures alone and 12 thumbs (26.09%) needed corrective osteotomy. The best cut-off point of preoperative MCP angulation that showed less significant residual deformity when treated by soft tissue procedure alone was 30° (96.43% sensitivity and 100% specificity). In MCP angulation ≤30°, soft tissue reconstruction alone was an effective method for correction of angular deformity with predictable outcome of no significant residual deformity (0/27 thumbs). In MCP angulation >30°, corrective osteotomy is recommended over soft tissue procedure alone due to achieve proper thumb position and adequate soft tissue balance. There is also a statistical decrease in significant residual deformity [from 85.71% (6/7 cases, treated by soft tissue procedure alone) to 30% (3/10 cases, treated by corrective osteotomy), P < 0.05]. This study proposes the use of preoperative MCP joint angular deformity as a guide to the type of surgical intervention in Wassel type IV thumb polydactyly.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

We sought to understand the associations between patient-reported appetite and clinical outcomes. Methods: In the Thailand Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS), 690 of 848 randomly selected PD patients from 22 facilities reported their appetite by using the short form (three items) of the Appetite and Diet Assessment Tool (ADAT), between 2016 and 2018. In this questionnaire, the patients rated their appetite as well as a change in appetite over time. Cox proportional hazards model regression was used to estimating associations between self-reported appetite and clinical outcomes, including mortality, haemodialysis (HD) transfer and peritonitis. Results: Half of the PD patients reported a good appetite, whereas 34% and 16% reported fair and poor appetites, respectively. Poor appetite was more prevalent among female, diabetic, congestive heart failure, older age and patients who had worse nutritional indicators, including lower time-averaged serum albumin and serum creatinine concentrations, as well as a higher proportions of hypokalaemia and severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3 g/dl). After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and PD vintage, poor appetite was associated with increased risks of peritonitis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–2.62), HD transfer (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24–4.10) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08–2.39) compared to patients with good appetite. Conclusion: Patient-reported poor appetite was independently associated with higher risks of peritonitis, HD transfer and all-cause mortality.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available strategies for lowering protein-bound uremic toxin levels in CKD patients. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by searching the databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of dietary protein restrictions, biotic supplements (including prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics), AST-120, dialysis techniques, and the outcome of preservation of residual renal function (RRF) on indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate levels. Random-effect model meta-analyses were used to compute changes in the outcomes of interest. Results: A total of 38 articles (2,492 patients), comprising 28 RCTs, 8 single-arm or prospective cohort studies, and 2 cross-sectional studies were included in this meta-analysis. When compared with placebo, prebiotics, synbiotics, and AST-120 provided significantly lower levels of both serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate. There were no significant reductions in serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate levels in patients receiving probiotics. Preservation of RRF in dialysis patients resulted in lower levels of both of the protein-bound uremic toxins. When compared with conventional hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration significantly decreased serum p-cresyl sulfate alone, whereas a significant change in serum indoxyl sulfate levels was observed only in studies with long-term observation periods. Very low protein diet (VLPD) and other oral medications yielded insignificant differences in protein-bound uremic toxins. Conclusions: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that prebiotics, synbiotics, and AST-120 can effectively reduce both serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate in CKD patients when compared with placebo. Preservation of RRF was associated with lower serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate levels. The effect of biotic supplements was detected only in dialysis patients. For non-dialysis CKD patients, the results were limited due to the small number of studies. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy in these populations.",medical,Nephrology

As a result, water contact angle of carbon-WC deposited coir pulp was 123.4°, whereas that of coir pulp was 82.8°. The carbon-WC deposited coir pulp was then used as a filler in polylactic acid (PLA) to attain composite films of PLA/carbon-WC deposited coir pulp. The deposition of carbon-WC on coir pulp not only increased hydrophobicity of coir pulp but also improved compatibility between the filler and PLA. Even at the low filler content of 0.75 wt%, tensile strength and Young’s modulus of composite films of PLA/carbon-WC deposited coir pulp increased up to 45.73% and 22.79%, respectively compared with those of neat PLA film. Furthermore, the presence of carbon-WC deposited coir pulp in the PLA composite films could enhance the formation of crystalline structure of PLA. Accordingly, SPP is an interesting tool for surface modification of coir pulp in order to achieve surface-functionalized coir pulp for using as a filler in green composites.

This study adopts a two-step model with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to calculate and predict the isothermal torrefaction kinetics of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin under the torrefaction temperatures of 200, 250, and 300 °C. A thermogravimetric analyzer is coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared (TG-FTIR) spectrometer to analyze the instantaneous weight losses and released gaseous products. The predictions suggest that cellulose shows the greatest weight loss and generates the most volatile products (81.70%) followed by a final residue (18.29%) at the isothermal torrefaction temperature of 300 °C. Hemicelluloses have severe weight loss at 250 °C, owing to their relatively weak structure compared to cellulose. The final residue yield is in the range of 60.04–74.05%, and the second prevalent product is the intermediate ranging from 3.34 to 8.20%. Lignin shows higher thermal resistance to torrefaction and produces the most intermediate under the isothermal torrefaction at temperatures lower than 300 °C, accounting for 86.41–97.50%. The activation energies of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin are in the range of 166–260, 48–55, and 59–70 kJ mol−1, respectively. The FTIR spectra indicate that CO and CO2 are the dominant gases in the torrefaction of the three model compounds due to the cleavages of methoxyl, ether, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The severity of COVID-19 relates to hyperinflammatory conditions with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to multiple-organ failure and death. Innate immunity plays an important role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and regulates the pathogenesis and its clinical outcomes. The most severe cases of COVID-19 present with increased innate immune cell infiltration in the lung, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood serum that are associated with disease severity. Here we review the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the recent reports and discuss the potential roles of innate immune cells and their mediators in pathogenesis that dictate the outcome of the disease.

Thus, a method for converting this abundant source of biomass to useful chemicals, such as lactic acid, would be beneficial. In this study, we determined the catalytic activities of various metal oxides for chitin conversion at 533 K and found that MgO showed the highest activity for lactic acid production. X-ray diffraction analysis and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis showed that the MgO was transformed to Mg(OH)2 during chitin conversion. The highest yield of lactic acid (10.8 %) was obtained when the reaction was carried out for 6 h with 0.5 g of the MgO catalyst. The catalyst could be recovered as a solid residue after the reaction and reused twice with no decrease in the lactic acid yield.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Chemistry (all)

It is challenging to detect and segment since it doesn't have a concrete boundary and its shape is flat. Furthermore, it is crucial for the model to perform in real-Time fashion during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promising segmentation performance, they have failed to constrain inference speed. In this paper, we propose to employ a segmentation network called 'Fast Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network (Fast-SCNN)' to highlight GIM areas in realtime. We also present 'the edge-guided path' as an addition in the network to improve model accuracy. The model is based upon 802 GIM images that were retrieved from Chulalongkorn Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The results show that the model can perform in a real-Time environment having 55.01 average frames per second and achieved a 79.56% Fl-score having around 80% sensitivity.

Biodiesel sustainability: The global impact of potential biodiesel production on the energy–water–food (EWF) nexus,"Chong C.T., Loe T.Y., Wong K.Y., Ashokkumar V., Lam S.S., Chong W.T., Borrion A., Tian B., Ng J.-H.",2021-05-01,"Biodiesel feedstock, Biodiesel production, Environmental correlations, Environmental policy, Light-duty diesel engines, Renewable energy sector, Water requirements, Water stress indices, Biodiesel, EWF nexus, Food stress, Sustainability, Water stress","A data-driven model is used to analyse the global effects of biodiesel on the energy–water–food (EWF) nexus, and to understand the complex environmental correlation. Several criteria to measure the sustainability of biodiesel and four main limiting factors for biodiesel production are discussed in this paper. The limiting factors includes water stress, food stress, feedstock quantity and crude oil price. The 155-country model covers crude oil prices ranging from USD10/bbl to USD160/bbl, biodiesel refinery costs ranging from -USD0.30/L to USD0.30/L and 45 multi-generation biodiesel feedstocks. The model is capable of ascertaining changes arising from biodiesel adoption in terms of light-duty diesel engine emissions (NO, CO, UHC and smoke opacity), water stress index (WSI), dietary energy supply (DES), Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI) and short-term energy security. With the addition of potential biodiesel production, the renewable energy sector of global primary energy profile can increase by 0.43%, with maximum increment up to 10.97% for Malaysia. At current crude oil price of USD75/bbl and refinery cost of USD0.1/L, only Benin, Ireland and Togo can produce biodiesel profitably. The model also shows that water requirement varies non-linearly with multi-feedstock biodiesel production as blending ratio increases. Out of the 155 countries, biodiesel production is limited by feedstock quantity for 82 countries, 47 are limited by crude oil price, 20 by water stress and 6 by food stress. The results provide insights for governments to set up environmental policy guidelines, in implementing biodiesel technology as a cleaner alternative to diesel.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Science (all), Soil Science, Plant Science"

The use of fly ash offers several benefits such as reducing the fly ash disposal cost, solving environmental problems, and significantly increasing high valued products. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of kraft lignin using ZSM-5/ SBA-15 catalyst prepared from fly ash was studied using a pyrolysis-GC/MS system. The influence of temperature (400–600°C) during thermal pyrolysis, the FA-ZSM-5 and FA-SBA-15 ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1), and lignin-to-catalyst ratios (1:5 and 1:10) on the hydrocarbon selectivity was investigated. Non-catalytic pyrolysis volatiles consisted of a high proportion of guaiacol compounds (G-type, 66.7%) and p-hydroxyl phenols (H-type, 18.0%). The presence of zeolite catalysts contributed to enhance both aliphatic and aromatic production, while a proportion of guaiacyl decreased significantly. The highest selectivity of aliphatic and aromatic HCs was achieved at feed to catalyst ratios of 1:10. Coupling HZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15 catalysts were more reactive in converting the alkoxy-phenol (G-type) and p-hydroxyphenyl compounds (P-type) toward both aliphatic HCs and monocyclic-aromatic HCs (MAHs), particularly benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). Among all catalysts, FA-ZSM-5/ FA-SBA-15 ratio of 1:2 showed the optimum dual catalyst ratio to enhance the highest yield of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons of 15.1 and 21.4 % with the acceptable yield of phenolic compounds (34%). ZSM-5/ SBA-15 catalyst prepared from fly ash showed high efficiency to convert solid lignin to MAHs (BTX). The decrease in the PAHs selectivity seemed to be good performing of this dual catalyst because it expected to decrease the coke formation on the catalyst surface.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

The purpose of this study is to define the localisation of MKH in reference to bony landmarks of the foot, its relationship to plantar neurovascular bundle and to investigate in situ and ex vivo length of FHL tendon in single incision, double incision and minimally invasive techniques. Materials and methods: Foot length was examined in 62 feet of 31 soft cadavers (9 males, 22 females). Various parameters including the relationship between MKH and neurovascular bundle, the distances from MKH to medial malleolus (MM), navicular tuberosity (NT) and the first interphalangeal joint of great toe (IP) were measured. Surface localisation of MKH in relation to a line joining the medial end of plantar flexion crease at the base of great toes (MC) to NT (MC-NT line) was determined. Lengths of FHL tendon graft from three surgical techniques were examined. In situ length was measured in the plantar surface of foot and ex vivo length was measured after tendon was cut from its insertion. Results: The mean length of foot was 230.98 ± 15.35 mm with a statistically significant difference between genders in both sides (p < 0.05). No distance was found between medial plantar neurovascular bundle (MPNVB) and MKH. Mean distance of 17.13 ± 3.55 mm was found between lateral plantar neurovascular bundle (LPNVB) and MKH.

MPs can be consumed and may be accumulated by filter-feeding organisms such as mussels. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the acute effects of different types, sizes and concentrations of artificially synthesized MPs on the mortality rate and MP accumulation of the green mussel Perna viridis. The samples were exposed to 66, 333, 666, and 1333 items/L of small MPs (<30 μm), medium MPs (30–300 μm), and large MPs (300–1000 μm) polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polybutylene succinate (PBS) for 96 h. MPs accumulation in the soft tissue of mussels and mortality effects from MPs ingestion were assessed. There was no mortality observed in the control group. Small PP particles can lead to more mortality than PS and PBS particles of the same size. However, medium- and large PS caused a higher mortality percentage than the same size particles of PP and PBS. Large PS, PP, and PBS showed higher mortality potential than other sizes. MPs largely accumulated in the soft tissues rather than in gill tissues following the 96-hour exposure period. Increased accumulation of the three types of MPs was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of mussel mortality. The study highlights how particle size and type are key factors in plastic particulate toxicity.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the modulation technique of 5G. However, OFDM suffers from a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This degrades the performance of the power amplifiers (PA). As a result, the PAPR deteriorates the overall power efficiency of the 5G system. So, it is often highly essential to find which type of OFDM signals results in high PAPR. This classification will enable PAPR reduction techniques such as Clipped-Control Tone Reservation (CC- TR) to focus effectively on the classes of OFDM signals that have high PAPRproblems. So, we have proposed a model of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying OFDM signals having high and low PAPR. Here we have compared our ANN's performance, by using different types of activation functions, optimizers, signal chunk samples, and input data types such as combinations of bits and complex symbols to demonstrate the varying estimation ability and accuracy of our ANN model.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 °C but at 600 °C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that can self-sustain water is the key component for developing a light-weight and compact PEMFC system without humidifiers. Hence, zeolite is employed to the anode catalyst layer in this study. The effect of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) materials, catalyst loading, binder loading, and zeolite loading on the MEA performance is investigated. The MEA durability is also investigated through the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method.

The catechin nanoemulsions (CaNE) were fabricated using ultrasonication and subjected to different stress conditions including pH (2–8), ionic strengths (200–1000 mmol/L NaCl) and temperatures (pasteurization, sterilization, and high pressure processing; HPP). Physical stability (droplet size and polydispersity index; PDI) and antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP values) of the CaNE were investigated during storage at 4 °C for 28 days. The developed CaNE showed good physical stability at various pH (2–8) and ionic strengths (200–600 mmol/L NaCl), whereas DPPH and FRAP values of the CaNE significantly decreased at pH > 6 and NaCl > 600 mmol/L. Pasteurization and sterilization induced an increase in droplet size and a decrease in antioxidant activity, whereas HPP had no effect on the CaNE. The efficiency of nanoemulsion to stabilize catechins in a high pressure processed catechin-fortified coconut milk (HPP-CM-CaNE) was investigated in comparison to HPP-CM and HPP-CM containing catechin solution (HPP-CM-Ca) during storage at 4 °C. The decrease in pH and antioxidant activity of HPP-CM-CaNE was less than those of HPP-CM-Ca, indicating that the nanoemulsion could enhance catechin stability in HPP-CM.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Smoking and Drinking Behaviors among Older Adults: A Comparative Analysis of Three Southeast Asian Countries,"Knodel J., Pothisiri W.",2021-12-01,"Aged, Aging, Asia, Southeastern, Drinking Behavior, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Smoking, Correlates, Drinking, Older adults, Prevalence, Smoking, Southeast Asia","Studies on the two major health-risk behaviors of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older populations, particularly in Southeast Asia, are limited. This paper provides comparative analyses of the prevalences and correlates of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older people in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand, using data from the latest available national aging surveys in the three countries. The analyses were conducted within a multivariate framework. Gender-specific results show that smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol are more common among older men than women in all three countries. However, the prevalence of smoking and drinking among men declines at older ages. The multivariate analyses reveal that a higher level of education has a significant negative association with smoking and drinking in all three settings, but the magnitude and the direction of associations vary considerably between countries and genders. Area of residence is correlated with smoking among men in all three countries, whereas co-residential arrangements with spouse, children, or both significantly reduce alcohol consumption among men in Myanmar and among men and women in Thailand. In all three settings a significant complementary relationship between smoking and drinking is observed. From a policy perspective this implies that a successful reduction in smoking could be achieved through anti-drinking campaigns and vice versa.","sociology, medical","Health (social science), Geriatrics and Gerontology"

We prospectively studied the prevalence and molecular characteristics of clinically important Gram-negative bacilli, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ABC), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from blood, respiratory tract, urine, and sterile sites at 47 hospitals across Thailand. Among 187, 619 isolates, 93, 810 isolates (50.0%) were critically drug resistant, of which 12, 915 isolates (13.8%) were randomly selected for molecular characterization. E. coli was most commonly isolated from all specimens, except the respiratory tract, in which ABC was predominant. Prevalence of extendedspectrum cephalosporin resistance (ESCR) was higher in E. coli (42.5%) than K. pneumoniae (32.0%), but carbapenem-resistant (CR)-K. pneumoniae (17.2%) was 4.5-fold higher than CR-E. coli (3.8%). The majority of ESCR/CR-E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates carried blaCTX-M (64.6% to 82.1%). BlaNDM and blaOXA-48-like were the most prevalent carbapenemase genes in CR-E. coli/CR-K. pneumoniae (74.9%/52.9% and 22.4%/ 54.1%, respectively). In addition, 12.9%/23.0% of CR-E. coli/CR-K. pneumoniae cocarried blaNDM and blaOXA-48-like. Among ABC isolates, 41.9% were extensively drug resistant (XDR) and 35.7% were multidrug resistant (MDR), while P. aeruginosa showed XDR/MDR at 6.3%/16.5%. A. baumannii was the most common species among ABC isolates. The major carbapenemase gene in MDR-A. baumannii/XDR-A. baumannii was blaOXA-23-like (85.8%/93.0%), which had much higher rates than other ABC species. BlaIMP, blaVIM, blaOXA-40-like, and blaOXA-58-like were also detected in ABC at lower rates. The most common carbapenemase gene in MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa was blaIMP (29.0%/30.6%), followed by blaVIM (9.5%/25.3%). The findings reiterate an alarming situation of drug resistance that requires serious control measures.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Primary Versus Secondary Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: Perspectives from Multi-institutional and Population-Level Data,"Ngo T.N.M., Le T.T.B., Le T., Bychkov A., Oishi N., Jung C.K., Hassell L., Kakudo K., Vuong H.G.",2021-12-01,"Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Databases, Factual, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic, Thyroid Neoplasms, Anaplastic, De novo, Primary, Secondary, Thyroid, Transformation, Undifferentiated","Primary (or de novo) anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is ATC without pre-existing history of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and no co-existing DTC foci at the time of diagnosis. Secondary ATC is diagnosed if the patient had a history of DTC or co-existing DTC components at time of diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, clinical presentations, outcomes, and genetic backgrounds of primary versus secondary ATCs. We searched for ATCs in our institutional databases and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the genetic alterations of primary and secondary ATCs. From our multi-institutional database, 22 primary and 23 secondary ATCs were retrieved. We also identified 620 and 24 primary and secondary ATCs in the SEER database, respectively. Compared to primary ATCs, secondary ATCs were not statistically different in terms of demographic, clinical manifestations, and patient survival. The only clinical discrepancy between the two groups was a significantly larger tumor diameter of the primary ATCs. The prevalence of TERT promoter, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations was comparable between the two subtypes. In comparison to primary ATCs, however, BRAF mutations were more prevalent (OR = 4.70; 95% CI = 2.84–7.78) whereas RAS mutations were less frequent (OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.21–0.85) in secondary tumors. In summary, our results indicated that de novo and secondary ATCs might share many potential developmental steps, but there are other factors that suggest distinct developmental pathways.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"
Dual pH responsive via double - layered microencapsulation for controlled release of active ingredients in simulated gastrointestinal tract: A model case of chitosan-alginate microcapsules containing basil oil (Ocimum basilicum Linn.),"Thuekeaw S., Angkanaporn K., Chirachanchai S., Nuengjamnong C.",2021-09-01,"Active ingredients, Basil ocimum basilicum linn., Controlled release, Double layered, Dual ph responsive, Gastrointestinal tract, Layered polymers, Microcapsules, Ocimum basilicum, PH-responsive, Alginate, Basil oil, Chitosan, Controlled release, Double-layered, Dual pH responsive, Microcapsule","Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) have gained more attention to replace antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) in poultry industry. However, the efficiency of PEAs might be lost during feed pelleting, storage and gastrointestinal (GI) tract resulting in an insufficient level at the small intestine. The present work demonstrates the use of double-layered polymers with opposite charges leading to a dual pH responsiveness where the encapsulated ingredients are remained active through the acidic gastric stage and ready to be released at the intestine. Anionic sodium alginate (SA) and cationic chitosan (CS) are a good combination to represent double-layered polymer of which an effective incorporation of active ingredient, i.e. basil oil (BO), a model PEA, can be achieved. By simply fabricating SA porous microcapsules followed by the absorption of BO before the surface coating with CS, the double-layered microcapsules, CS-SA, are obtained. The release performances confirm that CS-SA retains the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of BO under storage in addition to a great tolerance of acids, bile, trypsin, including the thermal conditions. The present work, for the first time, proposes the concept of porous double-layered polymer in microcapsule form which shows the dual pH responsive for controlled release application. The use of ionic polysaccharides is simple, biocompatible and environmentally friendly, whereas the plausible upscaling for wide range of controlled release applications has to be further investigated.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Then, ultrafine fully vulcanized powdered natural rubbers (UFPNRs) were produced by electron beam irradiation of the graft copolymers in the presence of di-trimethylolpropane tetra-acrylate (DTMPTA) as a crosslinking agent and, subsequently, a fast spray drying process. The effects of St or AN monomer contents and the radiation doses on the chemical structure, thermal stability, and physical properties of the graft copolymers and UFPNRs were investigated. The results showed that solvent resistance and grafting efficiency of DPNR-g-PS and DPNR-g-PAN were enhanced with increasing monomer content. SEM morphology of the UFPNRs showed separated and much less agglomerated particles with an average size about 6 μm. Therefore, it is possible that the developed UFPNRs grafted copolymers with good solvent resistance and rather high thermal stability can be used easily as toughening modifiers for polymers and their composites.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

We investigated recovery rates of CD4/CD8 ratio among Thai children and adolescents after they initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods: Children and adolescents who started cART at age of ≥ 5 years were eligible in this study if they achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL and had a CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.8 at the time of virological suppression. Normalization of CD4/CD8 ratio was defined as 2 consecutive values ≥ 1. Using group-based trajectory analysis, low- and high-recovery groups were identified in terms of CD4/CD8 ratio recovery. Results: One hundred thirty-eight children and adolescents (101 perinatally infected and 37 behaviorally infected) with median age of 10.6 years at cART treatment initiation were included. After 559 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), overall incidence rate of CD4/CD8 ratio normalization was 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.7-6.2) per 100 PYFU. The probabilities of normalization at 2, 5, and 10 years after HIV suppression were 5.2%, 22.6%, and 35.6%, respectively. The low-recovery group had lower median pre-cART CD4 count (146 vs 304 cells/μL, P = .01), pre-cART CD4/CD8 ratio (0.15 vs 0.23, P = .03) and at first viral suppression (0.38 vs 0.65, P = .0001), compared to the high-recovery group. Conclusions: Less than half of children and adolescents living with HIV on cART with viral suppression had CD4/CD8 ratio normalization. Those with older age at cART initiation, lower pre-cART CD4 count, or CD4/CD8 ratio had slower ratio recovery. Long-term prognoses such as ongoing immune activation and clinical outcomes among children and adolescents on suppressive cART without CD4/CD8 ratio normalization need to be further investigated.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Infectious Diseases"

The bacteria are commensal in chicken tract and can be contaminated into chicken products during processing. Obviously, detecting reagents such as a specific antibody is essential for the development of immune–based detection methods for C. jejuni or C. coli. In this study, in silico techniques were used to design a chimeric recombinant antigen, named multiepitope antigen (MEA), for the production of specific polyclonal antibody. To design MEA polypeptide based on C. jejuni fibronectin–binding protein or CadF, four conserved and unique antigenic peptides were identified and fused together directly. The C. jejuni CadF–based MEA polypeptide fused with two single six–histidine tags at both C– and N–terminal ends was expressed under Escherichia coli expression system. The recombinant MEA was successfully produced and purified by Ni–NTA resin with a high satisfactory yield. Indirect ELISA results showed that anti–MEA polyclonal antibody derived from rabbit serum had a titer of 16,000, indicating high antigenicity of MEA polypeptide. Dot blot results also confirmed that the produced anti–MEA antibody could specifically recognize both C. jejuni and C. coli whole cells as expected while there was no cross–reactivity to non–Campylobacter spp. tested in this study.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; expression systems for foreign products; microbial, biochemistryistry",Biotechnology

All samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, XRF, N2 adsorption and desorption, FT-IR, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, UV–VIS, and TPO techniques. It was found that the propylene selectivity increased by the transition metal-loaded catalysts due to the increased medium acid sites on the catalyst surface. The hydrogen transfer index of modified ZSM-5 catalysts was lower than that of the unmodified ones. Moreover, the lack of strong acid sites on ZSM-5 was one of the significant factors that suppressed the formation of light alkanes. Besides, the acidic bridging hydroxyl groups and the external silanol group on ZSM-5 were also active sites during the hydrogen transfer reaction producing light alkanes (propane and butane). Hence, the Na-ZSM-5 exhibited the best performance in terms of propylene yield and catalyst stability. The Ni-loaded ZSM-5 was the least stable catalyst for the reaction due to high coke content and deactivation rate.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

The current review provides a more comprehensive summary, covering research from 1955 to the present year. Oxyresveratrol occurs in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, it has never been reported in plants in the subclass Sympetalae, and this point might be of both chemotaxonomic and biosynthetic importance. Oxyresveratrol can be easily obtained from plant materials by conventional methods, and several systems for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of oxyresvera-trol contents in plant materials and plant products are available. Oxyresveratrol possesses diverse biological and pharmacological activities such as the inhibition of tyrosinase and melanogenesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and protective effects against neurological disorders and digestive ailments. However, the unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of oxyresveratrol, including low water solubility and poor oral availability and stability, have posed challenges to its development as a useful therapeutic agent.

The aim is to examine whether biomarkers of the immune-inflammatory response (IRS) and endogenous opioid (EOS) systems are associated with affective symptoms in schizophrenia. Methods. We recruited 115 schizophrenia patients and 43 healthy controls and assessed the Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAM-A) rating Scale scores as well as serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, eotaxin (CCL11), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and mu (MOR) and kappa (KOR) opioid receptors. Results. The HDRS and HAM-A scores are significantly and positively correlated with a) psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, negative symptoms, psychomotor retardation, and formal thought disorders; and b) lowered scores on semantic and episodic memory, executive functions, and attention tests as measured with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Psychiatry. Both HDRS and HAM-A are significantly increased in non-responders to treatment as compared with partial responders. Both affective scores are strongly associated with a latent vector extracted from all symptoms, reflecting overall severity of schizophrenia symptoms (OSOS), and neurocognitive test scores, reflecting a generalized cognitive decline (G-CoDe). The HDRS score was strongly and positively associated with IL-6, HMGB1, KOR, and MOR levels, and the HAM-A score with IL-6, IL-10, CCL11, HMGB1, KOR, and MOR levels. A single latent trait may be extracted from OSOS, G-CoDe, and the HDRS and HAMA scores, and this latent vector score is strongly predicted by HMGB1, MOR, and DKK1. Conclusion. Immune-inflammatory and EOS pathways contribute to the phenome of schizophrenia, which comprises OSOS, affective, and physiosomatic symptoms, and G-CoDe.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Firstly, the mixer diameter (D) was increased while keeping the particle diameter (d) constant. It was observed that when the mixer diameter to the particle diameter ratio (D/d) was larger than a certain critical size (D/d ≥ 75), granular flow behaviors and mixing kinetics followed simple scaling relations. For D/d ≥ 75, flow patterns and mixing kinetics were found to be independent of system size, and velocities of particles scaled linearly with the tip speed of the impeller blades and particle diffusivities scaled with the tip speed of the blades and mixer diameter. These results suggest that past a certain system size the flow and mixing of cohesive particles in large-scale units can be predicted from smaller systems. Secondly, system size was kept constant and particle diameter was changed and it was observed that by keeping the Bond number constant (by changing the level of cohesion) the flow behavior and mixing patterns did not change, showing that larger particles can be used to simulate flow of smaller cohesive particles in a bladed mixer by matching the Bond numbers.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Mechanics of Materials"

COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan City, China, at the end of December 2019, spread over the entire world in approximately four months. By October 2020, approximately 20 million people were infected and mil-lions had died from this disease. Many health or-ganizations such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made COVID-19 their primary focus. Many industries, es-pecially, the tourism industry, were affected by the pandemic as many flight and hotel reservations were canceled. Thailand, a country considered one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, suffered much losses because of this pandemic. Many events and travel bookings were canceled and/or postponed. Many people expressed their views and emotions related to this situation over social media, which is considered a powerful media for spreading news and in-formation. In this research, the views of people who were planning to travel to Bangkok, the capital city and most popular destination in Thailand, were retrieved from Twitter for the dates between April 3 and 30, 2020, the period during which the country underwent nationwide lockdown. Sentiment analysis was performed using the support vector machine al-gorithm. The results showed 71.03% classification ac-curacy based on three sentiment classifications: posi-tive, negative, and neutral. This study could thus provide an insight into travelers’ opinions and sentiments related to the tourism business. Based on the significant terms in each sentiment extracted, strengths and weaknesses of each tourism issue could be obtained, which could be used for making recommendations to the related tourism organizations.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

The chemotherapy schedules were delayed and/or reduced in 40 (52.6%) and 48 (49.5%) in CAM users and non-CAM users, respectively, p =0.681. The mean relative dose intensity (RDI) were 92.4% and 94.1% in CAM and non-CAM users, respectively, p=0.244. However, there were significantly more CAM users receiving chemotherapy less than 90% RDI (34.8% vs 19.8%, p=0.033). As compared to first cycle, at third cycle, the mean QOL score changes were -4.63 (95% CI -2.49-9.27) and -8.02 (-2.36- 9.142) in CAM user and non-CAM user, respectively (p=0.255). There were significantly higher rates of grade 3 or 4 anemia (5.1% vs 0%, p=0.024), and grade 2 malaise (19.0% vs 5.1%, p=0.004) in CAM users. Conclusions: There were similar overall rates of chemotherapy schedule delay and dose reduction between CAM- and non-CAM users. However, there were less CAM-users achieving 90% chemotherapy RDI.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"
A single-phase smart meter with autocalibration and load control conformed to OpenADR protocol,"Pawitpanich N., Pora W., Panitantum N.",2021-05-19,"Auto calibration, Calibration equipment, Calibration process, Current sources, Demand response, Power capability, Single phase, Supply sides, Autocalibration, Automated demand response, OpenADR, Smart meter","Smart meters are essential components in smart grids as they provide a connection between utilities and their customers. All meters must be calibrated before they can be installed. Moreover, they should be calibrated every few years. This article describes a single-phase smart meter with an autocalibration feature. Accurate voltage and current sources are in the same chip as the metering part. This makes the calibration process unnecessary. So, cost from laboring and calibration equipment can be saved. Apart from automatic billing, a smart meter can help implementation of Demand Response (DR), which tries to balance the power required by the demand side and power capability of the supply side. DR is one of the most important functions in smart grid operation. However, no commercial smart meters in the market have yet to provide this DR function. Besides autocalibration, this prototype can communicate with the utility according to the OpenADR standard.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

The cascade architecture of a power converter in a DC microgrid may cause large oscillations and imbalance given that converters considered as loads have constant power load characteristics. In this work, output DC bus voltage stabilization and current sharing of a multiphase parallel-interleaved-FC boost converter is presented. The proposed robust controller with added integrator action is based on the Hamiltonian-Lyapunov function. The efficacy and robustness of the designed controller were successfully authenticated by experimental results obtained using a 2.5 kW prototype FC converter (via four-phase parallel-interleaved boost converters) and the dSPACE MicroLabBox platform.

Therefore, we sought to develop a machine learning model for an embedded portable device that can categorize mind-wandering state to assist people in keeping track of their minds. We utilize a low-channel EEG to record the brain state and to build the predictive model because of its practicality and user-friendly. Most machine learning experiments in mind-wandering using EEG exhibit good individual-level performance. For the group-level technique, only a few research has developed a model. As a result, the goal of this research is to achieve a high-accuracy group-level model. Thus, Leave One Participant Out Cross Validation (LOPOCV) was used to assess the model correctness.

However, little is known about how patients with difficult airway predictors are managed in emergency departments. We aimed to explore the incidence, management and outcomes of patients with difficult airway predictors in an emergency department. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using intubation data collected by a prospective registry in an academic emergency department from November 2017 to October 2018. Records with complete assessment of difficult airway predictors were included. Two categories of predictors were analyzed: predicted difficult intubation by direct laryngoscopy and predicted difficult bag-mask ventilation. The former was evaluated based on difficult external appearance, mouth opening and thyromental distance, Mallampati score, obstruction, and limited neck mobility as in the mnemonic “LEMON”. The latter was evaluated based on difficult mask sealing, obstruction or obesity, absence of teeth, advanced age and reduced pulmonary compliance as in the mnemonic “MOANS”. The incidence, management and outcomes of patients with these difficult airway predictors were explored. Results: During the study period, 220 records met the inclusion criteria. At least 1 difficult airway predictor was present in 183 (83.2%) patients; 57 (25.9%) patients had at least one LEMON feature, and 178 (80.9%) had at least one MOANS feature. Among patients with at least one difficult airway predictor, both sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 105 (57.4%) encounters, only sedation was used in 65 (35.5%) encounters, and no medication was administered in 13 (7.1%) encounters. First-pass success was accomplished in 136 (74.3%) of the patients. Compared with patients without predictors, patients with positive LEMON criteria were less likely to receive neuromuscular blocking agents (OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.24–0.87), p = 0.02) after adjusting for operator experience and device used. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding glottic view, first-pass success, or complications. The LEMON criteria poorly predicted unsuccessful first pass and glottic view. Conclusions: In emergency airway management, difficult airway predictors were associated with decreased use of neuromuscular blocking agents but were not associated with glottic view, first-pass success, or complications.",medical,Emergency Medicine
Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of Vietnamese canine parvovirus 2C originated from dogs reveals a new Asia-IV clade,"Nguyen Manh T., Piewbang C., Rungsipipat A., Techangamsuwan S.",2021-05-01,"Animals, Dog Diseases, Dogs, Female, Genome, Viral, Male, Parvoviridae Infections, Parvovirus, Canine, Phylogeny, Vietnam, Asia-IV subclade, canine parvovirus-2c, dog, evolution, phylodynamic, Vietnam","Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus causing fatal haemorrhagic enteritis in dogs. Currently, CPV-2 is classified into CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c based on genetic variation in the VP2 gene. The CPV-2c variant has become ubiquitous worldwide and gained attention for monitoring parvoviral evolution. In this study, we characterized the full-length genome sequences of CPV-2c strains obtained from 59 dogs in Vietnam. Molecular analysis revealed that Vietnamese CPV-2c shared a common evolutionary pattern with the Asian CPV-2 clade, which is marked by genetic signature patterns in the structural and nonstructural proteins. In addition, these Vietnamese CPV-2c strains exhibited unique Thr112Ile and Ile447Met mutations in the VP1 and VP2 sequence, respectively. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the mutations of amino acid residues in both the structural and nonstructural genes have contributed to the emergence of a new clade, designated here as the Asia-IV clade. The substitution rates, estimated from a dataset containing 199 sequences over the last 42 years, confirmed that CPV-2 showed a high rate of nucleotide substitution, at about 2.49 × 10–4 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (nt/s/y), with VP1/2 and NS1/2 estimates of 3.06 × 10–4 and 3.16 × 10–4 nt/s/y, respectively. Even though no evidence of genetic recombination in these Vietnamese CPV-2c strains was established, potential positive selection sites were observed in both the structural and nonstructural genes, suggesting the viral evolutionary process has occurred in both the structural and nonstructural proteins. Genetic and evolutionary analysis of the full-length genome sequence is necessary to gain evolutionary insight of CPV-2.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of the microbial community during the acclimation period in the system could be useful for the development of mature nitrifying biofilters. In this study, high-throughput DNA sequencing was applied to monitor the microbial communities on a biofilter during the acclimation period (7 weeks) in high (100 mg N/L) and low (5 mg N/L) total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) treatments. Both treatments were successful for developing a mature nitrifying biofilter, dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Nitrospirae. Complete nitrification was found after 7 days of biofilter acclimation as indicated by decreasing TAN concentration, increasing nitrate concentration, and high abundances of the nitrifying bacteria, Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae. The beta diversity analysis of microbial communities showed different clustering of the samples between high and low TAN treatment groups. A greater abundance of nitrifying bacteria was found in the high TAN treatments (27–51%) than in the low TAN treatment (15–29%). The bacterial diversity in biofilters acclimated at high TAN concentration (Shannon’s index 5.40–6.15) were lower than those found at low TAN treatment levels (Shannon’s index 6.40–7.01). The higher diversity in biofilters acclimated at low TAN concentrations, consisting of Planctomycetes and Archaea, might benefit the nutrient recycling in the system. Although nitrification activity was observed from the first week of the acclimation period, the acclimation period should be taken as at least 6 weeks for full development of nitrifying biofilm. Moreover, the reduction of potentially pathogenic Vibrio on biofilters was found at that period.","genergyal microbial ecology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Aquatic Science"

The suppression of these aggressive behaviors is of interest in anticancer drug research and discovery. In recent years, many plants have been explored in order to discover new bioactive secondary metabolites to treat cancers or enhance treatment efficiency. Aspiletrein A (AA) is a steroidal saponin isolated from the whole endemic species Aspidistra letreae in Vietnam. Previously, elucidation of the structure of AA and screening of its cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines were reported. However, the antitumor activities and mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-proliferative, anti-migrative and anti-invasive effects of AA on H460, H23 and A549 human lung cancer cells. Methods: MTT, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate the anti-proliferation, anti-migration and anti-invasion effects of AA, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of AA on the activity of protein kinase B (Akt), a central mediator of cancer properties, and apoptotic regulators in the Bcl-2 family proteins were investigated by Western blotting. Results: AA exhibits antimetastatic effects in human lung cancer cells through the inhibition of the pAkt/Akt signaling pathway, which in turn resulted in a significant inhibitory effect of AA on the migration and invasion of the examined lung cancer cells. Conclusions: Aspiletrein A may be a potent inhibitor of protein kinase B (Akt). Hence, AA could be further explored as a potential antimetastatic lead compound.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Although sex steroids, particularly estrogens, have been shown to regulate BAT thermogenic function, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to sexual dimorphism in basal BAT activity have not been elucidated. Therefore, we assessed the transcriptome of interscapular BAT of male and female C57BL/6J mice by RNA sequencing and identified 295 genes showing ≥2-fold differential expression (adjusted P < 0.05). In silico functional annotation clustering suggested an enrichment of genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cell contact, interaction, and adhesion. Ovariectomy reduced the expression of these genes in female BAT toward a male pattern whereas orchiectomy had marginal effects on the transcriptional pattern, indicating a prominent role of female gonadal hormones in this sex-differential expression pattern. Progesterone was identified as a possible upstream regulator of the sex-differentially expressed genes. Studying the direct effects of progesterone in vitro in primary adipocytes showed that progesterone significantly altered the transcription of several of the identified genes, possibly via the glucocorticoid receptor. In conclusion, this study reveals a sexually dimorphic transcription profile in murine BAT at general housing conditions and demonstrates a role for progesterone in the regulation of the interscapular BAT transcriptome.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Endocrinology"

The UFNBRPs- modified polybenzoxazine friction composite was characterized for chemical, tribological, and mechanical properties as well as thermal stability. The UFNBRPs not only act as a filler to reduce noise in the friction composites due to their suitable viscoelastic behaviors but also play a key role in friction modifiers to enhance friction coefficient and wear resistance in the polybenzoxazine composites. The chemical bonding formation between UFNBRPs and polybenzoxazine can significantly improve friction, mechanical, and thermal properties of the friction composite. The outstanding tribological performance of the friction composite under 100-350 °C, i.e., friction coefficients and wear rates in a range of 0.36-0.43 and 0.13 × 10-4-0.29 × 10-4 mm3/Nm, respectively, was achieved. The high flexural strength and modulus of the friction composite, i.e., 61 MPa and 6.4 GPa, respectively, were obtained. The friction composite also showed high thermal stability, such as 410 °C for degradation temperature and 215 °C for glass transition temperature. The results indicated that the obtained UFNBRPs-modified polybenzoxazine friction composite meets the industrial standard of brake linings and pads for automobiles; therefore, the UFNBRPs-modified polybenzoxazine friction composite can effectively be used as a replacement for asbestos-based friction materials.","lubrication, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: One hundred twenty-four eyes of 124 patients with open-angle glaucoma. Methods: Over a 5-year period, 124 patients with open-angle glaucoma underwent yearly DP, VF testing, SD OCT RNFL thickness scans, and optic nerve volume scans (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering), all performed on the same day. From high-density optic nerve volume scans, custom-built software calculated the minimum distance band (MDB) thickness, a 3D neuroretinal rim parameter. Patients were classified as glaucoma progressors or nonglaucoma progressors using event-based analysis. Progression by DP and VF testing occurred when 3 masked glaucoma specialists unanimously concurred. Progression by RNFL and MDB thickness occurred if change of more than test–retest variability was observed. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to analyze time-to-progression data. Kappa Coefficients were used to measure agreement of progressing eyes among methods. Main Outcome Measures: Time to glaucoma progression among all 4 methods. Results: Global MDB thickness detected glaucoma progression in the highest percentage of eyes (52.4%) compared with DP (16.1%; P < 0.001) and global RNFL thickness (15.3%; P < 0.001). Global MDB thickness detected glaucoma progression earlier than either DP (23 months vs. 44 months; P < 0.001) or global RNFL thickness (23 months vs. 33 months; P < 0.001). Among MDB progressing eyes, 46.2% were confirmed simultaneously or later by other conventional methods. Agreement of glaucoma-progressing eyes for all 4 methods in paired fashion were slight to fair (κ = 0.095–0.300). Conclusions: High-density 3D SD OCT neuroretinal rim measurements detected glaucoma progression approximately 1 to 2 years earlier compared with current clinically available structural tests (i.e., DP and 2D RNFL thickness measurements).","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

However, the production of free hapten (low-molecular-weight target)-recognizing IgG from plants has not been successfully developed yet. The current study aimed at creating a plant platform as an affordable source of IgG for use in immunoassays and diagnostic tools. The functional IgG was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 with recombinant geminiviral vectors (pBY3R) occupying chimeric anti-miroestrol IgG genes. The appropriate assembly between heavy and light chains was achieved, and the yield of expression was 0.57 µg/g fresh N. benthamiana leaves. The binding characteristics of the IgG to miroestrol and binding specificity to related compounds, such as isomiroestrol and deoxymiroestrol, were similar to those of hybridoma-produced IgG (monoclonal antibody, mAb). The plant-based mAbs exhibited high sensitivity for miroestrol (IC50, 23.2 ± 2.1 ng/mL), precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 5.01%), and accuracy (97.8–103% recovery), as determined using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applicable to determine miroestrol in plant samples. Overall, the plant-produced functional IgG conserved the binding activity and specificity of the parent IgG derived from mammalian cells. Therefore, the plant expression system may be an efficient and affordable platform for the production of antibodies against low-molecular-weight targets in immunoassays.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Agronomy and Crop Science, Plant Science"
"Snail mucus from the mantle and foot of two land snails, Lissachatina fulica and Hemiplecta distincta, exhibits different protein profile and biological activity","Noothuan N., Apitanyasai K., Panha S., Tassanakajon A.",2021-12-01,"Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Anti-Infective Agents, Mucus, Anti-tyrosinase activity, Antimicrobial activity, Antioxidant activity, Land snail, Snail mucus","Objective: Snails secrete different types of mucus that serve several functions, and are increasingly being exploited for medical and cosmetic applications. In this study, we explored the protein pattern and compared the biological properties of the mucus secreted from the mantle collar and foot of two snail species, Lissachatina fulica and Hemiplecta distincta. Result: Protein profile showed a different pattern between the two species and between the two secretory parts. The mantle-specific protein bands were further characterized and among them was an antibacterial protein, achacin. Accordingly, the mucus from the mantle exhibited the higher antibacterial activity than that from the foot in both snail species. The mucus from H. distincta, first reported here, also showed antibacterial properties, but with a lower activity compared to that for L. fulica. Snail mucus also exhibited anti-tyrosinase activity and antioxidant activity but with no significant difference between the foot and mantle mucus. These results indicate some different protein compositions and biological activities of snail slime from the mantle and foot, which might be associated with their specific functions in the animal and are useful for medical applications.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"
The correlation of maxillomandibular advancement and airway volume change in obstructive sleep apnea using cone beam computed tomography,"Kongsong W., Waite P.D., Sittitavornwong S., Schibler M., Alshahrani F.",2021-07-01,"Cone-Beam Computed Tomography, Humans, Mandibular Advancement, Maxilla, Osteotomy, Le Fort, Pharynx, Retrospective Studies, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, cone-beam computed tomography, obstructive sleep apnea, orthognathic Surgery, three-imensional Image, airway","The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation of maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) and airway volume changes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and to determine the surgical skeletal movements necessary to achieve an increase in total airway volume (TAV) of ≥70%. Thirty patients with OSA treated by MMA were evaluated. Pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography images were used to determine the horizontal distance and angular changes in surgical parameters and linear, area, and volumetric airway parameters. Postoperatively, the horizontal distance of surgical parameters (A-point, UI, B-point, pogonion, and menton) and craniofacial angulation (SNA and SNB) increased significantly, similar to total surface area, TAV, and minimum cross-sectional area of the airway (p < 0.0001). The total airway length decreased significantly (p < 0.0001). The mean increase in TAV was 67.2%. There were positive correlations between linear surgical changes and the percentage change in TAV. All surgical parameters were predictive of a change in TAV ≥70%. The optimal surgical change was 6 mm for A-point, 7.9 mm for UI, 7.6 mm for B-point, 11.2 mm for pogonion, and 10 mm for menton. In conclusion, maxillary advancement of less than 10 mm was adequate in this study to obtain an increase in the TAV of at least 70%.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"
Temperature and frequency dependence of dielectric relaxation in a metal–organic perovskite-like framework,"Paramee S., Guo R., Bhalla A.S., Manuspiya H.",2021-01-01,"Arrhenius law, Cole-Cole plots, Dielectric relaxation process, Frequencies dependence, Imidazolium, Metal-organic perovskite-like framework, Metal-organic perovskites, Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), Perovskite like structure, Temperature dependence, Arrhenius law, Cole–Cole plot, dielectric relaxation, frequency dependence, Metal-organic perovskite-like framework, temperature dependence","This study dielectrically analyzed the three-dimensional metal–organic framework complex of imidazolium magnesium formate [(C3N2H5)(Mg(HCOO)3)] (HImMg) to investigate the temperature–frequency dependence of the perovskite-like structure’s dielectric relaxation processes. HImMg was synthesized via solution diffusion at room temperature. The high-temperature phase transition of the HImMg was confirmed at around 178 °C by differential scanning calorimetry and temperature-dependent X-ray powder diffraction. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed a monoclinic structure in the space group P21/n, indicating a centrosymmetric system, with the HIm+ dipole in the cages of the Mg(HCOO)3. The dielectric values were recorded between −50 °C and 200 °C and at radio and microwave frequency ranges between 1 kHz and 1 GHz. Dielectric relaxation was calculated using the Arrhenius and Cole–Cole relationships. Low-temperature activation energies of 0.14, 0.35, and 0.25 eV were connected to the gradual freezing of the imidazolium cations’ reorientation movements. This behavior may demonstrate that the dielectric relaxations of HImMg are caused by the orientational motion of dipolar guest molecules.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

The polymer film, which was simply prepared from a blend of hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane elastomer and hydrophilic polyurethane, showed improved properties and economic viability for antifouling film for the marine industry. The field emission scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (FESEM and EDX) results from the polymer blend suggested a homogenous morphology and good distribution of the polyurethane disperse phase. The PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film gave a water contact angle of 103.4° ± 3.8° and the PDMS film gave a water contact angle of 109.5° ± 4.2°. Moreover, the PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film could also be modified with surface patterning by using soft lithography process to further increase the hydrophobicity. It was found that PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film with micro patterning from soft lithography process increased the contact angle to 128.8° ± 1.6°. The results from a field test in the Gulf of Thailand illustrated that the bonding strength between the barnacles and the PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film (0.07 MPa) were lower than the bonding strength between the barnacles and the carbon steel (1.16 MPa). The barnacles on the PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film were more easily removed from the surface. This indicated that the PDMS:PU blend (95:5) exhibited excellent antifouling properties and the results indicated that the PDMS:PU blend (95:5) film with micro patterning surface could be employed for antifouling application.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

However, in wholesale electricity markets, VRE participation tends to reduce marginal prices (MP) because of its low marginal costs. This circumstance, called the “merit-order effect” (MOE), reduces the generators’ profits. Thus, the traditional method is possibly no longer the best and only method to maximize the generators’ profits. Moreover, the VRE support schemes also affect MP, making MOE more severe. VRE curtailment can relieve MOE, but VRE output must be decreased, thereby reducing the generators’ profits. This paper proposes a method to find the optimal VRE generation schedules that maximize VRE generators’ profits while considering the trade-off among the VRE output, MP, and SOCs. The method combines the merit-order model and the unit-commit-ment model solved by the optimization tools in MATLAB. Thailand’s electrical system was the test system. The result shows that VRE generators’ profits from the proposed method are significantly higher than from the traditional method when the system has high wind penetration, and the generators have no support scheme. Curtailing approximately 7–10% of wind output can increase the average MP by 23.6–30%.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Regenerative medicine has fetched the opportunity to replace or regenerate the SG epithelia and restore its secretory function. Early adult stem cell transplantation strategies in rodents have recently shown to improve clinical outcomes in radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in Phase 1/2 human trials. Mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue are the most promising, although the ones from the labial mucosa, bone marrow, or dental pulp have an attractive therapeutic value after successful findings in ex vivo and in vivo mouse models of SG injury. Emerging approaches using cell-free therapy with cell ""extracts"", ""soups""or secretome components also exhibit favorable outcomes in the same rodent models. When compared to cell-based approaches, extracellular vesicles (EV) from the secretome (i.e., exosomes) can be easily extracted, quantified, and are more stable for long-term storage and use in SG tissue engineering. Additive manufacturing and three-dimensional bioprinting or bioassembly have an important role on generating spheroids or organoids for cell transplantation to ameliorate SG injury. Moreover, organoids can secrete EV, which may have a therapeutic potential worth to explore in future studies. In this review, we will describe the technological advancements and challenges of these different cell-based and cell-free strategies in SG tissue engineering and regeneration. Salivary gland (SG)-like innervated epithelial organoids and the secretome produced from stem cells may constitute feasible therapeutic alternatives to regenerate the SG due to their user-friendly, short-lived, consistent, and scalable additive manufacturing processes. Bioprinting such human SG organoids toward in vitro drug discovery may further reduce the incorporation of animal-derived components to the tissue constructs and minimize the use of animal experimentation in SG regeneration. Despite such advancements, transplantation with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is the only tissue engineering strategy that has reached Phase 1/2 clinical trials and shown to enlarge the serous SG epithelium and improve salivary flow.","otorhinolaryngology, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, biochemistryistry, engineering","Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering"

This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance and outcomes of ASP de-escalation recommendations in children who received meropenem. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in children aged 1 month to 18 years who received meropenem in a tertiary-care teaching hospital. The ASP team gave recommendation between 72 and 120 h after initiating meropenem therapy. Acceptance of de-escalation recommendations among primary physicians was evaluated within 24 h of recommendation. Outcomes included clinical success rate on the 7th day and incidence rate of acquisition of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) within 30 days. Results: From March to December 2019, 217 children with a median (interquartile range) age of 2.1 (0.6, 9.5) years received meropenem. The ASP team gave recommendations in 127 (58.5%) of cases for continuation of meropenem therapy and 90 (41.5%) of cases for de-escalation. The overall acceptance of ASP de-escalation recommendations was 57.8% (95%CI: 46.9–68.1%). Clinical success rates were 85.2% in the accepted group compared to 77.5% in the rejected group (P = 0.06). The incidence rate of acquisition of CR-GNB within 30 days after treatment was 5.8% in the accepted group and 15.8% in the rejected group (P = 0.03). Conclusions: About half of the recommendations to de-escalate meropenem prescriptions were accepted through the ASP intervention. Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria acquisitions was less likely in the de-escalation group.

Evaluations of the histological changes associated with TiLV infection are not only crucial for diagnosis, but also to gain an understanding of the disease. We therefore synthesized a rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulin G antibody against TiLV and developed an immunohistochemical (IHC) procedure to detect TiLV localization in the tissues of infected fish for comparison with in situ hybridization (ISH) testing. A total of four different sample cohorts derived from TiLV-infected fish was used to validate the IHC procedure. The TiLV IHC application was successfully developed and facilitated nuclear and cytoplasmic immunolabelling in the intestines, gills, brain, liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys that corresponded with the ISH results. Apart from the ISH results, TiLV-IHC signals were clearly evident in the endothelial cells of various organs, the circulating leukocytes in the blood vessels, and the areas of tissue inflammation. Among the tested sample cohorts, the intestines, gills, and brain had IHC-positive signals, highlighting the possibility of these organs as common TiLV targets. Immunological staining pattern and distribution corresponded with the TiLV viral load but not the inoculation route. The TiLV IHC was also capable of detecting TiLV infection in the experimentally challenged ornamental cichlids, Mozambique tilapia, giant gourami, and naturally infected tilapia, indicating the dynamic range of IHC for TiLV detection. Overall, our study delivers the first IHC platform to detect TiLV infection and provides novel evidence of cellular tropism during TiLV infection. Our findings also reveal the TiLV distribution pattern of infected fish and propose the endotheliotropism and lymphotropism of this virus, which requires further elaboration. Importantly, this new IHC procedure could be applied to study the pathogenesis and interaction of TiLV in future research.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

METHODS: From April 2010 to March 2019, a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study evaluated conservative surgery in participants from 16 sites in nine countries. Eligibility criteria included: (1) FIGO 2009 stage IA2-IB1 cervical carcinoma; (2) squamous cell (any grade) or adenocarcinoma (grade 1 or 2 only) histology; (3) tumor size <2 cm; (4) no lymphovascular space invasion; (5) depth of invasion <10 mm; (6) negative imaging for metastatic disease; and (7) negative conization margins. Cervical conization was performed to determine eligibility, with one repeat cone permitted. Eligible women desiring fertility preservation underwent a second surgery with pelvic lymph node assessment, consisting of sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or full pelvic lymph node dissection. Those not desiring fertility preservation underwent simple hysterectomy with lymph node assessment. Women who had undergone an 'inadvertent' simple hysterectomy with an unexpected post-operative diagnosis of cancer were also eligible if they met the above inclusion criteria and underwent a second surgery with pelvic lymph node dissection only. RESULTS: 100 evaluable patients were enrolled. Median age at surgery was 38 years (range 23-67). Stage was IA2 (33%) and IB1 (67%). Surgery included conization followed by lymph node assessment in 44 women, conization followed by simple hysterectomy with lymph node assessment in 40 women, and inadvertent simple hysterectomy followed by lymph node dissection in 16 women. Positive lymph nodes were noted in 5 patients (5%). Residual disease in the post-conization hysterectomy specimen was noted in 1/40 patients-that is, an immediate failure rate of 2.5%.
