Projected future changes in mean precipitation over Thailand based on multi-model regional climate simulations of CORDEX Southeast Asia,"Tangang F., Santisirisomboon J., Juneng L., Salimun E., Chung J., Supari S., Cruz F., Ngai S.T., Ngo-Duc T., Singhruck P., Narisma G., Santisirisomboon J., Wongsaree W., Promjirapawat K., Sukamongkol Y., Srisawadwong R., Setsirichok D., Phan-Van T., Aldrian E., Gunawan D., Nikulin G., Yang H.",2019-11-30,"Future projections, General circulation model, Global precipitation, Multi-Model Simulations, Regional circulation, Regional climate models, Regional climate simulation, Southeast Asia, CORDEX Southeast Asia, future projection, precipitation, regional climate simulation","This paper highlights detailed projected changes in rainfall over Thailand for the early (2011–2040), middle (2041–2070) and late (2071–2099) periods of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 using the high-resolution multi-model simulations of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Southeast Asia. The ensemble mean is calculated based on seven members consisting of six general circulation models (GCMs) and three regional climate models (RCMs). Generally, the ensemble mean precipitation agrees reasonably well with observations, best represented by the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) data, over Thailand during the historical period (1976–2005). However, inter-model variations can be large among ensemble members especially during dry months (December to March) for northern-central-eastern parts, and throughout the year for the southern parts of Thailand. Similarly for future projection periods, inter-model variations in the sign and magnitude of changes exist. The ensemble means of projected changes in rainfall for both RCPs during dry months show distinct contrast between the northern-central-eastern parts and the southern parts of Thailand with generally wetter and drier conditions, respectively. The magnitude of change can be as high as 15% of the historical period, which varies depending on the sub-region, season, projection period, and RCP scenario. In contrast, generally drier conditions are projected during the wet season (June to September) throughout the country for both RCPs where the rainfall reduction can be as high as 10% in some areas. However, the magnitude of projected rainfall changes of some individual models can be much larger than the ensemble means, exceeding 40% in some cases. These projected changes are related to the changes in regional circulations associated with the winter and summer monsoons, which are projected to weaken. The drier (wetter) condition is associated with the enhanced subsidence (rising motion).","fluidex; related topics, weather and cliMaterials Science forecasting, earth sciences",Atmospheric Science

Printability Analysis of Flexographic Printing On Compostable Films,"Hansuebsai A., Nawakitwong S.",2019-01-01,"Compostable film, Flexographic printing, Flexography, PBAT, PLA, Print qualities, Printability, Printability analysis, Quality requirements, Water based, compostable films, flexography, PBAT, PLA, printability, water based","As quality requirements of packaging continue to increase, flexographic printing still remains very important. Although many substrates are widely used for flexible packaging, bio-based materials are becoming popular because of their sustainable characteristic that results in the usage of bio-based films as a flexo-packaging substrates. This research focused on the printability of flexography using water based acrylic ink on compostable films produced in Thailand such as PLA/PBAT and PBAT/starch. Surface properties of these films were evaluated to observe how they affected the print quality (density, TVI and tone reproduction) of samples under certain conditions (running speed and anilox line screen). The examined properties of substrates were surface roughness, surface morphology and wettability. Results showed that print quality was influenced by substrates' surface properties and printing conditions. In addition, surface treatment was needed, but having limitation. Images of printed surface from SEM and SPM indicated that fracture surface and void of films could lead to defects of print quality. This suggests that raw materials mixed with additives are necessary to improve ink laid-down and hold-out on the surface.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, arts","Media Technology, Visual Arts and Performing Arts"
Localized delivery of pilocarpine to hypofunctional salivary glands through electrospun nanofiber mats: An ex vivo and in vivo study,"Muthumariappan S., Ng W.C., Adine C., Ng K.K., Davoodi P., Wang C.-H., Ferreira J.N.",2019-02-01,"Animals, Biocompatible Materials, Cell Compartmentation, Cell Death, Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Liberation, Female, Injections, Intradermal, Ki-67 Antigen, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Inbred ICR, Nanofibers, Pilocarpine, Saliva, Salivary Glands, Treatment Outcome, Drug delivery, Dry mouth, Electrospinning, Hypofunction, Nanofibers, Nanomaterials, Pilocarpine, Salivary glands, Xerostomia","Dry mouth or xerostomia is a frequent medical condition among the polymedicated elderly population. Systemic pilocarpine is included in the first line of pharmacological therapies for xerostomia. However, the efficacy of existing pilocarpine formulations is limited due to its adverse side effects and multiple daily dosages. To overcome these drawbacks, a localized formulation of pilocarpine targeting the salivary glands (SG) was developed in the current study. The proposed formulation consisted of pilocarpine-loaded Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanofiber mats via an electrospinning technique. The nanofiber mats were fully characterized for their size, mesh porosity, drug encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug release. Mat biocompatibility and efficacy was evaluated in the SG organ ex vivo, and the expression of proliferation and pro-apoptotic markers at the cellular level was determined. In vivo short-term studies were performed to evaluate the saliva secretion after acute SG treatment with pilocarpine-loaded nanofiber mats, and after systemic pilocarpine for comparison purposes. The outcomes demonstrated that the pilocarpine-loaded mats were uniformly distributed (diameter: 384 ± 124 nm) in a highly porous mesh, and possessed a high encapsulation efficiency (~81%). Drug release studies showed an initial pilocarpine release of 26% (4.5 h), followed by a gradual increase (~46%) over 15 d. Pilocarpine-loaded nanofiber mats supported SG growth with negligible cytotoxicity and normal cellular proliferation and homeostasis. Salivary secretion was significantly increased 4.5 h after intradermal SG treatment with drug-loaded nanofibers in vivo. Overall, this study highlights the strengths of PLGA/PEG nanofiber mats for the localized daily delivery of pilocarpine and reveals its potential for future clinical translation in patients with xerostomia.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Effect of sustained service loading on post-fire flexural response of reinforced concrete T-beams,"Thongchom C., Lenwari A., Aboutaha R.S.",2019-01-01,"Elevated temperature, Fire damages, Flexural response, Reinforced concrete beams, Service loading, Thermal response, Elevated temperatures, Finite element analysis, Fire damage, Flexural response, Reinforced concrete beams, Sustained service loading, Thermal response","This paper presents the effect of sustained service loading at elevated temperatures on the residual flexural response of reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams after exposed to elevated temperatures of 700 and 900°C (1292 and 1652°F) for 3 hours and then cooled in air. Two beams were subjected to a constant simulated service loading equal to 22.6% of undamaged (unheated) flexural strength, while the counterpart beams were exposed to fire without any applied sustained load. The test results showed that the bottom (tension) steel reinforcements in all fire-exposed beams had experienced the peak temperatures that were higher than a critical value (593°C [1099°F]) before the post-fire static test. The post-fire static test results showed that the sustained loading has a detrimental effect on the post-fire flexural response of RC beams. The effect was more pronounced on the post-fire stiffness and ductility than on strength. In the paper, simplified finite element models for predicting the temperature response and post-fire load-deflection relationships of fire-exposed RC beams are also described.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction"
"Cyclic behaviour and liquefaction resistance of Izumio sands in Osaka, Japan","Mase L.Z., Likitlersuang S., Tobita T.",2019-08-09,"Cyclic stress ratio, Cyclic tri-axial tests, Deviatoric stress, Effective stress paths, Excess pore pressure, Liquefaction resistance, Site investigations, Undisturbed specimens, Unknown","This article presents a study of liquefaction resistance behaviour of sand using a cyclic triaxial test. The site investigation was performed, and frozen undisturbed specimens were taken from the Izumio site in Osaka, Japan. According to the evidence in 1995 Kobe Earthquake, the first two sand layers are vulnerable to undergo liquefaction. The effect of deviatoric stress on liquefaction resistance was focused on in this study. The excess pore pressure ratio, hysteresis loop, and effective stress path from the cyclic triaxial tests were reported. A multispring element model was employed to simulate the soil behaviour under cyclic loading. The results showed that applied deviatoric stress could influence the liquefaction resistance of sandy soil samples. The plots of the cyclic stress ratio versus the number of cycles to generate liquefaction known as a liquefaction resistance curve can be then constructed and compared with other sands.","earth sciences, engineering","Oceanography, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Ocean Engineering"
Fictitious flux observer for sensorless control of synchronous reluctance motors considering magnetic cross -coupling effects,"Pitphibunwong S., Sangwongwanich S.",2019-03-01,"Cross-couplings, Flux observers, Globally stable observer, Operating condition, Rotor position, Sensorless drive, Speed estimator, Synchronous Reluctance motor, Cross coupling effects, Fictitious flux, Globally stable observer, Sensorless control, Synchronous reluctance motor","This paper extends the previously proposed position and speed estimator for synchronous reluctance motors which is based on the fictitious flux concept by taking into consideration the magnetic cross-coupling effects. Definition of the fictitious flux has been modified to include also the cross-coupling flux, and a new expression for the motor model is introduced. A globally stable flux observer is then derived, along with the rotor position and speed estimator by a vector phase-locked loop. Theoretical results are verified by simulation carried out under various operating conditions to confirm stability and performance of the sensorless drive using the proposed estimator.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Electrochemical investigation of amino acids Parkia seeds using the composite electrode based on copper/carbon nanotube/nanodiamond,"Babadi F.E., Hosseini S., Shavandi A., Moghaddas H., Shotipruk A., Kheawhom S.",2019-04-01,"Correlation coefficient, Diffusion controlled mechanism, Electrocatalytic activity, Electrochemical biosensor, Electrochemical investigations, Irreversible reactions, Parkia speciosa, Potassium ferrocyanide, Amino acid, Biosensor, Copper, Enzyme electrode, Nano-diamond, Parkia speciosa","An electrochemical biosensor comprising copper, nano-diamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT) has been fabricated to detect the amino acids of Parkia speciosa (PS) seeds. Parkia speciosa (stink bean), a Southeast Asian legume, is composed of medicinal chemicals which exhibit biological activities. The electro-catalytic activity of three electrodes Cu/CNT/ND, Zn/CNT/ND and NiO/CNT/ND was studied using 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 MKCl. The Zn/CNT/ND electrode exhibited irreversible reaction free oxidation with reduction peaks at -1 V, whereas, a pair redox peaks was observed for Cu/CNT/ND electrode. The immobilization of l-amino acid oxidase on the Cu/CNT/ND electrode was carried out to catalyze the amino acids detection. It was observed that the anodic and cathodic peak currents increased linearly with both the square root of the scan rate (ν1/2) and scan rate (ν) over the studied scan range of 0.01-0.1 V/s with high correlation coefficients and following both the adsorption and the diffusion-controlled mechanisms. The developed biosensor displayed a very good electro-catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the amino acid to release H2O2 and NH3 as a result of the reaction between the active sites and the Parkia speciosa component. This was also confirmed by a drop in the pH value from 6.8 to 6.5 and a change in the color of the solution from green to yellow (releasing H2S). The impedance results indicated an inductance behavior due to the co-formation of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the water via the adsorption on the electrode surface.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Methods: This study was conducted prospectively in 1340 patients admitted to a general hospital. All patients were screened for risky alcohol drinking. Risky alcohol drinkers were assessed by using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) to identify AUD patients. The diagnosis of AWS was based on criteria defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 5. The AWS scale was used to quantitate AWS severity level. Results: Prevalence of risky alcohol drinkers, AUD patients, and AWS patients among hospitalized patients was 15.5%, 13.1%, and 7.3%, respectively. All of the AUD and AWS patients were male. The majority of risky alcohol drinkers, patients with AUD, and patients with AWS were 40–60-year-old men. Almost all patients (98.3%) drank homemade alcohol. Hospitalized patients were more likely to develop AWS if they had liver disease or past experience with AWS. Conclusions: AUD and AWS are common in hospitalized patients. Formulating a protocol to identify and care for patients with alcohol-related disorders is urgent.","genergyal, sociology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, neuroscience","Health (social science), Biochemistry, Toxicology, Neurology, Behavioral Neuroscience"

This research was aimed to study the effect of the sterol alternative to ergosterol on the freezing stress of K. marxianus UBU1-11, a thermotolerant yeast. The 0–9 mgL−1 stigmasterol were added to the YM broth and applied for culturing. The growth of all conditions were not interfered by the addition of stigmasterol. The intra-cellular sterol content was detected in the medium with 5 mgL−1 stigmasterol and higher, where the maximum content was 0.32 mg g−1 cell dry weight. After frozen and thawed, the cultures contained stigmasterol had significantly higher viability than those without. It was found that the amount of stigmasterol contained in cells did not affect the number of survival. The stigmasterol provided a significant protection to the yeast cell when subjected to slow freezing. It also increased the survival rate of the culture subjected to subzero temperature storage.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial metabolism and physicsiology; microbial physicsiology, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
Comparison between the seventh and eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system for nasopharyngeal cancer integrated with pretreatment plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA level in a non-Chinese population: Secondary analysis from a prospective randomized trial,"Kitpanit S., Jittapiromsak N., Sriyook A., Prayongrat A., Kannarunimit D., Chakkabat C., Lertbutsayanukul C.",2019-12-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biomarkers, Tumor, Chemoradiotherapy, DNA, Viral, Female, Herpesvirus 4, Human, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms, Neoplasm Staging, Prognosis, Survival Analysis, Young Adult, Nasopharyngeal cancer, Plasma EBV DNA, TNM staging","Objective: To validate the eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients who were uniformly treated in a prospective randomized study using intensitymodulated radiation therapy and to investigate the prognostic value of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA level when incorporated into the TNM staging. Methods: Between October 2010 and September 2015, non-metastatic NPC patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Pretreatment images of 205 patients were reviewed by two radiologists to determine the TNM classification according to the seventh and eighth editions of the AJCC/UICC staging system. Overall survival (OS), progressionfree survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated. Harrell's C concordance index (C-index) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were used to compare the staging models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted and incorporated with plasma EBV DNA. Results: Overall, the eighth edition showed higher C-indexes and lower AIC values in nodal classification and stage groups, indicating a better discrimination performance and better goodness of fit, but showed similar separation for T classification compared with the seventh edition. The integration of pretreatment EBV values (<2300 vs =2300 copies/ml) to the eighth edition AJCC/UICC staging system allowed the classification of patients into three RPA categories and further lowered the AIC value and increased the C-index for OS. Conclusion: The eighth edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system had higher prognostic values in terms of OS, PFS and DMFS than the previous edition. An integration of pretreatment plasma EBV DNA into the next AJCC/UICC staging could improve the outcome prediction especially in poor risk groups who might benefit from treatment intensification.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Cancer Research"
Statistical process control improves the feasibility of remote physiological monitoring in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Cooper C.B., Sirichana W., Neufeld E.V., Taylor M., Wang X., Dolezal B.A.",2019-01-01,"Aged, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Inspiratory Capacity, Male, Middle Aged, Monitoring, Physiologic, Oxygen Consumption, Prospective Studies, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, Spirometry, Telemedicine, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, Early detection, Home monitoring, Treatment adherence","Background: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur with increasing frequency as the disease progresses and account for poor health status, worse prognosis, and higher healthcare expenditure. Methods: We developed a networked system for remote physiological monitoring (RPM) at home and optimized it with statistical process control (SPC) with the goal of earlier detection of COPD exacerbations. We enrolled 17 patients with moderate to severe COPD with a mean (SD) age of 71.1 (7.2) years. We obtained daily symptom scores, treatment adherence and activity levels using a programmable device, and measured daily slow and forced spirometry (FEV1, FVC, PEF), inspiratory capacity (IC) and oxygenation (SpO2). To identify exacerbations, we developed rolling prediction intervals for FVC, FEV1, IC and SpO2 using SPC. Results: The time taken to perform daily monitoring was reduced from 12.7 (5.4) minutes to 6.5 (2.6) minutes through software refinements during the study. Adherence to forced and slow spirometry was 62.6% and 62.4%, respectively. The within-subject coefficients of variation for FEV1, PEF and IC were 12.2%, 16.2%, and 13.1%, respectively. Event rates per patient-year for exacerbations were: self-reported 0.42, 2/3 Anthonisen Criteria (AC) 0.42, modified AC 2.23, systemic corticosteroid use 0.56, and antibiotic use 0.56. Conclusion: We successfully implemented a networked system for RPM of symptoms, treatment adherence, and physiology at home in patients with COPD. We demonstrated that SPC improves the feasibility of RPM in COPD patients which may increase the likelihood of detecting COPD exacerbations.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

However, its mechanisms responsible for anti-hyperlipidemic activity have not been fully identified. The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid-lowering mechanisms of C3R through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption in vitro. METHODS: The inhibitory activity of C3R against pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase was evaluated using enzymatic fluorometric and enzymatic colorimetric assays, respectively. An enzyme kinetic study using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk plot was performed to understand the possible types of inhibition. The formation of cholesterol micelles was determined using the cholesterol assay kit. The bile acid binding was measured using the colorimetric assay. The NBD cholesterol uptake in Caco-2 cells was determined using fluorometric assay. The mRNA expression of cholesterol transporter (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed that C3R was a mixed-type competitive inhibitor of pancreatic lipase with the IC50 value of 59.4 ± 1.41 μM. Furthermore, C3R (0.125-1 mM) inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase about 5-18%. In addition, C3R inhibited the formation of cholesterol micelles and bound to primary and secondary bile acid. In Caco-2 cells, C3R (12.5-100 μM) exhibited a significant reduction in cholesterol uptake in both free cholesterol (17-41%) and mixed micelles (20-30%). Finally, C3R (100 μM) was able to suppress mRNA expression of NPC1L1 in Caco-2 cells after 24 h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that C3R acts as a lipid-lowering agent through inhibition of lipid digestion and absorption.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

By cultured plating, only Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were mainly observed. By reverse transcriptase-nested PCR-DGGE (RevT-nested PCR-DGGE), lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were primarily observed while Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were only observed in particular stages of fermentation. The change of Maillard's reactants, particularly xylose and amino acids, as well as browning indicator were significant, when Bacillus and Staphylococcus were the main bacteria as mapping by RevT-nested PCR-DGGE. Extremely low browning indicator was found in moromi with more diverse autochthonous strains including Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. zhangzhouensis, B. pumilus, B. infantis S. condiment, Staphylococcus sp., S. carnosus, S. epidermidis and S. xylosus. Staphylococcus sp. SSB48, and B. amyloliquefaciens SSB6, with ability to ferment xylose and degrade melanoidin, were selected to test in moromi. These two isolates significantly reduced browning in moromi through melanoidin degradation without interfering with aromatic complexity and showed the best result in mature moromi fermented for one month. This study demonstrated the efficient method and potential source of target strains with novel properties. Additionally, the application of these autochthonous isolates was one of the potentially new biological means for browning reduction in soy sauce.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; microbially produced foods, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science
Leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number as a potential biomarker indicating poor outcome in biliary atresia and its association with oxidative DNA damage and telomere length,"Udomsinprasert W., Poovorawan Y., Chongsrisawat V., Vejchapipat P., Jittikoon J., Honsawek S.",2019-07-01,"Biliary Atresia, Child, DNA Copy Number Variations, DNA Damage, DNA, Mitochondrial, Humans, Leukocytes, Male, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidative Stress, Telomere, Telomere Homeostasis, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, Biliary atresia, Biomarker, Mitochondrial DNA copy number, Relative telomere length","Biliary atresia (BA) is a chronic obstructive liver disease, leading to advanced liver failure. Mitochondria dysfunction-mediated aberrant telomere length has been implicated in various pathological processes including cholestasis. Herein, we aimed to investigate associations between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, oxidative DNA damage, telomere length, and disease severity in BA patients. mtDNA copy number and relative telomere length (RTL) were assessed using real-time PCR. Circulating 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured using ELISA. Our findings showed that BA patients had significantly lower mtDNA copy number and RTL than healthy controls, whereas plasma 8-OHdG levels were significantly elevated in BA patients. mtDNA copy number was remarkably reduced in advanced BA patients. Furthermore, mtDNA copy number was independently associated with age and degree of liver fibrosis in BA patients. Decreased mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with elevated risks of BA, severe fibrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction. Low mtDNA copy number can be utilized to distinguish patients with poor-outcome from those with good-outcome. Survival curve analysis revealed that low mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with poor survival of BA patients. Interestingly, there was a positive association between mtDNA copy number and plasma 8-OHdG in BA patients, while a negative association of mtDNA copy number with RTL was observed in BA patients. Alternatively, RTL was negatively correlated with plasma 8-OHdG in BA patients.

Health education through mass media announcements by loudspeakers about malaria care: Prevention and practice among people living in a malaria endemic area of northern Myanmar,"Aung P.L., Pumpaibool T., Soe T.N., Burgess J., Menezes L.J., Kyaw M.P., Cui L.",2019-11-12,"Adult, Aged, Endemic Diseases, Female, Health Education, Humans, Malaria, Male, Mass Media, Middle Aged, Myanmar, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Rural Population, Young Adult, Announcement, Loudspeaker, Malaria care, Malaria infection, Rural Myanmar","Background: Interventions to raise community awareness about malaria prevention and treatment have used various approaches with little evidence on their efficacy. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of loudspeaker announcements regarding malaria care and prevention practices among people living in the malaria endemic villages of Banmauk Township, Sagaing Region, Myanmar. Methods: Four villages among the most malaria-burdened areas were randomly selected: two villages were assigned as the intervention group, and two as the control. Prior to the peak transmission season of malaria in June 2018, a baseline questionnaire was administered to 270 participants from randomly selected households in the control and intervention villages. The loudspeaker announcements broadcasted health messages on malaria care and prevention practices regularly at 7:00 pm every other day. The same questionnaire was administered at 6-month post intervention to both groups. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and the t-test were utilized to assess differences between and within groups. Results: Participants across the control and intervention groups showed similar socio-economic characteristics; the baseline knowledge, attitude and practice mean scores were not significantly different between the groups. Six months after the intervention, improvements in scores were observed at p-value < 0.001 in both groups, however; the increase was greater among the intervention group. The declining trend of malaria was also noticed during the study period. In addition, more than 75% of people expressed positive opinions of the intervention. Conclusions: The loudspeaker intervention was found to be feasible and effective, as shown by the significant improvement in scores related to prevention and care-seeking practices for malaria as well as reduced malaria morbidity. Expanding the intervention to a larger population in this endemic region and evaluating its long-term effectiveness are essential in addition to replicating this in other low-resource malaria endemic regions.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"
The diversity of Anopheles blood feeding patterns suggests different malaria protection strategies in different localities,"Chakim I., Pumpaibool T.",2019-01-01,"Animals, Anopheles, Feeding Behavior, Indonesia, Malaria, Mosquito Control, Mosquito Vectors, Anopheles, blood feeding pattern, diversity, Malaria, protective strategy","Background: Malaria is a significant health burden for many countries worldwide. Insecticide-treated bed nets and mosquito repellent are considered effective methods for preventing Anopheles bites. However, changes in the biological properties of the vector have led to a reduction in their effectiveness. Most published studies have only investigated the human population factor, not the dynamics of vector behavior. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the importance of primary vector activity for selecting an appropriate malaria protection strategy. Methods: Initially, active case detection (ACD) was carried out in western and eastern parts of Indonesia, Jambi and Sumba, to confirm their endemicity level. According to the 2016 national health report of Indonesia, Jambi has an annual parasite index (API) of 0.14 and Sumba has an API of 5.41. A series of entomological observations were carried out to compare the biting activity of Anopheles vectors in two localities, with a total of 216 houses and 216 catchers (108 at each study site). Results: The results indicated that endemicity at the sub-district level is higher than that at the provincial level. Only Anopheles balabacensi was found to be exophagic. Multiple comparisons found different biting times between the sites, suggesting that early evening (18.00-20.00) is most likely to be the time when mosquitoes transmit the Plasmodium parasite in Jambi, while during sleeping hours (21.00-01.00) is the peak biting time of Anopheles mosquitoes in Sumba. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the importance of Anopheles species blood feeding patterns in selecting an appropriate malaria protection strategy.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The simulated results under predetermined conditions revealed that the methanol yield of 28.88%, CO2 permeation factor of 99.24% and water permeation factor of 89.64% were obtained from the MMR, which were higher than those obtained from the TMR. This was attributed to the fact that the high surface area-to-volume ratio of MMR provided superior heat and mass transfer rate for the reactions, resulting in a better performance of the reactor. Furthermore, the operating and design parameters of MMR were also investigated. It was found that the mass flow ratio of gas in biogas channels (BC) to that in reaction channels (RC) and Weight hour space velocity (WHSV) in RC significantly affected the reactor performance. Finally, the reactions of methanol synthesis in MMR were proved toovercome the equilibrium limitation at low pressure. The quality of bio-methane obtained from MMR could also be used as a fuel for vehicles.","chemistry, coastal engineering, energy, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Enhanced organic solar cell performance: Multiple surface plasmon resonance and incorporation of silver nanodisks into a grating-structure electrode,"Putnin T., Lertvachirapaiboon C., Ishikawa R., Shinbo K., Kato K., Ekgasit S., Ounnunkad K., Baba A.",2019-01-01,"Absorption enhancement, Localized surface plasmon resonance, Metallic nanoparticles, Near-field distribution, Organic thin-film solar cells, Plasmonic nanostructures, Power conversion efficiencies, Solar cell performance, Ag nanodisks, Grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance, Imprinted grating, Localized surface plasmon resonance, Organic solar cells","In this study, plasmonic nanostructures were examined to enhance the light harvesting of organic thin-film solar cells (OSCs) by multiple surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomena originating from the grating-coupled configuration with a Blu-ray Disc recordable (BD-R)-imprinted aluminum (Al) grating structure and the incorporation of a series of silver nanodisks (Ag NDs). The devices with such a configuration maximize the light utilization inside OSCs via light absorption, light scattering, and trapping via multiple surface plasmon resonances. Different types and sizes of metallic nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), Ag nanospheres (Ag NSs), and Ag NDs, were used, which were blended separately in a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL). The device structure comprised of grating- imprinted-Al/P3HT:PCBM/Ag ND:PEDOT:PSS/ITO. Results obtained from the J-V curves revealed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of grating-structured Al/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO is 3.16%; this value is ~6% higher than that of a flat substrate. On the other hand, devices with flat Al and incorporated Au NPs, Ag NSs, or Ag NDs in the HTL exhibited PCEs ranging from 3.15% to 3.37%. Furthermore, OSCs with an Al grating substrate were developed by the incorporation of the Ag ND series into the PEDOT:PSS layer. Compared with that of a reference device, the PCEs of the devices increased to 3.32%-3.59% (11%-20% improvement), indicating that the light absorption enhancement at the active layer corresponds to the grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance and localized surface plasmon resonance excitations with strong near-field distributions penetrating into the active layer leading to higher efficiencies and subsequent better current generation.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science, engineering","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Building upon this remarkable history, Thailand has set an ambitious goal to stop the AIDS epidemic in the country by 2030. A key component of the strategy to achieve this goal includes scale-up of HIV screening programs to facilitate early HIV diagnosis and investment in mechanisms to support immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Initiation of ART during early or acute HIV infection not only reduces viremia, thereby halting onward transmission of HIV, but also may facilitate HIV remission by reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir and preserving immune function. In Thailand, many efforts have been made to reduce the time from HIV infection to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment, especially among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Successfully identifying and initiating ART in individuals with acute HIV infection has been leveraged to conduct groundbreaking studies of novel strategies to achieve HIV remission, including studies of broadly-neutralizing HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies and candidate therapeutic vaccines. These efforts have mostly been deployed in Bangkok and future efforts should include other urban and more rural areas. Continued progress in HIV prevention, screening, and treatment will position Thailand to substantially limit new infections and may pave the way for an HIV cure.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Virology, Pharmacology (medical)"

The testbed uses the GNS3 platform where OVS switches are constructed and controlled by the Opendaylight controller. A simple Linux script has been developed herein to instantiate a distributed ping attack from all possible starting switches to a victim gateway with the DDoS intention.

McBel-Plnc: A deep learning model for multiclass multilabel classification of protein-lncRNA interactions,"Navamajiti N., Saethang T., Wichadakul D.",2019-11-13,"Binary classifiers, Learning models, LncRNA, Molecular mechanism, Multi-label classifications, Protein-RNA interaction, RNA-binding protein, Standard deviation, Deep learning model, LncRNA, Machine learning, Multiclass multilabel classification, RBP-lncRNA interactions, RNA-binding protein","One main function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is to act as a scaffold facilitating multiple proteins to form complexes. Most of available prediction models for protein-RNA interactions, however, were proposed as a binary classifier, which limited on predicting the interaction between the non-coding RNAs and each individual RNA-binding protein (RBP). Hence, to predict if a lncRNA is acting as a scaffold, we consider this problem as a multiclass multilabel classification problem. To solve this problem, the high confident CLIP-seq data were selected from the POSTAR2 database with an augmentation of the data for the RBP classes with a small number of interacting lncRNAs. We then constructed a deep learning model for multiclass multilabel classification, called McBel-Plnc, based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) using each of the five datasets randomly generated from the prepared data. Based on macro average, the test results showed the high precision of 0.9151 ± 0.0038 averaged from the five models with the lower recall of 0.5786 ± 0.0208. The small standard deviations confirmed the model stability. Comparing with iDeepE with a binary relevance method, iDeepE got the higher recall with the significantly lower precision (0.6912 and 0.1987, respectively). This result suggested that our model is competent to predict the protein-lncRNA interactions, especially with the lncRNAs targeted by multiple proteins. This suggested the potential to infer the insights of lncRNA functions and molecular mechanisms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

However, in case of critical and emergency situations, active braking (AB) performs better in improving handling improvement. To improve overall handling performance in the critical situation, combination of TV and AB is introduced in this paper. Yaw rate and vehicle sideslip rate are used as a control parameter in PID controller to determine motor torques and brake pressures. Brake force is applied at each wheel whenever motor brake torque is activated. With the contribution of AB, overall required motor torques for countering yaw moment are drastically reduced in four-wheel independent drive electric vehicle while similar stability performance can be achieved.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, decision sciences, physics","Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software, Information Systems and Management, Instrumentation"

In early 2000, canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) was first reported and subsequently became a predominant subtype circulating in Europe and the Americas. CPV-2c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam. However, CPV-2c has never been reported in Thailand. In this study, we conducted viral enteric disease surveillance in dogs and cats in Thailand during 2016–2018. During 20 months of surveillance, 507 rectal swab samples were collected from dogs (n = 444) and cats (n = 63) with and without clinical signs. The samples were examined for parvovirus by using VP2 gene-specific PCR for parvovirus. Our results showed that the positivity of canine parvovirus (CPV) was 29.95% and that of feline parvovirus (FPV) was 58.73%. In this study, we characterized 34 parvoviruses by VP2 gene sequencing. Moreover, two Thai-CPV-2 (Dog/CU-24 and Cat/CU-21) were characterized by whole genome sequencing. The phylogenetic results showed that Thai-CPV-2 had the highest nucleotide identities and clustered with Asian-CPV-2c but were in separate subclusters from the North American and European CPV-2c. Similarly, whole genome analyses showed that Thai-CPVs are closely related to Asian-CPV-2c, with unique amino acids at positions 297A, 324I, 370R and 426E. In summary, our results demonstrated the emergence of Asian-CPV-2c in dogs and cats in Thailand. Thus, the surveillance of CPV-2 in domestic dogs and cats should be further conducted on a larger scale to determine the dynamics of predominant variants and their distributions in the country and in the Southeast Asia region.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

This study investigated the impact of oil phase composition on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cinnamon oil nanoemulsions against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The nanoemulsions were fabricated using the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method, which simply involves heating a mixture of surfactant, oil, and water about the PIT and then quench cooling with stirring. The antimicrobial activity of cinnamon oil is largely due to cinnamaldehyde, which is highly susceptible to chemical degradation. For this reason, the decrease in cinnamaldehyde content and increase in a major reaction product (benzaldehyde) were measured in the cinnamon oil nanoemulsions during storage. The antimicrobial activity of cinnamon oil nanoemulsions increased (lower MICs) as the droplet size decreased. Cinnamaldehyde was degraded during emulsification and after storage for 31 days. These results have important implications for the improvement of the antimicrobial activity and stability of encapsulated cinnamon oil using nanoemulsion-based delivery systems.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Here, the effects of salt-induced stresses, including NaCl, KCl, and LiCl stresses, on the production of lipid in green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (137c) were investigated. NaCl stress dramatically increased saturated fatty acids (SFAs), which accounted for 70.2% of the fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) under stress. In contrary, KCl stress led to a slight increase in SFAs (47.05%) with the remaining being polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (45.77%). RT-PCR analysis revealed that the genes involved in FA biosynthesis, such as PDH2, ACCase, MAT and KAS2, were up-regulated by NaCl-induced stress. Conversely, the genes responsible for the Kennedy pathway were suppressed. The alteration of FA homeostasis was further assessed by overexpressing MAT, the enzyme responsible for the production of malonyl-ACP, a key building block for FA biosynthesis, in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Intracellular FA composition was affected, with a predominant synthesis of SFAs in transformed cells. Owing to the diversity and relative abundance of SFAs, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFAs) and PUFAs enable the feasibility of using microorganisms as a source of microalgal lipids or valuable nutritional ingredients; salt-induced stress and expression of MAT are useful in providing precursors for enhanced lipid production.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, pharmacology",Drug Discovery

We collected prospective data on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among a multinational cohort of children to evaluate an adherence questionnaire. Methods: We enrolled 319 children ages 0 to 16 years on ART in Kenya (n = 110), South Africa (n = 109) or Thailand (n = 100). Children were followed up for six months of adherence monitoring between March 2015 and August 2016 using Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS®) with at least one viral load measure. At month 3 and 6, children or their caregivers were administered a 10-item adherence questionnaire. Repeated measures analyses were used to compare responses on questionnaire items to external adherence criteria: MEMS® dichotomized adherence (≥90% of doses taken vs. <90%), 48-hour MEMS® treatment interruptions and viral suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Items associated with outcomes (p < 0.10) were coefficient-weighted to calculate a total adherence score, which was tested in multivariate regression against MEMS® and viral suppression outcomes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results: Mean child age was 11 years and 54% were female. Children from Thailand (median age 14 years) were significantly older compared to Kenya (10 years) and South Africa (10 years). Prevalence of viral suppression was 97% in Thailand, 81% in South Africa and 69% in Kenya, while the prevalence of MEMS® adherence ≥90% was 57% in Thailand, 58% in South Africa and 40% in Kenya. Across sites, child-reported adherence using the questionnaire was significantly associated with dichotomized MEMS® adherence (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4), 48-hour treatment interruptions (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.6), and viral suppression (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7 to 6.7). We did find, however, that different cut-points for the adherence score may be context-specific. For example, MEMS® non-adherent children in Kenya had a lower adherence score (0.98) compared to South Africa (1.77) or Thailand (1.58). Conclusions: We found suboptimal adherence to ART was common by multiple measures in this multi-country cohort of children. The short-form questionnaire demonstrated reasonable validity to screen for non-adherence in these diverse settings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The angles of flexion, extension and lateral bend for a standing position were measured simultaneously using both the novel POF sensor of this investigation and the commercial Biometrics goniometer instrument. Each movement had two steps of bending which were 10° and 20° based on inclinometer readings. The POF sensor had good intra-rater reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.61 to 0.83). Bland-Altman plots were used to study the agreement using these two sensors. There were proportional differences and bias between the POF sensor and Biometrics goniometer, as the zero points did not lie in the percentage difference region in the Bland-Altman plots. The proportional difference between these two likely reflects the different sizes and thus, measurement regions of the two sensors. There was also strong correlation between the two sensors (r > 0.77).

The occurrence of such problems is due to drivers who do not respect traffic laws, inappropriate behavior of the driver, and the cause of illegal parking at prohibited parking, resulting in the rear car unable to move further. Possible or the car must change lanes to another lane. Therefore, to reduce such problems, we have developed an illegal parking pattern recognition system for cars on the road. We have applied the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the signal from CCTV cameras and find important characteristics of illegal car parked at the bus stop. Then use those images to learn to recognize the parking behavior of cars with Linear Regression. From the experiment, it is found that the recognition of cars parked on the road in front of the bus stop has an accuracy rate of 82.22 percent which can be used to detect the soaking of personal cars in real life.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Signal Processing, Media Technology, Computer Networks and Communications"

The liquid products were recovered with acetone in an ice-cold trap and analyzed by Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and the gas products (CO, CO2, CH4 and H2) were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Thermal Conductivity Detector (GC-TCD). It is found that H-ZSM-5 (HSZ-822), H-Beta (HSZ-931) and H-USY (HSZ-330) exhibited high performance for the conversion of oxygenated compounds in the bio-oils to aromatic hydrocarbons. Also, it is found that the biomass feedstock types showed great influence on the hydrocarbon compositions when using the same catalyst. High yield of BTXs was obtained by catalytic upgrading of the bio-oils derived from the cellulose and lignin over H-USY and H-Beta zeolites. In contrast, the remarkable production of xylene was observed in the catalytic upgrading of the bio-oils derived from the hemicellulose over all zeolite types. Moreover, the reusability of these three zeolites was in the order of H-Beta > H-USY > H-ZSM-5.","heat exchange, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Current diagnostic tools are slow, non-specific at the species and subspecies levels, and require specific morphological expertise to accurately identify pathogens from pure cultures. DNA barcodes are easily amplified, universal, short species-specific DNA sequences, which enable rapid identification by comparison with a well-curated reference sequence collection. The primary fungal DNA barcode, ITS region, was introduced in 2012 and is now routinely used in diagnostic laboratories. However, the ITS region only accurately identifies around 75% of all medically relevant fungal species, which has prompted the development of a secondary barcode to increase the resolution power and suitability of DNA barcoding for fungal disease diagnostics. The translational elongation factor 1α (TEF1α) was selected in 2015 as a secondary fungal DNA barcode, but it has not been implemented into practice, due to the absence of a reference database.

Although it has been used primarily as a cognitive screening test, many studies have attempted to establish the CDT's ability to localize specific brain lesions or pathology. This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence on the neuroanatomical correlates of the CDT. Methods: Using PRISMA guidelines, the authors systematically reviewed the evidence on neuroanatomical correlates of clock drawing by a systematic search in six databases (Pubmed, CINHL, PsychINFO, HealthStar, Embase, and Web of Science) until January 2018. Studies were included if they reported CDT correlations with anatomical brain lesions documented by neuroimaging. Results: Forty-five papers met inclusion criteria. Thirty-one studies identified distinct areas of neuroanatomical correlates of CDT utilizing different scoring methods and imaging techniques. Nine articles reported on the degree of white matter hyperintensities that correlated with lower scores on CDT and the severity of cognitive deficits. Five articles focused on postacute cerebrovascular accidents correlated with CDT performance. A variety of different anatomical lesions, located in all areas of the brain, were associated with abnormalities on the CDT. Conclusions: The CDT, regardless of scoring method and population studied, was not associated with any consistent, specific brain localization. This systematic review supports the use of the CDT as a cognitive screening test rather than a method of localizing brain lesions.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, medical","Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PD-related infections are based on variable evidence. We describe practice patterns across facilities participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS). METHODS: PDOPPS, a prospective cohort study, enrolled nationally representative samples of PD patients in Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Canada, Thailand, Japan, the UK and the USA. Data on PD-related infection prevention and treatment practices across facilities were obtained from a survey of medical directors'. RESULTS: A total of 170 centers, caring for >11 000 patients, were included. The proportion of facilities reporting antibiotic administration at the time of PD catheter insertion was lowest in the USA (63%) and highest in Canada and the UK (100%). Exit-site antimicrobial prophylaxis was variably used across countries, with Japan (4%) and Thailand (28%) having the lowest proportions. Exit-site mupirocin was the predominant exit-site prophylactic strategy in ANZ (56%), Canada (50%) and the UK (47%), while exit-site aminoglycosides were more common in the USA (72%). Empiric Gram-positive peritonitis treatment with vancomycin was most common in the UK (88%) and USA (83%) compared with 10-45% elsewhere. Empiric Gram-negative peritonitis treatment with aminoglycoside therapy was highest in ANZ (72%) and the UK (77%) compared with 10-45% elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in PD-related infection prevention and treatment strategies exist across countries with limited uptake of ISPD guideline recommendations. Further work will aim to understand the impact these differences have on the wide variation in infection risk between facilities and other clinically relevant PD outcomes.",medical,"Nephrology, Transplantation"

Using the domestic cat as a biomedical model, the objectives were to (1) confirm the expression of AMPKα and its regulatory kinases in epididymal spermatozoa and (2) assess the influence of AMPK activator, 5′-aminoimidasole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) on epididymal sperm function before and after cryopreservation. Methods: In study I, sperm samples of different qualities were obtained from cauda epididymides of domestic cats and evaluated for AMPKα expression. In study II, epididymal spermatozoa were equilibrated for either 30 or 60 min in the presence of 0 (control), 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 mM AICAR and sperm functions were assessed before and after cryopreservation. In study III, epididymal spermatozoa were treated as in study II and evaluated for AMPKα signaling protein expressions (phospho-AMPKα Thr172 and GLUT1) as well as ATP levels. Results: AMPKα protein expression was higher in high-motility vs poor-motility samples. Thirty-minute equilibration with 0.5 mM AICAR improved motion characteristics and fertilizing ability of cryopreserved sperm to the control. Increased expressions of phospho-AMPKα Thr172 and GLUT1 as well as intracellular ATP level were confirmed in sperm samples equilibrated with 0.5 or 2.0 mM AICAR for 30 min. Conclusions: Presence and role of AMPKα protein in cat regulating sperm function were demonstrated before and after cryopreservation. Findings could be used to potentially enhance cryopreserved sperm function in sub-fertile men.","medical, biochemistryistry","Reproductive Medicine, Genetics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Developmental Biology, Genetics (clinical)"

We aimed to determine the fraction of disease episodes likely to remain untreated due to the administration of antimicrobials on non-susceptible pathogens in chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Weekly data on antimicrobial use and clinical signs were collected from 88 randomly chosen chicken flocks over 124 full production cycles (i.e. time between restocking flocks with day-old chicks and sale for slaughter). A naïve Bayes model was trained to infer the probabilities of disease episodes having been caused by each of 24 pathogens, given the observed clinical sign profile, and expert knowledge on their relative incidence. Results: A total of 224 disease episodes were observed, of which 44.8% were attributed to viruses (95% CI 31.1-58.4%), 54.6% (CI 40.4-68.7%) to bacteria, and 0.6% (CI 0-1.7%) to a protozoan (Eimeria spp.). Antimicrobials were more frequently administered on weeks with disease than on weeks without disease (43.3% vs. 17.8%; p < 0.001). A median of 2 [IQR 0-4] antimicrobials were used by episode. The choice of specific antimicrobials was independent on whether the flocks had disease clinical signs or not. Antimicrobials were not used in 30.3% of the episodes. The overall probability that episodes were not effectively treated was 74.2, and 53.7% when discounting cases where the inferred aetiology is viral. Considering only episodes where antimicrobials were given, these probabilities were 57.4 and 23.8% respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights untargeted use of antimicrobials on small-scale Vietnamese chicken farms, as well as the limitations of antimicrobials as effective tools to control infectious diseases.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

A prospective observational study was conducted in pregnant women with a gestational age of 11 to 13 +6 weeks. A 3D transabdominal placental volume measurement was performed at the time of first-trimester aneuploidy screening. The predictive values of this test were calculated. The data from 360 pregnant women was analysed. Seventeen cases developed preeclampsia and/or IUGR. The 10 th percentile of placental volume was used as the cut-off level. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of placental volume less than the 10 th percentile for prediction of preeclampsia and/or IUGR were 23.5%, 90.7%, 11.1% and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for prediction of early onset preeclampsia were 50%, 90.7%, 3.0% and 99.7%, respectively.

It was not an effective screening tool for preeclampsia and/or IUGR in the first trimester.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Placental volume may reflect trophoblast invasion, but much earlier, in the first trimester. The estimation of a smaller early placental volume has been shown to be significantly associated with preeclampsia and IUGR. What do the results of this study add? The placental volume was lower in the cases with preeclampsia and/or IUGR. It was not an effective screening tool for preeclampsia and/or IUGR in the first trimester. But it might be used for predicting early onset preeclampsia. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Further research of placental volume in the first trimester for predicting an early onset preeclampsia should be conducted.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology

Functional status (FS) was assessed by combining self-reports of 8 instrumental and 5 basic activities of daily living, using the Lawton-Brody and the Katz questionnaires. Summary FS scores, ranging from 1.25 (most dependent) to 13 (independent), were based on the patient’s ability to perform each activity with or without assistance. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of a FS score < 11 comparing each country with the United States (US). Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR; 95% CI) for the effect of a low FS score on mortality and transfer to hemodialysis, adjusting for case mix. Results: Of 2,593 patients with complete data on FS, 48% were fully independent (FS = 13), 32% had a FS score 11 to < 13, 14% had a FS score 8 to < 11, and 6% had a FS score < 8. Relative to the US, low FS scores (< 11; more dependent) were more frequent in Thailand (OR = 10.48, 5.90 - 18.60) and the United Kingdom (UK) (OR = 3.29, 1.77 - 6.08), but similar in other PDOPPS countries. The FS score was inversely and monotonically associated with mortality but not with transfer to hemodialysis; the HR, comparing a FS score < 8 vs 13, was 4.01 (2.44 – 6.61) for mortality and 0.91 (0.58 - 1.43) for transfer to hemodialysis. Conclusion: Regional differences in FS scores observed across PDOPPS countries may have been partly due to differences in regional patient selection for PD.

It was aimed as an alternative method to dry harvested paddy instead of the traditional open air technique that can encounter rain or flooding problems. The prototype membrane drier was designed from a mathematical air flow pattern analysis, where it was found that a horizontal flow mode with a baffle plate and triangle air flow path (HFwBF&TFP) was the most appropriate feature. The chitosan membranes studied in this research were uncrosslinked dense (UCD), crosslinked dense (CD), uncrosslinked composite-on-spunbond (UCC) and crosslinked composite-on-spunbond (CC) membranes. The highest drying rate of the membrane drier equipped with UCD, CD, UCC and CC membranes occurred in the first hour of operation at 46.4 ± 0.4, 51.7 ± 6.7, 57.8 ± 0.9 and 71.5 ± 4.9 g-water/kg-moist-paddy/h, respectively. Compared to the drying rate by the open air technique and a hot air oven at 40 °C (52.7 ± 0.7 and 40.2 ± 0.7 g-water/kg-moist-paddy/h, respectively), the chitosan membrane drier could be used as an alternative method for drying biomass, such as paddy rice.

Derangement of the brainstem modulating system, especially raphe nuclei may contribute to this hyperexcitability. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) in the development of cortical and trigeminal hyperexcitability in a rat model of MOH. Results: Chronic treatment with acetaminophen increased the frequency of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-IR) neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). In the control group, muscimol microinjected into the NRM increased significantly the frequency of CSD-evoked direct current shift and Fos-IR neurons in the TNC. This facilitating effect was not found in rats with chronic acetaminophen exposure. In a model of migraine induced by intravenous systemic infusion of nitroglycerin (NTG), rats with chronic exposure to acetaminophen exhibited significantly more frequent neuronal firing in the TNC and greater Fos-IR than those without the acetaminophen treatment. Muscimol microinjection increased neuronal firing in the TNC in control rats, but not in acetaminophen-treated rats. The number of Fos-IR cells in TNC was not changed significantly.

However, it is unclear whether the SNPs are related to the clinical outcome of HBV infection in Thai individuals. Methods: The rs2296651 and rs4646287 polymorphisms of NTCP were determined by allelic discrimination using commercial TaqMan probes in blood samples of 1021 Thai individuals. These subjects included 610 patients with chronic HBV infection [CHB, 305 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 305 without HCC], 206 subjects with spontaneous HBV clearance and 205 healthy controls who were age and gender-matched. Results: The frequencies of rs2296651 A minor allele in the CHB group, the HBV clearance group and healthy controls were 7.8, 7.3 and 13.9%, respectively. For rs4646287, the frequencies of T minor allele of the corresponding groups were 10.4, 8.0 and 9.5%, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, the frequencies of rs2296651 GA + AA genotypes were significantly lower in the CHB group (P &lt; 0.001) and in the HBV clearance group (P = 0.001). There was no difference in their distribution between the HBV clearance and CHB groups. Among the CHB group, the distribution of GA + AA genotypes in patients with HCC were significantly lower than in patients without HCC (P = 0.014). The frequencies of HBeAg positivity in patients harboring GG and GA + AA genotypes were 39.8 and 23.5%, respectively (P = 0.004). Among patients with HCC, the mean HBV DNA of the corresponding genotypes were 4.9 ± 1.3 vs. 2.7 ± 1.0 log10 IU/mL, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in genotype and allele frequencies of rs4646287 polymorphism among all studied groups. Conclusions: Our results showed that rs2296651 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of susceptibility to HBV infection and the development of HCC.

In this paper, a prototype framework of low-latency collection of multi-point video streams over a multi-hop multi-channel wireless network is proposed. Video frames are captured by Raspberry Pi cameras and sent by the wireless link to the herein-called IoT Concentrators. IoT-Cloud Hub then pulls and stores those video frames from the IoT Concentrators. Users (traffic police) can watch traffic videos from the display screen of the IoT-Cloud Hub. As a proof-of-concept implementation, two Pi Cameras have been set up with Apache Kafka Producers and two additional Raspberry Pi’s have been set up as the IoT Concentrators, which run the leader and follower Apache Kafka Brokers. To complete our system, an Intel® NUC as IoT-Cloud Hub and another Intel® NUC as Orchestration-Hub have been also set up. We assume the available wired communication linkage between the Orchestration-Hub and the other devices. However, the links between the Pi Cameras, IoT Concentrators and IoT-Cloud Hub are wireless with Wi-Fi. To achieve a high performance, multiple Wi-Fi channels can be dynamically configured by the Orchestration-Hub to steer the VDO traffic (based on TCP) away from the congested channels. Based on the implementation prototype, the average TCP throughputs over all the wireless links have been improved by 56.046% on average, compared with the case without the dynamic Wi-Fi channel selection.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Software
A possible protein model involved in gallium arsenide leaching by Cellulosimicrobium funkei,"Maneesuwannarat S., Kudpeng K., Yingchutrakul Y., Roytrakul S., Vangnai A.S., Yamashita M., Thiravetyan P.",2019-06-15,"Abc transporter proteins, Aliphatic phosphate, Cellulosimicrobium, Environmental-friendly, Low concentrations, Organic phosphates, Phosphate-binding proteins, Positively charged, Bioleaching, Cellulosimicrobium funkei, Electronic waste, Gallium, Gallium arsenide, Semiconductor","Gallium (Ga), in the form of gallium arsenide (GaAs) has been extensively used as a substrate in semiconductor materials. The use of microorganisms is fast becoming a promising alternative to not only leach the metal at low concentrations, but to do so in a more safe, environmental friendly as well as in an energy saving way. The metabolites such as peptides and proteins in Cellulosimicrobium funkei have previously been shown to be involved in GaAs leaching, however the mechanism of how they do this has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, the role of C. funkei metabolites in the leaching of GaAs in different pHs was investigated. This study provides the first look at Ga-binding proteins from the supernatant of C. funkei at different pHs using affinity chromatography and LC-MS/MS analysis. Additionally, the functional group of bacterial proteins involved in Ga-binding were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The FTIR spectra revealed that Ga associated with the carboxylic groups of free amino acids/ peptides/ side chains of proteins, thiol-containing peptides/proteins, and the organic phosphate or aliphatic phosphate groups of phosphate binding proteins. This result was further confirmed by the identification of phosphate-binding proteins found in Ga-protein complexes by LC-MS/MS such as sugar ABC transporter proteins and protein kinases, with it possible that these proteins might improve Ga leaching efficiency. Furthermore, the type and number of proteins that could form Ga-protein complexes changed when the pH was changed, with the intensity of many proteins which could form Ga complexes increasing when the pH was increased. This was due to the amino acid side-chains in these proteins being deprotonated and therefore possessing a higher negative charge and allowing a better interaction possible with the positively charged Ga.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences","Control and Systems Engineering, Chemistry (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanical Engineering"
Novel insights into the mechanisms underlying depression-associated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"Duarte-Silva E., Macedo D., Maes M., Peixoto C.A.",2019-07-13,"Animals, Depression, Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental, Mice, Multiple Sclerosis, Animal model, Depression, EAE, MS-associated depression","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by neuroinflammation, demyelination and neuroaxonal degeneration affecting >2 million people around the world. MS is often accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder (MDD), which presents a lifetime prevalence of around 50% in MS patients. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model extensively used to study MS. EAE mimics the autoimmune nature of MS, as well as its inflammatory and demyelinating mechanisms also presenting predictive validity. There are important similarities between EAE and MS-associated depression (MSD). The mechanisms shared by these disorders include peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress, nitrosative stress, lowered antioxidant defenses, increased bacterial translocation into the systemic circulation, and microglial pathology. Although the role of the immune-inflammatory system in MDD has been established in the 1990's, only few studies addressed immune pathways as a major determinant of depressive-like behavior in EAE. Therefore, in the present study we aimed at revising the current literature on EAE as an animal model to investigate the comorbidity between MS and MDD. In this regard, we revised the current literature on behavioral alterations in EAE, the possible mechanisms involved in this comorbidity and the potential and limitations of using this animal model to study depressive-like behavior.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologyne response disorders; autoImmunologynity; human studies, pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"
The effect of prosthesis design on blood loss in simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty: Closed-box versus open-box prosthesis,"Rattanaprichavej P., Laoruengthana A., Rasamimogkol S., Varakornpipat P., Reosanguanwong K., Pongpirul K.",2019-12-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Blood Loss, Surgical, Blood Transfusion, Female, Humans, Knee Prosthesis, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Prosthesis Design, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Arthroplasty, Bilateral, Blood loss, Knee, Prosthesis, Transfusion","Background: Various pre- and perioperative risk factors have been reported in association with blood loss in knee arthroplasty. However, the effect of the uncovered cancellous surface on blood loss in simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA) by different prosthetic designs is not well elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the blood loss and transfusion rate between different knee prostheses in SBTKA and to identify risk factors that influence blood loss and transfusion after SBTKA. Methods: Demographic and perioperative data of patients who underwent SBTKA using either a closed-box or an open-box femoral component of posterior-stabilized fixed-bearing (PS FB) knee system were retrospectively reviewed. The calculated blood loss (CBL) and blood transfusion rate were compared by using Student t-test and confirmed with multivariate regression analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in preoperative parameters between 54 closed-box and 56 open-box PS FB TKAs. The CBL of the closed-box TKA group was 135.23 mL less (95% confidence interval [CI], -215.30 to -55.16; p = 0.001) than that of the open-box TKA group. However, the blood transfusion rates of the closed- and open-box TKA groups were not significantly different (24.1% and 38.5%, p = 0.11). For each additional minute of total operative time, 3.75 mL (95% CI, 1.75 to 5.76; p < 0.001) of blood loss was anticipated. For each additional mg/dL of preoperative hemoglobin, 71% (p < 0.001) reduction of blood transfusion probability was predicted. Conclusions: The use of closed- and open-box knee prostheses resulted in a significant difference in blood loss in SBTKA. Prolonged operative time also significantly increased CBL. Therefore, strategies to control the bleeding surface and shorten operative duration may be considered if blood loss is of special concern. The preoperative hemoglobin was the only factor that affects the probability of blood transfusion in SBTKA.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

A new packaging bag was produced primarily by blending polylactic acid (PLA) with spray-dried carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) from bleached bagasse (CMC B ) at various concentrations (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4% w/w). The film thickness of the PLA and PLA/CMC B bags was 75 μm. Unpacked mangoes were used as control before the packaged ones were stored at export conditions (13 ± 1°C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity [RH]) to evaluate the efficiency of the PLA/CMC B film. Mango respiration and ethylene production rate were measured periodically in a packaging atmosphere as an indicator of ripeness. Changing fruit physio-chemistry parameters were also studied, including weight loss, peel and flesh colour, firmness, total soluble solid (TSS), and total acidity (TA). The capacity of PLA/CMC B packaging to absorb water vapour and prolong mango shelf life was demonstrated, and active packaging function by control of RH was also demonstrated. The absorption of PLA/CMC B packaging was increased dramatically at 4% (w/w) CMC B mixed with PLA. At this CMC B concentration, the packaging film could extend the shelf life of mangoes for 42 days in export condition as well as decrease the physio-chemistry parameters and respiratory rate, which were significantly enhanced when compared with those of control mangoes or unpacked mangoes (P ≤ 0.05), which had a shelf life of approximately 3 weeks.","chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanical Engineering"

However, non-selective binding is a major obstacle for sample analysis. To overcome this problem, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were used as selective adsorbent materials prior to determining target analysts. In this study, the use of non-covalent molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for cotinine adsorption on a paper-based scaffold was studied. Fiberglass paper was used as a paper scaffold for cotinine-selective MIP adsorption with the use of 0.5% agarose gel. The effects of salt, pH, sample matrix, and solvent on the cotinine adsorption and extraction process were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the adsorption isotherm of synthesized MIPs increased to 125.41 μg/g, whereas the maximum adsorption isotherm of non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) was stable at 42.86 μg/g. The ability of the MIP paper scaffold to absorb cotinine in water medium was approximately 1.8-2.8-fold higher than that of the NIP scaffold. From Scatchard analysis, two dissociation constants of MIPs were calculated to be 2.56 and 27.03 μM. Nicotine, myosmine, and N-nitrosonornicotine were used for selectivity testing, and the calculated selectivity factor of cotinine to nicotine, myosmine, and N-nitrosonornicotine was 1.56, 2.69, and 2.05, respectively. Overall, the MIP paper scaffold is promising for simple onsite sampling of cotinine and can be used to assess tobacco smoke exposure.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Thai women of childbearing age have an increased risk of anaemia due to several factors including underlying health problems, lifestyles and poor diet. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of anaemia among female students of Chulalongkorn University (aged 18–22) and categorized causes of the anaemia. Design: 400 Thai female student-volunteers, without known underlying diseases were subjected to blood tests; complete blood count, Haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level. Bloods, having haemoglobin under 12 g/dl and hematocrit under 36%, were designated as anaemia. Then causes of anaemia are categorized into 3 groups; Iron deficiency, Thalassemia and Others. Results: We found that 21% of the volunteers were anaemic. In 85 anaemic volunteers, they were classified as Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA); with low serum ferritin levels 42.4%, Thalassemia; total of 6 types 25.9%, IDA and Thalassemia 2.3% and Others 29.4% in which haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level were normal. Conclusion: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the major cause of anaemia in Thai female students in our study. Several students were gradually developing anaemia where their haematocrit (Hct) and haemaglobin (Hb) were within reference range but mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemaglobin (MCH) and serum ferritin fell below reference range, indicating latent iron deficiency. A few volunteers had both IDA and Thalassemia and also Thalassemia with iron overloaded where health can be deteriorated without knowledge of having these conditions or proper health care. To improve their health, universities or public organizations should provide education and/or screen for anaemia. With the knowledge and understanding of their health issues or underling diseases, students themselves can prevent serious health conditions, improve university performances, and improve their quality of life.","sociology, arts, medical","Cultural Studies, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The pharmacokinetic profile of this compound is still limited and investigation is needed for further phytopharmaceutical product development. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of cucurbitacin B after administering the compound at different doses and routes to rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 6) were treated by cucurbitacin B extracted from Trichosanthes cucumerina L. The cucurbitacin B was administered at 0.1 mg/kg intravenously or by oral gavage at 2-4 mg/kg. Blood samples and internal organs were collected serially within 24 h after administration. Urine and feces were collected from time 0 to 48 h. The level of cucurbitacin B in biological samples was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: The absolute oral bioavailability of cucurbitacin B was approximately 10%. The maximum concentration in plasma after normalization by dose ranged from 4.85-7.81 μg/L and the time to reach maximum value was approximately within 30 min after oral dosing. The level of cucurbitacin B in plasma increased proportionally to the given dose. After intravenous administration, cucurbitacin B had a large volume of distribution of about 51.65 L/kg and exhibited a high tissue to plasma concentration ratio, approximately 60 to 280-fold in several organs. Negligible amount of unchanged cucurbitacin B could be detected in urine and feces and accounted less than 1% of administered dose. Conclusion: Cucurbitacin B had low oral bioavailability, but could be distributed extensively into internal organs with a high volume of distribution and tissue to plasma ratio. Only negligible amounts of unchanged cucurbitacin B were excreted via urine and feces suggesting that the compound might be biotransformed before undergoing an excretion.

This study was designed as an open-labeled, 2-se-quence dosage, single- and repeated-dose study investigated under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and their relative acid metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any observed adverse events. A key finding of this study was that the pharmacokinetics of ECa 233 in healthy volunteers did not correspond with its pharmacokinetics in animal studies. As indicated in human pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of the parent compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside) were very low, while their respective metabolites (madecassic acid and asiatic acid) demonstrated higher values. Based on the pharmacokinetic results observed in the dose comparison, accumulation of active metabolites after repeated dose is highly suggestive. In addition, the asiatic acid profile showed 2-fold increase in C max and AUC (0 – t) after increasing dose from 250 to 500 mg of ECa 233. Lastly, the safety and tolerability evaluation illustrated that single and multiple doses in both 250 and 500 mg oral administration of ECa 233 were well tolerated, and none of the volunteers discontinued their participation due to adverse effects during the study.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of KTZ cream in mild adult female acne (AFA) by conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using KTZ 2% and placebo cream twice daily for 10 weeks. We assessed the improvement of clinical severity, measured by AFA score graded by investigators and participants, and the change of acne count. Forty-one participants enrolled in our study. The proportion of participants with acne improvement from baseline (42.9% vs 9.5%, P = 0.015) and the success rate (45.0% vs 14.3%, P = 0.043) in the KTZ group were significantly higher than that of the placebo group. The most common adverse events were dryness and itching. The percentage change of acne count decreased significantly compared with baseline but did not differ statistically between the two groups (P = 0.268). We concluded that the KTZ monotherapy showed a plausible effect in improving AFA with excellent safety profile. It should be considered as a viable option for mild AFA treatment.",medical,Dermatology

The experimental isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the binary systems of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) + n-dodecane and tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) + n-dodecane were measured at pressures of 0.13, 2.40 and 6.67 kPa, using a glass vapor-liquid equilibrium ebulliometer. VLE data were generated in the form of T−x−y diagrams and checked for thermodynamic consistency via Herington area test and Van Ness point test. Data for all mixtures met the criteria of thermodynamic consistency and were found suitable for process modeling. At each pressure point, no azeotropic phenomenon was observed. Reduction in pressure of the system can significantly enhance the relative volatility and separation efficiency of both mixtures. At all pressure points, D2EHPA was noted to be more separable than TBP. Additionally, the experimental VLE results for all systems were found to have a good correlation with Raoult's law, Wilson and nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) models.

Surprisingly, the overflow occurs frequently and rapidly at the Lower Ping River where channel slope is high, and in particular area, sand-choked is extensively observed, even in normal rainfall condition. In contrary, at the downstream part, the erosion of river bank and shoreline around the mouth of Chao Phraya River has been spatially increasing in place where there should be a massive sediment supply to form a delta. Here we use Landsat imageries taken in 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017 to analyze geomorphological changes of rivers. Results show that both rivers have undergone the rapid decreasing of water storage capacity and increasing of sand bar areas in river embayment. The total emerged sand bar area in the Lower Ping River increases from 1987 to 2017 up to 28.8 km2. The excessive trapped bed sediments deposition along the upper reaches is responsible for the shallower of river embankment leading to rapid overflow during flooding. At the Chao Phraya River mouth, a total of 18.8 km2 of the coastal area has been eroded from 1987 to 2017.This is caused by the reducing of sediment supply leading to non-equilibrium in the deltaic zone of the upper Gulf of Thailand. There are several possibility implications from this study involving construction of weir, in-channel sand mining, reservoir sedimentation and coastal erosion management.","water engineeringneering, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Three statistics, defined by (1) the local allele frequency, (2) the Balding-Nichols approach and (3) the ratio between the maximum of the genotype probabilities over racial subgroup, were found to be good for testing these two types of familial relationships. Power analyses within racial groups are also included, with the power highest for African-American samples and lowest for Caucasian samples. Finally, simulation studies were done on both original and extended CODIS core loci. There were clear differences in power, with the power substantially higher for extended CODIS core loci.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of angina, and its association with hypertension, diabetes, and depression, in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa were utilized. Multivariable logistic regression methods were used to examine the factors associated with angina. Results: A total of 31,443 respondents aged 50 years and over were included in these analyses. The prevalence of angina was highest in Russia (39%), lowest in China (8%), and consistently higher in women than men. Angina was comorbid with chronic conditions and depression but patterns varied across countries. Depression was negatively associated with angina among older adults in Ghana but was positively associated with angina in all other countries. Hypertension was associated with increased odds of angina among older adults in China (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.59–2.25), India (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.14–1.78) and Russia (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.33–6.00). Diabetes was associated with higher odds of angina in China (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.15–2.15), Russia (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.57–3.87), and South Africa (OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.49–6.88). Conclusions: CVD is a significant contributor to disease burden in LMICs. Angina was often co-morbid with other conditions, therefore compelling health systems to develop longer-term integrated care systems to address co- and multi-morbidity.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells retain capability of in vitro cardiac differentiation,"Phakdeedindan P., Setthawong P., Tiptanavattana N., Rungarunlert S., Ingrungruanglert P., Israsena N., Techakumphu M., Tharasanit T.",2019-01-01,"Alkaline Phosphatase, Animals, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors, Myocytes, Cardiac, Nanog Homeobox Protein, Octamer Transcription Factor-3, Pluripotent Stem Cells, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc, Rabbits, SOXB1 Transcription Factors, Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens, BMP4, Cardiac differentiation, iPSC, Rabbit, Stem cells","Stem cells are promising cell source for treatment of multiple diseases as well as myocardial infarction. Rabbit model has essentially used for cardiovascular diseases and regeneration but information on establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation potential is fairly limited. In addition, there is no report of cardiac differentiation from iPSCs in the rabbit model. In this study, we generated rabbit iPSCs by reprogramming rabbit fibroblasts using the 4 transcription factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc). Three iPSC lines were established. The iPSCs from all cell lines expressed genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG) and proteins (alkaline phosphatase, OCT-3/4 and SSEA-4) essentially described for pluripotency (in vivo and in vitro differentiation). Furthermore, they also had ability to form embryoid body (EB) resulting in three-germ layer differentiation. However, ability of particular cell lines and cell numbers at seeding markedly influenced on EB formation and also their diameters. The cell density at 20,000 cells per EB was selected for cardiac differentiation. After plating, the EBs attached and cardiac-like beating areas were seen as soon as 11 days of culture. The differentiated cells expressed cardiac progenitor marker FLK1 (51 ± 1.48%) on day 5 and cardiac troponin-T protein (10.29 ± 1.37%) on day 14. Other cardiac marker genes (cardiac ryanodine receptors (RYR2), α-actinin and PECAM1) were also expressed. This study concluded that rabbit iPSCs remained their in vitro pluripotency with capability of differentiation into mature-phenotype cardiomyocytes. However, the efficiency of cardiac differentiation is still restricted.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science","Animal Science and Zoology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Veterinary (all)"

This study compared the efficacy of two types of dietary advice: (1) brief advice on a commonly recommended diet (BRD), and (2) structural individual low-FODMAP dietary advice (SILFD). Patients with moderate-tosevere IBS were randomized to BRD or SILFD groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms, 7-day food diaries, and post-prandial breath samples were evaluated. The SILFD included (1) identifying highFODMAP items from the diary, (2) replacing high-FODMAP items with low-FODMAP ones by choosing from the provided menu. The BRD included reducing traditionally recognized foods that cause bloating/abdominal pain and avoidance of large meals. Responders were defined as those experiencing a ≥30% decrease in the average of daily worst abdominal pain/discomfort after 4 weeks. Sixty-two patients (47 F, age 51 ± 14 years), BRD (n = 32) or SILFD (n = 30), completed the studies. Eighteen (60%) patients in SILFD vs. 9 (28%) in the BRD group fulfilled responder criteria (p = 0.001). Global IBS symptom severity significantly improved and the number of high-FODMAP items consumed was significantly decreased after SILFD compared to BRD. Post-prandial hydrogen (H2) breath production after SILFD was significantly lower than was seen after BRD (p < 0.001). SILFD was more effective than BRD. This advice method significantly reduced FODMAP intake, improved IBS symptoms, and lowered intestinal H2 production.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The pH value was shown to influence the particle size and shape which were related to particle electrical and magnetic properties. The synthesized Fe3O4, GFe3O4, and Mer-GFe3O4 NPs were of the spherical, connected-fibrous, and irregular shapes with the average sizes between 25 and 80 nm. Moreover, they all exhibited the superparamagnetic behavior with the magnetization in the range of 25–64 emu/g. The optimum pH for the synthesized Mer-GFe3O4 NPs was 10 with a smaller particle size without particle agglomeration, and with semiconducting and superparamagnetic properties. Thus, the synthesized Fe3O4 and GFe3O4 NPs were shown here as potential cancer drug carriers.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

We hypothesized that abnormal paracervical muscle compartment pressures might be one of them. The cervical paraspinal muscle compartment pressures of 10 cadavers were measured in six different areas under four different conditions. The posterior cervical area was divided into two sides: open side and hinge side. Then each side was divided into upper, middle, and lower areas. The compartment pressures of each area were measured under four different conditions: before and after dissection of posterior paravertebral (paraspinal) muscles, after laminoplasty and after laminoplasty with removal of the spinous processes. There was a statistically significant difference between the pressures after dissection versus after laminoplasty on the hinge side at all upper, middle and lower areas [p < 0.01, <0.001 and =0.009 respectively]. There was a difference in the pressures after laminoplasty between the open and hinge sides [p < 0.001, <0.001 and =0.023 respectively].

Cervical paraspinal muscle compartment pressures on the hinge side were significantly increased after laminoplasty. This may be a contributor to axial neck pain following laminoplasty. The pressure was then significantly decreased after removal of the spinous processes.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using visible light has become of increasing interest in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that a combination of curcumin-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles (Cur-CS/Alg NPs) and blue light emitting diodes (LED) light irradiation effectively suppressed the hyperproliferation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced cultured human kerlatinocyte (HaCaT) cells. The Cur-CS/Alg NPs were fabricated by emulsification of curcumin in aqueous sodium alginate solution and ionotropic gelation with calcium chloride and chitosan using an optimized formulation derived from a Box-Behnken design. The fabricated Cur-CS/Alg NPs were characterized for their particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity. The surrogate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, to measure the relative number of viable cells, showed that the CS/Alg NPs were nontoxic to normal HaCaT cells, while 0.05 µg/mL and 0.1 µg/mL of free curcumin and Cur-CS/Alg NPs inhibited the hyperproliferation of HaCaT cells induced by TNF-α. However, the Cur-CS/Alg NPs demonstrated a stronger effect than the free curcumin, especially when combined with blue light irradiation (10 J/cm2) from an LED-based illumination device. Therefore, the Cur-CS/Alg NPs with blue LED light could be potentially developed into an effective PDT system for the treatment of psoriasis.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Furthermore, L. intracellularis needs enriched medium and a unique atmosphere for isolation, cultivation and propagation. Because of this,there are only a few isolates of L. intracellularis available and few studies in vitro demonstrating the susceptibility of this bacterium to antimicrobial agents. The objectives of this study were to isolate South American and Southeast Asia strains of L.intracellularis and to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity against these isolates. Tested antimicrobials included: chlortetracycline, lincomycin, tiamulin, tylosin and valnemulin(against both Brazilian and Thailand strains) and additionally, amoxicillin, zinc-bacitracin, carbadox, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, spectinomycin and a combination (1:1) of spectinomycin and lincomycin were also tested against the Thai isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the antimicrobial activity that inhibited 99% of L. intracellularis growth in a cell culture as compared to the control (antimicrobial-free). Results: Two strains from Brazil and three strains from Thailand were successfully isolated and established in cell culture. Each antimicrobial was evaluated for intracellular and extracellular activity. Pleuromutilin group (valnemulin and tiamulin) and carbadox were the most active against L. intracellularis strains tested. Tylosin showed intermediate activity, chlortetracycline had variable results between low and intermediate activity, as well as spectinomycin, spectinomycin and lincomycin, amoxicillin, sulfamethazine and enrofloxacin.

The objective of study was to determine the inhibitory effect of CTE on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The phytochemical profiles of CTE were analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Anti-adipogenesis effect of CTE was measured by using Oil Red O staining, intracellular triglyceride assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cell cycle studies were performed by flow cytometry. Lipolysis experiments were performed using a colorimetric assay kit. In early stages, CTE demonstrated anti-adipogenic effects through inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle retardation by suppressing expression of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The results also showed that CTE inhibited the late stage of differentiation through diminishing expression of adipogenic transcription factors including PPARγ and C/EBPα. The inhibitory action was subsequently attenuated in downregulation of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, causing the reduction of TG accumulation. In addition, CTE also enhanced catecholamine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. These results suggest that CTE effectively attenuates adipogenesis by controlling cell cycle progression and downregulating adipogenic gene expression.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

It stimulates several processes, including hyaluronan synthesis, involved in orbital tissue volume expansion and may act synergistically with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB. PDGF-BB is known to stimulate adipogenesis in orbital fibroblasts, but the effect of bFGF on adipogenesis in orbital fibroblasts is so far unknown. This study was conducted to determine whether (i) bFGF induces adipogenesis in orbital fibroblasts, (ii) bFGF and PDGF-BB together exert an additive or synergistic effect on adipogenesis, and (iii) treatment directed at bFGF- and PDGF-BB signaling may potentially be of interest for the treatment of GO. Methods: Orbital fibroblasts from GO patients and controls were cultured in adipocyte differentiation medium with or without bFGF and/or PDGF-BB at different concentrations. Adipogenesis was determined by Oil Red O staining and messenger RNA expression of the late adipocyte differentiation markers cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) and adiponectin (ADIPOQ). To demonstrate involvement of FGF-receptor and PDGF-receptor signaling, experiments were also conducted in the presence of dasatinib (inhibitor of PDGF-receptor) or nintedanib (inhibitor of PDGF-receptor and FGF-receptor). Results: bFGF significantly stimulated adipogenesis by orbital fibroblasts, as shown by increased Oil Red O staining and CIDEC and ADIPOQ expression after 14 days of differentiation. Furthermore, an additive effect of bFGF/PDGF-BB co-stimulation on adipogenesis was observed at the lowest concentration (12.5 ng/mL) of the growth factors tested. Nintedanib completely inhibited bFGF-, PDGF-BB-, and bFGF/PDGF-BB-induced adipogenesis, while dasatinib only fully abrogated PDGF-BB-induced adipogenesis. Conclusion: bFGF induces adipogenesis in orbital fibroblasts and as such may contribute to GO. The additive effect of bFGF and PDGF-BB on adipogenesis, along with the observed inhibitory effects of dasatinib and nintedanib, point at independent receptor-mediated effects. This supports the hypothesis that multi-target directed therapy might be more efficient in the treatment of GO.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"
Enhanced efficacy of immersion vaccination in tilapia against columnaris disease by chitosan-coated “pathogen-like” mucoadhesive nanovaccines,"Kitiyodom S., Yata T., Yostawornkul J., Kaewmalun S., Nittayasut N., Suktham K., Surassmo S., Namdee K., Rodkhum C., Pirarat N.",2019-12-01,"Animals, Aquaculture, Bacterial Vaccines, Chitosan, Fish Diseases, Flavobacteriaceae Infections, Flavobacterium, Gills, Nanoparticles, Tilapia, Vaccination, Chitosan, Columnaris disease, Immersion vaccination, Tilapia","Red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) has become one of the most important fish in aquaculture. Bacterial infection caused by Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease, has been now identified as one of the most serious infectious diseases in farmed red tilapia and cause major financial damage to the producers. Among the effective prevention and control strategies, vaccination is one of the most effective approach. As the surface of living fish is covered by mucus and directly associated with the mucosal immunity, we therefore hypothesized that better adsorption on mucosal surfaces and more efficient vaccine efficacy could be enhanced biomimetic nanoparticles mimicking the mucoadhesive characteristic of live F. columnare. In this work, we describe an effective approach to targeted antigen delivery by coating the surface of nanoparticles with mucoadhesive chitosan biopolymer to provide “pathogen-like” properties that ensure nanoparticles binding on fish mucosal membrane. The physiochemical properties of nanovaccines were analyzed, and their mucoadhesive characteristics and immune response against pathogens were also evaluated. The prepared vaccines were nano-sized and spherical as confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The analysis of hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential also suggested the successful modification of nanovaccines by chitosan as indicated by positively charged and the overall increased diameter of chitosan-modified nanovaccines. In vivo mucoadhesive study demonstrated the excellent affinity of the chitosan-modified nanovaccines toward fish gills as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging, fluorescent microscopy, and spectrophotometric quantitative measurement. Following vaccination with the prepared nanovaccines by immersion 30 min, the challenge test was then carried out 30 and 60 days post-vaccination and resulted in high mortalities in the control. The relative percent survival (RPS) of vaccinated fish was greater than 60% for mucoadhesive nanovaccine. Our results also suggested that whole-cell vaccines failed to protect fish from columnaris infection, which is consistent with the mucoadhesive assays showing that whole-cell bacteria were unable to bind to mucosal surfaces. In conclusion, we could use this system to deliver antigen preparation to the mucosal membrane of tilapia and obtained a significant increase in survival compared to controls, suggesting that targeting mucoadhesive nanovaccines to the mucosal surface could be exploited as an effective method for immersion vaccination.","genergyal, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2016 to February 2017 among individuals from six nations in Southeast Asia-Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Singapore. The study population comprised healthcare and non-healthcare personnel. RESULTS: In total, 799 healthcare personnel and 1079 non-healthcare personnel completed an online survey. The prevalence of the awareness of their own HBV infection status and risk of this regionally endemic infection was 85.6% (684/799) among healthcare personnel and 54.0% (583/1079) among non-healthcare personnel. Similarly, 85.9% of healthcare personnel and 45.5% of non-healthcare personnel had good knowledge about disease transmission, complications, and the need for treatment, and 76.6% of healthcare personnel and 39.8% of non-healthcare personnel followed good HBV infection-prevention practices. Overall, 90.6% found the idea of treatment acceptable. Awareness had a significant impact on both knowledge and practice scores among both healthcare personnel and non-healthcare personnel (p < 0.01) but without statistically significant differences in treatment acceptance between the two groups (p = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of HBV infection was relatively low among non-healthcare personnel in Southeast Asian populations. The provision of additional hepatitis B awareness campaigns is crucial to eliminating viral hepatitis in the region.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Response surface methodology with a spherical central composite design model was employed to determine the optimal extraction condition, consisting of a seed moisture content (%wt), a solvent to solid ratio (g/g), and an extraction temperature (°C). A quadratic regression equation suggested the optimal extraction condition was a moisture content of 56.4%wt, a solvent to solid ratio of 6.7 (g/g), and a temperature of 33.3 °C. At this condition, the RSO yield predicted by the model gave a slight deviation of 0.68% from the experimentally validated results (41.48 versus 41.20%). RSO has a kinematic viscosity of 36.8 cSt, an acid value of 10.7 KOH/g oil, a fatty acid content of 5.1% and an unsaturated fatty acid content of 80%, resulting in the potential production of biodiesel, biolubricants, and biodegradable plastics.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

New LB solutions of the problem are numerically derived and described by the set of the dimensionless parameters consisting of the stability load factor, the cover-depth ratio, the normalized overburden pressure, normalized strength gradient, and anisotropic strength ratio while failure mechanisms associated with these parameters are also discussed and compared. The computed LB solutions are validated with the existing results of isotropic strengths confirming the accuracy and correctness of the solutions. Based on a nonlinear regression, the new design equations for the stability load factor and factor of safety for plane strain headings in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays are first time proposed for assessing the undrained stability of relatively long-wall tunnels particularly considering the effects of strength anisotropy and non-homogeneity.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, computer science","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Computer Science Applications"
Colorimetric sensor for determination of phosphate ions using anti-aggregation of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate-modified silver nanoplates and europium ions,"Pinyorospathum C., Rattanarat P., Chaiyo S., Siangproh W., Chailapakul O.",2019-07-01,"Colorimetric sensors, Naked-eye, Paper-based analytical devices, Phosphate ions, Silver nanoplates, Colorimetric sensor, Naked eye, Paper-based analytical devices, Phosphate ions, Silver nanoplates","A new, distinctive, and inexpensive colorimetric sensor for the detection of phosphate ions (Pi) performed on paper-based analytical devices (PADs) based on the anti-aggregation of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MS)-modified silver nanoplates is proposed. An aggregation of MS-AgNPls due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged sulfonate group on MS-AgNPls and europium ions (Eu3+) causes a color change. Conversely, the color of MS-AgNPls remains unchanged in the presence of premixed Eu3+ with Pi because of the higher binding affinity that Eu3+ has towards Pi, leaving the AgNPls dispersed. An apparent color change from brown to red with the increasing amount of Pi can be observed by the naked eye on PADs and can be used for quantification by the measurement of color intensity using ImageJ software and determined with the color comparator. The aggregation and anti-aggregation of MS-AgNPls were characterized by TEM, UV–vis spectroscopy, and FT-IR to confirm the mechanism. This method can detect Pi in the range of 1–30 mg L−1, with a detection limit of 0.33 mg L−1 (3SD/slope) and a limit of quantification equal to 1.01 mg L−1 (10SD/slope). The optimum parameters, including pH, MS and Eu3+ concentrations, reaction time, and interference effects, were studied. This method can be applied with the detection of Pi in real samples collected from soils, and the results agree with those of the standard method (UV–vis spectroscopy).","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

This paper presents an efficient collision arbitration algorithm based on binary tree algorithm to improve the performance of the RFID system. In the proposed algorithm, collision-slots skipping is applied. For a collision, binary splitting is firstly applied until the leftmost node of the binary tree contains idle or a success. From the outcome from the left-hand side node, we can expect the number of tags in the right-hand nodes. If the left-hand node is a collided slot, the binary tree will skip the righthand node as it is expected as a collision node. The simulation results show that the proposed improved binary tree algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics, physics","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Aerospace Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computational Mathematics, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Instrumentation"

However, the availability of high-quality data linking quantitative phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) and genomic data have thus far been limited. We determined drug resistance profiles of 176 genetically diverse clinical M. tuberculosis isolates from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Peru, Thailand, and Switzerland by quantitative phenotypic DST for 11 antituberculous drugs using the BD Bactec MGIT 960 system and 7H10 agar dilution to generate a cross-validated phenotypic DST readout. We compared DST results with predicted drug resistance profiles inferred by whole-genome sequencing. Classification of strains by the two phenotypic DST methods into resistotype/wild-type populations was concordant in 73 to 99% of cases, depending on the drug. Our data suggest that the established critical concentration (5 mg/liter) for ethambutol resistance (MGIT 960 system) is too high and mis-classifies strains as susceptible, unlike 7H10 agar dilution. Increased minimal inhibitory concentrations were explained by mutations identified by whole-genome sequencing. Using whole-genome sequences, we were able to predict quantitative drug resistance levels for the majority of drug resistance mutations. Predicting quantitative levels of drug resistance by whole-genome sequencing was partially limited due to incompletely understood drug resistance mechanisms. The overall sensitivity and specificity of whole-genome-based DST were 86.8% and 94.5%, respectively. Despite some limitations, whole-genome sequencing has the potential to infer resistance profiles without the need for time-consuming phenotypic methods.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Among the studied supports, SBA-15 showed 100% adsorption. This work examined the effects of temperature, pH, and amount of the support on the enzyme immobilization. The optimal conditions for cellulose hydrolysis were at pH = 3.8 and 45 °C for 3 days using 1.2 g of the enzyme immobilized on SBA-15 (IM-SBA-15), yielding about 90% sugar. Depth profiles of X-ray photoelectron and Infrared spectroscopies (XPS and IR, respectively) illustrated that the enzyme was attracted to the support surface by electrostatic force between carbonyl of the amide group and hydroxyl group of the support. Remarkably, IM-SBA-15 resulted in a much better yield of monomeric sugar (90%) in a weak-acid condition while only 65% monomeric sugar yield was obtained using the free enzyme.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, environmental","Bioengineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal"

VDW protein hydrolysates were prepared with trypsin and purified by ultrafiltration with molecular mass cut-off membranes of 10, 5 and 3 kDa. The M<3 kDa (FA) fraction had the highest 2,2'-azino- bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities, with IC50 values of (11.5±0.3) and (13.6±0.2) μg/ mL, respectively. The FA fraction was separated by reversed phase HPLC to yield four subfractions (F1-4). The F4 subfraction showed the highest maximum ABTS radical scavenging activity (3.55±0.61) % and it was selected for further analysis by electrospray ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) based on de novo peptide sequencing. Five antioxidant peptides were identified, of which AILESYSAGKTK had the highest ABTS radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, the FA fraction showed high cytotoxic activities against human cancer-derived cell lines, especially the colon cancer cell line (SW620) with an IC50 value of (106.6±21.5) μg/mL, but not the untransformed Wi38 cell line. The FA fraction activated the apoptotic pathway in SW620 cells after treatment for 24, 48 and 72 h, with the highest activities of caspases-3, -8 and -9 being observed after treatment for 72 h.

For the synthesis of activated carbon catalysts, coffee ground residues were chemical activated with ZnCl2 (ratio 1:3) followed by different physical activation. All prepared catalysts were characterized with various techniques such as nitrogen physisorption (BET and BJH methods), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The dehydrogenation of vaporized ethanol was performed to test the catalytic activity and product distribution. Testing catalytic activity by operated in a fixed-bed continuous flow micro-reactor at temperatures ranged from 250 to 400 °C. It was found that the AC-D catalyst (using calcination under carbon dioxide flow at 600 °C, 4 hours for physical activation) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while all catalysts show high selectivity to acetaldehyde (more than 90%). Ethanol conversion apparently increased with increased reaction temperature. At 400 ºC, the AC-D catalyst gave the highest ethanol conversion of 47.9% and yielded 46.8% of acetaldehyde. The highest activity obtained from AC-D catalyst can be related to both Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity because the dehydrogenation of ethanol uses both Lewis acid and Lewis basic sites for this reaction. To investigate the stability of catalyst, the AC-D catalyst showed quite constant ethanol conversion for 10 h. Therefore, the synthesized activated carbon from coffee ground residues is promising to be used in dehydrogenation of ethanol.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The selection of separation agent (entrainer) for extractive distillation of binary mixture is usually based on the analysis of relative volatility diagrams of components as residue curve map (RCM). Tetra-ethylene-glycol as entrainer is possible to obtain high purity of methylal in the extractive distillation process. A practical method to propose the design of the extractive distillation column (EDC) has been obtained by response surface methodology (RSM) with the study of the effect of factors and their interactions on the requirement of energy consumption and methylal purity. The reboiler heat duty of EDC is directly related to mass reflux ratio, entrainer feed stage, temperature of entrainer, and entrainer to feed ratio. While the purity of methylal is related to the entrainer feed stage only. The optimal operation for EDC can be found by using the point prediction of RSM that is sufficient and efficient.","mixing and separation, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

Host genetic determinants of response are therefore in demand. Methods: In this genome-wide association study (GWAS), CHB patients, treated with (Peg)IFN for at least 12 weeks ± nucleos(t)ide analogues within randomized trials or as standard of care, were recruited at 21 centers from Europe, Asia, and North America. Response at 24 weeks after (Peg)IFN treatment was defined as combined hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <2000 IU/mL, or an HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative patients. Results: Of 1144 patients, 1058 (92%) patients were included in the GWAS analysis. In total, 282 (31%) patients achieved the response and 4% hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss. GWAS analysis stratified by HBeAg status, adjusted for age, sex, and the 4 ancestry components identified PRELID2 rs371991 (B= -0.74, standard error [SE] = 0.16, P = 3.44 ×10-6) for HBeAg-positive patients. Importantly, PRELID2 was cross-validated for long-term response in HBeAg-negative patients. G3BP2 rs3821977 (B = 1.13, SE = 0.24, P = 2.46 × 10-6) was associated with response in HBeAg-negative patients. G3BP2 has a role in the interferon pathway and was further examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy controls stimulated with IFNα and TLR8. After stimulation, less production of IP-10 and interleukin (IL)-10 proteins and more production of IL-8 were observed with the G3BP2 G-allele. Conclusions: Although no genome-wide significant hits were found, the current GWAS identified genetic variants associated with (Peg)IFN response in CHB. The current findings could pave the way for gene polymorphism-guided clinical counseling, both in the setting of (Peg)IFN and the natural history, and possibly for new immune-modulating therapies.

Extensive studies revealed that a rare MAA, mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G), possesses unique biological activities and functions. M2G is not only a potent antioxidant, but also suppresses protein glycation in vitro, and production of inflammatory mediators in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The present study evaluates vital functions of M2G in a heterologous expression system. The stress-sensitive fresh water cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, carrying a M2G biosynthetic gene cluster, was generated. The M2G-expressing cells were more tolerant to H2O2-induced oxidative stress than the wild type, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 2.3 ± 0.06 mM. Transcriptional analysis revealed that all M2G biosynthetic genes were highly up-regulated under oxidative stress. Further, expression of vital genes in the cellular antioxidant defense system, including sodB, cat and tpxA were modulated and up-regulated. Elevated M2G was detected under oxidative stress as well as salt stress treatments. This study provides insight into the molecular and cellular effects of the M2G biosynthetic gene cluster, contributing to understanding of the mechanism behind physiological plasticity under this heterologous expression system.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

In this study, the effect of the addition of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin on the levels of phytostilbenes in M. alba callus cultures was investigated. Commercial cyclodextrin was used in the hydrolytic and culture processes of the M. alba callus cultures. The hydrolytic study indicated that 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin acted as a retardant for stilbenoid hydrolysis. It reduced mulberroside A deglycosylation and stabilised oxyresveratrol. The elicitation result showed that extracellular oxyresveratrol was increased by adding 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin to the culture media of both free and immobilised M. alba callus (>730-fold and >169-fold, respectively) compared with those of the control. However, the intracellular mulberroside A levels in the treatment groups did not increase compared with those of the control. The results show that the addition of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin significantly changed the patterns and levels of the stilbenoids in M. alba callus cultures.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, chemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Plant Science, Organic Chemistry"

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide more precise estimates of HBsAg seroclearance rates among subgroups and populations. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library for cohort studies that reported HBsAg seroclearance in adults with chronic HBV infection with more than 1 year of follow-up and at least 1 repeat test for HBsAg. Annual and 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidence rates were pooled using a random effects model. Results: We analyzed 34 published studies (with 42,588 patients, 303,754 person-years of follow-up, and 3194 HBsAg seroclearance events), including additional and updated aggregated data from 19 studies. The pooled annual rate of HBsAg seroclearance was 1.02% (95% CI, 0.79–1.27). Cumulative incidence rates were 4.03% at 5 years (95% CI, 2.49–5.93), 8.16% at 10 years (95% CI, 5.24–11.72), and 17.99% at 15 years (95% CI, 6.18–23.24). There were no significant differences between the sexes. A higher proportion of patients who tested negative for HBeAg at baseline had seroclearance (1.33%; 95% CI, 0.76–2.05) than those who tested positive for HBeAg (0.40%; 95% CI, 0.25–0.59) (P <.01). Having HBsAg seroclearance was also associated with a lower baseline HBV DNA level (6.61 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 5.94–7.27) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (7.71 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 7.41–8.02) (P <.01) and with a lower level of HBsAg at baseline (2.74 log 10 IU/mL; 95% CI, 1.88–3.60) vs not having HBsAg seroclearance (3.90 log 10 IU/mL, 95% CI, 3.73–4.06) (P <.01). HBsAg seroclearance was not associated with HBV genotype or treatment history. Heterogeneity was substantial across the studies (I 2 = 97.49%). Conclusion: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a low rate of HBsAg seroclearance in untreated and treated patients (pooled annual rate, approximately 1%). Seroclearance occurred mainly in patients with less active disease. Patients with chronic HBV infection should therefore be counseled on the need for lifelong treatment, and curative therapies are needed.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"
Glycan binding and specificity of viral influenza neuraminidases by classical molecular dynamics and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations,"Phanich J., Threeracheep S., Kungwan N., Rungrotmongkol T., Hannongbua S.",2019-09-02,"Binding Sites, Humans, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype, Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype, Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype, Influenza, Human, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Neuraminidase, Polysaccharides, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Receptors, Virus, Substrate Specificity, Virus Replication, Influenza neuraminidase, MD simulation, QM/MM-GBSA calculation, replica exchange MD simulation, substrate specificity","Two important glycoproteins on the influenza virus membrane, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are relevant to virus replication. As previously reported, HA has a substrate specificity towards SIA-2,3-GAL-1,4-NAG (3SL) and SIA-2,6-GAL-1,4-NAG (6SL) glycans, while NA can cleave both types of linkages. However, the substrate binding into NA and its preference are not well understood. In this work, the glycan binding and specificity of human and avian NAs were evaluated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, whilst the conformational diversity of 3SL avian and 6SL human glycans in an unbound state was investigated by replica exchange MD simulations. The results indicated that the 3SL avian receptor fits well in the binding cavity of all NAs and does not require a conformational change for such binding compared to the flexible shape of the 6SL human receptor. From the QM/MM-GBSA binding free energy and decomposition free energy data, 6SL showed a much stronger binding towards human NAs (H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2) than to avian NAs (H5N1 and H7N9). This suggests that influenza NAs have a substrate specificity corresponding to their HA, indicating the functional balance between the two important glycoproteins. Both linkages show distinct glycan topologies when complexed with NAs, while the flexibility of torsion angles between GAL and NAG in 6SL results in the various shapes of glycan and different binding patterns. Lower conformational diversities of both glycans when bound to NA compared to the unbound state were found, and were required in order to be accommodated within the NA cavity.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD)and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)results unmistakably elucidated the tetragonal structure of TiO2 with the cubic structure of Fe3O4. The particle size, interface, and surface area were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)measurements. The TEM image of the prepared TiO2@Fe3O4 clearly showed that the material is nano-spherical in shape. The BET surface area of the nanocomposite was measured to have a higher value (115.7 m2/g)than those of the TiO2 (65.2 m/g)and Fe3O4 (30.1 m2/g)pure systems because of the synergistic effect and interface between the two different oxides. The absorption edges of the TiO2@Fe3O4 nanocomposites were studied with the UV-abs spectrometer, and the results revealed that the material band gap is 2.70 eV. The chemical composition and dispersion of the nanocomposite system was assessed via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)along with elemental mapping. The PL spectra of the prepared nanocomposite system indicated a delay of the electron-hole recombination process due to the presence of Fe3O4, thus inducing intermediate states into the TiO2 system. The favourable optical properties of the developed nanocomposites were exploited for the photocatalytic degradation of colourful dyes, such as methylene blue, and methyl orange, as well as of colourless phenol. In addition, their stability and photocatalytic mechanism are explained in detail.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Thromboembolism is one of the most common complications in patients supported by continuousflow left ventricular assisted devices (CF-LVADs). However, the association between AF and TE complications in this population is controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between AF and overall TE, stroke, and device thrombosis events in CF-LVAD patients. We performed a comprehensive literature search through September 2017 in the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Included studies were prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compared the risk of developing overall TE, stroke, and device thrombosis events in CF-LVAD patients with AF and those without AF. We calculated pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I2 statistic using the random-effects model. Eleven studies were included involving 6,351 patients who underwent CF-LVAD implantation. Overall, TE outcome was available in four studies involving 1,106 AF and 3,556 non-AF patients. Stroke outcome was available in seven studies (1,455 AF and 4,037 non-AF patients). Device thrombosis outcome was available in three studies (1,010 AF and 3,327 non-AF patients). There was no association between AF and TE events (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.57-1.59, I2 = 79%, p = 0.85), stroke (RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.74-1.64, I2 = 73%, p = 0.65), and device thrombosis (RR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.56-1.67, I2 = 42%, p = 0.91). AF in CF-LVAD patients was not associated with overall TE, stroke, or device thrombosis events. These findings might be explained by the highly thrombogenic property of CF-LVADs that exceeds the thromboembolic risk driven by AF.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"
Long-term Apomorphine Infusion Users Versus Short-term Users: An International Dual-center Analysis of the Reasons for Discontinuing Therapy,"Bhidayasiri R., Phokaewvarangkul O., Boonpang K., Boonmongkol T., Thongchuem Y., Kantachadvanich N., Garcia Ruiz P.J.",2019-09-01,"Aged, Antiparkinson Agents, Apomorphine, Cohort Studies, Humans, Infusions, Subcutaneous, Levodopa, Male, Middle Aged, Parkinson Disease, Retrospective Studies, apomorphine infusion, Parkinson's disease/parkinsonism, retention in treatment","Objectives A retrospective analysis at 2 specialist centers was undertaken to determine the long-term efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (APO), rates and reasons for discontinuation, and factors that might contribute to discontinuation. Methods Demographics, clinical outcomes data, and reasons for discontinuation were collected for patients treated with APO at Chulalongkorn Centre of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease and Related Disorders, Bangkok, Thailand (n = 36) and Fundacion Jimemez Diaz Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain (n = 16). Results There were 19 (52.7%) patients in the Thai cohort and 10 (62.5%) patients in the Spanish cohort who discontinued treatment within around 6 months of initiation, most commonly due to skin nodules (Thai cohort) and perceived lack of efficacy (Spanish cohort). Those who continued APO tended to stay on treatment. In both cohorts, APO resulted in significant reductions in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 3 motor scores, daily OFF time, and levodopa-equivalent dose in patients who subsequently stopped therapy, suggesting APO is clinically effective even when ""lack of efficacy"" is stated as a reason for discontinuing. Daily OFF hours after APO therapy was found to be a significant predictive factor for APO discontinuation with an odds ratio of 5.952 (P = 0.040). The cutoff point that determined APO discontinuation was calculated to be 1.75 or more OFF hours (sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 63.2%). Conclusions Apomorphine infusion is a minimally invasive therapy and therefore very easy to discontinue if difficulties arise. This fact might explain the high dropout rate of this technique. Successful long-term adherence to APO therapy requires a multidisciplinary health care team approach including regular patient follow-up and assessment and prompt resolution of queries and concerns.","genergyal, pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Neurology (clinical), Pharmacology (medical)"

This significantly affects the shift of the optical band gap energy from 1.15 eV (112-CIGS) to 1.19 eV, with only 10 nm thick of 135-CIGS capping layer, leading to the increase in open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. The optical transmission spectra show no sign of single 135-CIGS layer. The maximum Voc of 670 mV was obtained from 5 to 10 nm thick 135-CIGS capping layer on 112-CIGS compared to 646 mV of only 112-CIGS. The power conversion efficiencies of the devices covered with 135-CIGS with thickness of less than 80 nm are slightly lower than that of the uncovered 112-CIGS solar cells due to lower generated photocurrents. The solar cell parameters become dramatically deteriorate with thicker 135-CIGS capping layer. The XRD also shows the shift of the diffraction peak toward larger 2θ without peak broadening or splitting when the thickness of 135-CIGS is increased. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements indicate the shift of absorption threshold towards shorter wavelength when the thickness of 135-CIGS is increased, which is consistent with the optical transmission measurements.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

We aimed to investigate loss to follow-up (LTFU) in Asian patients who remained in care 5 years after ART initiation. Methods: Long-term LTFU was defined as LTFU occurring after 5 years on ART. LTFU was defined as (1) patients not seen in the previous 12 months; and (2) patients not seen in the previous 6 months. Factors associated with LTFU were analysed using competing risk regression. Results: Under the 12-month definition, the LTFU rate was 2.0 per 100 person-years (PY) [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8–2.2 among 4889 patients included in the study. LTFU was associated with age > 50 years [sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 1.64; 95% CI 1.17–2.31] compared with 31–40 years, viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL (SHR 1.86; 95% CI 1.16–2.97) compared with viral load < 1000 copies/mL, and hepatitis C coinfection (SHR 1.48; 95% CI 1.06–2.05). LTFU was less likely to occur in females, in individuals with higher CD4 counts, in those with self-reported adherence ≥ 95%, and in those living in high-income countries. The 6-month LTFU definition produced an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100 PY (95% CI 2.9–3.4 and had similar associations but with greater risks of LTFU for ART initiation in later years (2006–2009: SHR 2.38; 95% CI 1.93–2.94; and 2010–2011: SHR 4.26; 95% CI 3.17–5.73) compared with 2003–2005. Conclusions: The long-term LTFU rate in our cohort was low, with older age being associated with LTFU. The increased risk of LTFU with later years of ART initiation in the 6-month analysis, but not the 12-month analysis, implies that there was a possible move towards longer HIV clinic scheduling in Asia.","genergyal, medical","Health Policy, Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

The antidepressant effects of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been widely reported. The subcommittee of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research organized an expert panel and conducted a literature review and a Delphi process to develop a consensus-based practice guideline for clinical use of n-3 PUFAs in MDD. The guideline focuses on 5 thematic areas: General concepts, acute treatment strategy, depression recurrence monitoring and prevention, use in special populations, and potential safety issues. The key practice guidelines contend that: (1) clinicians and other practitioners are advised to conduct a clinical interview to validate clinical diagnoses, physical conditions, and measurement-based psychopathological assessments in the therapeutic settings when recommending n-3 PUFAs in depression treatment; (2) with respect to formulation and dosage, both pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or an EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination of a ratio higher than 2 (EPA/DHA >2) are considered effective, and the recommended dosages should be 1-2 g of net EPA daily, from either pure EPA or an EPA/DHA (>2:1) formula; (3) the quality of n-3 PUFAs may affect therapeutic activity; and (4) potential adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal and dermatological conditions, should be monitored, as well as obtaining comprehensive metabolic panels. The expert consensus panel has agreed on using n-3 PUFAs in MDD treatment for pregnant women, children, and the elderly, and prevention in high-risk populations.

KP is responsible for ca. 99% of brain tryptophan metabolism via its degradation to kynurenine (KYN) catalyzed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Some cytokines, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-6 are potent inducers of IDO. KYN is further converted by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) to the more neuroprotective kynurenic acid or by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) to neurotoxic 3-hydroxykynurenine. The aim of the present study was to delineate whether the administration of imipramine (IMI) to rats subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS) may reverse behavioral changes induced by CMS in association with changes in immune-inflammatory markers and KP. We confirmed that the CMS procedure modeled one of the main symptoms of depression, i.e. anhedonia, and administration of IMI for 5 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in anhedonia in a majority of animals (CMS IMI-R animals), whereas 20% of animals did not respond to IMI treatment (CMS IMI-NR animals). We established that CMS procedure increased IFN-γ and IDO mRNA and decreased KAT II mRNA expression in the rat cortex. In the cortex and hippocampus, IMI treatment and non-responsiveness to IMI (in CMS IMI-NR animals) were associated with increased IL-6 mRNA expression. In the spleen, CMS increased production of IFN-γ and IL-6 proteins, while these cytokines were decreased by IMI in CMS IMI-R animals. Chronic IMI administration to CMS rats decreased IDO and KMO mRNA and protein expression and increased KAT II/KMO mRNA and protein ratio in IMI responders (CMS IMI-R) in comparison to CMS rats. In CMS IMI-NR rats, a significant increase in IDO mRNA expression and protein level in comparison with IMI responders was observed. Our findings indicate that resistance to therapeutic action of IMI could be explained by a deficiency of the inhibitory properties of IMI on IDO, KMO and KYN synthesis in the cortex. We conclude that the antidepressant activity of IMI may, at least in part, be explained by modulatory activities on the KAT II/KMO ratio in brain areas.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

The Mg-Al mixed oxide was then derived by calcination of hydrotalcite at 450℃. The metal modified catalysts (Mo/Mg-Al and V/Mg-Al) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The obtained catalysts were characterized by several useful techniques and tested the reactivity for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol (gas-phase) to produce acetaldehyde. The catalytic reactions were performed at temperature range from 200 to 400℃ for both non-oxidative and oxidative atmospheres. The results showed that the vanadium-modified hydrotalcite (V/Mg-Al) exhibited the highest ethanol conversion (34.3%) and acetaldehyde yield (15.5%) at 400℃ in the non-oxidative atmosphere. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol, the V/Mg-Al catalyst showed the highest activity at 400℃ giving the ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde yield of 73.7% and 29.5%, respectively. This result probably related to the highest base density of V/Mg-Al catalyst (6.13 µmol CO2/m2) measured by CO2-TPD. The catalytic activity of Mg-Al catalyst and metal modified catalyst slightly decreased upon time-on-stream test for 10 h on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol due to carbon deposition.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Methods: Randomized controlled trials studying the effects of LDMs in treating CRS were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Primary outcome was Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT). Six prognostic factors: CRS subtypes, serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E level, membered lactone ring of macrolides, concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), and dosage and duration of the LDMs were assessed by subgroup analyses. Results: Ten studies (608 patients) met the inclusion criteria. LDMs and placebo were not different in SNOT improvement (standardized mean difference [SMD] = −0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.69 to 0.24). Subgroup analyses showed that the effects favored LDMs in the patients with CRS without polyps (SMD = −0.64, 95% CI: −1.01 to −0.27) compared to CRS with polyps, and the patients receiving a half dose (SMD = −0.64, 95% CI: −1.01 to −0.27) compared to a very low dose. There was no difference in SNOT improvement between LDMs plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment (SMD = −0.52, 95% CI: −1.57 to 0.53). Subgroup analyses showed that the effects favored LDMs in the patients receiving LDMs for a duration of 24 weeks (SMD = −1.68, 95% CI: −2.40 to −0.95) compared to 8 and 12 weeks. There was no difference between the 14-membered and 15-membered ring LDMs. Assessment of concurrent ESS found mixed results. Serum IgE level could not be assessed. Conclusions: LDMs provided favorable outcomes in patients with CRS without polyps. A half dose of macrolides should be given for a duration of 24 weeks. Level of Evidence: 1a.

Also, hydrogen storage system (HSS) as an energy storage system (ESS) is used to cope with variable nature of RESs in which the concepts of power to hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen to power (H2P) are defined. In this work, a risk-averse stochastic operation of HSS and WG is modeled using a scenario-based stochastic approach by considering price-responsive demand response (DR) program. All uncertainties are modeled via a scenario-based stochastic approach while the risk related uncertainties are modeled via the downside risk constraints (DRC) to capture the risk-averse operation of the HSS and WG. In order to investigate the impact of DRC implementation, a risk-averse strategy is compared versus risk-neutral strategy. Compared results show that the risk-in-cost (RIC) is reduced while the expected operation cost (EOC) is raised to deal with the risk of the uncertainty.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

It is characterized by the increased concentration of glucose in the blood and leads to damage of the body system, especially blood vessels and nerves. Lifestyle modification is often combined with anti-diabetic therapy as the standard of care for T2DM to maintain the proper blood glucose and to prevent long-term diabetic complications. The role of probiotics in improving glycemic control has been investigated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including different sets of trials have concluded an overall beneficial effect of probiotics in patients with T2DM. At least two RCTs with a longer treatment duration have been published since the publication of existing reviews. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review of RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for glycemic control in T2DM patients. Primary outcomes are fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). Secondary outcomes are plasma insulin, blood lipid profile, adverse events, and cost associated with the intervention and hospital visits. We will search PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, and trial registries. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias. We will summarize the results both qualitatively and statistically. We will use random-effects model for meta-analysis. Discussion: This systematic review aims to examine whether probiotics are effective and safe for glycemic control in T2DM patients.

However, injecting PV power during the light load occurrence can cause overvoltage and increased active power loss impacts on the distribution system. The objective of this paper is to determine the maximum PV size used to set the installation limit in Thailand grid code. The system voltages and the active power loss are used to be constraints of the optimization problem. A Direct Search method is employed and developed on the DIgSILENT PowerFactory program. The simulated system is constructed from typical data of Thailand distribution grids, while the load flow calculation is carried out on the average light load condition of Metropolitan Electricity Fig. 1.

Three simulation cases are studied: (1) PV installed at the beginning of the line, (2) PV installed at the middle of the line, and (3) PV installed at the end of the line. The results show that when a PV system with an appropriate size is installed, its impacts will be mitigated, and that the PV size can be the highest if its location is at the beginning of the line. Since the simulated system is typically constructed, the results and analyses can be applied broadly and imposed on the MEA's grid code.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The provision of food for airline passengers demonstrates an unsustainable consumption and production pattern and food waste from flight catering poses a significant sustainability issue, not only because valuable caloric content is lost, but also the loss of land, water and energy required in the production of food. A conduct of literature review of food waste management in airline catering business revealed a lack of research in this area. Through a case study of Halal food production process, the research aims to identify the amount of food waste generated from Halal kitchen flight catering production process in order to identify food waste hotspots by conducting a food waste composition analysis, Material Flow Analysis and eco-efficiency analysis. It also endeavors to provide insights that can help organizations better understand the food waste generation and composition imperative to the establishment of food waste management policies and make informed decisions to ensure that the future growth is more sustainable. One of the goals of this research is to develop a recommendation for sustainable food waste management by promoting the most preferred approaches of sustainable food waste management, which can prevent and reduce food wastage at source instead of the least preferred approach, which is recovering energy before landfill disposal. This research found that vegetable wastes accounted for 40–50 percent of the total food generated in the operation. From the quantitative analyses, it is recommended that the company prioritize its efforts in reducing seafood waste due to relatively high impact the reduction in seafood wastes will have in terms of cost-savings potential. This can be achieved by designing menus and recipes that aim to utilize seafood efficiently in combination with starting a dialogue with airline customers on the benefits of food waste reduction. The material flow diagram clearly illustrates the hotspots in the halal production process. Although the meal portioning process did not generate the highest amount of food waste, but in terms of edibility, this process generated the highest amount of wasted food (edible parts). Measures should be established in order to address the inefficiencies in the resource use. The company can reduce vegetables waste by selecting high quality suppliers, improve the effectiveness of selection and quality control process by providing additional training, changing the washing process and investing in new technology that facilitate staff in their jobs.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The trend is to send the cases to a fellowship-trained pediatric orthopedist. This study reviewed the outcomes and complications of SCHF surgically managed by orthopedic surgeons with different backgrounds of subspecialty training. Methods: The medical records of 87 children (87 elbows) with an average age of 5.9 ± 3.1 (range 1.3–14.1) years with SCHF Gartland 2 and 3 who underwent operative fixation were reviewed. The demographics data and operative details were obtained. Radiographically, the Baumann and humerocapitella angles were measured. The lateral rotational percentage of Gordon was calculated. The Griffet index 1 and 2 were retrieved. The parameters were compared among groups of surgeons with a pediatric fellowship-trained background and surgeons with other subspecialty training. A univariate analysis was calculated for the risk of postoperative complications. Results: The demographics data were comparable between the two groups. Children who were treated by non-pediatric fellowship-trained orthopedists showed higher but not significant degrees of postoperative Baumann angles; however, the proportion of children with an acceptable range of Baumann angle were similar. The overall complications rate was 17.5% and comparable between the two groups. Only SCHF Gartland 3 was associated with complications (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Pediatric SCHF could be efficiently managed by a general orthopedic surgeon because the radiographic outcomes and complications were comparable to pediatric fellowship-trained orthopedists. Extra precautions need to be exercised in SCHF Gartland type 3 because the chance of complications is higher among these types of injuries.

The bacterial filtration efficiency was performed by spraying the biological aerosol through the filters. Breathability of face masks was also measured as a pressure drop parameters. The physical properties of filters were evaluated in terms of surface morphology and water contact angle. The coated filters were then challenged with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as the representative bacteria. The results showed that the increase in the mangosteen extract concentration for coating caused fiber diameter, hydrophilicity, % BFE (> 95%) and pressure drop of filters to be also increased. Investigation into release characteristic of mangosteen extract-coated polypropylene filters exhibited initial burst release after 60 min of immersion in a phosphate buffer solution.

Methods: Anticancer, antimigration, anti-invasion effects and anchorage-independent growth were investigated by MTT, scratch, matrigel invasion and soft agar assays. Estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted genes and endocrine-resistant genes were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Key findings: Ethoxy mansonone G is the most potent MG derivative and has anticancer effects in ER-positive, endocrine-resistant and ER-negative breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that EMG can significantly inhibit estrogen-induced cell proliferation and the expression of ER-targeted genes in ER-positive breast cancer cells, suggesting the anti-estrogenic property of EMG which is consisting with the virtual molecular docking that EMG could possibly bind to the ERα.

These are common clinical conditions that involve loss of saliva-secreting epithelial cells. Several oral complications arise with SG hypofunction that interfere with routine daily activities such as chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Hence, there is a need for replacing these saliva-secreting cells. Recently, researchers have proposed to repair SG hypofunction via various cell-based approaches in three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-based systems. However, majority of the scaffolds used cannot be translated clinically due to the presence of non-human-based substrates. Herein, saliva-secreting organoids/mini-glands were developed using a new scaffold/substrate-free culture system named magnetic 3D levitation (M3DL), which assembles and levitates magnetized primary SG-derived cells (SGDCs), allowing them to produce their own extracellular matrices. Primary SGDCs were assembled in M3DL to generate SG-like organoids in well-established SG epithelial differentiation conditions for 7 days. After such culture time, these organoids consistently presented uniform spheres with greater cell viability and pro-mitotic cells, when compared with conventional salisphere cultures. Additionally, organoids formed by M3DL expressed SG-specific markers from different cellular compartments: acinar epithelial including adherens junctions (NKCC1, cholinergic muscarinic receptor type 3, E-cadherin, and EpCAM); ductal epithelial and myoepithelial (cytokeratin 14 and α-smooth muscle actin); and neuronal (β3-tubulin and vesicular acetylcholine transferase). Lastly, intracellular calcium and α-amylase activity assays showed functional organoids with SG-specific secretory activity upon cholinergic stimulation. Thus, the functional organoid produced herein indicate that this M3DL system can be a promising tool to generate SG-like mini-glands for SG secretory repair.","fluidex; related topics, medical, Materials Science, engineering","Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"
Green Synthesis of Size-Tunable Iron Oxides and Iron Nanoparticles in a Salt Matrix,"Nguyen M.T., Yu K., Tokunaga T., Boonyaperm K., Kheawhom S., Arita M., Yonezawa T.",2019-11-04,"Fe nanoparticles, Iron nanoparticles, Iron oxide nanoparticle, Metal precursor, Particle surface, Salt matrices, Synthesis temperatures, Two-step synthesis, iron nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, reduction, salt matrix","This research is devoted for the synthesis of Fe oxide and Fe nanoparticles (NPs) via, respectively, thermal decomposition of iron(III) oleate and H2 reduction of either iron(III) oleate or iron oxide NPs in a NaCl matrix. Lowering the weight ratios of metal precursor to NaCl and synthesis temperature results in smaller particle sizes. A higher uniformity of Fe NPs can be achieved with a two-step synthesis, that is, thermal decomposition of iron oleate followed by H2 reduction of iron oxides, with the milling of iron oxides and NaCl prior to the reduction step. Fe NPs obtained in this study are stable in the air for long-time storage. It is found that thin oxide and C layers on the particle surface are responsible for their stability.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Finite element analysis comparison between superior clavicle locking plate with and without screw holes above fracture zone in midshaft clavicular fracture,"Pengrung N., Lakdee N., Puncreobutr C., Lohwongwatana B., Sa-Ngasoongsong P.",2019-10-22,"Bone Plates, Clavicle, Finite Element Analysis, Fracture Fixation, Internal, Fractures, Comminuted, Humans, Stress, Mechanical, Implant failure, Midshaft clavicular fracture, Peak stress, Plate fixation, Screw hole, Superior clavicle locking plate","Background: Midshaft clavicular fractures are common fractures and generally treated conservatively. Among the surgical options, plate fixation is the most popular and has been biomechanically and clinically proven in numerous studies. However, implant failures caused by plate deformations or breakage still occur in up to 16.7% of cases, and recent studies showed that screw holes above fracture zone (SHFZ) might be the at-risk location. Using finite element analysis, this study aimed to test the biomechanical property of the superior clavicle locking plate (SCLP) with and without SHFZ in comminuted midshaft clavicular fracture. Methods: Finite element models of comminuted midshaft clavicular fracture fixed with standard 8-hole titanium SCLP with screw holes (SHFZ plate) and without screw holes above fracture zone (No-SHFZ plate) were built. Both groups were tested under three different loading models (100-N cantilever bending, 100-N axial compression, and 1-Nm torsion). The average peak stress on medial clavicle, fracture zone, and lateral clavicle, and the peak stress on each screw hole (or the same position in the No-SHFZ plate) were measured and compared. Results: The highest average peak stress on the fracture zone was higher than those on medial and lateral clavicles under all loading conditions in both plates. However, the No-SHFZ plate significantly reduced the average peak stress value on the fracture zone, compared to the SHFZ plate (45.0% reduction in cantilever bending, 52.2% reduction in axial compression, and 54.9% reduction in axial torsion). The peak stress value on the maximal stress point in the SHFZ and No-SHFZ plates with cantilever bending, axial compression, and torsion loads were 1257.10 MPa vs. 647.21 MPa, 186.42 MPa vs. 131.63 MPa, and 111.86 MPa vs. 82.41 MPa, respectively. Conclusion: The weakest link of the SCLP construct in comminuted midshaft clavicular fracture fixation is the SHFZ, especially in the cantilever bending load. Additionally, the biomechanical property of the SCLP without SHFZ model (No-SHFZ plate) is superior to the standard SCLP model (SHFZ plate), with a significantly lower peak stress on the SHFZ location in all loading conditions. We recommend a new SCLP design with SHFZ to prevent implant failure and improve surgical outcomes.","orthopedic surgery, medical","Rheumatology, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"
Modified response spectrum analysis to compute shear force in tall RC shear wall buildings,"Khy K., Chintanapakdee C., Warnitchai P., Wijeyewickrema A.C.",2019-02-01,"Higher mode, Nonlinear response history analysis, Reinforced concrete shear walls, Response spectrum analysis, Shear force, Higher mode response, Modified response spectrum analysis, Nonlinear response history analysis, Reinforced concrete shear walls, Response spectrum analysis, Shear force, Tall buildings","Among various analysis methods, response spectrum analysis (RSA) is widely used to compute design forces of structures subjected to earthquake loading. Previous studies indicate that using a single response modification factor (R) to reduce elastic forces contributed from all modes in the RSA procedure is the primary cause for underestimating the design force demands on structures. In this paper, two modified response spectrum analysis (MRSA) methods, MRSAHE based on a higher-mode elastic approach and MRSAHI based on a higher-mode inelastic approach are proposed for computing design shear forces in tall reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall buildings. Here 15-, 20-, 31-, and 39-story tall buildings subjected to earthquake excitations in Bangkok are first designed using the RSA procedure, and then nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) is carried out. It is found that the RSA procedure provides good estimates for floor displacements and story drift ratios, but significantly underestimates force demands, when compared with NLRHA. The MRSAHE method provides good estimates of shear force for the 15- and 20-story buildings and conservative estimates for the 31- and 39-story buildings; while the MRSAHI method provides good estimates for all cases. However, MRSAHI requires a nonlinear inelastic structural model but MRSAHE does not. In both MRSA methods, the bending moment demands are computed in the same way as the conventional RSA procedure, with ductile detailing in RC walls or columns required at locations where the combined axial and bending strain exceeds a certain limit. In order to determine the locations that require ductile detailing in RC walls or columns, a novel method based on the equal displacement concept using strain from elastic analysis to predict inelastic strain is found to provide good agreement with inelastic strain computed from NLRHA.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

For efficient utilization of inherently intermittent renewable energy sources, safe and cost-effective energy storage systems are required. A zinc-air flow battery integrated with a zinc electrolyzer shows great promise as an electricity storage system due to its high specific energy density at low cost. A mathematical model of the system was developed. The model was implemented in MATLAB and validated against experimental results. The validation of the model was verified by the agreement between the simulation and experimental polarization characteristic. The behavior and performance of the system were then examined as a function of different operating parameters: the flow rate of the electrolyte, the initial concentration of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the initial concentration of zincate ion. These parameters significantly affected the performance of the system. The influence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the performance of the system was investigated and discussed as it significantly affected the coulombic efficiencies of both the zinc-air flow battery and the zinc electrolyzer. Optimal KOH concentration was found to be about 6-7 M. Whilst increased KOH concentration enhanced the discharge energy of the battery, it also increased HER of both the battery and the electrolyzer. However, higher initial concentration of zincate ion reduced HER and improved the coulombic efficiency of the system. Besides, a higher flow rate of electrolyte enhanced the performance of the system especially at a high charge/discharge current by maintaining the concentration of active species in the cell. Nevertheless, the battery suffered from a higher rate of HER at a high flow rate. It was noted that the model-based analysis provided better insight into the behavioral characteristics of the system leading to an improved design and operation of the integrated system of zinc-air flow battery with the zinc electrolyzer.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Economics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Economics and Econometrics"

Sepsis is a multiorgan injury, and thus, drug metabolism in sepsis-AKI might be interfered by non-renal factors such as changes in functions of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and functions of intestinal drug transporters. We compared the defect on mouse CYP3A11 (human CYP3A4 representative) in liver and intestine along with several intestinal drug transporters (MDR1a, MRP2, and OATP3) in three mouse models; chronic ischemic reperfusion injury (Chr I/R; 4-week), acute ischemic reperfusion injury (Acute I/R; 24-h), and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP; 24-h) as representative of sepsis-AKI. Decreased expression of CYP3A11 and drug transporters was demonstrated in all models. Among these models, sepsis-AKI had the least severe renal injury (increased BUN and Scr) with the most severe liver injury (increased ALT and changes in liver histopathology), the most severe intestinal leakage (increased serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan) and the highest increase in serum IL-6. A reduced expression and activity of liver and intestinal CYP3A11 along with intestinal efflux-drug transporter expressions (MDR1a and MRP2), but not drug uptake transporter (OATP3), was predominant in sepsis-AKI compared with acute I/R. Additionally, a reduction of CYP3A4 expression with IL-6 was demonstrated on HepG2 cells implying a direct injury of IL-6 on human liver cells. Differences in drug metabolism were reported between sepsis-AKI and ischemic-AKI confirming that drug dosing adjustment in sepsis-AKI depends not just only on renal function but also on several non-renal factors.

Therefore, rollover prevention systems are of great importance for driver safety. The implementation of rollover prevention systems requires an estimation of the rollover risk. To assess that risk, different rollover indices have been introduced. A difficulty is the dependence of these indices on unknown parameters, e.g., center of gravity and current load of the vehicle. One solution is to implement an algorithm for the estimation of the required parameters that can be online measured. In this work however, we investigate the use of recurrent neural networks for the estimation of the rollover index. Their ability to work on sequential data is promising for a data based estimation without the need of an additional estimation algorithm.

The effect of the amount of 0.5 M H2SO4 (2.5–10 g) added into the pre-synthesis mixture on the physicochemical properties of the obtained NRHMS nanocomposites was investigated. With a small addition of H2SO4 solution, the fabricated NRHMS nanocomposite possessed an improved wormhole-like mesostructure arrangement with a thicker silica wall, which retarded the thermal decomposition of the NR phase, as deduced from the auto-oxidation of NR by thermogravimetric analysis. The H2O adsorption–desorption measurement revealed an increased hydrophobicity of the NRHMS composites, explained by the acid-catalyzed bridging of free silanol groups to siloxane bonds, which was supported by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mapping revealed a good dispersion of the NR phase within the mesostructured silica. However, a high amount of added H2SO4 solution led to silica–NR phase separation due to the decreased hydrophobic interaction between the silica precursor and rubber chain, as well as an agglomeration of the NR phase itself. The mechanism of NRHMS nanocomposite formation under pH-controlled conditions was proposed to proceed via a cooperative self-assembly route.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Additionally, SYBR Green I was used for endpoint detection of the RPA products by the naked eye. Method: A total of 146 genomic Mtb DNA samples and 24 genomic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) DNA samples were amplified at IS6110 and IS1081 by RPA.

The performance of the RPA assays was evaluated by comparing them to a conventional PCR. Results: The RPA assay demonstrated to have a good capability to differentiate Mtb from NTM with a very short turnaround time at a constant temperature. Compared to conventional PCR, the sensitivities and specificities of RPA-AGE for IS6110 and IS1081 were 100%. The specificity of RPA-S was 100% for both targets; however, its sensitivities for IS6110 and IS1081 were 97.95% and 99.32%, respectively.

The effects of operating parameters in terms of boundary of carbon formation, steam to carbon ratio, and oxygen to carbon ratio on the biogas reforming process are firstly investigated. To utilize more CO2 in the system, CO2 produced from the DME synthesis is recycled to use in the biogas tri-reforming process. The H2 and CO yields of the tri-reforming process increase with increasing the CO2 recirculation ratio while the DME yield and system efficiency decrease. The requirement of gas cleaning unit for the DME synthesis coupling with the biogas tri-reforming system is also analyzed. The results indicate that the system with CO2 removal from syngas has more impact on the DME yield than that with H2O removal. On the contrary, the total CO2 emission intensity of the system with H2O removal is lower than that with CO2 removal. When comparing all cases, the system with both H2O and CO2 removals achieves the highest DME yield and system efficiency.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Probe solution changes color from red to blue in the presence of Ca2+ and can be observed by the naked eyes. To verify the complete self-assembly of the AHMP onto the AuNP surface, the modified AuNPs were characterized using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. Under optimal conditions, a quantitative linearity was 10 to 100 ppm (R2 = 0.9877) with a detection limit of 3.05 ppm. The results obtained by the developed method were in good agreement with standard atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) results and demonstrated that this method could reliably measure Ca2+. Overall, this novel alternative approach presents a low-cost, simple, sensitive, rapid, and promising device for the detection of Ca2+.","biophysicsics, bioengineeringneering and medicalcal instrumentation, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In ophthalmology, epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human amniotic membrane (HAM) promotes corneal epithelial cell proliferation and migration, thus it facilitates corneal wound healing. In dogs, with limited cryopreserved HAM availability, different cold glycerol preserving protocols have been developed for the storage canine amniotic membrane (CAM). This study aimed to study protein expression of EGF in CAM preserved with different concentrations of glycerol and storage temperatures, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CAM preserved in 50% glycerol and 99.5% glycerol and kept at 4 and − 20 °C for 7–30 days were compared. We found that preserving membrane with 50% glycerol at − 20 °C has significantly higher EGF protein expression compared with that at 4 °C (p < 0.05). There was a trend that the storage in 50% glycerol achieved higher EGF protein expression than 99.5% glycerol at both 4 °C and − 20 °C. In conclusion, 50% glycerol at − 20 °C was the best condition to preserve CAM in our study. Therefore, there is likely an alternative method to maintain level of EGF protein expression in preserved CAM.","genergyal, Materials Science, engineering, biochemistryistry, medical","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Transplantation"

Here, we explore decision-making processes and perceptions of trial participation in a phase I trial that raised important ethical considerations, to identify potential areas of improvement in this relatively new field of HIV research. Similar considerations apply to other HIV phase I trials, especially those involving ATI, making this trial a model to identify challenges and opportunities in promoting informed choice. Methods: Using longitudinal semi-structured interviews and a validated questionnaire, we examined how decisions to join or decline the trial were made, whether there was evidence of decisional conflict, and reactions to the trial outcomes. We also explored contrasting views and experiences in this small trial cohort. We report analyses of data from these questionnaires and interviews, conducted from February through December of 2016 with the 14 SEARCH cohort participants who either joined (n = 8) or declined (n = 6) participation in RV411. Results: The eight participants and six decliners had low overall decisional conflict, which remained low over time. Decision making was more difficult for decliners than participants, at least initially. While all interviewees described being satisfied with their decisions, our study identified important negative consequences for a few individuals, including seroconversion, negative experiences with optional procedures and disappointment due to rapid viral rebound. Conclusions: Although our results reflect the experiences of a small group invited to join this trial, our overall finding of low decisional conflict even while some individuals reported negative experiences provides lessons for clinical trial investigators. We developed points-to-consider in helping participants make informed choices, to support participants during the trial and to support decliners in their decisions.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

However, the relatively poor surface hardness, wear resistance and metal release of these layers may cause some problems in clinical application. In this study, titanium surfaces were modified using a TiO2 sol-gel coating, in order to improve surface properties and osteoblast function. No significant difference in surface roughness was observed between titanium and TiO2 sol-gel discs. The surface of TiO2 sol-gel discs possessed more wettability than titanium discs. The X-ray diffraction results showed amorphous TiO2 phase on titanium discs, whereas TiO2 sol-gel surfaces presented TiO2 rutile and anatase phase. After 4 hours, the number of osteoblasts seeded on TiO2 surface was significantly higher than those on titanium discs. The mRNA expression of bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin were also higher on day 5 and 7, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) analysis confirmed the increase of osteocalcin protein synthesis in osteoblasts grown on the TiO2 sol-gel surface. Alizarin red-S staining showed higher amount of calcium deposition from osteoblasts cultured on TiO2 surface than those on titanium discs at day 20. In conclusion, TiO2 sol-gel coated-titanium could enhance osteoblasts differentiation and promote mineralization, indicating its potential in improving osseointegration for clinical application.",medical,Medicine (all)

We aimed to define the prevalence and comprehensively explore mechanisms of PH in β-thal/HbE patients receiving regular transfusion and iron chelation, which were reported to alleviate PH. Materials and methods: β-Thal/HbE patients receiving regular transfusion and iron chelation over one year were enrolled. Patients at risk for PH were defined by tricuspid-regurgitant-jet-velocity (TRV) ≥ 2.5 m/s. Laboratory and echocardiographic variables were compared with healthy controls. Results: There were 68 β-thal/HbE, including 31 (45.6%) splenectomized patients, and 38 controls included for analysis. PH was detected in 29 β-thal/HbE (42.6%). β-Thal/HbE with PH had a significant reduction in nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) but elevations in thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) values compared to those without PH (all, p < 0.05). TRV was significantly correlated with NOx, TAT, sTM, ET-1 and FMD values (r = −0.514, r = 0.281, r = 0.313, r = 0.245 and r = −0.474; all p < 0.05). Erythropoietic activity, serum ferritin, circulating total tissue factor (TF) antigen, microparticle-associated TF activity, microparticle's procoagulant activity and soluble p-selectin levels were not different between PH and non-PH subgroups. Notably, there were no significant associations between splenectomy and PH. Conclusions: PH remains prevalent in β-thal/HbE patients receiving long-term transfusion and iron chelation. PH is not associated with splenectomy status but correlated with NO depletion, TF-independent hypercoagulability and endothelial perturbation.","genergyal, medical",Hematology

To reduce the amount of their waste deposited in landfills and to increase the value- adding of recyclable waste, this work interested to use as raw materials in the preparation of geopolymer. This paper studied the reaction mechanisms of calcined kaolin processing waste-based geopolymers in the presence of low alkali activator solution by the pressing method. The reaction mechanisms of geopolymer were measured as a function of NaOH concentration by DSC, XRD, and FTIR analysis. Furthermore, the effects of NaOH concentration and curing time on the mechanical properties and microstructure of calcined kaolin processing waste-based geopolymer were investigated. The DSC, XRD, and FTIR results indicated that the geopolymerization reaction increased with higher NaOH concentrations. Forming the geopolymer by the pressing method led to the particles being close together in a compact matrix. Subsequently, their surfaces were dissolved with NaOH solution, inducing the geopolymerization reaction. This reaction and continuous reaction resulted in the compressive strength and microstructure of the geopolymer. The compressive strengths of the geopolymer synthesized with NaOH concentration of 10 M (curing time of 7 days) and a curing time of 28 days were 26.98 MPa and 28.55 MPa, respectively, which were approximately 22.58% and 52.35% higher compared to the geopolymer synthesized with NaOH concentration of 4 M and a curing time of 1 day. The SEM micrographs of the geopolymer samples displayed more geopolymeric gel and denser matrices with increases in NaOH concentration and curing time. The nitrogen adsorption and pore volume decreased with increases in NaOH concentration and curing time. Synthesis of geopolymers using kaolin processing waste as a raw material is a value- adding and environmentally friendly process.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

Significantly lesser toxicity is obtained when AmB incorporated into the aqueous dispersion of lipid nanoparticles. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize AmB loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). NLC differed from SLN by the presence of liquid lipid, glyceryl tri(caprylate/caprate) in the lipid matrix. Various surfactants i.e. tween 20, cremophor RH40, poloxamer 407 (P407) and Myrj 52 were used to stabilize SLN and NLC. The effect of phospholipid incorporated in those lipid dispersions was also determined. Among surfactants tested, only P407 could stabilize AmB lipid dispersions. There was no chemical reaction occurred between AmB and other components that confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot-stage microscopy (HSM), powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD) data showed that AmB was molecularly dispersed or in amorphous form in the lipid matrix. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) results showed that in the presence of phospholipid oil clusters within the lipid matrix are formed. These results indicate that SLN and NLC stabilized by P407 and/or phospholipid as the colloidal carrier for AmB were successfully developed.","pharmacology, chemistry","Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

The developed device is capable of storing and transporting reagents sequentially to the detection channel without the need for external power. The device comprises two components: An origami folding paper (oPAD) and a movable reagent-stored pad (rPAD). This 3D capillary-driven device eliminates the undesirable procedure of multiple-step reagent manipulation in a complex assay. To demonstrate the scope of this approach, the device is used for electrochemical detection of biological species. Using a flow-through configuration, a self-calibration plot plus real sample analysis using a single buffer introduction are established for ascorbic acid detection. We further broaden the effectiveness of the device to a complex assay using a stopped-flow configuration. Unlike other electrochemical paper-based sensors in which the user is required to cut off the device inlet or rest for the whole channel saturation before measurement, herein a stopped-flow device is carefully designed to exclude the disturbance from the convective mass transport. As a proof of concept, multiple procedures for electrode modification and voltammetric determination of serotonin are illustrated. In addition, the research includes an impedimetric label-free immunosensor for alpha;-fetoprotein using the modified stopped-flow device.

An enormous number of traffic data could be obtained with the development of information techniques. This motivates the application of machine learning in the road traffic area, especially in traffic incident detection.

In this paper, by using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) software, we have chosen to work on the Chula-Sathorn SUMO Simulator (Chula-SSS) dataset. SUMO enables users to simulate traffic networks and supports the traffic data by setting up conveniently simulated lane area detectors.

The results indicated that using a 1:5 PRC: Ni/AC catalyst weight ratio with medium-sized PRC particles (125–425 μm)was the most effective condition for the conversion of oxygenated (O)-compounds to hydrocarbons (HCs)through decarbonylation, decarboxylation and dehydration reactions, giving the highest decrease (99%)in O-compounds. Increased HC yields, to more than 58%, were also obtained with this catalyst. Similarly, using the other synthesized Ni catalysts resulted in a reduction in the O-compounds and production of favorable HC species, albeit to a lesser extent.

Therefore, the application of sunscreen has gained much attention to reduce the harmful efiects of UV irradiation on our skin. Recently, there has been a growing demand for the replacement of chemical sunscreens with natural UV-absorbing compounds. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), promising alternative natural UV-absorbing compounds, are a group of widely distributed, low molecular-weight, water-soluble molecules that can absorb UV radiation and disperse the absorbed energy as heat, without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). More than 30 MAAs have been characterized, from a variety of organisms. In addition to their UV-absorbing properties, there is substantial evidence that MAAs have the potential to protect against skin aging, including antioxidative activity, anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of protein-glycation, and inhibition of collagenase activity. This review will provide an overview of MAAs, as potential anti-aging ingredients, beginning with their structure, before moving on to discuss the most recent experimental observations, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which MAAs might protect the skin. In particular, we focus on the potential anti-aging activity of mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G).",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

Average grain size of BSTO ceramics decreased from 15 to 2 μm with increasing Sr molar fraction. X-ray structural analysis revealed that BSTO ceramics exhibited tetragonal structure (x = 0 and 0.3) and transformed into cubic structure at high Sr molar fraction (x = 0.5) at room temperature. Dielectric constant of the BSTO ceramics was measured between -60 and 180 °C and frequency range of 1-100 kHz. Temperature transition from ferroelectric to paraelectric phase (Curie temperature: T C) decreased linearly from 125 to -30 °C as Sr molar fraction increased. The dielectric constant exhibited frequency-independent behavior in the frequency range investigated. A diffuse dielectric constant peak was evident for BSTO with Sr molar fraction of 0.5 due to the effect of fine-grained size. Polarization-electric field (P-E) at room temperature presented a well-defined hysteresis loop for BSTO (x = 0 and 0.3), indicating their ferroelectric characteristics. At a high Sr molar fraction of 0.5, the P-E loop became a linear relation, indicating a paraelectric phase. Energy storage density of BSTO with x = 0 was about 0.2 J/cm3; however, energy storage efficiency was less than 50%. After doping with Sr molar fraction of 0.5, energy storage density decreased to 0.1 J/cm3 but its energy storage efficiency significantly improved to 90%.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

The beam element is modeled as a composite consisting of the bulk material and the surface material layer. Both Eringen nonlocal elasticity theory and Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory are adopted to formulate the moment-curvature relationship of the beam. In the formulation, the pre-existing residual stress within the bulk material, induced by the residual surface tension in the material layer, is also taken into account. The resulting moment-curvature relationship is then utilized together with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the elliptic integral technique to establish a set of exact algebraic equations governing the displacements and rotations at the ends of the beam. The linearized version of those equations is also established and used in the derivation of a closed-form solution of the buckling load of nano-beams under various end conditions. A discretization-free solution procedure based mainly upon Newton iterative scheme and a selected numerical quadrature is developed to solve a system of fully coupled nonlinear equations. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique yields highly accurate results comparable to the benchmark analytical solutions. In addition, the nonlocal and surface energy effects play a significant role on the predicted buckling load, post-buckling and bending responses of the nano-beam. In particular, the presence of those effects remarkably alters the overall stiffness of the beam and predicted solutions exhibit strong size-dependence when the characteristic length of the beam is comparable to the intrinsic length scale of the material surface.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

In the present study, the isolated alga Synechocystis PCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L−1 d−1 and it was estimated that the algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha−1 year−1. A low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery. The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the microalgae Synechocystis biomass production cost was approximately 2–3 US$ per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained. This is the first study to demonstrate the alga Synechocystis cultivation in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and produced two potential biofuels.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This motif is found in hominids (humans and great apes) at an identical location in repeat units of their centromere satellite DNA. We have recently reported that the CENP-B box exists at diverse locations in three New World monkey species (marmoset, squirrel monkey and tamarin). However, the evolutionary origin of the CENP-B box in these species was not determined. It could have been present in a common ancestor, or emerged multiple times in different lineages. Here we present results of a phylogenetic analysis of centromere satellite DNA that support the multiple emergence hypothesis. Repeat units almost invariably formed monophyletic groups in each species and the CENP-B box location was unique for each species. The CENP-B box is not essential for the immediate survival of its host organism. On the other hand, it is known to be required for de novo centromere assembly. Our results suggest that the CENP-B box confers a long-term selective advantage. For example, it may play a pivotal role when a centromere is accidentally lost or impaired.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Molecular Biology, Genetics"

The use of a fractional open-circuit voltage method with feedback mechanism make the MPPT highly robust against process variation and component tolerances. Moreover, due to an input capacitor-less feature, the MPPT circuit can fast track the maximum power point (MPP) when input voltage varies. The converter is designed using a 130 nm CMOS technology and uses a thermoelectric generator (TEG) as an input voltage source.

The toxicity against mice, the cytotoxicity against five cell lines, and the antioxidant activity were measured. The KV2 venom showed a higher cytotoxicity than the KV6 and the non-cytotoxic KV9 venoms. Comparative analysis of the O. hannah venom proteins was performed after 2-dimensional (2-D) denaturing gel electrophoresis and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). 2-D analysis by isoelectric focusing (IEF) Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) resolution of the venoms revealed significant differences between all three venoms, with most spots being unique to that venom. Only 2 out of the 13–16 distinct spots were common to all three venoms, and four spots were common to KV6 and KV9. KV2 had the highest proportion of low molecular mass spots, and KV6 and KV9 appeared more related to each other than to KV9. From peptide mass mapping by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and MASCOT-based amino acid sequence database searching, the two venom proteins that were common to all three specimens are likely to be ophanin and acidic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), whilst the proteins unique to the cytotoxic KV2 venom, included three other PLA2 proteins. The RP-HPLC pattern of KV2 was different from the other two venoms with a higher protein concentration eluting in the 31–41% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) fraction than for the other two venoms.","chemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Little, however, is known about the molecular mechanism by which FK506 inhibits PDR transporter drug efflux. Thus, to obtain further insights we searched for FK506-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells overexpressing either the endogenous multidrug efflux pump Pdr5 or its Candida albicans orthologue, Cdr1. A simple but powerful screen gave 69 FK506-resistant mutants with, between them, 72 mutations in either Pdr5 or Cdr1. Twenty mutations were in just three Pdr5/Cdr1 equivalent amino acid positions, T550/T540 and T552/S542 of extracellular loop 1 (EL1) and A723/A713 of EL3. Sixty of the 72 mutations were either in the ELs or the extracellular halves of individual transmembrane spans (TMSs), while 11 mutations were found near the center of individual TMSs, mostly in predicted TMS-TMS contact points, and only two mutations were in the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains of Pdr5. We propose that FK506 inhibits Pdr5 and Cdr1 drug efflux by slowing transporter opening and/or substrate release, and that FK506 resistance of Pdr5/Cdr1 drug efflux is achieved by modifying critical intramolecular contact points that, when mutated, enable the cotransport of FK506 with other pump substrates. This may also explain why the 35 Cdr1 mutations that caused FK506 insensitivity of fluconazole efflux differed from the 13 Cdr1 mutations that caused FK506 insensitivity of cycloheximide efflux.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The objectives were to find the optimizing condition to produce the maximum biofuel using a 2k factorial level experimental design and to study the kinetics of the reaction. The experiment was performed in a laboratory scale 70-mL micro-reactor, and the obtained biofuel from the cracking process was analyzed by simulated distillation gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the fuel properties and elemental analysis of the biofuel were characterized. The effects of the temperature (420-460 °C), reaction time (45-75 min), catalyst loading (1-5% by weight; wt%) and an initial hydrogen (H2) pressure (100-500 kPa) on biofuel and gasoline yield were analyzed by analysis of variance. The main parameters were the reaction temperature and time. The optimum conditions, derived from using the design-expert software, was a reaction temperature and time of 444.4 °C and 45.50 min, respectively, with 1 wt% catalyst and an initial H2 pressure of 100 kPa to obtain a maximum yield of 76.2 wt% biofuel with 24.0 wt% gasoline. The acid value was decreased 3.9-fold to 13.5 mgKOH g-1, whereas the heating value was increased 1.10-fold to 42.92 MJ kg-1, which is slightly lower than that for commercial diesel. The kinetics were determined based on experimental data for temperatures from 410 to 470 °C and best fitted to a second order rate with an apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor of 86.0 kJ mol-1 and 181.3 s-1, respectively. The possible reaction pathway commenced from the hydrolysis of triglyceride to heavy oxygenated compounds followed by carboxylation, carbonylation and hydrogenation to become heavy linear hydrocarbons (HCs), then the heavy linear HC might be thermally and catalytically cracked into middle or small paraffins and olefins.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

This series of PDAs provides a systematic increase of head group size and overall inter- and intramolecular interactions within the assemblies. The increase of head group size affects the packing parameter of diacetylene(DA) monomers, causing morphological change from spherical vesicles to rod-like structures. X-ray diffraction reveals that the size of the head group also dictates molecular tilting angle within the lamellar structure of DA assemblies. The monocarboxylic poly(PCDA) exhibits irreversible thermochromism. The incorporation of aromatic head groups in poly(PCDA-mBzA) and poly(PCDA-NPA) enhances the overall interactions within assemblies, resulting in reversible thermochromism. Furthermore, the size of aromatic head groups strongly affects the response time and color reversibility in thin film. Interestingly, the sensitivity of PDAs to chemical stimuli including cationic surfactants and organic solvents is found to vary with type of head group. The poly(PCDA-mBzA) is more sensitive to cationic surfactants compared to the system of poly(PCDA-NPA). An opposite result is observed when organic solvents, tetrahydrofuran and pyridine, are used as chemical stimuli.

Despite the advance in lung cancer therapy, the five-year survival rate is extremely restricted due to therapeutic failure and disease relapse. Targeted therapies selectively inhibiting certain molecules in cancer cells have been accepted as promising ways to control cancer. In lung cancer, evidence has suggested that the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) protein, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is a target for drug action. Herein, we report the Mcl-1 targeting activity of renieramycin T (RT), a marine-derived tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid that was isolated from the Thai blue sponge Xestospongia sp. RT was shown to be dominantly toxic to lung cancer cells compared to the normal cells in the lung. The cytotoxicity of this compound toward lung cancer cells was mainly exerted through apoptosis induction. For the mechanism of action, we found that RT mediated activation of p53 protein and caspase-9 and -3 activations. While others Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bak, and Bax) were minimally changed in response to RT, Mcl-1 protein was dramatically diminished. We further performed the cycloheximide experiment and found that the half-life of Mcl-1 was significantly shortened by RT treatment. When MG132, a potent selective proteasome inhibitor, was utilized, it could restore the Mcl-1 level. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that RT significantly increased the formation of Mcl-1-ubiquitin complex compared to the non-treated control. In conclusion, we report the potential apoptosis induction of RT with a mechanism of action involving the targeting of Mcl-1 for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. As Mcl-1 is critical for cancer cell survival and chemotherapeutic failure, this novel information regarding the Mcl-1-targeted compound would be beneficial for the development of efficient anti-cancer strategies or targeted therapies.",pharmacology,"Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)"

A liquid optical adhesive (NOA 61) was dropped on the circular flat surface of cylindrical substrates made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The formation of hemispherical optical prisms was accomplished by taking advantage of the sharp edges of cylindrical PDMS substrates that prevented the overflow of liquid NOA 61 at the edge of substrates. The size of the hemispherical optical prisms can be controlled by changing the diameter of the cylindrical PDMS substrates. After UV curing, the SPR sensor chips were obtained by the deposition of 3 nm thick chromium and 47 nm thick gold on the flat side of the prisms. The fabricated miniature SPR sensor chips were then mounted on a three-dimensional-printed flow cell to complete the microfluidic SPR sensor module. The miniature SPR sensor chips provided a comparable sensitivity to the conventional high-refractive-index glass SPR chips.

Patients were divided into 2 groups, younger (aged 18-49 years) and elderly (aged >60 years). The EEG was an index test. Reference standard, independently verified by 2 board-certified neurologists, was a clinical diagnosis of presence or absence of epilepsy/probable seizures. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to ascertain associated risk factors for epilepsy/probable seizures. Among 2187 total EEG recordings, 244 (11.16%) recordings were requested with indication of TUR. A total of 156 patients (50 younger and 106 elderly) were recruited for analysis. Prevalence of epilepsy/probable seizures in patients with TUR was 26.9%. Prevalence of interictal epileptiform discharges was 16% in the younger and 12.3% in the elderly. Overall diagnostic performance was poorer in the elderly. Associated risk factors for having seizures were presence of intermittent slow waves in the younger and presence of positive motor signs as well as presence of nonepileptiform abnormalities in the elderly. Prevalence of seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges was low in the elderly who manifests with TUR. Overall diagnostic performance of the EEG in diagnosing seizures was poorer in the elderly mainly due to low sensitivity.

TCF4 was discovered recently to be an obligatory master regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We postulated that a tissue-based assay designed to detect dual CD123 and TCF4 expression would provide a highly reliable and practical marker for BPDCN in biopsy material. We designed, optimized, and validated a dual-color TCF4/CD123 immunohistochemistry stain for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The performance characteristics of the TCF4/CD123 stain were evaluated in 48 confirmed BPDCN cases. TCF4/CD123 coexpression was detected reproducibly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In BPDCN, the TCF4/CD123 stain showed coexpression in all (48/48; 100%) cases analyzed. Cases with concurrent samples from different anatomic sites showed comparable staining characteristics. In contrast, of 464 non-BPDCN cases comprising a wide range of hematolymphoid neoplasms and cutaneous lesions that might enter in the differential diagnosis of BPDCN, we identified dual expression of TCF4 and CD123 in only 1 case of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. On the basis of these findings, the TCF4/CD123 dual-color immunohistochemical stain had an analytic sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.8%. Receiver operator characteristic analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 1.000 (95% confidence interval: 0.999-1.000). In summary, the dual-color TCF4/CD123 immunohistochemistry stain provides a robust standalone and cost-effective assay for the diagnosis of BPDCN.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; cells of the Immunologyne system; dendritic cells, medical","Anatomy, Surgery, Pathology and Forensic Medicine"
Analysis for T-stress of cracks in 3D anisotropic elastic media by weakly singular integral equation method,"Rungamornrat J., Sukulthanasorn N., Mear M.E.",2019-04-15,"Anisotropic material, BIEM, Crack faces, T stress, Weakly singular, Anisotropic materials, BIEM, Crack-face displacement, Cracks, T-stress, Weakly singular","This paper proposes an efficient numerical procedure for computing T-stresses of cracks in three-dimensional, linearly elastic, infinite media. The technique is established in a broad framework allowing a medium made of generally anisotropic materials and cracks of arbitrary shape and under general loading conditions to be treated. A pair of weakly singular, weak-form, displacement and traction boundary integral equations is utilized to formulate the key equations governing the unknown crack-face fields. Besides the basic benefits such as the reduction of spatial dimensions of the solution space and the efficient treatment of unbounded domains and remote boundary data, use of such integral equations in the formulation offers additional positive features including the computational simplicity resulting from the weakly singular nature of all involved integrals and the involvement of a complete set of crack-face displacement fields. A weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the special near-front approximation is utilized to solve for the unknown relative crack-face displacement whereas the sum of the crack-face displacement is obtained from the displacement boundary integral equation for cracks via the Galerkin technique. The latter step is one of the essential aspects of the present study that provides the direct means for determining the T-stress data in terms of the sum of the crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack-front. An extensive numerical study is conducted for various scenarios and a selected set of results is reported to demonstrate both the accuracy and capability of the proposed technique.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, physics, computer science","Computational Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computer Science Applications"

In this synthetic strategy based on the grafting from concept, sericin molecule acts as a bio-initiator where its hydroxyl groups existing in serine units. The effects of polymerization parameters, including reaction temperature, the concentration of catalyst and sericin, on the copolymer structure and properties were investigated. XPS spectra of SS-g-PLA copolymer showed C1S and N1S signals clearly and differed form that of the neat PLA. 2D HMBC NMR spectra showed correlation assigned to the carbon atom of PLA polymer chains and hydrogen atom in hydroxyl group of serine. Molecular weight of the graft copolymer by GPC was in range of 4000–5600 g mol−1. From soxhlet extraction, the results showed that PLA content in the graft copolymer molecules increased with increasing sericin content. The weight ratio of PLA to sericin in the SS-g-PLA5, SS-g-PLA10 and SS-g-PLA15 graft copolymers were 0.6:1, 1.4:1 and 2.1:1, respectively. By nitrogen analyzer,%protein increased significantly with increasing sericin content. Thermal analysis showed that the graft copolymer presented a single glass-transition temperature (Tg) belonging to PLA. This Tg decreased with increasing sericin content. The thermal degradation temperature (Td) of SS-g-PLA copolymer decreased to about 60 °C. Furthermore, SS-g-PLA is expected to utilize in biomedical applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science, chemistry","Physics and Astronomy (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Previous studies have reported that non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) could enhance the resistance of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei to a specific strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which carried a toxin-producing plasmid (VP AHPND ), via the induction of LvHSP70 transcription. Here, we further investigated the specific function of LvHSP70 in shrimp immunity. The upregulation of LvHSP70 at the protein level was detected during recovery time after NLHS treatment, using both western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that NLHS immediately activated the production of LvHSP70 in shrimp hemocytes and that such induction was observed in all three types of hemocytes: hyaline; granular and semi-granular cells. Furthermore, the role of LvHSP70 in bacterial defense was investigated using the heterologous expression of recombinant LvHSP70 (rLvHSP70) in Escherichia coli. Shrimp receiving rLvHSP70 by injection showed an increased survival rate (75%) to VP AHPND infection compared to just 20% survival in the control group injected with bovine serum albumin (BSA). We also demonstrated that the injected rLvHSP70 accumulated in shrimp hemocytes and was detected in the intracellular space of hemocyte cells leading to the induced expression (P<0.05) of several immune-related genes (LvMyD88, LvIKKβ LvIKKε LvCrustin I, LvPEN2, LvPEN3, LvproPO1, LvproPO2 and LvTG1). Collectively, these results suggest that LvHSP70 plays a crucial role in bacterial defense by activating the shrimp immune system.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

In addition, the influence of Notch signaling on osteogenic differentiation of human bone-derived cells was examined. Methods: Gene expression profiling of osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in vitro (GSE80614) and bone healing period of murine tibial fracture in vivo (GSE99388) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The expression of Notch signaling components was obtained from bioinformatic tools. Human bone-derived cells were isolated from alveolar and iliac bone. Cells were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surface. Osteogenic marker gene expression and mineralization were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and alizarin red s staining, respectively. Results: From bioinformatic analysis of gene expression profiling, various Notch signaling components were differentially expressed during osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in vitro and bone healing period of murine tibial fracture in vivo. The common genes differentially regulated of these two datasets were Hes1, Aph1a, Nsctn, Furin, Adam17, Hey1, Pcsk5, Nedd4, Jag1, Heyl, Notch3, Dlk1, and Hey2. For an in vitro analysis, the mineral deposition markedly increased after seeding human bone-derived cells on Jagged1 immobilized surface, correspondingly with the increase of ALP mRNA expression. Jagged1 treatment downregulated TWIST2 mRNA expression in both human alveolar and iliac bone-derived cells. Conclusion: Notch signaling is regulated during osteogenic differentiation and bone healing. In addition, the activation of Notch signaling promotes osteogenic differentiation in human alveolar and iliac bone-derived cells. Therefore, Notch signaling manipulation could be a useful approach for enhancing bone regeneration.","medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

In this study, suspensions of silica colloidal particles and polyethylene glycol fluid were prepared at varying volume fractions φ = 0.3 to 0.52 and their rheological behavior was investigated. It was found that the suspensions exhibited a Newtonian behavior for φ < 0.4, whilst a shear thinning followed by a thickening behavior could clearly be observed for φ > 0.4. Furthermore, the critical shear rates for the onset of shear thickening was found to decrease with increasing silica volume fraction but the corresponding critical shear stresses were independent of the volume fraction. To improve the ballistic protective performance, small amount of hard particles, such as alumina, were added into the silica suspension of φ = 0.5. It was shown that the critical shear rates of the reinforced-STFs decreased with increasing volume fraction and decreasing alumina particle size. However, higher thickening ratio was observed for the alumina additive with agglomerated structure and this ratio increased with increasing alumina volume fraction.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

One of the major factors affecting testicular descent is the androgen receptor (AR), which binds to androgen and then regulates the expression of androgen-responsive genes in the inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent. AR expression has been reported to regulate apoptosis in testicular stem cells. The present study aimed to immunohistochemically examine AR and Ki-67 protein expression and apoptosis detection in unilateral undescended testicles (UDT) and descended testicles in cryptorchid pigs (DT) of suckling (aged 1–2 weeks), nursery (aged 6 weeks) and growing-finishing pigs (aged 12, 15 and 20 weeks) and in normal testicles (NT) at 1–2 and 12 weeks of age. At 1–2 weeks, decreased expression of AR was observed in UDT and DT compared with NT and was lower than that at 6–20 weeks. The expression of Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, in UDT and DT at 12 weeks was lower than that in NT at the same age. In addition, Ki-67 expression in UDT at 6 and 12 weeks was lower than that in UDT at 1–2 and 15–20 weeks. More testicular apoptosis was revealed in UDT at 1–2 weeks than in DT and NT at the same age. At 15–20 weeks, more apoptosis was detected in UDT than in DT. Positive correlation of AR expression in DT at 6 and 12 weeks was also noted, in addition to the association of the expression of AR and Ki-67 in NT at 12 weeks. Taken together, this study unveiled the low expression of AR and high apoptosis detection in UDT, whereas low expression of AR and low apoptosis detection were noted in DT in suckling piglets. Diminished cell proliferation was shown in UDT at 6–12 weeks, whereas high apoptosis was observed in UDT at 15–20 weeks. High expression of AR was shown only in nursery pigs. Distinct expression of AR in DT and NT at 1–2 and 12 weeks indicated that both conditions were not interchangeable.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

However, the mechanisms by which this gonadotropin regulates cat folliculogenesis are still unclear. We investigated the responsiveness of cat ovarian follicles at different developmental stages to various eCG concentrations supplemented in vitro. Follicles were mechanically isolated from the ovaries of 22 cats and categorized into three developmental stages based on their morphology and diameter: 1) two-layered secondary follicle (SF), 100–150 μm (n = 139); 2) multi-layered SF, 150–300 μm (n = 154); and 3) early antral follicle (AF), ≥300–500 μm (n = 123). The follicles were then encapsulated in 0.5% (w/v) sodium alginate and cultured for 12 days in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.5 IU/mL eCG. Follicle and oocyte diameters were assessed every 3 days. On Day 12, mRNA expression levels of FHSR, LHCGR, GDF9, BMP15, CYP17A1, CYP19A1 and STAR were analyzed using real-time PCR. After being cultured for 12 days, follicle growth and mRNA expression of two-layered SF were not influenced by eCG at all concentrations (P > 0.05). However, the concentration of eCG at 0.05 IU/mL stimulated follicular growth and gene expressions in the multi-layered SF and early AF (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, the diameter of oocytes in the multi-layered SF and early AF treated with 0.05 IU/mL eCG was unchanged. Considering the mRNA expression, the level of STAR was enhanced in the early AF (P < 0.05) and tended to increase in the multi-layered SF (P = 0.08) cultured in 0.05 IU/mL eCG, whereas the expression of other genes was not affected. In sum, the responsiveness of cat follicles to eCG is apparent from the multi-layered SF stage onward. The eCG supplementation at 0.05 IU/mL appeared to be optimal for the follicle culture in the domestic cats.","endocrinology and metabolism; endocrine systems; anterior pituitary gland; gonadotropin(lh)(fsh), Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Results: G allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 variant was significantly higher in NBNC-HCC (49%) compared to healthy controls (32%), HBV-HCC (32%) and HCV-HCC (31%) (P < 0.001). T allele of TM6SF2 rs58542926 was more prevalent in NBNC-HCC (24%) than in healthy controls (8%), HBV-HCC (10%) and HCV-HCC (12%) (P < 0.001).

The surface morphology of fabrics revealed that the coatings thoroughly covered the fabrics. The assessment of the vertical burning test of thin material (UL-94 rating VTM 0) indicated that the flame retardancy of coated polyester fabrics was improved significantly as compared with the uncoated fabric. The self-extinguishing ability and anti-dripping behaviors of coated polyester fabrics were also enhanced markedly. The improvement of flame retardancy depends on the number of coating layers and the amount of APP. However, after washing, the flame retardancy decreases to some extent. The morphology of char exhibits the typical structure of intumescent char on coated fabrics. The assessment of mechanical properties revealed that the intumescent coating via layer-by-layer assembly did not deteriorate the strength of the fabric. The increasing number of coated layers leads to the slight increase of the breaking force of the fabric; however, the increasing number of layers and the increasing amount of prepared APP lead to increased rigidity of the fabrics.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Polymers and Plastics"

Therefore, we aimed to unravel the predictors for late post-ICH dementia (6 months after ICH event) in probable CAA patients. Methods: From a large consecutive MRI prospective cohort of spontaneous ICH (2006-2017), we identified probable CAA patients (modified Boston criteria) without dementia 6 months post-ICH. Cognitive outcome during follow-up was determined based on the information from standardized clinical visit notes. We used Cox regression analysis to investigate the association between baseline demographic characteristics, past medical history, MRI biomarkers, and late post-ICH dementia conversion (dementia occurred after 6 months). Results: Among 97 non-demented lobar ICH patients with probable CAA, 25 patients (25.8%) developed dementia during a median follow-up time of 2.5 years (IQR 1.5-3.8 years). Pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden, the presence of disseminated cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and higher total small vessel disease score for CAA were all independent predictors for late dementia conversion. Conclusion: In probable CAA patients presenting with lobar ICH, high WMH burden and presence of disseminated cSS are useful neuroimaging biomarkers for dementia risk stratification. These findings have implications for clinical practice and future trial design.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience, psychology, medical","Neuroscience (all), Clinical Psychology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Serial serum samples from 91 patients with HBeAg-negative CHB previously treated with PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir in a randomized trial were retrospectively analysed. HBV RNA quantification was examined by droplet digital PCR. At the end of 3 years post-treatment follow-up, maintained virological response (MVR, HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance were achieved in 37.4% (34/91) and 7.7% (7/91), respectively. Baseline serum HBV RNA concentrations correlated with HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA but did not correlate with HBsAg levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that pre-treatment HBV RNA and HBsAg were independently associated with MVR and HBsAg clearance. Baseline HBV RNA (cut-off 2.0 log10 copies/mL) had a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value in predicting MVR of 80.8% and 80.0%, respectively.

At week 12 during therapy, HBV RNA level ≥ 2 log10 copies/mL displayed high NPVs of achieving MVR and HBsAg clearance (95% and 100%, respectively). In conclusion, the measurement of HBV RNA prior to PEG-IFN-based therapy could identify patients with high probability of MVR. In addition, HBV RNA kinetics may serve as a promising “stopping rule” in patients infected with HBV genotypes B or C.","medical, Immunology","Hepatology, Virology, Infectious Diseases"
Who Should Get Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection after Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation?,"Malakorn S., Yang Y., Bednarski B.K., Kaur H., You Y.N., Holliday E.B., Dasari A., Skibber J.M., Rodriguez-Bigas M.A., Chang G.J.",2019-10-01,"Antineoplastic Agents, Chemoradiotherapy, Colectomy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Lymph Node Excision, Lymphatic Metastasis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, Neoplasm Staging, Pelvis, Prognosis, Rectal Neoplasms, Retrospective Studies, Lateral pelvic lymph node, Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, Multidisciplinary, Neoadjuvant chemoradiation, Pelvic side wall, Rectal cancer","BACKGROUND: Despite the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer, lateral pelvic lymph node recurrence is still an important problem. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the indication for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection in post neoadjuvant chemoradiation rectal cancer. DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected institutional database. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center from January 2006 through December 2017. PATIENTS: Patients who had rectal cancer with suspected lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis, who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was pathologic lateral pelvic lymph node positivity. INTERVENTIONS: The associations between lateral pelvic lymph node size on post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation imaging and pathologic lateral pelvic lymph node positivity and recurrence outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were analyzed. The mean lateral pelvic lymph node size before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation was 12.6 ± 9.5 mm and 8.5 ± 5.4 mm. The minimum size of positive lateral pelvic lymph node was 5 mm on post neoadjuvant chemoradiation imaging. Among 13 (20.3%) patients who had a <5 mm lateral pelvic lymph node after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, none were pathologically positive. Among 51 (79.7%) patients who had a ≥5 mm lateral pelvic lymph node after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, 33 patients (64.7%) were pathologically positive. Five-year overall survival and disease-specific survival were higher in the histologic lateral pelvic lymph node negative group than in the lateral pelvic lymph node positive group (overall survival 79.6% vs 61.8%, p = 0.122; disease-specific survival 84.5% vs 66.2%, p= 0.088). After a median 39 months of follow-up, there were no patients in the <5 mm group who died of cancer. There were no lateral compartment recurrences in the entire cohort. LIMITATIONS: Being a single-center retrospective study may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation lateral pelvic lymph node size ≥5 mm was strongly associated with pathologic positivity. No patients with size <5 mm had pathologically positive lymph nodes. Following lateral pelvic lymph node dissection, no patients with a positive lateral pelvic lymph node developed lateral compartment recurrence. Therefore, patients who have rectal cancer with clinical evidence of lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis and post-neoadjuvant chemoradiation lateral pelvic lymph node size ≥5 mm should be considered for lateral pelvic lymph node dissection at the time of total mesorectal excision.

The goal was to add value to the CFA (which is an industrial waste) while improving the mechanical properties of the NR. These NR–CFA and NR–CFAT composites were fabricated using the latex aqueous microdispersion method to ensure suitable dispersion of the filler. The mechanical properties of both composites, including tensile strength, elongation at break and Young’s modulus, were improved considerably at a filler content of 20 phr compared to the original NR. Adding CFA and CFAT increased these values to 10.5 MPa, 222% and 126 and 7.7 MPa, 315% and 21.4 MPa, respectively. NR–CFA and NR–CFAT composites also exhibited substantially higher structural stability in water with only minimal swelling, as well as better resistance to toluene. The NR–CFA composite film containing CFA at 20 phr was found to have the best structural stability, mechanical properties and resistance to solvents among the specimens tested.","environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

Silver microfibers of more than 2 cm long and 6600 aspect ratio were grown within 48 h. The influences of precursors on the generation of Ag microfiber during the galvanic reaction were systematically investigated. Concentration of Ag+ is a crucial parameter for the morphological control of the obtained silver microstructures (dendrites, pentagonal rods, microcubes and fibers). The kinetic growth transforms into thermodynamic growth when the concentration was increased from 0.005 M to 0.1 M. Nitrate ions facilitate the galvanic replacement reaction by promoting electron liberation from sacrificial aluminum metal. The obtained microfibers possess nano-interception provides the formation of hotspots within a fiber bundle, thereby presenting a promising substrate for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

The cellulose from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was extracted to prepare the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) used as the starting material for synthesizing CMC-based hydrogel for the selective adsorption of Cu(II) ions in contaminated solution. Hydrogel fabrication was performed under microwave-assisted irradiation, which helps to improve reaction efficiency and significantly reduces reaction time compared with using a conventional hotplate. The hydrogel of 25% CMC blended with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a cross-linking agent showed the property of selective adsorption for Cu(II) ions from the solution with an adsorption capacity of 2.3 mg/g (92.4% removal) under ambient temperature with pH 5.0. The adsorbed Cu(II) ions were effectively desorbed from the hydrogel by either 0.1 M HCl or 0.1 M EDTA. Thus, the prepared hydrogel could potentially be applied in the removal of Cu(II) ions from contaminated water, with promising potential for reuse after the regeneration process. Sugarcane bagasse was used as a starting material for the synthesis of hydrogel, which has selective adsorption property to Cu(II) ions. In addition, microwave-assisted irradiation, technology that is able to save time and energy, was exploited for the polymer synthesis.

Immunohistochemistry for ATRX Can Miss ATRX Mutations: Lessons from Neuroblastoma,"Chami R., Marrano P., Teerapakpinyo C., Arnoldo A., Shago M., Shuangshoti S., Thorner P.S.",2019-09-01,"Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, False Negative Reactions, Female, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Infant, Male, Mutation, Neuroblastoma, Reproducibility of Results, X-linked Nuclear Protein, Young Adult, ATRX, FISH, immunohistochemistry, neuroblastoma, SNP array, telomere","Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood with a median age of presentation of 17 months. A common theme in high-risk neuroblastoma is maintenance of telomeres, one mechanism for which involves alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT) associated with ATRX gene mutations. Mutations are believed to result in loss of ATRX protein, and therefore immunohistochemistry is used to detect mutations. We screened 133 cases of neuroblastoma by ATRX immunohistochemistry, and found 9 cases with partial to total absence of ATRX. Sequencing for ATRX mutations detected a mutation in 1 of 9 cases, suggesting immunostaining was not reliable for detecting mutations. To correlate immunostaining with ALT, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ALT was performed in 6 of these cases and 5 (from 4 patients) showed ALT, implying impaired ATRX protein function, despite the failure to identify a mutation. Two other cases with large deletions in the ATRX gene showed diffusely positive staining for ATRX protein but showed ALT by FISH. Four of the 6 patients with ALT-positive tumors were over 5 years old. Therefore, 29 additional patients 5 years old and above with ATRX-positive tumors were screened for ALT by FISH and 6 additional cases with ALT were detected, bringing the total to 29% (10/34) of children 5 years old and above, 70% of which showed positive ATRX immunohistochemistry. Patients with ATRX mutations in neuroblastoma tend to have a more chronic and progressive course of disease. Screening neuroblastoma tumors at diagnosis for ATRX mutations may help identify patients who might benefit from personalized therapy directed against ALT. However, relaying on negative immunohistochemistry for ATRX protein to identify ALT in neuroblastoma may miss a significant proportion of patients. The addition of FISH for ALT as part of the diagnostic workup, especially for older children (5 y old and above), would help ensure that patients are correctly identified for anti-ALT therapy.",medical,"Anatomy, Surgery, Pathology and Forensic Medicine"

The experiments were conducted at 8 MPa and at 277.2, 283.2, 288.2 and 293.2 K. The results show that the methane uptake increased with the increase in the experimental temperature due to at the fact that higher experimental temperature showed the multiple hydrate nucleation and effective heat distribution to the surrounding. The experiment at 277.2 K showed the fastest induction time and shortest time to reach 90% of the methane uptake (t90). The highest methane uptake was observed at 293.2 K. Moreover, the effects of experimental over pressure on the methane hydrate formation was investigated by varying the pressure from 8 to 4 MPa at 288.2 K. The result showed that the pressure did not affect the methane uptake but the rate of formation at the higher pressure is higher than at lower pressure. Furthermore, this work reports the synergistic effects of kinetic promotion of methane hydrate formation by coupling THF with methyl ester sulfonate (MES) at 293.2 K. The results showed that the presence of MES increases both induction time and rate of hydrate formation. The dissociation experiment was conducted after the formation by increasing the temperature to 308.2 K. The results showed that up to 98% of methane could be recovered.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; crudes; natural gas, natural gasoline and lpg, petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Apocynaceae is a clade of >5300 species with a worldwide distribution. A database representing >10 % of species in the family was used to explore the diversity of pollinators and evolutionary shifts in pollination systems across major clades and regions. Methods: The database was compiled from published and unpublished reports. Plants were categorized into broad pollination systems and then subdivided to include bimodal systems. These were mapped against the five major divisions of the family, and against the smaller clades. Finally, pollination systems were mapped onto a phylogenetic reconstruction that included those species for which sequence data are available, and transition rates between pollination systems were calculated. Key Results: Most Apocynaceae are insect pollinated with few records of bird pollination. Almost three-quarters of species are pollinated by a single higher taxon (e.g. flies or moths); 7 % have bimodal pollination systems, whilst the remaining approx. 20 % are insect generalists. The less phenotypically specialized flowers of the Rauvolfioids are pollinated by a more restricted set of pollinators than are more complex flowers within the Apocynoids + Periplocoideae + Secamonoideae + Asclepiadoideae (APSA) clade. Certain combinations of bimodal pollination systems are more common than others. Some pollination systems are missing from particular regions, whilst others are over-represented. Conclusions: Within Apocynaceae, interactions with pollinators are highly structured both phylogenetically and biogeographically. Variation in transition rates between pollination systems suggest constraints on their evolution, whereas regional differences point to environmental effects such as filtering of certain pollinators from habitats. This is the most extensive analysis of its type so far attempted and gives important insights into the diversity and evolution of pollination systems in large clades.","pollination and seed dispersal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Plant Science
Shear bond strength of resin cement to saliva-contaminated metal alloys after various surface treatments,"Surintanasarn A., Thamrongananskul N.",2019-01-01,"Aluminum oxide particles, Dental restorations, Metal alloys, Resin cement, Shear bond strength tests, Shear bond strengths, Surface pretreatment, Universal testing machines, Metal alloy, Resin cement, Saliva contamination, Shear bond strength","The bonding ability of resin cement to metal alloys of conventional dental restorations is critical for the retention and long-term survival rate. Contaminated saliva during try-in process which is resistant to simple water rinsing could reduce bond strength. Surface treatment before cementation might have an important role in optimizing resin-metal bond strength. The purpose of this study was to study the effect of surface pretreatment on the shear bond strength of dental base metal alloys after saliva contamination using a self-adhesive resin cement. Forty dental wax patterns (7-mm diameter) were made and cast with dental base metal alloy (Argeloy N.P. (V)). Cast metal specimens were embedded in PVC tube using self-curing acrylic resin and then flattened with 600-grit silicon carbide paper. PVC tube holders were specifically designed for the shear bond strength test device. Forty resin composite specimens were prepared in plastic mold (diameter of 3 mm and depth of 3 mm). The resin composite specimens were treated with sandblasting. Fifty-μm aluminum oxide particle was blasted for 10 seconds from the distance of approximately 5 mm perpendicular to the bonding surface. Metal alloy specimens were immersed in artificial saliva for 1 minute and rinsed with water-spray for 15 seconds. The specimens were also air-dried for 15 seconds. Specimens were divided into four groups, which received one of the following surface treatments: (1) No surface treatment (Control), (2) 37% phosphoric acid, (3) 37% phosphoric acid and then rinsed with 70% ethyl alcohol, and (4) 70% ethyl alcohol. After rinsing and drying, the resin composite specimens were cemented with Panavia SA Cement (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc., Okayama, Japan) at the center of metal alloy specimens followed by the manufacturer's instruction. Before testing, the specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for 24 hours. For testing, specimens were dried and mounted to universal testing machine (EZ-S, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) at the crosshead speed of 1 mm/minute. Failure loads was recorded in Newton (N) and then analyzed to Mega Pascal (MPa). The highest shear bond strength was observed for group 2 and 3. The failure mode in all the materials was adhesive failure which occurred at the resin-metal interface. Within the limitations of this study, phosphoric acid was effective in removing saliva contamination and enhancing bond strength at the resin-dental base metal interface.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Medical education was an additional responsibility for the clinicians who already had multi-dimensional roles in the healthcare system where there is acute shortage of healthcare professionals. We studied the impact of FDPs on postgraduate medical education in Bhutan. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study with a quantitative (cohort study - quasi-experimental with 18 participants) and concurrent explanatory qualitative component (focused group discussion (FGD) with 11 teaching faculty members). The 18 participants were given a structured FDP designed by the University. The FGD assessed teacher self-efficacy and competency using standard tools before and after the FDP. Thematic analysis of the FGD explored the impact of FDPs in the delivery of postgraduate residency programmes. Results: There were significant increase in the teacher self-efficacy (31 vs 34, p = 0.009) and competency scores (56 vs 64, p = 0.011). There were significant improvements in self-efficacy in the domain of the teaching relevant subject contents and developing creative ways to cope with system constraints. In teaching-learning assessments, there was a significant appreciation of the effectiveness of lectures and tutorials and the use of essay questions. The FGD demonstrated the acceptance of FDPs and its importance in quality improvement of postgraduate medical education, professional development of teachers and improvement of their communication skills. The teachers have now migrated from the conventional methods of teaching to workplace-based teaching and assessment. The FDPs also resulted in review and revision of postgraduate medical curriculum soon after the first batch graduated in 2018. Lack of adequate support from relevant stakeholders and lack of a medical education centre in the University were seen as major challenges. Conclusions: The FDPs have brought tangible professionalization of postgraduate medical education at an early stage of the medical university. There is a need for continued efforts to strengthen, sustain and consolidate the gains made thus far.",sociology,Education

As there are many applications in the same category and the competition is very high in the market, mobile development teams need to get user feedback on their applications so that they can improve quality of the applications. An important source of feedback is user review on App Store and Play Store from which the developers can analyze problems and recommendations for future maintenance and evolution of the applications. Since there might be a large number of user reviews for each release of a mobile application, this paper proposes an automated approach to classifying user reviews as bug reports or feature requests. These classification results are used as a basis for generating tickets for an issue tracking system, i.e. Jira. In user review classification, text classification, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and review metadata are used with several machine learning algorithms, i.e. Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble methods. The best classifiers for both categories of reviews are used further in an implementation of a Jira ticket generating tool. The tool considers semantic similarity of review comments and can filter out duplicate user reviews. When necessary, the tool applies text summarization to the user review to extract the title of a ticket for the corresponding bug report or feature request. The approach can facilitate the mobile development team in their maintenance task as the developers can pick the tickets and work on them to improve the application in a future release.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, medical, computer science","Control and Optimization, Health Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems"

The aim of this study was to assess the anatomical variations of AEA in Asian population. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 252 AEA identified by computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses. The multiplanar CT images were acquired from SOMATOM ® Definition AS+ and reconstructed to axial, coronal and sagittal view at 1 mm slice thickness. Results: 42.5% of AEA was within skull base (grade I), 20.2% at skull base (grade II) and 37.3% coursed freely below skull base (grade III). The prevalence of supraorbital ethmoid cell (SOEC) and suprabullar cell (SBC) was 29.8% and 48.0%. The position of AEA at skull base has significant association with SOEC (p < 0.001), but not with SBC (p = 0.268). Type I Keros was 42.1% and Type 11 Keros was 57.9%. When lateral lamella’s height is longer, the probability increases for AEA to course freely within the ethmoid sinus (p = 0.016). The mean distance of AEA from skull base was 1.93 ± 2.03 mm, orbital floor 21.91 ± 2.47 mm and nasal floor 49.01 ± 3.53 mm. Conclusions: The position of AEA at skull base depends on the presence of SOEC and length of lateral lamella, but not with SBC.

The effects of anionic surfactant types and their concentrations on the gelation mechanism and time of SF were systematically investigated. We found that SDS and STS that have long alkyl chain lengths and high negative charges could accelerate the gelation of SF to occur within 14–42 min in a concentration-dependent manner. SOS that has a short alkyl chain length and low negative charge slowly induced SF to gel at around 113–144 h. The mechanisms of SF gelation induced by these three anionic surfactants were supposed to be combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, as well as the self-transition of beta sheets. The SF + STS hydrogels were further employed to encapsulate curcumin for the controlled release application. The SF + 0.09% wt. STS hydrogel encapsulating curcumin showed a slow rate of degradation while sustained the release of curcumin. This hydrogel can be applied as a minimal invasive injectable hydrogel or as a hydrogel for topical treatment of diseases.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

It is found that the functional molecules that formed upon the caramelization of sugar enhance the performance of the PSF membranes in terms of their permeability as well as the hydrophilicity. Thus, the PSF-based flat sheet membranes were prepared by phase inversion technique with different additional amounts of caramel (i.e., 50 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg). The prepared membranes were characterized and their performance was evaluated by pure water flux, water uptake and contact angle measurements. Studies on the rejection and fouling properties of membranes in water treatment were carried out using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The modified membranes showed a significantly enhanced flux of ∼350 L/m2 h and the rejection of BSA was found to be 90%. It was also found that the antifouling capacity of the PSF membranes enhanced with caramel modification. Congo red removal using PSF-Caramel membrane was observed to be very effective in acidic conditions and the dye was able to be successfully recovered using ethanol. The membranes were reused for several times, which showed a consistent performance in flux and rejection of Congo red. Overall, the caramel modified membranes can open up new possibilities in enhancing the thermal, mechanical, hydrophilicity, water flux and antifouling properties of PSF membranes.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

At-risk breeds were identified if odds ratios were significant (P value '.05) across all comparison groups. Results: Of 258 898 urolith submissions, 124 285 were CaOx. Calcium oxalate was identified in 212 breeds. Twelve breeds were identified as high-risk breeds, and 14 breeds were identified as low-risk breeds. All high-risk breeds were small dog breeds, and all low-risk breeds were medium to large dog breeds. Overall, the mean age ± standard deviation of the first CaOx urolith was 8.4 ± 2.8 years. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: To achieve the health benefits of preclinical evaluation, breeds at high risk for CaOx urolithiasis should be screened at 5 to 6 years of age, which is 2 to 3 years before likely development of clinical urolithiasis.","urology and nephrology, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)

However, they are difficult to genomically modify due to their low transformation efficiencies. In this study, the Bacillus-E. coli shuttle vector pHY300PLK, which is widely used in gram-positive bacteria, was adopted for genome integration in organic solvent-tolerant Bacillus isolates. The Bacillus-replicative vector was used to deliver homologous recombinant DNA and propagate itself inside the host cell, increasing the likelihood of genome integration of the recombinant DNA. Then, the unintegrated vectors were cured by cell cultivation in antibiotic-free medium with facilitation of nickel ions. The developed protocol was successfully demonstrated and validated by the disruption of amyE gene in B. subtilis 168. With an improved clonal selection protocol, the probability of clonal selection of the amyE::cat genome-integrated mutants was increased up to 42.0 ± 10.2%. Genome integration in undomesticated, organic solvent tolerant Bacillus strains was also successfully demonstrated with amyE as well as proB gene creating the gene-disrupted mutants with the corresponding phenotype and genotype. Not only was this technique effectively applied to several strains of undomesticated B. subtilis, but it was also success-fully applied to B. cereus. This study validates the possibility of the application of Bacillus-replicative vector as well as the developed protocol in a variety of genome modification of undomesticated Bacillus species.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology","Microbiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
A game-based neurofeedback training system to enhance cognitive performance in healthy elderly subjects and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment,"Jirayucharoensak S., Israsena P., Pan-Ngum S., Hemrungrojn S., Maes M.",2019-01-01,"Aged, Attention, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Electroencephalography, Executive Function, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Memory, Short-Term, Neurofeedback, Neuropsychological Tests, Pattern Recognition, Visual, Treatment Outcome, Video Games, Aging, Amnestic mild cognitive impairment, Brain, Cognition, Computer interface, Executive functions, Neurofeedback, Serious gaming","Introduction: This study examines the clinical efficacy of a game-based neurofeedback training (NFT) system to enhance cognitive performance in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and healthy elderly subjects. The NFT system includes five games designed to improve attention span and cognitive performance. The system estimates attention levels by investigating the power spectrum of Beta and Alpha bands. Methods: We recruited 65 women with aMCI and 54 healthy elderly women. All participants were treated with care as usual (CAU); 58 were treated with CAU + NFT (20 sessions of 30 minutes each, 2–3 sessions per week), 36 with CAU + exergame-based training, while 25 patients had only CAU. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery both before and after treatment. Results: NFT significantly improved rapid visual processing and spatial working memory (SWM), including strategy, when compared with exergame training and no active treatment. aMCI was characterized by impairments in SWM (including strategy), pattern recognition memory, and delayed matching to samples. Conclusion: In conclusion, treatment with NFT improves sustained attention and SWM. Nevertheless, NFT had no significant effect on pattern recognition memory and short-term visual memory, which are the other hallmarks of aMCI. The NFT system used here may selectively improve sustained attention, strategy, and executive functions, but not other cognitive impairments, which characterize aMCI in women.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology
"In Schizophrenia, Increased Plasma IgM/IgA Responses to Gut Commensal Bacteria Are Associated with Negative Symptoms, Neurocognitive Impairments, and the Deficit Phenotype","Maes M., Kanchanatawan B., Sirivichayakul S., Carvalho A.F.",2019-04-15,"Adult, Antibodies, Bacterial, Case-Control Studies, Dicarboxylic Acids, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin M, Male, Malondialdehyde, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, B1 cells, Immune, Inflammation, Natural IgM, Oxidative stress, Psychiatry, Psychosis, Schizophrenia, TRYCATs","Increased gut permeability (leaky gut) with increased translocation of Gram-negative bacteria plays a role in the gut-brain axis through effects on systemic immune-inflammatory processes. Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to 5 Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic acid in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic acid with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.5%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic acid. There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

The electrochemical behavior of 8-HQ on the CoPc-modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The obtained results demonstrated that the CoPc-SPCE shows high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of 8-HQ. The oxidation potential was shifted to a negative value compared to those obtained from the unmodified electrode. Under the optimized experimental conditions, a good linear relationship between the 8-HQ concentration and the peak current was obtained within the range of 10–250 μM with a detection limit of 0.89 μM. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied for the determination of 8-HQ in cosmetic samples. According to a paired t-test, the results were in good agreement with results from the standard HPLC-UV method. The benefits of this proposed device are that it is easily fabricated, low cost, disposable, highly sensitive and reproducible.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

Since this method has high sensitivity and easy to prepare; however the cost of the enzyme is very expensive and the stability of the enzyme activity is poor which result in short lifetime. From those drawbacks of current pesticide sensor, non-enzymatic sensor is an alternative way to detect pesticide with lower cost, higher sensitivity and stability. In this work, copper oxide nanorods were used to overcome the difficulties of enzymatic pesticide sensor. To obtain cost effective and simple preparation pesticide sensor, direct anodization and annealing processes were used to synthesize copper oxide nanorods. We used our synthesized copper oxide nanorods in electrochemical analysis by performing cyclic voltammetry in organophosphate pesticide. Our copper oxide nanorods electrode exhibits sensitivity and detection limit of 1.234 μA/ng mL-1 and 0.0761 ng/mL, respectively. Our copper oxide nanorods electrode provides high sensitivity and desirable detection limit with higher stability and lower cost than the common enzyme-based pesticide sensor.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Bioengineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry, Condensed Matter Physics"

Nasal provocation test (NPT) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of LAR. Nasal eosinophilia is a known inflammatory marker in allergic rhinitis. We hypothesized that nasal eosinophilia can be used as a screening tool for LAR. Objective: To determine the applicability of nasal eosinophilia as a diagnostic tool for LAR. Methods: Forty-eight perennial nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) patients with SPT negative were recruited. Nasal cytology analysis was performed. NPTs with 3 allergens (mixed mites, mixed cockroaches, and Bermuda grass) were performed to diagnose LAR. Nasal symptoms combined with nasal patency were used to determine the results of NPT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of nasal eosinophilia as a diagnostic tool of LAR were calculated. Results: LAR was diagnosed in 41.6% of the NAR patients. Nasal eosinophilia was found in 58% of the NAR patients. The sensitivity of nasal eosinophilia for diagnosing LAR was 80%, the specificity was 57.14%, the positive predictive value was 57.14%, and the negative predictive value was 80%. The most common allergen of LAR was mixed mites. Conclusion: Nasal eosinophilia on nasal cytology was a good screening tool for diagnosing LAR because of its high sensitivity and simplicity of the procedure. Unfortunately, the low specificity of nasal eosinophilia makes the NPT necessary for confirmation of LAR.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Otorhinolaryngology"

SLNs are considered favorable candidates for drug delivery vehicles since their ability to store and release organic molecules can be tailored through the identity of the lipids and surfactants used. When stored, polymorphic transitions in the core of drug-loaded SLNs lead to the premature release of drug molecules. Significant experimental studies have been conducted with the aim of investigating the physicochemical properties of SLNs, however, no molecular scale investigations have been reported on the behaviors that drive SLN formation and their polymorphic transitions. A combination of small angle neutron scattering and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations is therefore used to yield a detailed atomistic description of the internal structure of an SLN comprising triglyceride, tripalmitin, and the nonionic surfactant, Brij O10 (C18:1E10). The molecular scale mechanisms by which the surfactants stabilize the crystalline structure of the SLN lipid core are uncovered. By comparing these results to simulated liquid and solid aggregates of tripalmitin lipids, how the morphology of the lipids vary between these systems is demonstrated providing further insight into the mechanisms that control drug encapsulation and release from SLNs.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biomaterials, Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all)"

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of salmon bone protein hydrolysate (SBPH). RESULTS: Salmon bones were hydrolyzed by separately using one of four proteases (Alcalase, Favourzyme, Neutrase and papain) at various concentrations (10, 25 and 50 mg mL−1), where the SBPH derived from 10 mg mL−1 papain hydrolysis exhibited the highest nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging activity. After ultrafiltration, the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction showed the strongest NO inhibitory activity and was further fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (G1 and G2 fractions) and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic fractionation of the G1 fraction, from which the three main peaks (H1, H2 and H3) were found to have a marked NO-inhibitory activity and their peptide sequences were determined. Moreover, the G1 fraction was shown to inhibit both the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and the LPS-induced inducible NO synthase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and induced NO production and the LPSCOX-2 mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Salmon bones from the salmon fisheries and farming industry were utilized by enzymatic hydrolysis for the production of valuable peptides.

The synergistic effects of the two additives on the mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the PLA/PBAT blend films were investigated. The influence of TEC content on the plasticized PLA films and the effect of TDI’s presence on the PLA/PBAT blend films were also studied by comparing them with neat PLA. The results showed a pronounced increase in elongation at break of the plasticized PLA films with increasing TEC levels, but a slight reduction in thermal stability. Also, the addition of TEC and TDI to the blend system not only synergistically enhanced the tensile properties and tensile-impact strength of the PLA/PBAT blends, but also affected their crystallinity and cold crystallization rate, a result of the improvement of interfacial interaction between PLA and PBAT, including the enhancement of their chain mobility. The synergy of the plasticization and compatibilization processes led to the improvement of tensile properties, tensile-impact strength, and compatibility of the blends, accelerating cold crystallization without affecting crystallization.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

CTF modulates the expression of regulatory proteins including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are essential for the homeostasis of the periodontium. Among the BMPs, BMP9 is one of the most potent osteogenic BMPs. It is yet unknown whether CTF affects the expression of BMP9 and mineralization. Here, we demonstrated that continuously applied CTF for only the first 6 hr stimulated the synthesis of BMP9 and induced mineral deposition within 14 days by human PDL cells. Stimulation of BMP9 expression depended on ATP and P2Y 1 receptors. Apyrase, an ecto-ATPase, inhibited CTF-mediated ATP-induced BMP9 expression. The addition of ATP increased the expression of BMP9. Loss of function experiments using suramin (a broad-spectrum P2Y antagonist), MRS2179 (a specific P2Y 1 receptor antagonist), MRS 2365 (a specific P2Y 1 agonist), U-73122 (a phospholipase C [PLC] inhibitor), and thapsigargin (enhancer of intracytosolic calcium) revealed the participation of P2Y 1 in regulating the expression of BMP9. This was mediated by an increased level of intracellular Ca 2+ through the PLC pathway. A neutralizing anti-BMP9 antibody decreased mineral deposition, which was stimulated by CTF for almost 45% indicating a role of BMP9 in an in vitro mineralization. Collectively, our findings suggest an essential modulatory role of CTF in the homeostasis and regeneration of the periodontium.","genergyal, biochemistryistry","Physiology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"

Prenatal echocardiography was available in 52 cases, showing 85% correlation with autopsy findings. Defects missed by echocardiography were generally of mild severity. Conclusion: Postmortem examination is important to delineate the anatomy of CHDs, and recognize extracardiac malformations for identification of possible genetic syndromes. This information can be used for parental counseling and for assessment of accuracy of pre-mortem imaging studies.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Pathology and Forensic Medicine"
Production of biogas from cassava wastewater using a three-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor,"Jiraprasertwong A., Maitriwong K., Chavadej S.",2019-01-01,"Anaerobic process, Cassava wastewater, High productivity, Mesophilic temperature, Methane production, Process performance, Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, Upflow anaerobic sludge blankets, Cassava wastewater, Hydrogen and methane production, Mesophilic temperature, Three-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)","In this study, a three-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) system was developed and tested for hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) production from cassava wastewater with an emphasis on CH4 production. The experiment was carried out at mesophilic temperature (37 °C) at different chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rates from 5 to 18 kg/m3d (based on total liquid holding volume) with a recycle ratio of the final effluent to both the first and second bioreactors at a constant 1: 1 flow rate ratio of feed: final effluent. The first bioreactor was maintained pH at 5.5 while those of the other two bioreactors were not controlled. At an optimum COD loading rate of 15 kg/m3d, the system provided the highest COD removal level (92.5%) and the highest H2 and CH4 yields of 0.43 mL H2/g COD applied, and 328 mL CH4/g COD applied, respectively. The very high productivity of CH4 with the very low H2 productivity resulted from the recycled methanogen sludge from the third bioreactor to the first and second bioreactors. The process performance of the three-stage UASB system in terms of optimum COD loading rate and total energy yield was much higher than those of single and two-stage anaerobic processes.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"
Relation of lumbar sympathetic chain to the open corridor of retroperitoneal oblique approach to lumbar spine: an MRI study,"Mahatthanatrakul A., Itthipanichpong T., Ratanakornphan C., Numkarunarunrote N., Singhatanadgige W., Yingsakmongkol W., Limthongkul W.",2019-04-01,"Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aorta, Biometry, Female, Humans, Intervertebral Disc, Lumbar Vertebrae, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures, Psoas Muscles, Retroperitoneal Space, Spinal Fusion, Lumbar sympathetic chain, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Minimally invasive surgical approach, Oblique corridor, Oblique lumbar interbody fusion","Background: Retroperitoneal oblique approach to lumbar spine used surgical corridor between psoas muscle and aorta for exposure to anterior part of lumbar spine. Lumbar sympathetic chain (LSC) runs in the corridor to make it a structure at risk of injury. Research question: Does LSC relationship with surgical corridor for minimally invasive retroperitoneal anterolateral oblique approach change in different intervertebral disc level? Methods: Left LSC was identified in axial magnetic resonance imaging images at L2–3, L3–4 and L4–5 intervertebral disc levels of 144 patients. Distances between LSC and left psoas muscle and aorta were recorded. Results: Mean age of the patients was 62.3 years. LSC was identifiable in 90.9% of levels. Distance between LSC and psoas muscle at L2–3, L3–4 and L4–5 was 4.0 mm, 4.7 mm and 5.2 mm. Statistical difference was found between L2–3 and L4–5 level (p = 0.006). Distance between LSC and aorta at each level was 12.4 mm, 12.3 mm and 10.6 mm without statistical difference. In non-scoliosis group distance between LSC and psoas muscle at each level was 3.1 mm, 3.3 mm and 4.0 mm. Statistical difference was found between L2–3 and L4–5 level (p = 0.012) and between L3–4 and L4–5 level (p = 0.041). Distance between LSC and aorta at each level was 11.9 mm, 11.4 mm and 10.2 mm. Statistical difference was found between L2–3 and L4–5 disc level (p = 0.039). Conclusion: LSC moves away from psoas muscle and becomes closer to aorta in L4–5 disc level.

Progesterone receptor isoform B expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells decreases cell proliferation,"Asavasupreechar T., Saito R., Edwards D.P., Sasano H., Boonyaratanakornkit V.",2019-06-01,"Adult, Cell Line, Cell Proliferation, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Neuroendocrine Cells, Neuroendocrine Tumors, Receptors, Progesterone, Isoform-specific antibody, Progesterone receptor isoforms A and B, Pulmonary neuroendocrine cell","The progesterone receptor (PR) has been reported to play important roles in lung development and function, such as alveolarization, alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and upper airway dilator muscle activity. In the lung, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are important in the etiology and progression of lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Women with lung NETs had significantly better survival rates than men, suggesting that sex steroids and their receptors, such as the PR, could be involved in the progression of lung NETs. The PR exists as two major isoforms, PRA and PRB. How the expression of different PR isoforms affects proliferation and the development of lung NETs is not well understood. To determine the role of the PR isoforms in PNECs, we constructed H727 lung NET cell models expressing PRB, PRA, Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) (control). The expression of PRB significantly inhibited H727 cell proliferation better than that of PRA in the absence of progestin. The expression of the unrelated protein, GFP, had little to no effect on H727 cell proliferation. To better understand the role of the PR isoform in PNECs, we examined PR isoform expression in PNECs in lung tissues. A monoclonal antibody specific to the N-terminus of PRB (250H11 mAb) was developed to specifically recognize PRB, while a monoclonal antibody specific to a common N-terminus epitope present in both PRA and PRB (1294 mAb) was used to detect both PRA and PRB. Using these PR and PRB-specific antibodies, we demonstrated that PR (PRA&PRB) and PRB were expressed in the PNECs of the normal fetal and adult lung, with significantly higher PR expression in the fetal lung. Interestingly, PRB expression in the normal lung was associated with lower cell proliferation than PR expression, suggesting a distinct role of PRB in the PNECs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PR and PR isoform signaling in lung NET cells may help in developing novel therapeutic strategies that will benefit lung NET patients in the future.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"
The emergence of avian orthoavulavirus 13 in wild migratory waterfowl in china revealed the existence of diversified trailer region sequences and hn gene lengths within this serotype,"Fei Y., Liu X., Mu J., Li J., Yu X., Chang J., Bi Y., Stoeger T., Wajid A., Muzyka D., Sharshov K., Shestopalov A., Amonsin A., Chen J., Zhu D., Ding Z., Yin R.",2019-07-01,"Animal Migration, Animals, Animals, Wild, Avulavirus, Avulavirus Infections, Chickens, China, Ducks, Geese, Genome, Viral, HN Protein, Phylogeny, RNA, Viral, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Serogroup, Avian orthoavulavirus 13, Genetic relationships, HN gene, Migratory waterfowl, Trailer","Avian orthoavulavirus 13 (AOAV-13), also named avian paramyxovirus 13 (APMV-13), has been found sporadically in wild birds around the world ever since the discovery of AOAV-13 (AOAV-13/wild goose/Shimane/67/2000) in a wild goose from Japan in 2000. However, there are no reports of AOAV-13 in China. In the present study, a novel AOAV-13 virus (AOAV-13/wild goose/China/Hubei/V93-1/2015), isolated from a wild migratory waterfowl in a wetland of Hubei province of China, during active surveillance from 2013 to 2018, was biologically and genetically characterized. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated a very close genetic relationship among all AOAV-13 strains, as revealed by very few genetic variations. Moreover, pathogenicity tests indicated that the V93-1 strain is a low virulent virus for chickens. However, the genome of the V93- 1 virus was found to be 16,158 nucleotides (nt) in length, which is 12 nt or 162 nt longer than the other AOAV-13 strains that have been reported to date. The length difference of 12 nt in strain V93- 1 is due to the existence of three repeats of the conserved sequence, “gAAAAAT”h, in the 5′-end trailer of the genome. Moreover, the HN gene of the V93-1 virus is 2,070 nt in size, encoding 610 aa, which is the same size as the AOAV-13 strain from Japan, whereas that of two strains from Ukraine and Kazakhstan are 2,080 nt in length, encoding 579 aa. We describe a novel AOAV-13 in migratory waterfowl in China, which suggests that diversified trailer region sequences and HN gene lengths exist within serotype AOAV-13, and highlight the need for its constant surveillance in poultry from live animal markets, and especially migratory birds.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"
The relationship between heavy equipment cost efficiency and cleaner production in construction,"Carmichael D.G., Shen X., Peansupap V.",2019-02-20,"Cleaner production, Construction operations, Construction practice, General coincidence, Industry Perceptions, Optimum, Sustainable practices, Unit cost, Construction operations, General coincidence, Optimum, Unit cost, Unit emissions","Attitudes in the construction industry towards emissions and cleaner production are mixed. Many in the industry do not measure their emissions, or show awareness or progress towards minimizing emissions, but rather focus on more traditional matters of time, cost and production. Some writers suggest cost, or an industry perception of extra cost, as a main barrier to implementing more sustainable practices. There has been a slow shift to a sustainability mindset, but commonly this shift is only embarked upon if there are parallel cost savings. A realistic business view is that sustainability in the construction industry will only be achieved if parallel cost reductions occur. Within this debate, the paper puts forward the proposition and shows that, for a defined type of construction operation, performing at minimum unit cost (cost per production) also leads to minimizing unit emissions (emissions per production). The implication of this is that, within an existing operation, least unit emissions can be achieved without an increase in unit cost; alternatively, traditionally efficient ways of undertaking construction have the least environmental impact. Conversely, not operating at minimum unit cost leads to unnecessary emissions. The paper demonstrates this on an array of construction practices, and opines that similar results will hold for related construction operations.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Relationship between vegetation indices and SPAD values of waxy corn using an unmanned aerial vehicle,"Jermthaisong P., Kingpaiboon S., Chawakitchareon P., Kiyoki Y.",2019-01-01,"Agricultural productions, Chlorophyll contents, Chlorophyll meters, High-accuracy, Leaf concentrations, Management zones, Vegetation index, Waxy corn, SPAD Chlorophyll Meter, UAV, Vegetation Indices, Waxy Corn","The amount of chlorophyll in a plant can indicate leaf N concentration, as chlorophyll is a major component of nitrogen. Identifying chlorophyll levels in plants, therefore, leads to appropriate nitrogen fertilizer recommendations for the plants and to their fertilization at the proper time, optimizing efficiency of agricultural production and helping to preserve the environment by reducing excess use of nitrogen fertilizer. Measuring leaf N concentration in a high accuracy laboratory is expensive and time consuming, whereas a SPAD chlorophyll handheld meter can be carried conveniently in the field and can assess rapidly. However, the handheld meter's capacity is limited, especially in large areas, where samples must be taken to represent an area. The use of vegetation indices calculated from UAV imagery and correlated with SPAD values enables better estimations of N leaf concentrations over large areas. The result showed that relationship between NDVI and SPAD value (chlorophyll contents) of waxy corn (Zea mays L. var. ceratina) at V6 and R1 stage in R 2 were 0.594 and 0.632, respectively. The results of this study are beneficial for knowing the amount of chlorophyll in plants, which can result in accurate nitrogen fertilizer requirements and better administration of management zones in precision agriculture.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence
Feasibility and sustainability analyses of carbon dioxide – hydrogen separation via de-sublimation process in comparison with other processes,"Yurata T., Lei H., Tang L., Lu M., Patel J., Lim S., Piumsomboon P., Chalermsinsuwan B., Li C.",2019-08-30,"CO2 removal, Cryogenic separation, Cryogenic temperatures, Hydrogen purification, Peng-Robinson equation of state, Petrochemical process, Pressure swing adsorption, Sustainability analysis, CO2 removal, Cryogenic separation, De-sublimation, Hydrogen purification, Phase equilibrium","Hydrogen (H2) plays a vital role both as a reactant in petrochemical processes and as an energy carrier and storage medium. When produced from carbon-containing feed stocks, such as fossil fuels and biomass, hydrogen is typically produced as a mixture with carbon dioxide (CO2), and must be subsequently separated by the associated energy, with an invertible energy penalty. In this study, the process for the removal of carbon dioxide from CO2 - H2 mixtures by de-sublimation was analysed. This process is particularly relevant to the production of liquid hydrogen (LH2) at cryogenic temperatures, for which cooling of the H2 stream is already necessary. The solid – gas equilibrium of CO2 - H2 was studied using the Peng-Robinson equation of state which provided a wide range of operating conditions for process simulation. The de-sublimation process was compared with selected conventional separation processes, including amine-based absorption, pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation. In the scenario in which the resulting products, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, were subsequently liquefied for transportation and storage at 10 bar and −46 °C, and 1 bar and −251.8 °C, respectively. The overall energy consumption per kg of CO2 separated (MJ/kgCO2), was found to follow the order: 8.19–11.21 for monoethanolamine (MEA) absorption; 1.81–8.93 for membrane separation; 1.53–5.69 for pressure swing adsorption; and 0.81–3.35 de-sublimation process. Each process was evaluated and compared on the bases of electricity demand, cooling water usage, high-pressure steam usage, and refrigeration energy requirements. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages were discussed and the feasibility and sustainability of the processes for application in the production of liquid hydrogen were assessed.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Separating memoranda in depth increases visual working memory performance,"Chunharas C., Rademaker R.L., Sprague T.C., Brady T.F., Serences J.T.",2019-01-01,"Adult, Analysis of Variance, Attention, Color Perception, Cues, Depth Perception, Female, Humans, Male, Memory, Short-Term, Mental Recall, Photic Stimulation, Visual Perception, Young Adult, Depth perception, Memory biases, Visual working memory","Visual working memory is the mechanism supporting the continued maintenance of information after sensory inputs are removed. Although the capacity of visual working memory is limited, memoranda that are spaced farther apart on a 2-D display are easier to remember, potentially because neural representations are more distinct within retinotopically organized areas of visual cortex during memory encoding, maintenance, or retrieval. The impact on memory of spatial separability in depth is less clear, even though depth information is essential to guiding interactions with objects in the environment. On one account, separating memoranda in depth may facilitate performance if interference between items is reduced. However, depth information must be inferred indirectly from the 2-D retinal image, and less is known about how visual cortex represents depth. Thus, an alternative possibility is that separation in depth does not attenuate between-items interference; it may even impair performance, as attention must be distributed across a larger volume of 3-D space. We tested these alternatives using a stereo display while participants remembered the colors of stimuli presented either near or far in the 2-D plane or in depth. Increasing separation in-plane and in depth both enhanced performance. Furthermore, participants who were better able to utilize stereo depth cues showed larger benefits when memoranda were separated in depth, particularly for large memory arrays. The observation that spatial separation in the inferred 3-D structure of the environment improves memory performance, as is the case in 2-D environments, suggests that separating memoranda in depth might reduce neural competition by utilizing cortically separable resources.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems"

Given limited evidence on potential relationship between the TXA and improvement of pain control and functional outcome after TKA, this study aimed at comparing the blood loss, pain scores, morphine consumption, and knee flexion across the TXA administration routes. Methods: The 228 primary TKA were randomized into no TXA use (No-TXA), intra-articular TXA (15 mg/kg) use (IA-TXA), and intravenous TXA (10 mg/kg) use (IV-TXA). A multivariate regression analysis was used for comparing perioperative blood loss (PBL), drain output, average number of units of blood transfused (ANUBT), visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain, amount of morphine consumption, and knee flexion angle. Results: The IA-TXA and IV-TXA group had 193.26 (P <.01) and 160.30 mL (P <.01) less PBL than No-TXA, respectively. No-TXA significantly required higher ANUBT than IA-TXA and IV-TXA (P =.03). The IA-TXA group had lower VAS at 6 (P =.04), 12 (P =.03), and 24 hours (P =.02) postoperative when compared to No-TXA, while IV-TXA had no effect. The IA-TXA required 18.26 mg less total morphine at 48 hours than No-TXA (P =.02), whereas IV-TXA used insignificantly (5.31 mg; P =.31) less total morphine at 48 hours than No-TXA. Both TXA routes tended to improve knee flexion, but not statistically significant. Conclusion: Both IA-TXA and IV-TXA could significantly reduce PBL and ANUBT. The IA-TXA could significantly mitigate VAS and morphine use after TKA. Hence, IA-TXA could minimize blood loss and may be considered as an adjunct to pain control following TKA.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of daytime somnolence and night-time sleep disturbances; to characterise the night-time sleep disturbance in patients with daytime somnolence; and to determine the correlation between daytime somnolence and night-time sleep disturbances. Methods: One hundred and sixty patients with PD were included in the study. Each patient completed the Thai version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and the PD Sleep Scale version-2 (PDSS-2) questionnaire to evaluate night-time sleep disturbance. Subjective sleep information and details about the presence or absence of sleep attack (SA) were also obtained from the patients. Results: The types of daytime somnolence found in this study were EDS, SA, and combination of EDS and SA (EDS + SA) with the prevalence rates of 22.5, 3.1 and 6.3%, respectively. The prevalence of night-time sleep disturbance was 46.9%. The most common nocturnal disturbance (82.5%) was ""get up at night to pass urine"". There was a significant positive correlation between the ESS score and PDSS-2 total score with a correlation coefficient of 0.16 (p = 0.043). Patients with ""EDS + SA"" were the most affected by nocturnal disturbances, as they represented the largest group among those patients with night-time disturbances and had the highest PDSS-2 total score (p < 0.05). Conclusion: There are differences in nocturnal sleep disturbances among PD patients with different types of daytime somnolence. The significant positive correlation between the ESS and the PDSS-2 total scores suggests that night-time sleep disturbance may influence daytime somnolence.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

However, a tester can generate test cases to verify accuracy of information in the business process. Previously, many researchers have focused on BPMN test cases generation. None of their studies has been conducted on the creation of BPMN test cases with DMN. Consequently, this paper proposes an approach to generate test cases from BPMN with DMN. BPMN along with DMN, paths traverse from the entry to the exit of the BPMN, and existing test cases are inputs of our approach. BPMN, DMN, and existing test cases are analyzed to check whether they cover all rules in the DMN. In case that all rules are not covered, new test cases will be generated. This paper proposes an approach to generate test cases cover all rules in the DMN to effective monitoring BPMN with DMN. This approach is used to check the rules within the DMN decision table without affecting BPMN process. It ensures the business processes are implemented correctly.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
"Genetic characterization of duck Tembusu virus in Thailand, 2015-2017: Identification of a novel cluster","Ninvilai P., Tunterak W., Oraveerakul K., Amonsin A., Thontiravong A.",2019-09-01,"Animals, Ducks, Flavivirus, Flavivirus Infections, Phylogeny, Poultry Diseases, Thailand, duck Tembusu virus, ducks, genetic characterization, Thailand","Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) infected cases have increasingly been observed in several duck farms in Thailand since its first report in 2013. However, information on the genetic characteristic of DTMUVs recently circulating in ducks in Thailand is limited. In this study, we investigated the geographic distribution and genetic characteristic of DTMUVs recently circulating in ducks in Thailand during 2015–2017. Of the 288 clinical samples obtained from 89 ducks farms located in duck raising areas of Thailand, 65 samples (22.57%) of 34 duck farms (38.20%) were DTMUV positive. Our results demonstrated that DTMUV was extensively distributed in duck raising areas of Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of the E and NS5 genes revealed that DTMUVs circulating in Thailand were divided into three distinct clusters, including cluster 1, subcluster 2.1 and a novel cluster 3. Among these three clusters, subcluster 2.1 was a predominant cluster of DTMUV circulating in duck populations in Thailand during 2015–2017. It is interesting to note that a novel cluster of DTMUV (cluster 3), which was genetically different from any of the previously reported DTMUV clusters, was first identified in this study. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the circulation of different clusters of DTMUV and the presence of a novel DTMUV cluster in ducks in Thailand. This study highlights the high genetic diversity of DTMUVs in Thailand and the necessity of the routine surveillance of DTMUV for early detection, prevention and control of newly emerging DTMUVs.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Matching precision of the reverse contralateral radial head in generating of the individualized prosthesis from the surface registration in tuberosity-neck and in tuberosity-diaphysis,"Luenam S., Vongvanichvathana A., Kosiyatrakul A., Kongphanich C., Chanpoo M., Koonchornboon T., Phakdeewisetkul K., Lohwongwatana B., Puncreobutr C.",2019-01-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cadaver, Diaphyses, Elbow Joint, Elbow Prosthesis, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Fitting, Prosthesis Implantation, Radius, Reconstructive Surgical Procedures, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, individualized prosthesis, matching, radial head, reverse engineering, surface registration","Purpose: Following the radial head replacement, the surface mismatches between the implants and the morphological characteristics of the original proximal radius decreased contact areas and increased contact forces which is potential for the long-term articulating cartilage wear. Several studies demonstrated that the individualized prosthesis, created from computed tomographic (CT) images of the contralateral side with the reverse engineering technology, may reduce the mismatch. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the matching precision of the reverse contralateral head between the surface registration in tuberosity-neck (TN) area and in tuberosity-diaphysis (TD) area. Materials and Methods: High-resolution CT scan of 11 pairs of the cadaveric arms was performed. Utilizing advanced image processing techniques, three-dimensional (3-D) models of each specimen was generated. The model of the left side was reversed and matched with the model of the right side in the same cadaver by registering in the area of radial neck along with tuberosity (TN) and in the area of radial tuberosity combined with 2 cm of proximal diaphysis (TD). The alteration of the head diameter, dish diameter, articular depth, head thickness, end-plane angle, offset, and head volume were evaluated and analyzed by paired t-test. Results: No statistically significant difference was found in all parameters from both TN and TD registrations (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The surface registration in either TN or TD area can generate the statistically symmetrical 3-D model with the original head. The registration in these areas may possibly be used in creating the individualized radial head prosthesis.","orthopedic surgery, medical",Surgery

One possible approach is using the Home Energy Management System (HEMS) to monitor and manage the electrical usage at residential user. One useful feature of HEMS is the capability of detecting and identifying electrical appliances in order to assign these appliances to join many saving energy programs such as Time-Of-Use or Demand Response. In this paper, we propose an appliance classification approach based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique. KNN is extensively used classification algorithm owing to its simplicity, ease of implementation and effectiveness. The inputs we used to calculate the Euclidean distance in KNN are the root mean square (RMS) of voltage, current and the active power of appliance. We also implement a HEMS prototype includes many smart plug-in devices and a MQTT server. The appliance classification results show that our KNN classifier can be a suitable approach for appliance classification feature of HEMS.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computational Mechanics, Control and Systems Engineering, Instrumentation"

Printed images with varied edge enhancement filtering weights of four objects in everyday life were evaluated by observers in psychophysical experiment. By data analysis, it was found that three quality attributes such as image quality, detail expression and naturalness were sufficient to represent perceptual quality of images, by which they would probably influence in final decision of Like and Dislike of images. 5 stage-estimation indicated that there was a sensation limit based on these three attributes, depending on each object. The observers were able to some extent to differentiate the perceptual quality of printed images due to easy recognition of their clues. The relationship between the estimated data of three attributes and likeness preference was established. This finding could predict the likeness preferences of mixed objects in printed images for chosen edge enhancement filtering weight.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

New behaviors and activities that may have not been considered before in the design of architectural building types are now commonly found in public and private spaces throughout the world. In an attempt to explore and experiment with the concept of interplay between digital and physical environments, an option studio was proposed to 4th year architecture students to develop a new type of augmented architecture that corresponds to changes in human social behavior due to digital technologies. Five pilot projects are presented with experiments conducted to question three social activities commonly found in everyday lives using Arduino prototypes installed in real physical locations.

However, as the business process continue to develop iteratively, the business rules are likely to explode considerably. This usually leads to an inadvertently error-prone design of the business process. Therefore, some designers employ a visualization technique to help them comprehend the decision tables more profoundly and mitigate the design errors. This paper proposes a scheme to visualize the decision tables using Petri nets. A Petri net is a formal method that is used to illustrate business flows and decision paths of the decision table. Our method starts with defining a set of rules which transforms a decision table into a Petri net model. Next, the table is transformed into a Petri net model. This transforming process often disclose inconsistent rules and redundant rules. After refining the table and obtaining a final model, a simulation tool is then used to animate the Petri net model. This allows the designers to verify the internal working of the decision table, identify its flaws, and fix the errors more precisely.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Anonymity and commitment: how do Kierkegaard and Dreyfus fare in the era of Facebook and “post-truth”?,Hongladarom S.,2019-06-01,"Anonymity, Commitment, Dreyfus, Kierkegaard, Public, Rationality, Anonymity, Commitment, Dreyfus, Education, Kierkegaard, Press, Public, Rationality","This paper looks at the situation first described by Dreyfus (Educ Philos Theory 34(4):369–378, 2002) in his seminal paper, in order to find out whether and, if so, to what extent the use of Internet in education is still characterized by anonymity and commitment in today’s social media and ‘post-truth’ era. Current form of web technology provides an occasion for us to rethink what the Press and the Public, two main Kierkegaardian themes, actually consist in. The very ease and rapidity of how information is shared and the blurring of the line between journalists and consumers have made it very difficult to find where the Public actually is so that one can conform one’s own thoughts and beliefs to it. In addition, an effect of social media is that the Public does not seem to be monolithic, but has splintered into many smaller groups, each one overlapping with one another in a highly complex way. In Kierkegaard’s time the Press consisted of nothing more than a rather small number of newspapers, but now we have countless number of sources of information, so much so that it is almost impossible to see where the Press actually is. This situation has a way of diluting Kierkegaard’s contention that it is the Press that anonymized the people, rending them faceless and eliminating their individuality. Furthermore, the effect of Facebook is such that, not only does one still retain much of one’s commitment, but the commitment can be very passionate. As Petrik et al. (Ethics Inf Technol 16:275–284, 2014) have pointed out, it is possible for someone to be passionately committed to something while remaining very active on the Internet. This shows that the direction can go both ways. On the one hand, fragmenting the Public can go along with lack of commitment and other ills that Kierkegaard mentioned. On the other hand, fragmenting the Public, thereby creating many smaller groups existing in the online world (such as Facebook groups) can also bring about specific and well-directed commitments than would be possible if the Public remained a single monolithic entity. Furthermore, Kierkegaard’s insistence on lack of commitment by the Public seems to foretell the current malaise of what is known as ‘post-truth’. For Dreyfus the Internet is ultimately responsible for this. Indeed, however, both lack of commitment and too much commitment seem to be both responsible. A way out of this is proposed where a commitment to rational and critical thought is needed.","arts, computer science","Philosophy, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence"

This study evaluated a CS/DA scaffold with and without seeded primary human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) in its capacity to regenerate bone in calvarial defects of mice. The osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs was analyzed by bone nodule formation and gene expression. In vivo bone regeneration was analyzed in mice calvarial defects. Eighteen mice were divided into 3 groups: one group with empty defects, one group with defects with CS/DA scaffold, and a group with defects with CS/DA scaffold and with hPDLCs. After 6 and 12 weeks, new bone formation was assessed using microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) and histology. CS/DA scaffold significantly promoted in vitro osteoblast-related gene expression (RUNX2, OSX, COL1, ALP, and OPN) by hPDLCs. Micro-CT revealed that CS/DA scaffolds significantly promoted in vivo bone regeneration both after 6 and 12 weeks (p < 0.05). Histological examination confirmed these findings. New bone formation was observed in defects with CS/DA scaffold; being similar with and without hPDLCs.

With different breathing conditions of patients, the flow pattern might not cause the aerosol to transport and deposit on the desired bronchial section. In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations based on the Euler–Euler method were successfully used to evaluate the airflow behavior when an electrostatic charge was present. The three-dimensional domain was acquired and derived from the computed tomography scan of the patient. Three breathing frequencies were investigated. The instantaneous contour plot revealed that the particles migrated to the wall since charged particles will move from the high to the low potentials. It was found that the variation of the breathing frequency plays a significant role on designated particle deposition region. At a short flow time, the particles only traveled and deposited on the upper part of the airway, whereas as the time flow increased the particles tended to increasingly accumulate on the lower parts of the airway. The electrostatic charge model for aerosol deposition has shown that the further design of aerosol transport must take an average breathing frequency into consideration. The wall shear stress, oscillatory flow velocity index, granular temperature, granular pressure and skin friction coefficient were able to imply the amount of solid particles deposited within the system. All the purposed indices can be used as preliminary indicators for indicating a potential deposition location of the aerosol.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

A secondary aim was to evaluate correlations between circulating levels of glucose or amino acids and their transporters. There were significant age-dependent changes in the immune cell repertoire in the circulating blood (P < 0.004). Blood glucose levels were lower in LBW piglets than in NBW piglets (P < 0.05); in both birthweight groups, blood glucose increased with age. Plasma concentrations of histidine, isoleucine, proline and tryptophan showed significant changes with age (P < 0.003). With regard to mRNA levels for the nutrient transporters, there were no differences between the two birthweight groups or between the two age groups. At day 7 postpartum, intestinal expression of SGLT1 or GLUT2 mRNA did not correlate with blood glucose level. Expression of LAT2 mRNA in the ileum correlated positively with plasma level of methionine (r = 0.92, P < 0.001).

The photocatalytic activity of La-doped NaTaO3 should therefore be sensitive to the photostability of the La species being doped. Unfortunately, the photostability of the La species in NaTaO3 is not fully known. Herein, we perform an in-depth study on the photostability of the La species. Advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), are employed to clarify the chemical state and local structure of the La species in NaTaO3. Our findings show that the examined La-doped NaTaO3 can be effectively reused for six consecutive runs without a significant loss of its photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of recalcitrant organic compounds under UV light. The reusability of La-doped NaTaO3 is proposed to be due to the photostability of the La species. The La species are photostable because their oxidation state is unaltered and their structure in the host NaTaO3 is well preserved.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Twenty fruit types with various appearances in color and texture were selected to be analyzed in this study. Although the capability of many color or texture features were previously studied in many researches, each feature cannot be used to identify the fruit type accurately enough for practical use. In this study, we combine six features, i.e., HSV Color Histogram, Color Layout Descriptor (CLD), Color Correlogram, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Neighboring Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) to gain high accuracy of fruit-in-A-box classification. An image preprocessing stage is applied to fruit images to prepare the images in good condition. Then, six image features are extracted from each image. Finally, the fruit classification process is adopted through the well-known classification methods such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier, Naïve Bayes classifier, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). After experiments were tested and evaluated, it shows that, with the appropriate classification method, the hybridization of features yields high accuracy with independence of classification method and effectiveness in the classification of fruit in a box.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software, Information Systems and Management"

To control ovulation time using hormone, factors that influence ovulation should be investigated. The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of GnRH (buserelin) administration in relation to season and sow parameters on ovulation time in weaned sows. Seventy-seven weaned sows were divided into the following groups: control (hot season, n=21; cool season, n=16) and treatment (hot season, n=22; cool season, n=18). Sows were kept in a close house equipped with an evaporative cooling system. Ovulation time was determined every 6 hr using transrectal ultrasonography. Administration of 10 µg buserelin at 72 hr after weaning affected estrus-to-ovulation interval (EOI) and weaning-to-ovulation interval (WOI) in sows (P<0.05). The percentage of sows that ovulated between 44–56 hr after injection was higher in the cool season than in hot season (P<0.05). Weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) and injection-to-estrus interval (IEI) were affected by season (P<0.05). Body condition score (BCS) of sows influenced EOI (P<0.01). Sows with low backfat thickness, lactation length <20 days, or litter weight ≥67 kg, had delayed injection-to-ovulation interval (P<0.05). In conclusions, buserelin administration (10 µg, at 72 hr after weaning) advanced ovulation. Hot season prolonged ovulation time. Sows that were weaned with lactation length of at least 20 days, litter weight less than 67 kg, or BCS of at least 3, had better responses to buserelin injection.

All studies were of level III evidence and a total of 1985 arteries were studied. Its position at the skull base was influenced by the presence of supraorbital ethmoid cell (SOEC) and length of the lateral lamella of cribriform plate (LLCP). Inter population morphological variations contribute to the anatomical variations. Conclusions: The average diameter of AEA was 0.80 mm and the intranasal length was 5.82 mm. 79.2% was found between the second and third lamellae, 12.0% in the third lamella, 6% posterior to third lamella and 1.2% in the second lamella. Extra precaution should be taken in the presence of a well-pneumatized SOEC and a long LLCP as AEA tends to run freely below skull base.",medical,"Anatomy, Surgery, Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

We aimed to validate this approach using data collected from the Gut and Obesity in Asia Workgroup. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 759 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (24% with advanced fibrosis), seen at 10 centers in 9 countries in Asia, from 2006 through 2018. By using liver biopsies as the reference standard, we calculated percentages of misclassifications and indeterminate or discordant results from assessments made based on fibrosis scores (NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] or Fibrosis-4 score) and liver stiffness measurements (LSMs), alone or in combination. The analysis was repeated using randomly selected subgroups with a different prevalence of advanced fibrosis (histologic fibrosis stage ≥F3). Results: In groups in which 3.7% and 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, a 2-step approach (using the NFS followed by LSM only for patients with indeterminate or high NFS) and using a gray zone of 10 to 15 kPa for LSM, produced indeterminate or discordant results for 6.9% of patients and misclassified 2.7% of patients; only 25.6% of patients required LSM. In the group in which 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, the same approach produced indeterminate or discordant results for 7.9% of patients and misclassified 6.6% of patients; only 27.4% of patients required LSM. In groups in which 24% and 50% of patients had advanced fibrosis, using LSM ≥10 kPa alone for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis had the highest accuracy and misclassified 18.1% and 18.3% of patients, respectively. These results were similar when the Fibrosis-4 score was used in place of NFS. Conclusions: In a retrospective analysis, we found that a 2-step approach using fibrosis scores followed by LSM most accurately detects advanced fibrosis in populations with a low prevalence of advanced fibrosis. However, LSM ≥10 kPa identifies patients with advanced fibrosis with the highest level of accuracy in populations with a high prevalence of advanced fibrosis.","gastroenterology, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

"Quantitative interpretation of seismic attributes for reservoir characterization of Early-Middle Miocene syn- and post-rift successions (Songkhla Basin, Gulf of Thailand)","Phoosongsee J., Morley C.K., Ferguson A.J.",2019-11-01,"Depositional environment, Fluvial, Gulf of Thailand, Post-rift, Reservoir characterization, Seismic attributes, Songkhla Basin, Syn-rift, Depositional environment, Fluvial, Gulf of Thailand, Post-rift, Reservoir characterization, Seismic attributes, Songkhla Basin, Syn-rift","The major hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Gulf of Thailand, including the Songkhla Basin, are deposited throughout the syn- and post-rift section (Late Eocene-Recent), with the main reservoirs occurring in the Early Miocene to Middle Miocene section. These reservoirs are predominantly fluvial channels with complex lateral and vertical geometries and distributions particularly as point bars, overbank deposits, and sand- or mud-filled channels. This study characterizes the reservoir architecture and depositional environment of Songkhla Basin from late syn-rift to post-rift, during the Miocene, by integrating the seismic attributes (RMS, similarity, and spectral decomposition), well log interpretations, and well biostratigraphic data. Two distinctive channel characteristics and patterns were interpreted: (A) N-S oriented meandering channel complexes, aligned sub-parallel to the western boundary faults, developed during the late syn-rift (upper Early Miocene), (B) NE-SW oriented long, narrow fluvial channels with tidal and marine influence, developed in the post-rift phase I (Middle Miocene). These channel orientations reflect changes in the basin architecture passing from the late syn-rift stage to the post rift. Syn-rift channel orientation was controlled by topography created by motion on the western boundary fault system, while during the post-rift stage channel orientations were affected by mild inversion on the boundary fault system and thermal subsidence, which resulted in an eastward shift in the basin depocentre towards the flexural margin.","fluidex; related topics, hydrocarbons, earth sciences","Oceanography, Geophysics, Geology, Economic Geology, Stratigraphy"

However, its epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes in surgical critically ill patients remains unclear. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of the university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Results: A total of 189 of the 400 patients enrolled in our study developed AKI (47.3%). The severity was: stage 1 = 29.6% of all AKI (56 cases), stage 2 = 30.7% (58 cases), and stage 3 = 39.7% (75 cases). Risk factors of AKI development included a higher BMI, a greater APACHE-II score, septic shock, use of mechanical ventilation, acute medical complications during surgical admission, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. After adjustment for covariates, only the most severe stage of AKI (stage 3) was associated with increasing 28-day ICU mortality compared with no AKI stage, HR = 7.75 (95% CI, 1.46–41.20, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with an increase in mortality in surgical ICU patients. There should be more focus on patients with AKI risk factors to prevent this deleterious event.",medical,Nephrology
Power development planning considering energy storage system,"Rattanapratoom K., Audomvongseree K.",2019-07-01,"Conventional power plants, Energy storage systems, Intermittency, Long-term plans, Power development, Power grids, Recent researches, Renewable energies, Energy storage system, Power development plan","Power development plan or PDP is a long-term plan for energy reliability and security. It illustrates how much power plant a country plans to build to meet future demand. At present, one of the great challenges for the system planner is to develop a PDP that can confront with high growth of demand as well as high growth of the renewable energy. As the renewable energy is highly penetrated, it creates high uncertainty and intermittency to the power grid in such a way that, sometimes, typical conventional power plant cannot be quick enough to response. Many recent researches suggest that the energy storage system or ESS should be installed to cope with this problem. This paper proposed a method to develop a PDP considering installation of the ESS. The key factor determining whether a power grid requires a new plant or a new ESS is an index modified from Reserved Margin (RM). To illustrate the advantage of the proposed method, new power development plan (PDP) done by the proposed method is then compared to the Thailand's current plan, PDP2018.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Salt stress in rice: multivariate analysis separates four components of beneficial silicon action,"Lekklar C., Chadchawan S., Boon-Long P., Pfeiffer W., Chaidee A.",2019-03-01,"Multivariate Analysis, Oryza, Salt Stress, Silicon, Sodium Chloride, Chloride toxicity, Multivariate analysis, Osmotic stress, Rice (Oryza sativa L.), Silicon targets, Sodium toxicity","How many subcellular targets of the beneficial silicon effect do exist in salt-stressed rice? Here, we investigate the effects of silicon on the different components of salt stress, i.e., osmotic stress, sodium, and chloride toxicity. These components are separated by multivariate analysis of 18 variables measured in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). Multivariate analysis can dissect vectors and extract targets as principal components, given the regressions between all variables are known. Consequently, the exploration of 153 correlations and 306 regression models between all variables is essential, and regression parameters for variables of shoot (silicon, sodium, chloride, carotenoids, chlorophylls a and b, and relative growth rate) and variables of shoot and root (hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), fresh weight, dry weight, root-to-shoot ratio) are determined. The regression models [log (y) = y 0 + a × log (x)] are confirmed by variance analysis of global goodness of fits (p < 0.0001). Thereby, logarithmic transformation yields linearization for multivariate analysis by Pearson’s correlation. Four principal components are extracted: two targets of osmotic stress, one target of sodium toxicity, and one target of chloride toxicity. Thereby, silicon improves salt tolerance by increasing APX and CAT activities and decreasing hydrogen peroxide, salt ion accumulation, photosynthetic pigment losses, and growth inhibition. Salt stress increases silicon uptake pointing to a physiological regulation of plant salt stress in the presence of silicon. This mechanism and its four components are promising targets for further agricultural application.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Plant Science, Cell Biology"

In this work, we first conclude the oxygen solubility of α-Zr lying in the range of 33–38 at.%. Then, the mechanical and dynamical stability for all Zr-O compounds are confirmed by the analysis of elastic modulus and phonon dispersion. Furthermore, the stress responses of Zr-O system under the tensile and shear loadings have been systematically investigated by using first-principles calculations. The results reveal that ideal-strength depends on the O concentration strongly. Oxygen addition significantly enhances the ideal-strength compared with pure α-Zr, which provides direct evidence that α-Zr can notably harden by oxygen. Specifically, the alloy with 33 at.% oxygen contents exhibits the highest tension strength whereas 38 at.% oxygen content confers the alloy relatively excellent shear strength. Finally, the stress response and bonding nature of Zr-O system under loading are examined by the electronic structures.","engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

DNA sequence analyses of cloned pirA and pirB genes showed them to be identical to those detected in other AHPND-causing Vibrio sp. Amplicons generated using PCR tests targeted to the toxR gene showed the Pir toxin genes to be associated with a V. parahaemolyticus type more similar to a genotype found in Mexico compared to that found in Asia. Histology detected masses of bacteria and hemocytic infiltrations as well as extensive necrosis and sloughing of epithelial cells in hepatopancreatic tubules pathognomonic of AHPND. The data support AHPND as the cause of the mortalities. Given that US companies produce shrimp broodstock for farms in Asia and Latin America, the further spread of AHPND in the USA needs to be prevented to avoid serious economic consequences to these industries.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Aquatic Science"

Noticeably, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that the derived INNPs exhibited uniformity in size, which was easily controlled by the reaction temperature. The effect of enzyme and sucrose concentration, as well as reaction time, was explored. Moreover, the solubility of INNPs in various organic solvents was also investigated, and we found that the INNPs were freely regenerated in water even though they had precipitated by organic solvents. Essentially, we demonstrated that the derived INNPs could be applied for flavonoid encapsulation. The solubility and stability of quercetin and fisetin in the INNPs complexes was higher than those of free compounds.

Moreover, we examined whether these physical performance measures are accurate indicators of the investigated health outcomes. Methods: Using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, we investigated a sample of 8272 respondents aged 60 to 79 years. All data were based on the 2009 National Health Examination Survey (NHES IV) of Thailand. Results: For males aged 60 to 69 years, handgrip strength was used as an indicator of functional limitations. The cutoff point for disabilities in the activities of daily living (ADLs) was 29.5 kg, while in other limitations it ranged from 28.7 to 31.3 kg. In contrast, usual walking speed was able to indicate ADL disabilities at 0.7 m per second (m/s). As one might expect, the cutoff points for males aged 70 to 79 years were lower than for males in the 60 to 69 age group. For females, handgrip strength was able to indicate ADL disabilities at 16.5 kg for both the 60 to 69, and 70 to 79 age groups. Likewise, walking speed was indicative of ADL disabilities at 0.6 m/s for both age groups. Interestingly, the composite measure increases the ability to detect ADL disabilities in the younger group but not in the older group. The area under the curve (AUC) of cutoffs measuring the detection power of a diagnostic test was varied, ranging from 0.535 to 0.7386. Conclusions: The cutoff points of three measures varied according to sex and type of functional limitations. Our findings also showed that physical performance measures were useful for identifying people with an increased risk of functional limitations, particularly for ADL disabilities. However, although the AUC of the cutoffs of other functional limitations were relatively low, they should be considered with caution.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology

The aim of this study was to investigate hydrogen production from the co-gasification of biomass and coal integrated by means of the sorption-enhanced water gas shift reactor (G-SEWGS) for a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC). The effects of the gasifier temperature, the steam to fuel ratio (S/F ratio), and the equivalence ratio (ER) on the hydrogen production performance and environmental impact of the G-SEWGS were theoretically analysed and compared with the conventional gasifier integrated with the water gas shift reactor (G-WGS) and the sorption-enhanced gasifier integrated with the water gas shift reactor (SEG-WGS). As compared to the conventional water gas shift reactor, the addition of a CaO sorbent in the modified water gas shift reactor not only reduces the amount of the CO2 emission but also leads to an increase in the hydrogen concentration and hydrogen content. The G-SEWGS provides better performance in terms of its fuel processor efficiency and CO2 emission than the G-WGS and the SEG-WGS. Also, the problem of sulphur compound in the hydrogen-rich gas can be reduced by using of the sorption-enhanced water gas shift reactor (SEWGS). The best system exergy efficiency, which was around 22% for the power generation, was determined from the HT-PEMFC integrated with the G-SEWGS. The main exergy destruction of around 70% of the total loss was caused by hydrogen production processes.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The adjunctive use of botulinum toxin (BTX) injection into the sternocleidomastoid, followed by PT, could provide correction and avoid more invasive surgery. Aims of the study were to review clinical and caregiver-reported outcomes of children with resistant CMT treated by BTX injection combined with a guided-PT program.Methods:Medical records of consecutive children with resistant CMT treated by our protocol between 2010 and 2015 were reviewed. A minimum 2-year follow-up was required. Demographic parameters, numbers of BTX required and pre-BTX and post-BTX head tilt and range of neck rotation were recorded. A univariate analysis test was conducted to identify variables related to the need of repeated BTX injections. A phone interview with the caregivers was done regarding their satisfaction.Results:A cohort of 39 patients with treatment resistant CMT were identified that had an average age of 14 (range, 6.5 to 27.6) months at initiation of BTX treatment. Multiple BTX injections were utilized in 21/39 (54%) of patients. No patient required tendon lengthening surgery.

In a special, filler is used to increase the volume of tissue, and so understanding the regional thickness and distribution of the facial superficial fat is essential for optimizing minimally invasive procedures. The aim of this study was to establish the overall facial skin and superficial fat thicknesses using a three-dimensional (3D) scanning system. From 53 adult Korean and Thai embalmed adult cadavers, the undissected and serially-dissected facial specimens were scanned and reconstructed. The facial skin and superficial fat thicknesses on seven facial regions were calculated from the superimposed images. The facial skin tended to become thicker in the order of the radix and dorsum, and the temple, supraorbital, forehead, perioral, cheek, and infraorbital areas. The skin was thinnest at radix and dorsum (1.51 ± 0.55 mm), and thickest in infraorbital region (1.97 ± 0.84 mm). The facial superficial fat thickness tended to increase in the order of the radix and dorsum, supraorbital, forehead, temple, cheek, infraorbital, and perioral regions. The superficial fat was thinnest at the radix and dorsum (1.61 ± 1.07 mm), and thickest in the perioral region (5.14 ± 3.31 mm). The facial superficial fat thickness tended to increase in the order of the radix and dorsum, supraorbital, forehead, temple, cheek, infraorbital, and perioral regions.

Assessment of heat-to-power ratio in a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell system,"Wiranarongkorn K., Arpornwichanop A.",2019-03-15,"Bio oil, Combined heat and power, Combined heat and power generation, Enhanced steam reforming, High efficiency technology, Operational strategies, Power ratio, Primary energy savings, Bio-oil, Combined heat and power, Heat-to-power ratio, Solid oxide fuel cell system, Sorption enhanced steam reforming","A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Without the need for activation step, the capture peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes carrying a C-terminal lysine modification can be directly immobilized on the surface-grafted poly[glycidyl methacrylate-ran-poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate] (P(GMA-ran-PEGMA)) through ring-opening of epoxide groups in the GMA repeating units by amino groups in the PNA's structure. The success of P(GMA-ran-PEGMA) grafting on the filter paper and subsequent PNA immobilization was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Colorimetric detection with signal amplification upon DNA hybridization relies on sandwich-hybridization assay employing another biotinylated PNA strand as a reporter probe together with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (SA-HRP) and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate. It was found that increasing ionic strength during the DNA hybridization step by addition of NaCl can increase the signal intensity, which can be visualized by naked eye. The sensing platform showed the best performance in preventing non-specific adsorption from the non-complementary DNA and discriminating between complementary and single-mismatched targets of at least 50 fmol without the requirement for stringent hybridization or washing condition. This superior ability to suppress non-specific adsorption of non-target DNA as well as other non-DNA components may be explained as a result of hydrophilic PEGMA repeating units in the surface-grafted copolymer.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Two text generation methods: The text generation using Markov Chains and the text generation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were applied and compared in the term of ability to improve the performance of imbalanced text classification. Our experimental study is based on LSTM networks classifier. Traditional over-sampling technique was also used as baseline.

The storage modulus (G′) or the elasticity monotonically increased with increasing crosslinking agent and electric field strength. The MWCNT/pullulan hydrogel composite with 0.01%v/v MWCNT provided the highest storage modulus sensitivity of 71.2 at the applied electric field strength of 800 V/mm, relative to other hydrogel composites previously reported. The storage and loss moduli were further transformed to the creep compliance through the relaxation spectrum and the retardation spectrum, respectively. The creep compliance of the pristine hydrogels and composites decreased with increasing crosslinking agent amount and electric field strength. The 01MWCNT/Pullulan_5STMP hydrogel composite yielded the lowest creep compliance function, illustrating the ability to resist deformation through electric field. The dielectrophoresis force density of the MWCNT/pullulan hydrogel composite with 0.01%v/v MWCNT was the highest obtained at 0.2258 mN/mm3, suggesting as the most suitable for practical actuator applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Physics and Astronomy (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Due to the complexity of column geometry and shear effects, the available methods to analyze the elastic buckling load are limited. This study proposes a method of calculation the elastic buckling load about the major axis of a pin-ended cellular column. The analysis is based on simplification of the column geometry and uses an effective length of shear force transfer across openings in the columns. The shear force in the column causes additional deformations of the web-post and the Tee section of cellular columns. The buckling load is derived by using differential equations of total curvature of the buckling curve, which is the sum of curvatures due to moment and shear forces. The proposed buckling load estimate is validated by comparisons with finite element analysis. A parametric study of the column geometry effects on shear, such as the section ratios, the opening ratios, the spacing ratios and the slendernesses, was also conducted. The shear effects clearly increases with open area fraction in the web, and with the section ratios. It was found that the spacing ratio affects the buckling load more than the opening ratio. Overall, the shear effects degrade the buckling load by less than 20% when the slenderness exceeds 50 compared to the Euler buckling load.",engineering,"Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanical Engineering"

Studies looking into the situation of older adults providing care for their grandchildren have found that care responsibilities can have beneficial effects but can also pose challenges to those providing it, depending on individual and societal circumstances. The objective of our study is to shed light on the health effects of providing care for grandchildren younger than 10 years of age on grandparents. Whether this experience has positive or negative effects on the caretaker's health depends on a range of factors that we explore here in the context of Thailand. The study is based on the quantitative analysis of the 2011 round of the National Survey of Older Persons in Thailand. In order to control for endogeneity between health status and the provision of care, we apply several instrumental variable (IV) approaches in addition to regular regressions. In terms of health status, we make use of four health-related variables: self-reported health status, functional limitations, happiness level and information about negative feelings. The observed positive impact of grandparenting on three health outcomes that we find with non-endogeneity-controlled OLS analyses is likely due to reverse causality or self-selection into becoming a grandparent who provides care. The unbiased results imply that regularly taking care of young grandchildren does not provide any physical health benefits; to the contrary, it seems to have a negative impact on self-rated health, functional limitations and psychological well-being, supporting the role strain theory.","geobase; related topics, sociology, arts","Health (social science), History and Philosophy of Science"

PCC 6803 exposed to UVA, UVB and UVC for at least 3 h were investigated with the emphasis on the changes of polyamines (PAs) levels in whole cells, thylakoid membrane fraction, and thylakoid membrane-associated proteins fraction. All UV radiations caused a slight decrease on cell growth but a drastic reduction of photosynthetic efficiency of Synechocystis cells. UV radiations, especially UVB and UVC, severely decreased the levels of PAs associated with thylakoid membrane proteins. The decreased PAs levels as affected by UV radiation correlated well with the decrease of photosynthetic efficiency, suggesting the role of PAs for the maintenance of photosynthetic activity of Synechocystis. PAs, especially spermidine (Spd) and putrescine (Put), were found abundantly in the thylakoid membrane fraction, and these PAs were associated mainly with the PSI trimer complex. Importantly, the exposure of Synechocystis cells to all UV radiations for 3 h resulted in the increase of Spd associated with the PSII monomer and dimer complex, suggesting its protective role against UV radiations despite the overall decrease of PAs.

Two PEBAX samples are studied, namely, P6333 and P7033 with 37 and 25 mol.% of soft poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) blocks, respectively. In both samples, poorly hydrogen-bonded mesophase facilitates electric field-induced ferroelectric switching. Meanwhile, the longitudinal electrostrictive strain (S1)–electric field (E) loops are obtained at 2 Hz. Different from conventional poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)]-based terpolymers, uniaxially stretched nylon-12-based PEBAX samples exhibit negative S1, that is, shrinking rather than elongation in the longitudinal direction. This is attributed to the unique conformation transformation of nylon-12 crystals during ferroelectric switching. Namely, at a zero electric field, crystalline nylon-12 chains adopt a more or less antiparallel arrangement of amide groups. Upon high-field poling, ferroelectric domains are enforced with more twisted chains adopting a parallel arrangement of amide groups. Meanwhile, extensional S1 is observed for P6333 at electric fields above 150 MV m−1. This is attributed to the elongation of the amorphous phases (i.e., amorphous nylon-12 and PTMO). Therefore, competition between shrinking S1 from mesomorphic nylon-12 crystals (i.e., nanoactuation) and elongational S1 from amorphous phases determines the ultimate electrostriction behavior in stretched PEBAX films.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Five surfactants namely cetyltrimethyl- ammonium bromide (CTAB), benzyldodecyldimethyl-ammonium bromide (BDAB), and dimethyldioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DODAB) as cationic surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an anionic surfactant, and polysorbate 20 (TW20) as a non-ionic surfactant were utilized as the surfactant templates. The PEAn particle shapes were found to be irregular, globular, and fibrillar, with the sizes varying from 127 to 840 nm depending on the surfactant type and concentration. PEAn with the fibrillar shape provided higher electrical conductivity than PEAn with the globular shape, as observed in the cationic surfactant templates at 1 CMC namely CTAB, BDAB, and DODAB.

The median central nervous system PFS was not calculable for the osimertinib group and was 13.8 months for the SoC EGFR TKI group (hazard ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.25–1.17, p = 0.118). Fewer adverse events of grade 3 or higher (40% versus 48%) and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (15% versus 21%) were reported with osimertinib versus with an SoC EGFR TKI, respectively. Conclusion: In this Asian population, first-line osimertinib demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS over an SoC EGFR TKI, with a safety profile consistent with that for the overall FLAURA study population.",medical,"Oncology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine"

It is essential for project manager and as a tool to consistently estimate the usage of project time and resources. However, the massive numbers of activities and their complicated dependencies remains difficult to be verified manually. We intend to use a timed Petri net to formally represent the existing massive tasks in the activity network diagram to make it easier for verification. The relationship types between the activities are correctly defined with no conflict in the project plan. The timed Petri net would ease the simulation of the control flows and dependencies among the activities in the project. Moreover, there exist several timed Petri nets simulation and animation tools for the incident investigation and verification. In this paper, we propose a set of rules to map the elements of an activity network diagram into the associate timed Petri nets. The basic four dependency types - finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish, between activities are handled with care. The resulting timed Petri nets are correctly generated and verified by the simulation tool.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, medical, computer science","Control and Optimization, Health Informatics, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems"

Recent studies suggest that AF is associated with morbidity and mortality in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature have not been done. We assessed the association between AF in patients with TTC and mortality by a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. Methods: We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to January 2018. Included studies were published prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compared all-cause mortality in TTC with AF versus without AF. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Five studies from August 2008 to October 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 2,321 subjects with TTC (243 with AF and 2,078 without AF). The presence of AF was associated with all-cause mortality (pooled odds ratio = 2.19, 95% confidence interval: 1.57–3.06, p < 0.001, I 2 = 0%). Conclusion: Atrial fibrillation increased all-cause mortality by double among patients with TTC compared to without it.

Biological evaluation and molecular dynamics simulation of chalcone derivatives as epidermal growth factor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors,"Sangpheak K., Tabtimmai L., Seetaha S., Rungnim C., Chavasiri W., Wolschann P., Choowongkomon K., Rungrotmongkol T.",2019-03-20,"A549 Cells, Binding Sites, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Survival, Chalcone, Epidermal Growth Factor, Humans, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Mutation, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, ADMET, Chalcone derivatives, Cytotoxicity assay, EGFR tyrosine kinase, Molecular dynamics simulation","Targeted cancer therapy has become a high potential cancer treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which plays an important role in cell signaling, enhanced cell survival and proliferation, has been suggested as molecular target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. In this study, a series of chalcone derivatives was screened by in vitro cytotoxicity against the wild type (A431 and A549) and mutant EGFR (H1975 and H1650) cancer cell lines, and, subsequently, tested for EGFR-tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition. From the experimental screening, all chalcones seemed to be more active against the A431 than the A549 cell line, with chalcones 1c, 2a, 3e, 4e, and 4t showing a more than 50% inhibitory activity against the EGFR-TK activity and a high cytotoxicity with IC50 values of < 10 µM against A431 cells. Moreover, these five chalcones showed more potent on H1975 (T790M/L858R mutation) than H1650 (exon 19 deletion E746-A750) cell lines. Only three chalcones (1c, 2a and 3e) had an inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK with a relative inhibition percentage that was close to the approved drug, erlotinib. Molecular dynamics studies on their complexes with EGFR-TK domain in aqueous solution affirmed that they were well-occupied within the ATP binding site and strongly interacted with seven hydrophobic residues, including the important hinge region residue M793. From the above information, as well as ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties, all three chalcones could serve as lead compounds for the development of EGFR-TK inhibitors.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This study investigated whether 2-week sleep extension in chronically sleep-deprived individuals would improve glucose metabolism. Methods: A crossover study was conducted in volunteers without diabetes who reported sleeping ≤ 6 h/night. They were randomized to maintain their habitual sleep or extend sleep time for 2 weeks, then crossed over after a washout period. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy. Oral glucose tolerance tests (75 g) with insulin levels was performed at the end of each period. Mixed-effect linear regression analysis, adjusting for sequence and period effects, was applied. Results: A total of 21 participants (19 females) with mean (standard deviation) age of 33.1 (6.1) years completed the protocol. Mean sleep duration during habitual sleep was 318.7 (44.3) minutes and the participants extended their sleep by 36.0 (45.2) minutes during sleep extension. The average washout period was 21 (11) days. There were no significant effects of sleep extension on any metabolic parameters. The per-protocol analysis included eight participants who could sleep more than 6 hours during sleep extension (mean sleep duration 396 [25] minutes, extended by 60.1 [28.5] minutes). Among these individuals, sleep extension improved Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (adjusted mean difference −0.50 [95% confidence interval [CI] −0.89, −0.11, P = .013]), early insulin secretion (insulinogenic index; mean difference 0.39 [95% CI 0.15, 0.63, P = .001]), and β-cell function (disposition index, mean difference 1.07 [95% CI 0.17, 1.97, P = .02]). Conclusions: Sleep extension in chronically sleep-deprived individuals improved glucose metabolism in only those who could objectively extend their sleep to more than 6 h/night. Our findings suggest that a critical amount of sleep is needed to benefit metabolic outcomes.","medical, neuroscience","Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Hazardous experiences greatly influence the expertise and abilities of actors that implement and execute public disaster responses. In domestic disaster situations, there are protocols and resources that facilitate a national disaster response. However, in overseas responses, disaster response becomes more challenging as more responsibilities with limited authorities and resources are required. In this research, the public disaster response of the Royal Thai Embassy in Tokyo was explored and evaluated on the basis of several disaster scenarios. This research was developed to understand the state of disaster response, enhance the effectiveness of disaster response protocols, and reduce unnecessary resource consumption. This study intended to fulfill organizational needs and responsibilities. The study converts existing protocol that is written in document form into a time series disaster response plan for disaster drills based on a possible worst-case scenario, i.e., the Kumamoto Earthquake scenario in 2016 and the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011. The plan was used in a disaster drill to evaluate organizational responses. The results from drills and discussions and comments from participant information flow primarily manage communications, cooperation, and connections, which are dependent on experiences and expertise in disaster management. This further affects information flow management and assistance capabilities. The outputs and outcomes from this research can be used as a guideline for application to other embassies in Japan, the Royal Thai Embassy in other countries, and general overseas organizations. This work may apply to other public disaster responses aside from natural disasters.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

The effects of calcination temperatures were studied at 400 °C (ST-4), 500 °C (ST-5), to 600 °C (ST-6). The characterization results indicated that the achieved Ag species in all of the prepared Ag-anatase composites were stable in Ag (0) which was confirmed by X-ray absorption near the edge structure (XANES) and detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The deposition of tiny Ag species (10–20 nm in size) on the anatase surface was observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The photoluminescence (PL) characterization results revealed that the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs was significantly reduced after the deposition of Ag nanoparticles and was decreased as the calcination temperature increased. The ST-6 possessed the highest photocatalytic performance which can degrade rhodamine B (10 ppm) by using 0.05 g of the prepared composites under UV irradiation within 1 h. It could be concluded that metallic Ag nanoparticles deposited on the anatase surface induced by the calcination process can possibly play an important role in the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of bare-anatase.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, computer science, physics, chemistry, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Computer Science (all), Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Total and ionized calcium and magnesium are significantly lowered in drug-naïve depressed patients: effects of antidepressants and associations with immune activation,"Al-Dujaili A.H., Al-Hakeim H.K., Twayej A.J., Maes M.",2019-10-01,"Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Calcium, Depressive Disorder, Major, Female, Humans, Ketoprofen, Magnesium, Male, Middle Aged, Sertraline, Treatment Outcome, Cytokines, Depression, Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, Inflammation, Neuro-immune","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with alterations in calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), as well as circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used as adjuvant treatments for MDD. However, no studies examined the effects of a combinatorial treatment with sertraline and ketoprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, on Ca and Mg levels in MDD. The present study examined a) differences in both cations between drug-naïve MDD patients and controls, and b) the effects of sertraline and ketoprofen on Ca and Mg (both total and ionized). In the same patients, we also examined the associations between both cations and IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, zinc, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Clinical improvement was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and after follow up for 2 months. Serum Ca and Mg (total and ionized) were significantly lower in MDD patients as compared with controls, while treatment significantly increased calcium but decreased magnesium levels. There were significant and inverse correlations between the BDI-II scores from baseline to endpoint and Ca (both total and ionized), but not Mg, levels. The effects of calcium on the BDI-II score remained significant after considering the effects of zinc, IDO and an immune activation z unit-weighted composite score based on the sum of all cytokines. There was a significant and inverse association between this immune activation index and calcium levels from baseline to endpoint. In conclusion, lowered levels of both cations play a role in the pathophysiology of major depression. Antidepressant-induced increases in Ca are associated with clinical efficacy and attenuation of the immune response. The suppressant effect of antidepressants on Mg levels is probably a side effect of those drugs. New antidepressant treatments should be developed that increase the levels both Ca and Mg.

The FA and TAG content of the oil sample was analysed using gas chromatography–electron ionisation mass spectrometry (GC–EIMS). FA analysis was performed after derivatisation to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). For free FA and TAG analysis, the oil sample was dissolved in hexane and injected into a short, high-temperature column, for GC with MS analysis. Free FA and FAME were tentatively identified based on mass spectrum information of their molecular and fragment ions, as well as library matching. Overlapping TAG peaks were deconvoluted based on mass fingerprint data. The FA composition was utilised to predict possible TAG identities. FA residues of TAG were identified based on characteristic fragment ions, such as [M–RCO 2 ] + , [RCO+128] + , [RCO+74] + and RCO + where R is the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. FAME analysis showed that the cyclic FA hydnocarpic (36.1%), chaulmoogric (26.5%) and gorlic (23.6%) acids were the major components. In addition, straight chain FA such as palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids were detected. Palmitic, oleic, hydnocarpic, chaulmoogric and gorlic acids were also detected as free FA in the oil sample. Six groups of TAG peaks were eluted from GC at temperatures ≥330 °C. After deconvolution and mass spectrum analysis, each TAG peak group was revealed to comprise 2 to 5 co-eluted TAG molecules; >18 TAG were identified. These TAG consisted of a mix of both cyclic and straight chain FA, but were mostly derived from cyclic FA.","chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry"

Neonatal testes were collected from 1-week-old piglets. The testes were digested by a two-step enzymatic method to isolate Sertoli cells. The latter were transfected with retroviral vectors expressing OSKM. The Sertoli iPSC-like colonies were subjected to morphological analysis, alkaline phosphatase staining, RT-PCR, G-banding karyotyping, in vitro differentiation, and in vivo differentiation. Primary Sertoli cells had polygon-shaped morphology and manifested phagocytic activity as determined by a fluorescent bead assay. Sertoli cells also expressed the anti-Müllerian hormone protein in the cytoplasm. According to RT-PCR results, these cells expressed Sertoli cell markers (FSHR, KRT18, and GATA6) and endogenous transcription factors genes (KLF4 and c-MYC). A total of 240 colonies (0.3% efficiency) were detected by day 7 after viral transduction of 72500 cells. The Sertoli iPSC-like colonies contained small cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. These colonies tested positive for alkaline phosphatase staining, expressed endogenous pluripotency genes, and had a normal karyotype. All these cell lines could form in vitro three-dimensional aggregates that represented three germ layers of embryonic-like cells. A total of two cell lines used for in vivo differentiation produced high-efficiency teratoma. In conclusion, Sertoli cells can efficiently serve as a novel cell source for iPSC reprogramming.","cell and developmental biology; cell growth and division; cell growth; stem cells, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Multiple studies of B/F/TAF in treatment-naive and virologically suppressed cohorts have shown high efficacy and tolerability with no treatment-emergent resistance through 48 weeks. Participants in these studies have been predominantly men. We report 48-week results from a phase 3 study evaluating switching to B/F/TAF, specifically in a globally distributed trial population of women.Methods:In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02652624), women living with HIV who were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL) on a regimen containing either TAF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) or stay on baseline regimen (SBR) once daily for 48 weeks. Primary endpoint was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at week 48 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm); prespecified noninferiority margin was 4%.Findings:We randomized 472 participants and treated 470 (234 B/F/TAF, 236 SBR). Switching to B/F/TAF was noninferior to SBR for the primary outcome, as 1.7% (4/234) vs 1.7% (4/236) had HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at week 48 (difference 0.0%, 95.001% confidence interval: -2.9% to 2.9%). No individual receiving B/F/TAF developed treatment-emergent resistance. Both treatments were well-tolerated; no participant discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.Interpretation:Fixed-dose combination B/F/TAF provides a safe and efficacious option for ongoing treatment of HIV in women. This study contributes important data on safety, tolerability, and outcomes of antiretroviral therapy among women living with HIV.","genergyal, medical","Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"
Lack of associations between thyroid function and obstructive sleep apnea severity in adults with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus,"Sriphrapradang C., Pinyopodjanard S., Suntornlohanakul O., Nimitphong H., Chirakalwasan N., Saetang S., Anothaisintawee T., Siwasaranond N., Manodpitipong A., Chailurkit L.-O., Reutrakul S.",2019-09-01,"Adult, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Humans, Hypothyroidism, Male, Middle Aged, Prediabetic State, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, Thyrotropin, Thyroxine, Triiodothyronine, Hypothyroidism, Polysomnography, Sleep apnea syndromes, Thyrotropin, Thyroxine, Triiodothyronine","Purpose: Hypothyroidism is associated with a high frequency of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the prevalence of OSA in hypothyroid patients is not different from the general population in many reports. The importance of thyroid function screening in sleep-disordered breathing is still controversial. This study aimed to explore the association between thyroid dysfunction and OSA in the adults with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus type 2, who have very high prevalence of OSA. Methods: OSA was assessed using an in-home monitoring device, WatchPAT200. OSA severity was measured using apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), minimum oxygen saturation (minO2), and time spent under oxygen saturation < 90% (T90). Patients with pre-existing thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Results: Participants included 70 men and 118 women with mean age 52.8 ± 10.9 years and body mass index 28.2 ± 4.9 kg/m2. One hundred forty participants (75%) had OSA, with a median AHI of 10.1 (interquartile range 4.8, 18.3). The percentage of positive thyroid autoantibody (thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin antibody) was similar among the subjects with and without OSA. There was no correlation between the levels of thyroid function (TSH, FT3, FT4, TSH/FT3, and TSH/FT4 ratio) and the severity indices of OSA (AHI, ODI, minO2, and T90). Conclusions: These data do not support universal screening for thyroid dysfunction in OSA patients with diabetes or prediabetes.",medical,"Otorhinolaryngology, Neurology (clinical)"

Radiotherapy-induced trismus occurs when the masticatory muscles are within range of radiation treating head and neck cancer, resulting in muscular fibrosis and trismus. We aim to assess the measurement properties of available validated patient-reported outcome measures relevant to radiotherapy-induced trismus in head and neck cancer patients. Systematic electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify studies validating radiotherapy-induced trismus with patient-reported outcome measures up to January 2018. Two reviewers independently rated the methodological quality of identified validation studies, using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instrument (COSMIN) checklist. The level of evidence for measurement properties was then summarised based upon pre-defined criteria. Only one of the 280 retrieved studies were deemed fit for inclusion. The Gothenburg Trismus Questionnaire was assessed and found to have a good methodological quality of measurement properties except for reliability, which was poor. There was a moderate level of evidence supporting internal consistency, content validity, structural validity and hypothesis testing. The evidence for test-retest reliability remains unknown in the population of interest. The Gothenburg Trismus Questionnaire is the only patient-reported outcome measure in the field of showing some good measurement properties, and it may therefore represent a useful instrument for the assessment of radiotherapy-induced trismus in head and neck cancer patients. However, further validation studies are needed especially with respect to the reliability, measurement error and the responsiveness of this instrument.","cancer research; treatment; side effects and computer sciencelications of cancer; radiation effects, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Cancer Research, Periodontics"

In this work, the CNT and IL (CNT-IL) were mixed with NR by latex mixing method. Cure characteristics, thermo-mechanical properties, Payne effect, electrical conductivity and thermal stability were investigated. It was found that IL (BMI) accelerated vulcanization reactions and reduced scorch time. In addition, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) results confirmed the role of IL in NR composites along with the reaction between CNT and NR molecules. The temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR) measurement was used to assess thermo-mechanical properties, and a relaxation peak of IL was found due to interactions of cations and anions in IL (BMI). Furthermore, the Payne effect was used to qualitatively analyze the roles of IL and CNT in three-dimensional CNT networks in the NR matrix. It was found that CNT dispersion was finer in the NR/CNT composites with IL. Furthermore, the NR/CNT-IL composite had higher electrical conductivity and lower percolation threshold concentration than the NR/CNT composite.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In contrast to adult infection, where elite controllers have been very well characterized and constitute approximately 0.5% of infections, very few data exist to address this question in paediatric infection.Methods:We describe 11 ART-naive elite controllers from 10 cohorts of HIV-infected children being followed in South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, and Europe.Results:All but one of the elite controllers (91%) are females. The median age at which control of viraemia was achieved was 6.5 years. Five of these 11 (46%) children lost control of viraemia at a median age of 12.9 years. Children who maintained control of viraemia had significantly higher absolute CD4 cell counts in the period of elite control than those who lost viraemic control. On the basis of data available from these cohorts, the prevalence of elite controllers in paediatric infection is estimated to be 5-10-fold lower than in adults.Conclusion:Although conclusions are limited by the study design, these data suggest that, whilst paediatric elite control can be achieved, compared with adult elite controllers, this occurs rarely, and takes some years after infection to achieve. Also, loss of immune control arises in a high proportion of children and often relatively rapidly. These findings are consistent with the more potent antiviral immune responses observed in adults and in females.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv, medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

The Ni2P phase was clearly present in the Ni2P/C catalyst with a Ni:P ratio of 1.5 and a 5.37 mmol Ni loading level. The catalysts were then evaluated for the hydrodeoxygenation of the pyrolysis vapor derived from the integrated pyrolysis and upgrading of Napier grass, with two fixed bed reactors in series, at different upgrading temperatures and space velocities. The reaction could be carried out at atmospheric pressure. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at an upgrading temperature of 340 °C, while the major components of the bio-oil were phenolic compounds (>50%). An upgrading temperature of 360 °C did not only present dehydration but aromatization was also predominant. Moreover, the phenolic compounds decreased with increasing space velocity. The oxygen content in the pyrolysis vapor was catalytically removed via the dehydration pathway, which significantly decreased the oxygen/carbon ratio from 0.24 to 0.17. Due to advantages spanning from highly efficient deoxygenation activity to the requirement of mild conditions, the Ni2P/C catalyst shows great potential as a catalyst for bio-oil upgrading.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

To this end, chitosan should not only be soluble in water but also be thixotropic. Therefore, it can be used as an injectable liquid that can form a hydrogel under physiological conditions. Accordingly, chitosan was modified with carboxymethyl chloride and the resultant carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS) was conjugated to α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) to yield CMCTSCD. The α-CD conjugation improved the water solubility and the hydrophobic cavities to function as crosslinking points by forming an inclusion complex with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The optimum mole ratio of α-CD (as CMCTSCD) to PEG was found to be 2 to 4 with a threading number of ~2.5. The sol-to-gel transition was formed within 450 ± 10 min. The interconnecting porous structure of the gel was observed by scanning electron microscope. Therefore, CMCTSCD/PEG is a potential novel design that can be used as an injectable hydrogel for bone tissue engineering.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Meanwhile, postoperative topical steroid decreases the downtime, yet still possibly increases other steroid side effects. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moisturizer containing 5% panthenol, madecassoside, and copper-zinc-manganese (experimental cream) versus 0.02% Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) cream in decreasing adverse effects and downtime after FrCO2 laser, with wound healing improvement and prevention of certain steroid-related side effects like postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Methods: We conducted a double-blinded, split face, randomized controlled trial in 20 subjects receiving FrCO2 laser on both sides of the faces and randomly treated with two posttreatment regimens on each side for 7 days. Clinical, expert panel assessment of photography, downtime, side effects, and biometric evaluation for erythema and melanin were performed on baseline, immediately after treatment, day 3, 5, 7, 14, 30 and, 60 postoperatively. Results: Both experimental cream (EC) and 0.02% TA cream could significantly reduce postlaser downtime including swelling, redness, crusting, and scaling in 5-7 days, with comparable efficacies in decreasing downtime and adverse reactions, as well as wound healing improvement and lower PIH without statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The incidence of PIH was 60% in the EC treated group with minimal intensity. Conclusion: The moisturizer with anti-inflammatory ingredients could be a novel treatment modality for reduction of postablative laser downtime by using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents to avoid adverse effects and improve wound healing process with lower PIH.",medical,Dermatology

The purpose was to find the optimal operating condition for sustainable production of biomethane using multi-criteria perspective considering technical, environmental and economic aspects. The absorption system was modified by including one additional absorber unit for improving biogas upgrading efficiency. The performance of the biogas upgrading system was evaluated and compared in terms of methane recovery, methane content in biomethane, and energy consumption. Effects of operating conditions such as operating pressure in absorber, concentration, and total flow rate of absorbents were investigated. The results revealed that the performance of the modified absorption system was superior to the conventional system. The methane content in biomethane, methane recovery, and energy consumption increased with the increase of operating pressure in the absorbers. Increasing concentration and total flow rate of absorbents increased the methane content in biomethane and the energy consumption but decreased the methane recovery. The optimal operating condition could achieve 96%v/v of methane content in biomethane with methane recovery of higher than 95%v/v in the modified water absorption system.

Based on the prospective data analysis of nearly 1400 patients, the AARC consensus was published in 2014. In the past nearly four-and-a-half years, the AARC database has been enriched to about 5200 cases by major hepatology centers across Asia. The data published during the interim period were carefully analyzed and areas of contention and new developments in the field of ACLF were prioritized in a systematic manner. The AARC database was also approached for answering some of the issues where published data were limited, such as liver failure grading, its impact on the ‘Golden Therapeutic Window’, extrahepatic organ dysfunction and failure, development of sepsis, distinctive features of acute decompensation from ACLF and pediatric ACLF and the issues were analyzed. These initiatives concluded in a two-day meeting in October 2018 at New Delhi with finalization of the new AARC consensus. Only those statements, which were based on evidence using the Grade System and were unanimously recommended, were accepted. Finalized statements were again circulated to all the experts and subsequently presented at the AARC investigators meeting at the AASLD in November 2018. The suggestions from the experts were used to revise and finalize the consensus. After detailed deliberations and data analysis, the original definition of ACLF was found to withstand the test of time and be able to identify a homogenous group of patients presenting with liver failure. New management options including the algorithms for the management of coagulation disorders, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, variceal bleed, antivirals and criteria for liver transplantation for ACLF patients were proposed.

Dental health personnel must assess the oral health status and needs of the community through the collection and interpretation of reliable health information. Thus, the aims of this study were (1) to develop a mobile application for oral health surveys, (2) to analyze the oral status of school children in Bangkok using the newly developed application, and (3) to evaluate user satisfaction with using the Oral Health Survey Mobile Application (OHSMA). Materials and Methods: The OHSMA Android app was created to facilitate the collection and transfer of oral health status data. The survey data on the oral health status of Grades 1-6 Thai schoolchildren were collected and analyzed using the OHSMA. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to evaluate the satisfaction of 125 dental students when using this new application compared with using paper forms. Results: The prevalence of dental caries in 441 schoolchildren was 79.7%. The total mean decayed, missing, and filled for primary teeth (dmft) and decayed, missing, and filled for permanent teeth (DMFT) were 4.09 (d + D = 3.29, m + M = 0.15, and f + F = 0.65). Users indicated high satisfaction scores for three OHSMA features: font, color, and proper size. The results showed that paper forms were easier for inputting and recording the data compared with the OHSMA. However, the OHSMA was significantly easier for searching data and reporting data compared with paper forms (OHSMA 3.80, paper forms 3.35; p < 0.001, and OHSMA 3.80, paper forms 3.51; p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, this study suggests that the mobile application has the potential to collect valuable oral health survey data.","fluidex; related topics, medical, Health Professions","Health Informatics, Health Information Management"

The postoperative brain surgery patients can be counted as a critical patient group because they need to have a close monitor for at least 24 hours. However, the number of medical staffs presently is inadequate when comparing with the number of patients. Therefore, this paper proposed an automated monitoring and analyzing pain system, MAPS, to monitor postoperative brain surgery patients and to analyze their symptom after operations without any guidance from nurses. The output from this system is the warning message to the responsible nurses so that they can provide a suitable treatment to the patient in time. The expected outcome of this research is that the postoperative mortality rate can be reduced because fast treatment can be granted to the patients promptly.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The aim of the present study was to determine the presence and genotype of E. bieneusi in humans and domestic animals in central Thailand by testing stool samples of 200 apparently healthy humans, 73 goats, 60 cattle and 65 pigs using nested-PCR/ sequence analysis based on the ITS region of SSU rRNA genes. Results: E. bieneusi tested positive in 2 (1%) of the 200 stool samples collected from humans and 56 (28.3%) of the 198 stool samples collected from domestic animals. The highest prevalence of E. bieneusi was observed in pigs (39/65, 60%), followed by goats (14/73, 19.2%) and cattle (3/60, 5%). Seven novel E. bieneusi genotypes were identified, which were named GoatAYE1-4 and PigAYE1-3 and clustered in either zoonotic Group 1 or Group 2. Moreover, eleven previously described E. bieneusi genotypes were also identified (O, D, H, SX1, CHC8, CHG3, CS-10, SHZC1, LW1, WildBoar5, and EbpC). All novel genotypes exhibited zoonotic potential from a phylogenetic analysis of ITS region. Conclusion: Our data showed that the prevalence of E. bieneusi is low in apparently healthy individuals and higher in pigs than cattle and goats. This study provides baseline data useful for controlling and preventing E. bieneusi infection in farm communities, where pigs and goats appear to be the major reservoir of E. bieneusi. The results of our study support the view that E. bieneusi is a zoonotic pathogen that should be considered a potential public health threat.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
Optimal location of local anesthetic injection in the interspace between the popliteal artery and posterior capsule of the knee (iPACK) for posterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty: An anatomical and clinical study,"Kampitak W., Tansatit T., Tanavalee A., Ngarmukos S.",2019-10-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anesthetics, Local, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Cadaver, Female, Humans, Knee Joint, Male, Middle Aged, Nerve Block, Pain, Postoperative, Popliteal Artery, Ultrasonography, Interventional, Young Adult, Knee replacement arthroplasty, Popliteal artery, Postoperative pain, Tibial nerve","Background: This study aimed to determine the optimal location of local anesthetic injection in the interspace between the popliteal artery and posterior capsule of the knee (iPACK), using the anatomical pattern of the articular branch of tibial nerve (ABTN). We hypothesized that injection at the level of ABTN forming a popliteal plexus would mainly spread throughout the popliteal fossa without contacting the tibial or peroneal nerves. Methods: The anatomical study included 30 soft cadavers. Ultrasound-guided dye injection was performed in legs of 10 cadavers after identifying the position of the ABTN and surrounding structures, followed by dissection to assess its spread. Clinical study was conducted in 15 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with ultrasound-guided injection in the iPACK. All patients also received continuous adductor canal block. Sensorimotor function of the tibial and common peroneal nerves was determined. Results: In the distal portion of the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve and popliteal vessels ran superficially and closely together. The trajectory of ABTN ran lateral to the popliteal vasculature, forming a plexus towards the posterior capsule of the knee below the medial side of the upper edge of lateral femoral condyle. In cadavers, the ABTN and surrounding area of the popliteal plexus were stained with dye after injection. In the clinical study, no patients experienced complete motor or sensory blocks. Conclusions: We described a modified iPACK technique injection at the level of the ABTN forming the popliteal plexus, and it may constitute an optional anesthetic regimen to promote early ambulation following TKA.",medical,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine

These models aim to maximize overall part makers' satisfaction. The evaluators are chosen from purchasing management team from 10 part makers. These assessors will evaluate 8 raw material suppliers. This research is divided into 2 parts. The first part is the evaluation of raw material suppliers using Analytic Hierarchy Process. This part weights the importance of decision criteria complying with part makers' satisfaction. The second part proposes a decision model for supplier selection using integer programming. The weight of each criterion from the first part will be considered along with raw material consumption to select the suitable raw material suppliers that maximize overall part makers' satisfaction. The results from the first part of this study show that the most important criterion is cost which is about 41%. Quality, Delivery, Service, and Risk factors are 24%, 14%, 12% and 9%, respectively. The second part shows that the model can match material suppliers to part makers according to their preference. Comparing with current situation, the satisfaction is increased by 26% with this proposed model. It means that the proposed model can help increase satisfactions between car seat makers and their suppliers, which benefit the parts supplied to the case-study company.","fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Using erroneous data such as data with missing values, class imbalance, and skew, may affect model performance and classification outcome. Often when models have poor performance, practitioners focus on improving models but overlook quality processing as it requires the involvement of data experts or data owners who have an intimate understanding of the data. Furthermore, performing data quality processing is challenging in that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal solution that is suitable for all types of data and models. Therefore, a unique combination of data quality processing methods is required for each dataset and model prior to model generation in order to identify the most appropriate set of methods that can improve the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Finding the most effective way to prepare data requires many manual iterations of trial and error. In this paper, we design and develop Sweeper, a tool that automatically explores combinations of many data quality processing methods and models to rank and identify the most suitable one for the given data. Sweeper is simple to use and can reduce the manual workload for practitioners in improving data classification performance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Clinical manifestations include strokes, transient ischaemic events, psychiatric disturbances, dementia, and migraines. We report a case of a Thai man with a severe CADASIL phenotype who presented with recurrent seizures and acute ischaemic stroke and classic vascular risk factors. Case presentation: A 50-year-old man with a history of mood disorder and progressive cognitive decline for 20 years as well as well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with recurrent generalized seizures and acute right-sided weakness. An MRI of the brain showed acute infarction of the left pons, a large number of cerebral microbleeds throughout the brain and white matter abnormalities without classic anterior temporal lobe lesions. Molecular genetic testing identified a homozygous pathologic variant, c.1672C > T (p. Arg558Cys), in the NOTCH3 gene. The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed. His clinical symptoms deteriorated, and he died of tracheobronchitis with secretion obstruction.

Optimizing Vancomycin Use Through 2-Point AUC-Based Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Pediatric Patients,"Suchartlikitwong P., Anugulruengkitt S., Wacharachaisurapol N., Jantarabenjakul W., Sophonphan J., Theerawit T., Chatsuwan T., Wattanavijitkul T., Puthanakit T.",2019-12-01,"Adolescent, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Area Under Curve, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Monitoring, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Prospective Studies, Staphylococcal Infections, Vancomycin, Area under the serum concentration-time curve, Equation, Outcome, Pediatric, Trough concentration, Vancomycin","The 24-hour vancomycin area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC24) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC24/MIC) is more closely related to patient outcomes than serum trough concentrations (Ctrough). Two-point simplified equations for calculating AUC based on serum peak concentrations (Cpeak) and Ctrough, named equation A (EqA) and equation B (EqB), have recently been adopted into clinical use for adult pediatric patients. We aimed to find the agreement between predicted AUC24 using the reference method (ref) relative to EqA and EqB and the correlation between Ctrough and AUC24. From June to December 2018, 43 pediatric patients with normal renal function, receiving 15 mg/kg of vancomycin intravenously every 6 hours, were enrolled. The pediatric patients’ median age was 2.2 years (range 0.1-15.3). At steady state, vancomycin Cpeak and Ctrough were measured at 2 hours after infusion completion and within 30 minutes before the next dosing, respectively. AUC24 was estimated using ref, EqA, and EqB. From Bland-Altman analysis, the 2 AUC24s estimated by ref and EqA showed less bias than those estimated by ref and EqB (bias 1.3 and –72.1 mg⋅h/L, respectively). Ctrough and AUC24 using either ref or EqA were correlated more closely (r2 = 0.94) than with EqB (r2 = 0.86). Assuming a vancomycin MIC of 1 mg/L, an AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L was targeted. Regardless of the method used, AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L was never seen with Ctrough <8 mg/L but was always seen with Ctrough >10 mg/L. In conclusion, EqA based on the 2 measured serum concentrations was sufficiently accurate for AUC24 estimation. Ctrough >10 mg/L correlated highly to AUC24 ≥400 mg⋅h/L.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

The simulation of first and second dimension time (1tR and 2tR) of FAME relies on use of a Gibbs energy additivity approach to correlate with the structures of FAME. First and second dimension peak standard deviations (1σ and 2σ) of the compounds were further calculated from the 1tR and 2tR data according to the plate height concept which provided good agreement between the predicted and experimental peak widths at half height in one dimension GC (1DGC) with an overall R2 of 0.9628. The effect of 1σ distortion caused by the modulation process was also taken into account in the peak width simulation where the simulated 1σ data were rounded up to multiples of the scale of modulation period (PM). Two dimension Gaussian equations were then used to generate GC × GC results (2D contour plots) from simulated 1tR, 2tR, 1σ and 2σ data for FAME separation on different column sets employing ionic liquid and conventional columns. Good overall correlations between experimental and simulated 1tR and 2tR were obtained with R2 of 0.9951 and 0.9802, respectively, and the simulated 2D contour plots were an acceptable match with the experimental results.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

All 22 products obtained were evaluated against three different α-glucosidases (maltase, sucrase and Baker's yeast glucosidase) and DPPH radical. Of furofuran lignans evaluated, β-14, having two catechol moieties and one acetoxy group, was the most potent inhibitor against Baker's yeast, maltase, and sucrase with IC 50 values of 5.3, 25.7, and 12.9 µM, respectively. Of interest, its inhibitory potency toward Baker's yeast was 28 times greater than standard drug, acarbose and its DPPH radical scavenging (SC 50 11.2 µM) was 130 times higher than commercial antioxidant BHT. Subsequent investigation on mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of β-14 revealed that it blocked Baker's yeast and sucrase functions by mixed-type inhibition while it exerted non-competitive inhibition toward maltase. Molecular dynamics simulation of the most potent furofuran lignans (4, α-8b, α-14, and β-14) with the homology rat intestinal maltase at the binding site revealed that the hydrogen bond interactions from catechol, acetoxy, and quinone moieties of furofuran lignans were the key interaction to bind tightly to α-glucosidase. The results indicated that β-14 possessed promising antidiabetic activity through simultaneously inhibiting α-glucosidases and free radicals.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of carbetocin administration after the first piglet was born on farrowing duration, birth interval, colostrum consumption and vitality index in newborn piglets. In total, 186 sows and their offspring (n = 2611 piglets) were distributed into three groups: 1) CONTROL: sows were allowed to farrow naturally (n = 66); 2) OXY: sows were administered oxytocin 20 IU intramuscularly after the first piglet was born (n = 62); and 3) CARBE: sows were administered carbetocin 0.6 μg/kg intramuscularly after the first piglet was born (n = 58). The reproductive data of sows including farrowing duration, total number of piglets born per litter (TB), number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), proportion of stillborn piglets per litter (SB) and proportion of mummified fetuses per litter (MF) were recorded. Piglet vitality index including skin colour, integrity of the umbilical cord, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, screaming score, udder stimulation score, movement capacity and number of completed circles around enclosure were determined. Birth weights of the piglets were measured immediately at birth and again at 24 h thereafter to determine the individual colostrum intake of the piglets. On average, the farrowing duration, birth interval and BA were 188.0 ± 95.7 min, 12.5 ± 18.3 min, and 12.3 ± 2.9 piglets per litter, respectively. The farrowing duration of the sows was reduced in CARBE group (151.2 ± 11.9 min) compared to OXY (180.2 ± 11.5 min, P = 0.003) and CONTROL (227.7 ± 11.2 min, P < 0.001) groups. Birth interval of piglets in all categories of birth weight in the CARBE group was shorter than those in the CONTROL group (P < 0.05). However, the colostrum yield of sows in CARBE group (2398 ± 133 g) was lower than CONTROL and OXY groups (3371 ± 125 g and 3549 ± 128 g, respectively; P < 0.001). Similarly, colostrum intake of piglets in the CONTROL and OXY groups was higher than in the CARBE group (276.4 ± 11.0 g, 286.4 ± 13.6 g and 225.3 ± 14.0 g, respectively; P < 0.05). The percentage of stillborn piglets in CARBE was higher than OXY (8.7 ± 1.1% vs 5.3 ± 1.1%, P < 0.05) but did not differ significantly compared to CONTROL (7.5 ± 1.1%, P > 0.05). The piglet movement capacity in CONTROL was lower than CARBE group (1.36 vs 1.48, P < 0.05) but was not different compared to OXY group (1.40, P > 0.05). In conclusion, administration of carbetocin after the birth of the first piglet reduced the farrowing duration of sows, but increased the number of stillborn piglets and reduced the colostrum yield of sows.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Extracted VOCs (<200 Da) and SVOCs were analysed by gas chromatography (GC), and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) with flame ionisation (FID) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) detection. Results showed CSC extraction presented poor recovery of VOCs and SVOCs released during roasting. However, XAD-2 was able to collect both groups, including SVOCs of >400 Da. GC × GC resolved many co-eluting compounds observed in 1D GC and allowed chemical group type cluster analysis, revealing that many non-polar VOCs are observed within the 0–3 min interval, and that the release of polar and higher molar mass SVOCs were mostly found within the 3–6 min interval. These group-type cluster analyses offer a broad spectrum chemical profile of the released substances.

The alloys displayed the opaque state below 40 °C. The alloys were transformed to the transparent state upon exposing to the transition temperature of 60–130 °C, depending on the molecular weights and mass concentrations of urethane prepolymers in the BA-a/PU alloys. The optical state transitions were reversible with small hystereses. BA-a/PU alloys exhibited a good optical contrast with 0%T at the light scattering state and almost 100%T at the transparent state. The alloys were glassy and form-stable up to 250 °C, due to the synergistic behavior in the glass transition temperatures. The reaction-induced phase separation effectuated by the incorporation of urethane prepolymer into thermosetting polybenzoxazine, the sizes and local concentrations of the phase-separated urethane microdomains in the supporting polybenzoxazine matrix, and the reversible dissolution and demixing of urethane microdomains and polybenzoxazine phase played crucial roles on TRLS properties of the developed benzoxazine-urethane alloys.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Background: Although high-quality treatment and modern hypertension clinical practice guidelines have been developed worldwide, the outcomes of patients with hypertension in Thailand are not optimal. Implementing a person-centred and integrated health services model to improve hypertension management, such as a community-based intervention, is challenging for healthcare providers in Thailand. Design: An observational study of a community-based intervention. Methods: The study comprised residents in 17 villages in one province of Thailand. A sample of 156 participants was allocated into the intervention and the control groups. Inclusion criteria were people aged 60 years or older diagnosed with hypertension. Exclusion criteria included the latest record of extreme hypertension and having a documented history of cognitive impairment. The intervention group received the 4-week community-based intervention programme. Multiple linear regression was applied to predict the adherence status at each phase. Multiple logistic regression was then implemented to predict influencing factors between the groups. Results: Patients who received the intervention had significantly lower adherence scores (reflecting a higher level of adherence) at 3 and 6 months after intervention by 1.66 and 1.45 times, respectively, when adjusting for other variables. After 6 months, the intervention was associated with a significant improvement in adherence when adjusting for other variables. Conclusion: This study provides evidence to support the use of community-based interventions as an effective adjunct to hospital-based care of hypertension patients in Thailand. Implications for practice: Understanding factors between health outcomes and social determinants of health is crucial for informing the development of culturally appropriate interventions.",Nursing,Gerontology

A previous study showed that the vaccine was immunologically non-inferior to the HSA-containing vaccine and well-tolerated in toddlers; low-grade fever was numerically higher in children receiving the vaccine without HSA, but the study lacked power to conclude on this difference. Methods: In this phase III, double-blind, multi-center study, healthy 12-23-month-olds were randomized (1:1) to receive two doses of the varicella vaccine without (Var-HSA group) or with HSA (Var + HSA group) at days 0 and 42. The primary objective compared safety of the vaccines in terms of incidence of fever > 39.0 °C in the 15-day period post-first vaccination. The objective was considered met if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the incidence of fever > 39.0 °C was ≤5% (Var-HSA group minus Var + HSA group). Safety, reactogenicity and immune responses were evaluated. Results: Six hundred fifteen children in the Var-HSA group and 616 in the Var + HSA group received ≥1 vaccination. Fever > 39.0 °C was reported in 3.9 and 5.2% of participants in the Var-HSA and Var + HSA groups, with a between-group difference of - 1.29 (95% confidence interval: - 3.72-1.08); therefore, the primary objective was achieved. Fever rates post-each dose and the incidence of solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) were comparable between groups. Unsolicited AEs were reported for 43.9 and 36.5% of children in the Var-HSA group and 45.8 and 36.0% of children in the Var + HSA group, during 43 days post-dose 1 and 2, respectively. Serious AEs occurred in 2.1% (group Var-HSA) and 2.4% (group Var + HSA) of children, throughout the study. In a sub-cohort of 364 children, all had anti-varicella-zoster virus antibody concentrations ≥50 mIU/mL post-dose 2; comparable geometric mean concentrations were observed between the groups. Conclusions: The varicella vaccine formulated without HSA did not induce higher rates of fever during the 15 day-post-vaccination period, as compared with the original HSA-containing vaccine.

We believe that with decreasing costs of NGS, increasing ability to interpret the genomic data, a greater number of actionable and available treatments, implementation of precision medicine at the public health level is not a matter of if but when.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"
Surfactant assisted CaO-based sorbent synthesis and their application to high-temperature CO2 capture,"Jamrunroj P., Wongsakulphasatch S., Maneedaeng A., Cheng C.K., Assabumrungrat S.",2019-02-15,"CaCO3, Carbon dioxide emissions, CO2 sorption, Gemini surfactant, Hydrophobic chains, Precipitation techniques, Single chain surfactants, Surfactant assisted, CaCO3, CaO-based sorbent, CO2 sorption, Gemini surfactant, SDS","The concern of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a main contribution of greenhouse gases, has been emerged as an important issue for environmental impact. Adsorption of CO2 by porous solid materials is proven to be one of efficient techniques for CO2 capture technologies. In the present work, attempted has been made to improve property of porous solid materials, CaO-based sorbent, applied for high-temperature CO2 capture. CaCO3 and CaO-based alumina was synthesized using precipitation technique with the addition of sulfonic single chain (SDS) and gemini (12-carbon hydrophobic chains and 3-carbon alkyl spacer, 12-3-12) surfactants for controlling/modifying physical properties. Our studies showed that the addition of anionic surfactants affected phase formation and polymorph of CaCO3, where stronger effect was observed with gemini surfactant. The synthetic CaCO3 was derived to form CaO and applied for capturing CO2 at 600 °C, 15% v/v CO2 (N2 balanced). The results showed that CaO synthesized with adding gemini surfactant offered higher CO2 sorption capacity than single chain surfactant. By incorporating calcium with alumina using co-precipitation technique, the addition of gemini surfactant showed a good impact on CO2 capture performance as an increase in CO2 sorption capacity was observed. However, sintering effect was still not yet be resolved with the addition of gemini surfactant as CO2 sorption capacity decreased upon multiple cycles of CO2 capture.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)

This task is considered to pertain to fundamental knowledge in applied microbiology. Some previous investigations conducted the study by applying feature-based models; others have presented deep-learning-based models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks used with the shortest dependency paths (SDPs). Although SDPs contain valuable and concise information, some parts of crucial information that is required to define bacterial location relationships are often neglected. Moreover, the traditional word-embedding used in previous studies may suffer from word ambiguation across linguistic contexts. Results: Here, we present a deep learning model for biomedical RE. The model incorporates feature combinations of SDPs and full sentences with various attention mechanisms. We also used pre-trained contextual representations based on domain-specific vocabularies. To assess the model's robustness, we introduced a mean F1 score on many models using different random seeds. The experiments were conducted on the standard BB corpus in BioNLP-ST'16. Our experimental results revealed that the model performed better (in terms of both maximum and average F1 scores; 60.77% and 57.63%, respectively) compared with other existing models. Conclusions: We demonstrated that our proposed contributions to this task can be used to extract rich lexical, syntactic, and semantic features that effectively boost the model's performance. Moreover, we analyzed the trade-off between precision and recall to choose the proper cut-off to use in real-world applications.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, computer science, Mathematics","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics"
Reduced Time to Suppression among Neonates with HIV Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy Within 7 Days after Birth,"Dominguez-Rodriguez S., Tagarro A., Palma P., Foster C., Puthanakit T., Jupimai T., Cotugno N., Ananworanich J., Zangari P., Nastouli E., Munoz-Fernandez M.A., Navarro M.L., Giaquinto C., Rossi P., Kuhn L., Rojo P.",2019-12-15,"Anti-HIV Agents, CD4 Lymphocyte Count, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Follow-Up Studies, HIV Infections, HIV Protease Inhibitors, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical, Male, Retrospective Studies, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Time Factors, Viral Load, early treated, HIV, infants, neonates, newborns, viral load, viral suppression","There are limited data on infants with HIV starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the neonatal period. We investigated the association between the timing of ART initiation and time-to-suppression among infants who tested HIV-positive and initiated ART within the first 28 days of life. The effect was estimated using cumulative probability flexible parametric spline models and a multivariable generalized additive mixed model was performed to test nonlinear associations. Forty-four neonates were included. Nineteen (43.2%) initiated ART within 7 days of life and 25 (56.8%) from 8 to 28 days. Infants treated within 7 days were 4-fold more likely to suppress earlier than those treated after 7 days [Hazard ratio (HR) 4.01 (1.7-9.5)]. For each week the ART initiation was delayed, the probability of suppression decreased by 35% (HR 0.65 [0.46-0.92]). Age at ART start was linearly associated with time-to-suppression. However, a linear association with normally distributed residuals was not found between baseline viral load and time-to-suppression, with no association found when baseline viral loads were ≤5 log(10) copies/mL, but with exponential increase in time-to-suppression with > log5 copies/mL at baseline. Starting ART within 7 days of life led to 4-fold faster time to viral suppression, in comparison to initiation from 8 to 28 days.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; diagnosis and disease monitoring, medical","Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"
Anatomical Variations of Iliac Vein Tributaries and Their Clinical Implications during Complex Pelvic Surgeries,"Kanjanasilp P., Ng J.L., Kajohnwongsatit K., Thiptanakit C., Limvorapitak T., Sahakitrungruang C.",2019-07-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anatomic Variation, Cadaver, Dissection, Female, Humans, Iliac Vein, Male, Middle Aged, Pelvic Exenteration, Pelvis, Sacrum, Cadaver, Iliac vein anatomy, Pelvic exenteration, Presacral area","BACKGROUND: During high sacrectomies and lateral pelvic compartment exenterations, isolating the external and internal iliac veins within the presacral area is crucial to avoid inadvertent injury and severe hemorrhage. Anatomical variations of external iliac vein tributaries have not been previously described, whereas multiple classifications of internal iliac vein tributaries exist. OBJECTIVE: We sought to clarify the iliac venous system anatomy using soft-embalmed cadavers. DESIGN: This is a descriptive study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted in Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. PATIENTS: We examined 40 iliac venous systems from 20 human cadavers (10 males, 10 females). INTERVENTIONS: Blue resin dye infused into the inferior vena cava highlighted the iliac venous system, which was meticulously dissected and traced to their draining organs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Iliac vein tributaries and their valvular system were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: The external iliac vein classically receives 2 tributaries (inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac) near the inguinal ligament. However, external iliac vein tributaries in the presacral area were found in 20 venous systems among 15 cadavers (75%). The mean diameter of each tributary was 4.0 ± 0.35 mm, with 72% arising laterally. We propose a simplified classification for internal iliac vein variations: pattern 1 in 12 cadavers (60%) where a single internal iliac vein joins a single external iliac vein to drain into the common iliac vein; pattern 2 in 7 cadavers (35%) where the internal iliac vein is duplicated; and pattern 3 in 1 cadaver (5%) where bilateral internal iliac veins drain into a common trunk before joining the common iliac vein bifurcation. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by the number of cadavers included. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive understanding of previously unreported highly prevalent external iliac vein tributaries in the presacral region is vital during complex pelvic surgery. A simplified classification of internal iliac vein variations is proposed.",medical,Gastroenterology

Herein, we study the Mo2C on pyridinic nitrogen-doped defective carbon sheets (MoNCs) as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Theoretical calculations imply that the introduction of Mo2C produces a graphene wave structure, which in some senses behaves like N doping to form localized charges. Being an active electrocatalyst, MoNCs demonstrate a Tafel slope as low as 60.6 mV dec−1 and high durability of up to 10 h in acidic media. Besides charge engineering, plentiful defects and hierarchical morphology also contribute to good performance.

Many building energy management (BEM) software platforms are commercially available to monitor and control energy consumption. These platforms are hosted on the physical hardware within the building, due to which the hardware specifications limit their performance. To address this limitation, cloud technology emerged which facilitates software to be deployed at a remote location that has scalable hardware resources. Conventional BEM software can leverage such a cloud platform to offer scalable and maintenance-free installation. Once hosted on a remote cloud platform, BEM software lacks direct connectivity to building sensors/controllers, hence requires a device to support remote accessibility. Most devices are bound to a local area network and therefore, need an additional functional layer on top of its communication stack to perform network address translation (NAT)-Traversal. This functionality is implemented on a scalable software which connects to the devices in the network and acts as a gateway for cloud-based BEM software to access devices in the local area network. Any message sent to this gateway is translated to a respective device protocol. This paper describes the design and implementation of such an Internet of Things (IoT) gateway for a cloud-based BEM system that requires support for BACnet, Modbus, and HTTP RESTful interface devices.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Information Systems, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications"

An array of datasets has been generated with the use of diverse emotion-eliciting stimuli and the resulting brainwave responses conventionally captured with high-end EEG devices. However, the applicability of these devices is to some extent limited by practical constraints and may prove difficult to be deployed in highly mobile context omnipresent in everyday happenings. In this study, we evaluate the potential of OpenBCI to bridge this gap by first comparing its performance to research grade EEG system, employing the same algorithms that were applied on benchmark datasets. Moreover, for the purpose of emotion classification, we propose a novel method to facilitate the selection of audio-visual stimuli of high/low valence and arousal. Our setup entailed recruiting 200 healthy volunteers of varying years of age to identify the top 60 affective video clips from a total of 120 candidates through standardized self assessment, genre tags, and unsupervised machine learning. In addition, 43 participants were enrolled to watch the pre-selected clips during which emotional EEG brainwaves and peripheral physiological signals were collected. These recordings were analyzed and extracted features fed into a classification model to predict whether the elicited signals were associated with a high or low level of valence and arousal. As it turned out, our prediction accuracies were decidedly comparable to those of previous studies that utilized more costly EEG amplifiers for data acquisition.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
"Eotaxin, an Endogenous Cognitive Deteriorating Chemokine (ECDC), Is a Major Contributor to Cognitive Decline in Normal People and to Executive, Memory, and Sustained Attention Deficits, Formal Thought Disorders, and Psychopathology in Schizophrenia Patients","Sirivichayakul S., Kanchanatawan B., Thika S., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2019-01-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aging, Biomarkers, Case-Control Studies, Chemokine CCL11, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Processes, Middle Aged, Schizophrenia, Schizophrenic Psychology, Young Adult, Cytokines, Immune, Inflammation, Interleukin, Neurocognition, Schizophrenia","Eotaxin is increased in neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia, and preclinical studies indicate that eotaxin may induce cognitive deficits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral levels of eotaxin impact cognitive functioning in healthy volunteers and formal thought disorder (FTD) and psychopathology in schizophrenia patients. Serum levels of eotaxin were assayed and cognitive tests were performed on a sample of 40 healthy participants and 80 schizophrenia patients. Among healthy participants, eotaxin levels were significantly associated with episodic/semantic memory, executive functions, Mini Mental State Examination, emotion recognition, and sustained attention. In addition, age-related effects on these cognitive measures were partly mediated by eotaxin. The super-variable “age-eotaxin” predicted a large part of the variance in cognitive functions among healthy participants, and hence, eotaxin may act as an “accelerated brain aging chemokine” (ABAC). In schizophrenia, eotaxin levels had a strong impact on formal thought disorders and psychopathology. In schizophrenia, increased eotaxin strongly impacts memory and sustained attention, which together to a large extent determine FTD. FTD together with memory deficits predicts around 92.5% of the variance in psychopathology. Moreover, the effects of eotaxin are partially mediated by executive functioning, while the effects of male sex on FTD and psychopathology are mediated by eotaxin. In healthy subjects, eotaxin strongly impacts executive functioning and multiple cognitive domains. In schizophrenia, peripheral levels of eotaxin strongly impact both negative symptoms and psychosis (hallucinations and delusions), and these eotaxin effects are mediated by impairments in frontal functioning, memory, sustained attention, and FTD. Eotaxin is an endogenous cognitive deteriorating chemokine (ECDC) and a novel therapeutic target for age-related cognitive decline and schizophrenia as well.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

Currently, there are no validated questionnaires specifically to assess nocturnal hypokinesia in PD patients. Objective: To develop and validate a questionnaire to assess PD patients’ problems associated with turning or getting out of bed. Methods: The nocturnal hypokinesia questionnaire (NHQ) consists of 10 items, completed independently by patients and their caregivers. For validation, 76 patient-caregiver pairs completed the questionnaire and validity, agreement levels, and internal consistency assessed. In addition, 76 healthy couples served as controls. The NHQ and Modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) were compared and 25 random patients-caregiver pairs were also assessed with objective night-time monitoring. Results: Patient and caregiver scores showed a high level of agreement (Intra-class correlation: 0.84) with high internal consistency (KR-20 coefficient of 0.73 for patients and 0.69 for caregivers). No significant difference between the mean total NHQ scores as rated by patients and caregivers was observed. Mean NHQ scores from patients and caregivers were significantly higher than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Moderate correlations were found between the NHQ and PDSS-2 (r = 0.32, p = 0.004), and with objective monitoring (Number of turns: r = −0.41, p = 0.04, Degree of turn: r = −0.44, p = 0.02). Conclusion: The NHQ is a reliable instrument to identify symptoms of nocturnal hypokinesia amongst PD patients.

Optimization of Lignin Extraction from Pine Wood for Fast Pyrolysis by Using a γ-Valerolactone-Based Binary Solvent System,"Jampa S., Puente-Urbina A., Ma Z., Wongkasemjit S., Luterbacher J.S., Van Bokhoven J.A.",2019-02-18,"Binary solvent systems, Bio oil, Extraction conditions, Fast pyrolysis, Increasing temperatures, Lignocellulosic biomass, Product selectivities, Sulfuric acid solution, bio-oil, fast pyrolysis, lignin, lignocellulosic biomass, γ-valerolactone (GVL)","Fast pyrolysis of lignin is a promising method to produce aromatic chemicals and fuels. Lignin structure and pyrolysis conditions determine the liquid yield and product selectivity. Extraction of pine wood using γ-valerolactone (GVL) mixed with water in the presence of diluted sulfuric acid obtains lignin (GVL-lignin) which shows different product yield and selectivity. The composition of the extraction medium influences the yield of GVL-lignin and affects its native structure. The GVL-to-water ratio affects the lignin yield without significantly modifying the structure of the extracted lignin, whereas the sulfuric acid concentration affects both the extraction yield and the extracted lignin structure. These structural changes influence the product distribution after fast pyrolysis, which generates phenols and alkoxy phenols as the main products in the liquid fraction. Lignin extracted with a mixture of 4/1 of GVL/H 2 O (w/w) and 0.075 M sulfuric acid solution produces the highest pyrolysis liquid yield. Pyrolysis of GVL-lignin at 750 °C generates the maximum liquid yield. The amount of phenols in fast pyrolysis products increases with increasing temperature and sulfuric acid concentration used in the GVL-lignin extraction. This indicates that the extraction conditions of GVL-lignin may be optimized to increase the selectivity in fast pyrolysis.","mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Using tapered, cementless stem for patients with stovepipe morphology or Dorr type C is controversial. The purpose of this study is to analyze (1) subsidence of the fully hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated, tapered, cementless stem in different morphology according to Dorr classification, (2) subsidence of the stem related to radiographic canal-fill ratio. Methods: The digitized radiographs of 311 consecutive cementless primary total hip arthroplasty with fully HA-coated, tapered stem were retrospectively reviewed. Subsidence and the canal-fill ratio at 4 locations were evaluated postoperatively after a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. The threshold of subsidence >3 mm was considered as a clinically significant migration. Results: A multivariate regression analysis of subsidence across Dorr type, controlling for age, gender, and intraoperative calcar fracture, demonstrated 0.40 mm (P =.28) and 0.18 mm (P =.51) greater subsidence in Dorr type C and B when compared to Dorr type A. Age, gender, and calcar fracture had no influence on subsidence, whereas greater canal-fill ratio at 2 cm below lesser trochanter resulted in significantly less subsidence (P =.02). Additionally, all variables did not affect the risk of having subsidence >3 mm. Conclusion: The proximal femoral morphology has no statistically significant effect on the subsidence of fully HA-coated stem. Therefore, this stem type might be a viable option for Dorr type C. Increasing the canal-fill ratio at metadiaphyseal junction may ensure the stability of the stem.","orthopedic surgery, medical",Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

This review focuses on the use of µPADs that have the potential to work without batteries or with only small and portable devices such as smartphones, timers, or miniaturized detectors. The µPADs that can be operated without batteries are, in general, those that allow the visual judgment of analyte concentrations via readouts that are measured in time, distance, count, or text. Conversely, a smartphone works as a camera to permit the capture and processing of an image that digitizes the color intensity produced by the reaction of an analyte with a colorimetric reagent. Miniaturized detectors for electrochemical, fluorometric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemiluminescence methods are also discussed, although some of them require the use of a laptop computer for operation and data processing.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry","Instrumentation, Spectroscopy"

Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both. Methods: Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article. Results: Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic acid metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia, as well as more general prenatal stressors, modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.

Attention was paid to discriminate whether the ascending mental artery arose from the submental artery or the sublingual artery using the arch of the mylohyoid muscle as the discriminating landmark. Results: Incidence of ascending mental artery from the sublingual artery was 7.1% in the studied population. All ascending mental arteries were 0.7 ± 0.2 mm in diameter at the mental protuberance and were branches of the submental artery that arose from the facial artery, except for two arteries that arose from the sublingual artery. Ultrasonographic study revealed that one left and one right sublingual artery from the lingual arteries penetrated the mylohyoid muscle near the midline to become the ascending mental artery in two volunteers.

A folding affinity paper-based electrochemical impedance device for cardiovascular risk assessment,"Boonyasit Y., Chailapakul O., Laiwattanapaisal W.",2019-04-01,"C-reactive proteins, Cardiovascular risk assessments, ELectrochemical detection, Electrochemical impedance, Phosphocholine, Single frequency, Biosensing Techniques, C-Reactive Protein, Cardiovascular Diseases, Electric Impedance, Electrochemical Techniques, Humans, Limit of Detection, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors, C-reactive protein, Cardiovascular risk assessment, Label-free electrochemical detection, Paper-based electrochemical impedance device, Phosphocholine-based detection, Single frequency analysis","A novel affinity paper-based electrochemical impedance device (PEID) was first fully developed for cardiovascular risk assessment. Herein, a simple folding PEID comprising a dual screen-printed electrode was fabricated for label-free electrochemical impedance detection. The results demonstrated in a step-wise manner that the phosphocholine-modified screen-printed carbon electrodes were highly responsive to the clinically required range of C-reactive protein (CRP) (0.005 – 500 mg L −1 ; r 2 = 0.993) levels with a detection limit (3σ/slope) of 0.001 mg L −1 . The optimal binding frequency of CRP–phosphocholine interaction was determined to be 100 Hz. These results implied that our proposed system could be used for simultaneously measuring the CRP levels using a single PEID platform in combination with the specific recognition elements. When assaying two levels of CRP, the overall assay reproducibility for each concentration, expressed as relative standard error of the mean (RSE%; n = 30), was 1.21%. The variation in the measurements between individual electrodes, expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was 2.82%. Using 2 measurement sites per device, the proposed sensor provided excellent precision for the simultaneous detection of CRP. Moreover, the RSD for the CRP levels measured on ten independently fabricated paper-based sheets was 2.11%, thereby offering an acceptable fabrication reproducibility. The presented folding PEIDs were used forthe determination of CRP in patient-derived blood samples with minimised bias and excellent correlation with a standard method (n = 15; CUSUM linearity test, p > 0.10), thus permitting the potential application of PEID for assessing cardiovascular risk in individuals.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; animal biotechnology; biosensors, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Our study aimed to evaluate the 24-hr, 28-day, and 7-day post-moisturizing efficacy of ceramide-containing moisturizer in senile xerosis treatment. A split site, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study was conducted in 24 senile subjects (91.7% females, mean age 54.83 ± 5.45 years) with mild to moderate xerosis, who were randomized to receive ceramide-containing moisturizer or hydrophilic cream, daily applied on each side of the shin. A single application of ceramide-containing moisturizer increased skin hydration, while improving transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin pH for up to 24 hr, with statistically significant difference. After 28 days of twice-daily application, more significant improvement on skin hydration, barrier function, and skin pH was observed in those with ceramide-containing moisturizer at all-time points. At day 28, there was a statistically significant decrease of hemoglobin index, wrinkle, and texture on the ceramide treated side. The 7-day post-moisturizing efficacy on the ceramide treated side was superior for skin hydration, TEWL, skin pH, and wrinkle. Thus, the ceramide-containing moisturizer can be a novel promising treatment for senile xerosis.",medical,Dermatology

Understanding the epidemiology and factors for LTFU is complicated by varying LTFU definitions.Setting:Asian regional cohort incorporating 16 pediatric HIV services across 6 countries.Methods:Data from PHIVA (aged 10-19 years) who received combination antiretroviral therapy 2007-2016 were used to analyze LTFU through (1) an International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) method that determined LTFU as >90 days late for an estimated next scheduled appointment without returning to care and (2) the absence of patient-level data for >365 days before the last data transfer from clinic sites. Descriptive analyses and competing-risk survival and regression analyses were used to evaluate LTFU epidemiology and associated factors when analyzed using each method.Results:Of 3509 included PHIVA, 275 (7.8%) met IeDEA and 149 (4.3%) met 365-day absence LTFU criteria. Cumulative incidence of LTFU was 19.9% and 11.8% using IeDEA and 365-day absence criteria, respectively. Risk factors for LTFU across both criteria included the following: age at combination antiretroviral therapy initiation <5 years compared with age ≥5 years, rural clinic settings compared with urban clinic settings, and high viral loads compared with undetectable viral loads. Age 10-14 years compared with age 15-19 years was another risk factor identified using 365-day absence criteria but not IeDEA LTFU criteria.Conclusions:Between 12% and 20% of PHIVA were determined LTFU with treatment fatigue and rural treatment settings consistent risk factors. Better tracking of adolescents is required to provide a definitive understanding of LTFU and optimize evidence-based models of care.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; diagnosis and disease monitoring, medical","Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

We quantified rates and identified factors significantly associated with infectious and non-infectious adverse events in clinical practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of data from a multicenter consortium database (from May 2014 through June 2017). Infectious and non-infectious adverse events were defined as those requiring antibiotics, hospitalization, vedolizumab discontinuation, or resulting in death. Rates were quantified as proportions and events per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE) or follow up (PYF). We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors significantly associated with events and reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Results: Our analysis comprised 1087 patients (650 with CD and 437 with UC; 55% female; median age, 37 years) with 861 PYE and 955 PYF. Infections were observed in 68 patients (6.3%; 7.9 per 100 PYE, 7.1 per 100 PYF); gastrointestinal infections (n = 31, 2.4 per 100 PYE, 2.2 per 100 PYF) and respiratory infections (n = 14, 1.6 per 100 PYE, 1.5 per 100 PYF) were the most common. Arthralgias were the most common non-infectious adverse events (n = 31, 2.9%; 3.6 per 100 PYE).

Preservation of the colo-anal reflex in colonic transection and post-operative Hirschsprung's disease: Potential extrinsic neural pathway,"Sintusek P., Rybak A., Mutalib M., Thapar N., Borrelli O., Lindley K.J.",2019-01-01,"Adolescent, Anal Canal, Child, Colon, Colostomy, Constipation, Female, Hirschsprung Disease, Humans, Male, Reflex, Retrospective Studies, colo-anal reflex, high-resolution colonic manometry, Hirschsprung’s disease, internal anal sphincter, recto-anal inhibitory reflex, slow transit constipation","Background: The colo-anal reflex is a distinct reflex whereby the internal anal sphincter (IAS) relaxes in association with colonic high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) in contrast to the recto-anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), which is characterized by IAS relaxation upon rectal distension. The RAIR is mediated by the myenteric plexus and therefore absent in Hirschsprung disease. We retrospectively assessed the presence and the characteristics of the colo-anal reflex in children in whom large bowel continuity had been surgically disrupted to assess the role of the extrinsic nervous system in the reflex. Methods: High-resolution (HR) colonic manometry and HR-anorectal manometry were used to evaluate both colonic and anal motor activity in ten children with treatment-unresponsive slow transit constipation (STC), who had previously undergone left-sided colostomy formation with consequent disruption of the bowel continuity, and in two children with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), who had previously undergone distal colon resection followed by Duhamel pull-through. Eight children with STC, normal colonic motor activity, and preserved large bowel continuity served as a control group. The presence and characteristics of colo-anal reflex were analyzed. Key Results: In the study group, all patients showed the presence of both normal HAPCs and the presence of the colo-anal reflex. In two cases of HSCR, RAIR was absent; however, both patients demonstrated a colo-anal reflex. Conclusions: In children with disrupted continuity of the colon and/or abnormal anal reflex, the colo-anal reflex is still preserved suggesting that it is mediated by a different pathway from the RAIR, possibly an extrinsic neural pathway.","neuroscienceoscience; physicsiology and pharmacologymacology of the peripheral nervous system; innervation of the intestine, biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Physiology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Gastroenterology"
Furosemide Stress Test as a Predicting Biomarker for Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplantation,"Udomkarnjananun S., Townamchai N., Iampenkhae K., Petchlorlian A., Srisawat N., Katavetin P., Sutherasan M., Santingamkun A., Praditpornsilpa K., Eiam-Ong S., Avihingsanon Y.",2019-04-01,"Adult, Biomarkers, Delayed Graft Function, Diuretics, Female, Furosemide, Humans, Kidney Transplantation, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Acute tubular necrosis, Allograft biopsy, Delayed graft function, Furosemide stress test, Kidney transplantation","Background: Delayed graft function (DGF) could worsen early and long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation (KT). DGF is caused by several pre-transplantation and perioperative factors in both donors and recipients. At present, there are no biomarkers or tests during the immediate post-KT period that can accurately predict the development of DGF. Materials and methods: This prospective study was conducted in deceased donor KT (DDKT) at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. All recipients underwent furosemide stress test (FST) by receiving a single dose of intravenous furosemide, 1.5 mg/kg at 3 h after allograft reperfusion. We determined the correlations between DGF (requiring dialysis within the first week after transplantation) and the values of urine volume recorded hourly after FST until 6 h, the parameters of postoperative dynamic tests, including resistive index (RI) of renal arteries and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Results: Of the 59 total DDKT recipients enrolled, 24 developed DGF. The FST is a more accurate biomarker than urine NGAL, RI of renal arteries, and ERPF in the prediction of DGF. The 4-h urine volume less than 350 mL (FST non-responsive) was the best cut-off value in predicting DGF with 87.5% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, and 82.5% accuracy. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed an odds ratio of 0.993 (0.986-0.999, p = 0.035) for the 4-h urine volume to predict DGF. Conclusions: The FST is a simple and accurate biomarker for predicting DGF in early post-KT period. Close monitoring and well prepared dialysis are suggested in patients with urine volume < 350 mL after 4 h of FST. The FST non-responsive patients could be the target for further DGF preventive intervention.

Periostin plays role in force-induced stem cell potential by periodontal ligament stem cells,"Panchamanon P., Pavasant P., Leethanakul C.",2019-05-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Biomarkers, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cell Differentiation, Humans, Mechanotransduction, Cellular, Molar, Third, Osteogenesis, Periodontal Ligament, Stem Cells, Young Adult, compressive force, periodontal ligament, POSTN, stem cells","Mechanical stimuli have been shown to play an important role in directing stem cell fate and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. One of the functions of the mechanoresponsive tissue periodontal ligament (PDL) is to withstand the functional forces within the oral cavity. Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) derived from periodontal tissue have been demonstrated to be able to respond directly to mechanical forces. However, the mechanisms of action of mechanical force on PDLSCs are not totally understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which compressive force affects PDLSCs, especially their stemness properties. PDLSCs were established from extracted human third molars; their stem cell characteristics were validated by detecting the expression of stem cell markers and confirming their ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. PDLSCs were subjected to various magnitudes of static compressive force (0 [control], 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2 g/cm2). Application of 1.0 g/cm2 compressive force significantly upregulated a panel of stem cell marker genes, including NANOG and OCT4. Conversely, higher force magnitudes downregulated these genes. Mechanical loading also upregulated periostin, a matrix protein that plays important roles in tissue morphogenesis. Interestingly, knockdown of periostin using siRNA abolished force-induced stem cell marker expression in PDLSCs. This study suggests a proper magnitude of compressive force could be one important factor involved in the modulation of the pluripotency of PDLSCs through the action of periostin. The precise mechanism by which periostin regulates stemness requires further detailed investigation.",biochemistryistry,Cell Biology

Moreover, skin irritation is a common side effect. Therefore, proretinal nanoparticles (PRN) as a novel formulation of topical retinoids, which are based on chitosan grafted with retinal through reversible linkage, were developed and their skin penetration behavior was studied. As nanoparticles preferably penetrate into the hair follicles, the follicular penetration depths of PRN at different time points were investigated. Moreover, the release capacity of the nanoparticulate system was studied using fluorescein as a model drug. Additionally, the concentration of retinal in the stratum corneum and in the hair follicles was quantified after application in particulate and non-particulate form. The results showed that the nanocarriers reached the infundibular area of the hair follicles, irrespective of the incubation time. The nanoparticles were able to release their model drug within the hair follicle. The retinal concentration delivered to the stratum corneum and the hair follicles was significantly higher when retinal was applied in the particulate form. In conclusion, the presented proretinal nanoparticle system may help to overcome the main problems of topical retinoid therapy, which are skin irritation, chemical and photochemical instability and low bioavailability, thus improving the topical retinoid therapy.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Science"

Results: Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced IL-8 production. Pre-treatment of cells with TLR2 and TLR4 inhibitors, before stimulation, reduced IL-8 production. Zinc gluconate was used for verification. Zinc can significantly suppress IL-8 production in the system. Treatment of cells with LTA+PGN or LPS resulted in increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression on the cell surface.

Emerging evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has been linked to hypertension in the general population, may play role in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, including preeclampsia–eclampsia. However, little research has been conducted in Asia (no data in Thailand) on the effects of OSA on preeclampsia–eclampsia. We aimed to examine the association between OSA and preeclampsia–eclampsia among Thai pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a large prospective cohort study among Thai pregnant women who were in the second trimester of singleton pregnancy. The Berlin Questionnaire was administered to evaluate the risk for OSA. Preeclampsia–eclampsia was diagnosed by standard clinical assessment. Multivariate models were applied in adjustment for confounding factors. Results: Enrolled were 1345 pregnant women. The overall prevalence of high risk for OSA was 10.1% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 8.5–11.7), and it was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress Scale. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) for preeclampsia–eclampsia in women with high risk for OSA was 2.72 (95% CI 1.33–5.57). Conclusions: Pregnant women with high risk for OSA are at increased risks for preeclampsia–eclampsia compared to those with low risk for OSA.

Strategies for developing functional secretory epithelia from porcine salivary gland explant outgrowth culture models,"Urkasemsin G., Castillo P., Rungarunlert S., Klincumhom N., Ferreira J.N.",2019-11-01,"Animals, Cell Differentiation, Epithelium, Salivary Glands, Swine, Tissue Engineering, Neurons, Porcine, Primary cells, Progenitor cells, Salivary glands, Secretory epithelia, Xerostomia","Research efforts have been made to develop human salivary gland (SG) secretory epithelia for transplantation in patients with SG hypofunction and dry mouth (xerostomia). However, the limited availability of human biopsies hinders the generation of sufficient cell numbers for epithelia formation and regeneration. Porcine SG have several similarities to their human counterparts, hence could replace human cells in SG modelling studies in vitro. Our study aims to establish porcine SG explant outgrowth models to generate functional secretory epithelia for regeneration purposes to rescue hyposalivation. Cells were isolated and expanded from porcine submandibular and parotid gland explants. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and gene arrays were performed to assess proliferation, standard mesenchymal stem cell, and putative SG epithelial stem/progenitor cell markers. Epithelial differentiation was induced and different SG-specific markers investigated. Functional assays upon neurostimulation determined α-amylase activity, trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and calcium influx. Primary cells exhibited SG epithelial progenitors and proliferation markers. After differentiation, SG markers were abundantly expressed resembling epithelial lineages (E-cadherin, Krt5, Krt14), and myoepithelial (α-smooth muscle actin) and neuronal (β3-tubulin, Chrm3) compartments. Differentiated cells from submandibular gland explant models displayed significantly greater proliferation, number of epithelial progenitors, amylase activity, and epithelial barrier function when compared to parotid gland models.

Methodology: The biopsy report database (Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand) during 2005–2014 was reviewed. The prevalence of cholesterol crystals in the periapical lesions of root filled teeth was determined. Pathological diagnosis, patients’ age, gender and the location (maxilla or mandible) of the periapical lesion were obtained from treatment records. The area of the lesion from the periapical radiograph before surgery was calculated using ImageJ software. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between independent variables and the presence of cholesterol crystals. Results: The overall prevalence of cholesterol crystals was 20.31%. The periapical biopsies >100 mm 2 in size on periapical films had a significantly greater prevalence of cholesterol crystals than those <100 mm 2 (P = 0.005). The biopsies diagnosed as radicular cysts had a significantly greater prevalence of cholesterol crystals than the biopsies with other diagnoses (P < 0.001). A pathological diagnosis of radicular cyst was the variable with the strongest association with the presence of cholesterol crystals (P < 0.001; adjusted OR, 12.39). Conclusions: Presence of cholesterol crystals was associated with periapical lesion diagnosed as a radicular cyst and lesion >100 mm 2 in area. Age, gender and location of the lesion did not influence the presence of cholesterol crystals.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Herein, we determined whether isovitexin, a natural plant-derived compound could protect PM2.5-mediated oxidative stress and induce stemness in epidermal cells. Materials and Methods: Cell viability was detected by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Protein hallmarks of stem cells were examined by western blot analysis. Results: PM2.5 treatment for 30 min increased the levels of intracellular ROS. Pre-treatment of cells with 10-50 μM of isovitexin dramatically inhibited the ROS induced by PM2.5. Antioxidant efficacy of isovitexin was also determined by the ROS scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ABTS and superoxide anion radicals. In addition, we found that isovitexin enhanced the stem cell properties of keratinocytes, indicated by the significant increase in the levels of stem cell proteins.

Data Sources: Utilization reports from 99 intervention and 51 non-intervention health facilities from the Niger State Malaria Elimination Program, supplemented by data on facility-level characteristics from the Niger State Primary Health Care Development Agency and Local Government Malaria Control units. Study Design: Estimated with mixed-effects negative binomial modeling, a difference-in-differences method was used to quantify the impact of the program on the number of febrile illness cases and confirmed malaria cases. Potential confounding factors, non-stationarity, seasonality, and autocorrelation were explicitly accounted for. Data Extraction Methods: Data were retrieved from hard copies of utilization reports and manually inputted to create a panel of 5550 facility-month observations. Principal Findings: The program was implemented in two phases. The first phase (August 2010-June 2012) involved the provision of free artemisinin-based combination therapies, long-lasting insecticidal nets, and intermittent preventive treatments. In the second phase (July 2012-March 2013), the program introduced an additional intervention: free parasite-based rapid diagnostic tests. Compared to the pre-intervention period, the average number of monthly febrile illness and malaria cases increased by 20.876 (P < 0.01) and 22.835 (P < 0.01) in the first phase, and by 19.007 (P < 0.05) and 19.681 (P < 0.05) in the second phase, respectively. The results are consistent across different evaluation methods. Conclusions: This study suggests that user-fee removal leads to increased utilization of antimalarial services.

Failure modes discussed include fast fracture, fatigue (in inert and embrittling environments), liquid-metal embrittlement, hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, and corrosion fatigue, in materials such as steels, Al alloys, Ni alloys, and Cu alloys. The features sometimes observed on grain-boundary facets (e.g. fatigue striations, crack-arrest markings, slip lines, steps/microfacets, nano−/micro-scale dimples, second-phase particles, and deposits), and how they are formed, are described, as such knowledge helps in diagnosing fracture modes and causes. Reasons for intergranular cracking in the cases considered include (i) preferential precipitation at grain boundaries (sometimes with an associated precipitate-free zone), (ii) segregation of metalloid impurities, hydrogen, or some alloying elements, (iii) preferential adsorption of embrittling environmental species (such as some metal atoms and hydrogen) at intersections of grain boundaries with surfaces/crack tips, and (iv) locally anodic regions at or adjacent to grain boundaries. Some lessons for failure-analysis and prevention in general, illustrated by the case histories, are then summarised.","corrosion, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

We therefore used a longitudinal design to: (i) compare leukocyte counts at baseline between shift and day workers and (ii) examine the time trend of leukocyte counts over the follow-up period for these workers. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 6737 workers aged <60 years at two large organizations (a humanitarian organization and a university) in Bangkok, Thailand who had participated in at least two annual health check-ups during the period 2005-2016. Shift work exposure history was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and categorized into day, former, and current shift workers. Data on leukocyte count were collected annually as part of worksite health screening during the observation period. Association of shift work exposure and increased leukocyte count was then examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally by using multiple linear regression and multilevel analysis of repeated measures data, respectively. In addition, trends for leukocyte count over the follow-up period and work years were examined using LOWESS smooth curves. Results: Compared to day work, the current shift work was associated with increased leukocyte counts. The magnitude of percentage increase was the highest for basophil counts, followed by eosinophil and lymphocyte counts. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence revealed this association, although it was less pronounced longitudinally. For total leukocyte count, the magnitude of difference was constant across the 11-year follow-up period. However, for lymphocyte and basophil counts, these discrepancies tapered over the work years until they no longer differed (for lymphocyte count) or even differed in the opposite direction (for basophil count) in later work years. Conclusion: This study confirmed previous cross-sectional evidence that shift work exposure-increased leukocyte counts and that this was reversible. Whether this increase in immune cell count also results in an increased immune cell activity and serves as the intermediary in the association between shift work exposure and subsequent chronic disease development needs further investigation.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, medical","Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Anecdotal experience in angle-closure glaucoma suggests that it may also lower IOP by opening the drainage angle to promote aqueous outflow. This study sought to evaluate combined phacoemulsification and ECP (phaco/ECP) in eyes with different types and stages of glaucoma.Patients and Methods:A Retrospective chart review of eyes that underwent phaco/ECP between October 2010 and December 2016 at one institution was conducted.Results:In 63 eyes of 63 patients with an average of 3.0±1.7 years of follow-up, the 22 eyes with chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) had greater IOP reduction and medication reduction than the 41 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma at both 1 year (6.4 vs. 2.1 mm Hg, P=0.01; 0.9 vs. 0.2 medications, P=0.04) and final follow-up (6.2 vs. 2.4 mm Hg, P=0.02; 0.9 vs. 0.3 medications, P=0.05). There was no difference in IOP reduction or medication reduction for eyes with mild, moderate, or advanced glaucoma at both 1 year (3.5, 3.9, 0.5 mm Hg, respectively, P=0.18; 0.3, 0.6, 0.4 medications, P=0.58) and final follow-up (3.3, 4.8, 0.7 mm Hg, P=0.11; 0.1, 0.8, 0.4 medications, P=0.14).Conclusions:Eyes with CACG were more responsive to phaco/ECP in terms of IOP and medication reduction compared with eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. This finding could be partially or entirely due to concurrent cataract extraction and greater CACG preoperative IOP.

NR is used in a latex form to avoid a severe mixing condition. A small quantity of PPA and sulphur are proved to be effective modifiers in addition to NR. It is found that when asphalt is modified with 0.6–4.5 wt% of NR, 1–2 wt% of PPA and 0.3–1.0 wt% sulphur (based on 100 parts of NR), penetration of the modified asphalt systematically decreases while its softening points and Brookfield viscosity increase with increasing NR and PPA contents. An addition of sulphur in the asphalt system shows complementary improvement in its toughness and tenacity. Our results suggest the modified asphalt with 3.2 wt% of NR, 2 wt% of PPA and 0.3 wt% of sulphur is a suitable formula for the road condition in Thailand.",engineering,Civil and Structural Engineering

Hyperbaric inside attendants have to work under hyperbaric environment to provide medical care for patients in the hyperbaric chamber. This study aims to investigate longitudinal change in lung function in hyperbaric inside attendants (HIAs) and the relationship with hyperbaric exposure. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective longitudinal study exploring the adverse long-term effects to the lungs in HIAs. All inside attendants (HIAs) who worked in the public hospitals or medical centres with multiplace hyperbaric chamber in Thailand were included. To be considered for inclusion in the study, inside attendants were required to have at least two follow-up lung function tests and minimum 1-year interval at baseline from annually periodic examination. Lung function of HIAs were compared against reference values of the Thai population. Results: There were 51 subjects with 9.26-year mean period of follow-up. The HIAs showed a significantly decrease in measured lung function in average forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of functional vital capacity (FEF25-75%) and FEV1/FVC ratio over time. The annual reductions in FEV1, FEF25-75% and FEV1/FVC ratio were 22.52 mL per year, 44.92 mL/s per year and 0.48% per year, respectively. The study showed significant differences in annual changes in FVC, FEF25-75% and FEV1/FVC ratio between HIAs and the lung function predicted values for the Thais. However, the results revealed no differences of annual change in FEV1 from predicted values. The average working depths, average session duration and total working hours as HIAs were related with the changes of lung function. Conclusions: Working in a hyperbaric environment does affect the lung function of HIAs. In addition to fitness to work implementation, periodic lung function evaluation should be encouraged to monitor further possible harm to the attendants.",medical,"Medicine (miscellaneous), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

In this study, we performed chronology analysis to look for insight into the emergence of Leptospira species, focusing on L. interrogans, and investigated gene gain and loss related to their adaptation in strains isolated from asymptomatic dogs. Chronology analysis revealed that the emergence of L. interrogans was around 53.7 million years ago (MYA), corresponding to the Paleogene period that coincided with an optimal climatic temperature and the evolution of suitable mammalian hosts. Gene families encoding for vitamin B2, B12 biosynthesis, cell adhesion and external encapsulating structure were found to be enriched in L. interrogans isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs.

However, SOC is still at development stage with many unsolved issues; particularly, composing services for a workflow pose a significant challenge when some factors including distribution and dynamic characteristics of services are in consideration. The number of vendors providing similar services is increasing, and this requires effective methodologies for service workflow compositions. Service workflow specification (SWSpec) language was proposed to specify requirements of service attributes and verify them in a workflow during service selection processes automatically. One requirement for SWSpec is that all services must be represented for service selections adequately, while existing SWSpec exhibits its limitation in addressing significant specification patterns found in service-based applications (SBAs). This paper proposes a strengthened SWSpec, called real-time monitoring SWSpec that incorporates new modalities to represent missing specification patterns of events occurring in SBAs.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Information Systems, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

A clinical and epidemiological survey of the largest dengue outbreak in Southern Taiwan in 2015,"Wang W.-H., Lin C.-Y., Chang K., Urbina A.N., Assavalapsakul W., Thitithanyanont A., Lu P.-L., Chen Y.-H., Wang S.-F.",2019-11-01,"Adult, Aged, Cytokines, Dengue, Dengue Virus, Disease Outbreaks, Epidemics, Female, Humans, Interferon-gamma, Interleukin-6, Male, Middle Aged, Phylogeny, Risk Factors, Serogroup, Taiwan, Young Adult, Antibody-dependent enhancement, Dengue fever, Dengue hemorrhagic fever, Risk factors, Taiwan","Objectives: This study examined the epidemiological, clinical, and immunological characteristics of the 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan. Methods: Clinical data were collected from dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients. A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the source of the outbreak strain. Paired plasma samples from DF/DHF patients were used for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay and cytokine multiplex biometric immunoassay to validate the immunological mechanism. Results: This outbreak mainly occurred in two of the southern cities of Taiwan: Tainan (n = 22 777; 52%) and Kaohsiung (n = 19 784; 45%). A high DHF death rate was noted (34.6%). The case (DHF) and control (DF) study indicated that older age (>60 years), type II diabetes, and hypertension were risk factors correlated with the development of DHF (p < 0.0001). The phylogenetic tree results suggested that the outbreak-associated strain was dengue virus serotype 2 and cosmopolitan genotype, forming a stable cluster with the isolates from Thailand and Indonesia (bootstrap value of 99%). Cytokine analyses demonstrated that levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-4, IL-13, IL-1β, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly higher in DHF patients compared to DF patients (p < 0.001). The ADE assay showed that diluted plasma containing preexisting dengue antibodies from DHF patients significantly enhanced dengue infection (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results suggest that older age, type II diabetes, hypertension, immunological cytokine dysregulation, and preexisting dengue antibodies inducing ADE infection are correlated with dengue severity. This study also indicates that the largest dengue outbreak in Taiwan might have been a result of imported DF from dengue epidemic regions.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Non-invasive textile based colorimetric sensor for the simultaneous detection of sweat pH and lactate,"Promphet N., Rattanawaleedirojn P., Siralertmukul K., Soatthiyanon N., Potiyaraj P., Thanawattano C., Hinestroza J.P., Rodthongkum N.",2019-01-15,"Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, Colorimetric sensors, Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Lactate, Non-invasive, Physiological condition, Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, Sweat, Azo Compounds, Bromcresol Green, Calibration, Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium, Chitosan, Color, Colorimetry, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lactic Acid, Sweat, Colorimetric sensor, Cotton, Lactate, Non-invasive, pH, Sweat, Textile","A non-invasive textile-based colorimetric sensor for the simultaneous detection of sweat pH and lactate was created by depositing of three different layers onto a cotton fabric: 1.) chitosan, 2.) sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and 3.) indicator dye or lactate assay. This sensor was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Then, this sensor was used to measure pH and lactate concentration using the same sweat sample. The sensing element for sweat pH was composed of a mixture of methyl orange and bromocresol green while a lactate enzymatic assay was chosen for the lactate sensor. The pH indicator gradually shifted from red to blue as the pH increased, whereas the purple color intensity increased with the concentration of lactate in the sweat. By comparing these colors with a standard calibration, this platform can be used to estimate the sweat pH (1−14) and the lactate level (0–25 mM). Fading of the colors of this sensor was prevented by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The flexibility of this textile based sensor allows it to be incorporated into sport apparels and accessories hence potentially enabling real-time and continuous monitoring of sweat pH and lactate. This non-invasive sensing platform might open a new avenue for personal health monitoring and medical diagnosis as well as for determining of the physiological conditions of endurance athletes.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

SRSE is extremely difficult-to-control and associated with poor outcome. To date, optimal therapy and outcome data in children is limited. Objective: To assess etiology, treatment options and outcome in pediatric SRSE patients. Method: We reviewed medical records of children <15 years old with SRSE during 2007–2017 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Demographic data, etiology, treatment, complications and discharge outcome were recorded. Results: Seventeen patients, aged 1 month–13 years were included. The leading etiology was immune-mediated encephalitis (29.4%) and epilepsy (29.4%). The most common anesthetic agents were midazolam (94.1%) and propofol (52.9%) with the average maximal dose of 1.3 and 6.9 mg/kg/h respectively. Other treatments included immunological therapy (76.5%), ketogenic diet (76.5%), pyridoxine/pyridoxal-5-phosphate (70.5%). The most common complications were hypotension (61.5%), drug hypersensitivity (32.5%). Median length of anesthetic and intensive care were 9 and 23 days. The mortality rate was 17.6%, and 2 of 3 febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome cases died. At discharge, all survivors were seizure free. Conclusion: The majority of pediatric SRSE does not have epilepsy and the etiology is various. Treatment should expand from antiepileptic drugs to other modalities targeting different possible mechanisms such as immunomodulation or specific metabolic treatment. Multiple anesthetic drugs could be tolerated with close monitoring. Ketogenic diet, via enteral or parenteral route, could be considered early if requiring multiple anesthetic drugs. Initial outcome in children is relatively better than in adults.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; epilepsy, medical, neuroscience","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Developmental Neuroscience, Neurology (clinical)"

It is characterized by renal fibrosis, which is strongly correlated with impairment of renal function. Since renal biopsy is not performed routinely in clinical practice, the non-invasive method of ultrasonographic shear-wave elastography (SWE) was used to determine renal parenchymal stiffness. Currently, urinary procollagen type III amino-terminal propeptide (uPIIINP) is a renal fibrosis biomarker in humans. Moreover, PIIINP is increasingly applied for identification of fibrosis in various organs in animals. Results: The Young's modulus (E) value on SWE, uPIIINP, and renal function were evaluated in 23 CKD cats and 25 healthy cats (HC). The renal cortical E values were significantly higher than those of the renal medulla in both groups (P < 0.001). The E values of the renal cortex and medulla were significantly higher in CKD cats than in HC (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). The E values, especially of the cortex, showed a significant positive correlation with concentrations of plasma creatinine (P < 0.001), blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.05), while they had a negative correlation with urine specific gravity (P < 0.001) and urine osmolality per plasma osmolality ratio (P < 0.01). The uPIIINP to creatinine ratios (uPIIINP/Cr) were significantly higher in CKD cats than in HC (P < 0.01) and were highly correlated with renal cortical E values (P < 0.001). Conclusions: SWE might be an additively useful and non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool to evaluate renal parenchymal stiffness, which correlates with renal functional impairment in CKD cats. Moreover, the uPIIINP/Cr might be a promissing biomarker for adjunctive assessing the renal fibrosis in feline CKD.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Methods: The sample consisted of 198 outpatients attending the Dental Hospital of Chulalongkorn University. TMD pain was determined using the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. Pain lasting 3 months or longer was defined as chronic pain. Pain intensity was reflected using a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale, and pain frequency was assessed with the percentage of pain days over a 2-week period. The number of pain sites was evaluated using the Widespread Pain Index. The presence of comorbidities was assessed with a validated diagnostic questionnaire. The associations were analyzed using Spearman rho test, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression, with a significance level of P ≤ .05. Age and gender were analyzed as confounders. Results: The number of pain sites was related to pain duration, pain intensity, and age. The number of comorbidities was associated with pain duration. Neither pain frequency nor gender were related to the number of pain sites or comorbidities. When the pain duration reached 1 month, patients had a 1.045-times higher probability of pain beyond the orofacial area (odds ratio [OR] = 1.045; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.024 to 1.066; P = .001) and a 1.028-times higher probability of comorbidities (OR = 1.028; 95% CI = 1.005 to 1.05; P = .008).

A TiO2/graphene nanocomposite was readily synthesized and coated on a 3D porous Ni foam electrode to develop a novel electrode in an electrochemical biosensor. The as-prepared nanocomposite and the modified Ni foam were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to verify the well intercalation of graphene within TiO2 sol and successful coating of such nanocomposite on Ni foam surface, respectively. Comparing with an unmodified Ni foam, TiO2 sol/graphene modified Ni foam offered a drastic increase in current response signal (a 28-fold) toward H2O2 detection, suggesting a potential application of this system as a sensitive electrochemical sensor. Then, LOx was immobilized onto the modified electrode for lactate sensor via H2O2 detection. Interestingly, the combination between graphene and TiO2 sol enhanced both sensitivity and stability of this sensor. A wide linear range of 50 μM to 10 mM with a detection limit of 19 μM was obtained for lactate without interfering effect from ascorbic acid, dopamine, and glucose. This platform was sensitive enough for early diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock via the detection of concerned lactate level.

The operations of industrial reactors are judiciously focused on the dynamics of the deactivation along the axial length of the reactors, which are generally known approximately. Processes of strong energy release or fast chemical kinetics, such as oxidation reactions, cracking, etc., are associated with a deactivation where the time characteristics of the flow and transports are of magnitudes of the deactivation time-on-stream. Local deactivation of the preferential oxidation of CO was investigated by three-dimensional modelling of flow, mass and heat transfers inside a packed-bed reactor and validated by near-infrared tomography. The profiles of deactivation were sensitive to the rates of deactivation, heat transfer by dispersion and intra-particle mass transfer. At pore scale of the packing, pronounced deactivation was revealed near the wall due to a preferential flow circulation. The deactivation progressed at the exteriors of the catalytic particles, particularly over the regions in contact with the convective flow. Unlike the mass dispersion, the heat dispersion promoted the deactivation by shifting the moving waves of deactivation upstream, leading to asymmetrical maps inside the catalytic particles.","process equipment, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Evidence shows that, after mastectomy, women in Vietnam have a lower quality of life than women in other countries. In addition, high uncertainty is a predictor of low quality of life postmastectomy. Therefore, if nurses can manage uncertainty, the quality of life postmastectomy can improve. Objective This study examined the effect of the Uncertainty Management Program (UMP) on quality of life at 3 weeks postmastectomy in Vietnamese women. Methods This research was a quasi-experimental study using a ""posttest only with control group"" design. There were 115 subjects assigned to either the experimental group (n = 57), who participated in the UMP and routine care, or the control group (n = 58), who received only routine care. Participants were assessed 2 times postmastectomy using the modified Quality of Life Index Scale-Vietnamese version. Results The experimental group exhibited low uncertainty before discharge and significantly higher quality of life than the control group at 1 and 3 weeks postmastectomy, respectively (P <.05). Women's physical well-being, psychological well-being, body image concerns, and social concerns were significantly increased with UMP. Conclusion The UMP was considered as a promising program that might benefit the QoL of women with breast cancer 3 weeks postmastectomy. Implications for Practice The UMP appears feasible to apply for women with breast cancer to improve their QoL postmastectomy in various settings.

The starting material, commercial phosphate-bonded investment material, was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. After silicon dioxide powder was mixed with a binder, the thick liquid was poured into a rubber mold and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then, the green bodies formed were sintered at 1200 °C for 5 h in a furnace in air atmosphere. Phase and impurities of all the ceramic samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The morphology was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The local atomic structures of some ceramic samples were investigated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to better understand the formation of phosphate compound. Compression test was carried out on the ceramic samples at room temperature. Results showed that quartz-cristobalite transformation in the silicon dioxide structure did not significantly affect the mechanical property of the ceramic samples prepared in this work. Porosity was decreased with Al(H2PO4)3 diluted binder ratio. The presence of pores act as stress concentration points in SiO2-based ceramics in which crack could initiate under loading. We strongly believe that a sharp increase in the compressive strength is due to phosphate compound and its unique morphology.","Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

For perianal abscess, there was no significant difference in sensitivity or AUC value between the isolated T2 or combined T2-DWI data sets and post-contrast MR data set (p > 0.05). All MR data sets correctly identified secondary tracts in all 50 cases. Conclusions: Although contrast-enhanced MR studies can improve a radiologist’s confidence, non-contrast MR studies had similar diagnostic efficacy in identifying perianal fistulas and their complications. Therefore, a non-contrast study may suffice in selected patients such as those with renal impairment.","Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Gastroenterology, Urology"

Methods: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library) and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was June 20th, 2018. We selected RCTs of steroids in all routes of administration, in all age groups who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy and studied the results of nausea/vomiting, pain, and hemorrhage. Data analysis was done using Review Manager 5.3.5 software. Results: We included 64 studies (6,327 participants) with variety quality assessed by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. IV steroids statistically and clinically significant decrease post-tonsillectomy nausea/vomiting in children and adult, with superior effect to local steroids (Children: OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.15–0.30; P < 0.001, I 2 = 67%, Adult: OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.16–0.67; P = 0.002, I 2 = 40%). In the analysis of local steroids studies, there was only evidence in children that local steroids decrease post-tonsillectomy nausea/vomiting (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.33–0.88; P = 0.01, I 2 = 32%). IV and local steroids statistically significant decrease immediate post-operative pain severity. Local steroids had extended effect in reducing pain scores on the first day after tonsillectomy. However, the clinical significance of pain relief had to be concerned due to decreasing VAS only about 1 out of 10. Adding oral steroids to IV steroids gave no difference in effect from IV steroids alone. There are very few local steroids studies in adults and oral steroids studies to show the significant effects. Steroids have no statistically significant effect in reducing pain severity after a 1-day period. Steroids in all routes had no statistically significant effects on post-operative hemorrhage (primary hemorrhage: OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.55–1.67; P = 0.88, I 2 = 0%; secondary hemorrhage: OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.74–1.51; P = 0.79, I 2 = 0%). Conclusion: Intravenous steroids statistically significantly decrease post-tonsillectomy nausea/vomiting, and immediate pain scores (< 24 h) in children and adults. There is evidence in only children that local steroids statistically significantly decreases post-tonsillectomy nausea/vomiting, and pain scores during the 0-h to 1-day period.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology
Superior mesenteric vein-first approach to robotic complete mesocolic excision for right colectomy: Technique and preliminary outcomes,"Yang Y., Malakorn S., Zafar S.N., Paul Nickerson T., Sandhu L., Chang G.J.",2019-01-01,"Aged, Colectomy, Colonic Neoplasms, Dissection, Female, Humans, Lymph Node Excision, Male, Mesenteric Veins, Mesocolon, Middle Aged, Robotic Surgical Procedures, Colon cancer, Complete mesocolic excision, Obesity, Robotic surgery","INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence supporting complete mesocolic excision as the optimal surgical approach for right-sided colon cancer to improve oncologic outcomes in comparison with conventional surgical resection. Although the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach to complete mesocolic excision has been reported, obesity has been associated with increased difficulty for finding the correct plane for dissection and delineating the vascular anatomy. We describe a novel approach with early identification of and dissection along the superior mesenteric vein during robotic complete mesocolic excision surgery, for all patients, regardless of BMI. TECHNIQUE: The dissection is initiated with identification of the superior mesenteric vein as the starting point. Then, the vascular dissection is performed along the anterior superior mesenteric vein plane while observing complete mesocolic excision principles. The anterior superior mesenteric vein plane is an optimal and safe dissection plane because there are no anterior tributaries. The ileocolic vein and artery are ligated separately at their junction with the superior mesenteric vein and superior mesenteric artery. The dissection is then continued cephalad along the superior mesenteric vein, identifying additional colic arteries, including the middle colic arterial trunk as well as the venous tributaries to the superior mesenteric vein such as the gastrocolic trunk. The superior right colic vein is then ligated at the gastrocolic confluence and the middle colic vessels are ligated. After the vascular dissection is completed, the colon is then mobilized. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients received the “superior mesenteric vein-first” approach for robotic colectomy between 2013 and 2018, including 40.9% patients with BMI >30 kg/m2. Median lymph node yield was 32 (interquartile range, 25-40). The median distance to the high vascular tie was 12 cm (interquartile range, 7-19). Median estimated blood loss was 33 mL (interquartile range, 25-50). Overall rate of grade ≥3 complications was 3.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Using the superior mesenteric vein-first approach, robotic complete mesocolic excision for right colectomy can be performed on patients with high or low BMI with excellent short-term oncologic outcomes and acceptable morbidity.","genergyal, medical",Gastroenterology

The in-vitro drug release-permeation from the DPNR films and through the pig skin was investigated under the effects of the plasticizer type and amount, silicone oil (Si) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), applied electric potential, and used conductive polyazulene as the drug encapsulation host. The drug release-permeation consisted of 2 successive periods: the pore formation period and release-permeation period. In the first period, the scaling exponent n 1 values were between 0.5 and 1 indicating the decreasing drug rate with time. In the second stage, the scaling exponent n 2 values were higher than 1 indicating the increasing drug rate with time. The Npx release-permeation amount increased with increasing amount of hydrophilic plasticizers. The efficiency of plasticizers on the Npx release-permeation amount was ranked as follows: DBP > Si. The Npx release-permeation amount was drastically enhanced from the applied electrical potential due to the electro-repulsive force between the negatively charged drug and the negatively charged electrode, and the presence of the Npx-doped conductive polyazulene. Other characteristics were also investigated in details namely the matrix morphology, and the pore formation during the two periods.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science
Activation of the immune-inflammatory response system and the compensatory immune-regulatory system in antipsychotic naive first episode psychosis,"Noto M.N., Maes M., Nunes S.O.V., Ota V.K., Rossaneis A.C., Verri W.A., Cordeiro Q., Belangero S.I., Gadelha A., Bressan R.A., Noto C.",2019-03-01,"Adult, Antipsychotic Agents, Cytokines, Female, Humans, Male, Psychotic Disorders, Receptors, Cytokine, Risperidone, Young Adult, Antipsychotic, Cytokines, First episode psychosis, Immune, Inflammation, Schizophrenia","Psychotic disorders are accompanied by activation of the immune inflammatory response system (IRS). The compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) is a regulatory immune response that is induced by the IRS but exerts negative feedback through increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10. This study aims to examine the IRS and CIRS components, including macrophagic M1, T-helper (Th)-1, Th-2, Th-17 and T-regulatory (Treg) phenotypes, in antipsychotic-naïve first episode psychosis (AN-FEP) before and after risperidone treatment. We included 31 AN-FEP and 22 healthy controls. AN-FEP showed increments in M1, Th-1, Th-2, Th-17 and Treg phenotypes and a relatively greater IRS response (especially granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6 and IL-12) as compared with the CIRS response. Inflammatory markers, especially IL-6 and IL-8, were significantly correlated with negative, psychotic, affective and excitation symptom dimensions. Treatment with risperidone significantly suppressed the IRS and CIRS. Baseline levels of CIRS biomarkers, especially higher soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and IL-10 predicted clinical improvement after treatment. Our findings indicate that AN-FEP is characterized by robust IRS (M1 + Th-1 + Th-17) and CIRS responses, suggesting that monocytes, macrophages, Th-1, Th-2, Th-17 and Treg cells are activated. The findings indicate that (a) FEP patients are prone to the detrimental effects of M1, Th-1, Th-17 and Th-2 cells, which may contribute to long-lasting abnormalities in brain circuitry; and (b) in FEP, the CIRS may contribute to recovery from the acute phase of illness. Enhancing the CIRS might be a new drug target to treat FEP.","drug literature index, pharmacology, neuroscience, medical","Pharmacology, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry, Pharmacology (medical)"

In such transactive markets, communities may enjoy cheaper electricity prices while supporting locally produced green energy. However, there exists a considerable knowledge gap between market mechanisms and energy exchanges. Challenges arise in the auction process to ensure individual rationality, incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic efficiency. This paper offers insights for building the foundation of a P2P energy trading market and presents a comparative analysis of auction mechanisms and bidding strategies for P2P solar electricity exchanges in terms of market demand and supply metrics. Auction mechanisms considered in this paper are Discriminatory and Uniform k-Double Auction (k-DA). Impacts of different bidding strategies, including game theoretic approaches, on the economic efficiencies of the P2P transactive energy market are also studied. A simulation case study of 100 participants in a microgrid at various PV penetration levels is presented using typical residential load and solar PV generation profiles.","petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; solar, fluidex; related topics, planning - genergyal, engineering, energy, environmental","Building and Construction, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

However, the model checking of the time Petri nets with metric temporal logic is still merely supported. In this paper, we propose an alternative to transform the given time Petri nets along with the metric temporal logic into Promela code, which would be practically verified using SPIN tool. We also modified the previous work on translating basic metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas into linear temporal logic (LTL) written in Promela as to cope with the next and until temporal operators.

Laundry Detergency of Solid Nonparticulate Soil or Waxy Solids: Part II.

Its detergency was evaluated with a hydrophilic surface (cotton) or a hydrophobic surface (polyester) using different surfactants: alcohol ethoxylate (EO9), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), methyl ester sulfonate (MES), methyl ester ethoxylate (MEE), and two extended surfactants (C 12,14 -10PO-2EO-SO 4 Na and C 12,14 -16PO-2EO-SO 4 Na). The detergency efficiency at a 0.2 wt.% surfactant and 5 wt.% NaCl gradually increased while redeposition gradually decreased with increasing washing temperature in most studied surfactant solutions; this was observed both above and below the melting point of methyl palmitate on both studied fabrics. If the methyl palmitate was heated above the melting point when deposited on the fabric, it was better able to penetrate into the fabric matrix as compared to deposition below the melting point, resulting in poorer detergency for heated deposition, particularly for washing temperatures lower than the melting point. Among the surfactants studied, the nonionic surfactant (EO9) showed the highest detergency efficiency (73–94%) at any washing temperature especially on the polyester fabric. For washing temperatures below the melting point, detergency performance correlated well with the contact angle of surfactant solution on the solid methyl palmitate surface for all studied surfactants when salinity was varied. In this work, conditions resulting in the highest detergency below the melting point corresponded to the highest detergency above the melting point, suggesting this as a systematic approach to formulating below the melting point of the soil. Charge of particles or fabric was not observed to be important to the detergency mechanism, but steric factors resulting from surfactant adsorption were observed to be important mechanistic factors in waxy solid detergency.","coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

BRXO was produced by mixing rice bran oil (RO) with bleached rice bran wax (BRX, 9% wax). EO (20% aqueous phase, 80% oil phase) was prepared with BRXO without adding an emulsifier. All quality attributes changed during storage at both temperatures. The colors of BRXO and EO were slightly changed, while those of RO and the emulsion without the addition of organogels (E) were notably changed. EO showed better stability than E. In assessing the various stages of oxidative stability, the peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were determined. The PV peaked at 30 days (E and EO) and 90 days (RO and BRXO) and later declined. TBARS values decreased with a decrease in the storage temperature and time. There were no significant changes in the firmness, hardness or stickiness of BRXO and EO at 30 °C during storage (p < 0.05). The polymorphisms of RO appeared to be small, dispersed, plate-like crystals. The BRXO crystal morphology was needle-like and fibrous. All stored samples at both temperatures showed similar morphologies. Regarding EO, the water droplets were dispersed and trapped in the crystal network. Based on the quality parameter results, the bleached rice bran wax can produce stable structured BRXO and W/O emulsions.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering, engineering","Food Science, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Owing to the lack of BPMN standard semantics, formal verification is used to validate whether the BPMN design model is free of undesirable properties. The primary challenges of BPMN design model verification are the enormous size and complexity of BPMN design models; these challenges may lead to time-consuming processes for model abstraction and overcoming the state space explosion problem. This paper proposes a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis based on a colored Petri net (CPN). A BPMN partitioning technique and rules for the transformation of a BPMN into a CPN model are provided. The partitioning approach supports the unstructured BPMN design model, and the obtained CPN model also supports hierarchical verification. To validate and analyze the BPMN design model, the transformation technique and state space generator are implemented as a BPMN verification framework. This method is a viable option for the software process designers and is suitable for the large-scale BPMN design model verification.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The recent epidemiological data has revealed a possible association of ZIKV infection with more serious complications, particularly for Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and microcephaly in newborn children. Till now, there is no vaccine or effective drug commercially available to combat with ZIKV infection. An attractive drug target for the ZIKV treatment is the NS2B/NS3 serine protease, which is essential for viral polyprotein processing. Herein, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the ZIKV NS2B/NS3 serine protease in complex with four peptide substrates to investigate the binding recognition and protein-substrate interactions. The obtained results indicate that the P1 and P2 positions of the substrate play a significant role in binding with the protease enzyme, while the P3 and P4 positions show a minor contribution in binding interaction. Moreover, the binding free energy calculation based on the MM/PBSA method suggests that among the four similar peptide substrates, the peptide Ac-D-RKOR-ACC displays the strongest binding affinity towards the ZIKV protease due to the high energy contribution at the S2 subsite particularly for the NS3 residue D75 with the P2(O) residue of this substrate, which is in line with the experimental data. Thus, the information derived from MD simulations presented here would be useful for the design of potent protease inhibitors.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

Methods: The CERAD battery was completed and various biomarkers were assayed in 60 subjects with aMCI, 60 with AD, and 62 healthy controls. Results: Deficits in semantic and episodic memory were significantly predicted by anion gap and bicarbonate, albumin, and glucose coupled with ApoE4. Furthermore, these peripheral biomarkers interacted with ApoE to predict greater memory impairments. Conclusions: Peripheral blood biomarkers may interact with pathways related to ApoE4 to predict greater semantic and episodic memory impairments, thus contributing to the pathophysiology of aMCI and AD. Our data suggest that the transition from aMCI to AD could at least in some cases be associated with significant interactions between ApoE4 and those peripheral blood biomarkers.","neuroscience, psychology, medical","Neuroscience (all), Clinical Psychology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

This study aims to characterize alveolar bone cells of a DGI patient with DSPP mutation. Materials and methods: Pathogenic variants were identified by whole exome and sanger sequencing. Cells isolated from the alveolar bones of a DSPP patient were investigated for their characteristics including cell morphology, attachment, spreading, proliferation, colony formation, mineralization, and osteogenic differentiation. Results: We identified a Thai family with three members affected with autosomal dominant DGI harboring a heterozygous pathogenic missense mutation, c.50C > T, p.P17L, in exon 2 of the DSPP gene. The patients’ phenotypes presented deteriorated opalescent teeth with periapical lesions, thickening of lamina dura, furcation involvement, alveolar bone loss, and bone exostoses. The alveolar bone cells isolated from DSPP patient exhibited compromised proliferation and colony formation. Scanning electron microscope revealed altered cellular morphology and spreading. The DSPP cells showed deviated mRNA levels of OCN, ALP, and COL1 but maintained in vitro mineralization ability compared to the control. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the DSPP p.P17L mutant alveolar bone cells had compromised cell spreading, proliferation, colony formation, and osteogenic induction, suggesting abnormal bone characteristics in the patient with DGI caused by DSPP mutation.

Cell migration and tubulogenesis were studied by scratch and tubulogenesis assays. The expression level of VEGF was monitored by RT-PCR. We also monitored the phosphorylation of FAK and P-38 MAPK by western blotting. Compared to control group, curcumin decreased HUVECs survival rate after 72 h. We found that the migration of HUVECs was decreased after curcumin treatment compared to the control (p < 0.0001). Cell alignment and tubulogenesis activity were found to be inhibited compared to cells from the VEGF group (p < 0.05). The expression level of VEGF was increased in curcumin treated cells at first 24 h time period.

Aims: To present and analyze a case series of pediatric patients with BRBNS and to describe diagnostic approaches and management options applied. Patients and methods: Multicenter, retrospective study, evaluating the diagnosis and management of children with BRBNS. Results: Eighteen patients diagnosed with BRBNS were included. Cutaneous venous malformations were observed in 78% and gastrointestinal venous malformations in 89%. Lesions were also found in other organs including muscles, joints, central nervous system, eyes, parotid gland, spine, kidneys and lungs. Gastrointestinal lesions were more common in the small intestine than in stomach or colon. The management varied significantly among centers. Endoscopic therapy and surgical therapy alone failed to prevent recurrence of lesions. In younger children and in patients with musculoskeletal or other organ involvement, sirolimus was used with 100% success rate in our series (5 patients treated) although poor compliance with subtherapeutic sirolimus trough levels led to recurrence in a minority. Conclusions: Considering the multi-organ involvement in BRBNS, diagnosis and management requires a multidisciplinary approach. The treatment includes conservative, medical, endoscopic and surgical options. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to identify the optimal management of this rare condition.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"
HDT of the model diesel feed over Ir-modified Zr-SBA-15 catalysts,"Valles V.A., Sa-ngasaeng Y., Martinez M.L., Jongpatiwut S., Beltramone A.R.",2019-03-15,"4 ,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4 ,6-DMDBT), Dibenzothiophenes, Direct synthesis, Hydrodenitrogenation, Inhibition effect, Reduction temperatures, Refractory compounds, Tetralin hydrogenations, Acid lactic, Direct synthesis, Hydrodenitrogenation, Hydrodesulfurization, Zirconium propoxide","Iridium catalyst using different zirconium modified-SBA-15 supports were tested in the HDT of tetralin and typical sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in diesel feed. The zirconium modified-SBA-15 supports were synthesized by sol-gel method using two sources of zirconium, zirconyl chloride and zirconium (IV) propoxide. Regarding XRD, N2 adsorption isotherms and TEM, we obtained better textural and structural properties using the alkoxide, especially when lactic acid was added in order to decrease the hydrolysis rate of zirconium propoxide. In addition, XPS and DRUV-Vis demonstrated that zirconium was incorporated mainly as tetrahedral Zr4+ species NH3-TPD showed that higher acidity is observed when tetrahedral Zr4+ species are present. Iridium dispersion was determined by TEM and H2-chemisorption and reducibility by XPS and TPR. Among the catalysts prepared, the catalyst synthesized using zirconium propoxide and lactic acid presented the highest dispersion, lowest cluster size and lowest reduction temperature. Consequently, this was the most active catalyst for the hydrogenation of tetralin, the HDN of indole and quinoline and the HDS of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT). The presence of Zr+4 had a remarkable effect on the dispersion and reducibility capacity of the iridium actives species. In addition, the presence of moderate acidity in this material gives the best catalyst for HDN and HDS in the studied conditions. The inhibition effect of the sulfur and nitrogen compounds over tetralin hydrogenation was studied using individual feeds and a mixture feed. We observe that 4,6-DMDBT and quinoline were the most refractory compounds and they showed the highest inhibition effect. Tetralin hydrogenation was stronger inhibited when using the mixture feed compared with the individual feeds. This can be explained in terms of the competition between the different compounds that retard the rate of hydrogenation of tetralin. However, a high conversion of tetralin was achieved even when 300 ppm of S or N was added. The most active catalyst synthesized by direct synthesis using propoxide and lactic acid was stable after several catalytic cycles making this material as potential catalyst for HDT reaction at mild conditions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Battery energy storage system (BESS), an effective voltage management solution for low-voltage (LV) networks to deal with the high penetration of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems, is investigated in this paper considering the degradation of BESS due to aging. Two optimal strategies of BESS cost minimization are proposed for long-term planning and operation planning, where the utility is the BESS owner. As for the long-term planning, a strategy for siting and sizing of BESS is formulated based on the characteristics of the network, typical load, and PV generation profiles. Then, for the operation planning, schedules of BESSs and their cost estimation are provided based on the load and PV generation forecasts of 1 day ahead.

The study provides a methodology to collect data on specific arm movements, using signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer in mobile devices. Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in this study (20 stroke patients and 32 healthy subjects). Given in the instructions of the application, the patients were asked to perform two arm movements, Curl Up and Raise Up. The two exercises were classified into three parts: curl part, raise part, and stable part. Stroke patients were expected to experience difficulty in performing both exercises efficiently on the same arm. We proposed 20 handcrafted features from these three parts. Our study achieved an average accuracy of 61.7%-74.2% and an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 66.2%-81.5% from the combination of both exercises. Compared to the FAST method used by examiners in a previous study (Kapes et al., 2014) that showed with an accuracy of 69%-77% for every age group, our study showed promising results for early stroke identification, giving that our study is based only on the arm factor.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, medical","Signal Processing, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Health Informatics"

Importantly, the AuNPs with GQDs was prepared by one-pot chemical reaction by using GQDs as an excellent bifunction of the reducing agent and stabilizer to obtain the disaggregated AuNPs/GQDs in red color property. Apart from its photophysical sensing ability, this hybrid material demonstrated the dual sensing of cysteine and lysine regarding to colorimetric and fluorometric techniques, respectively, in PBS solution pH 7.4. The presence of Cys in the AuNPs/GQDs solution rapidly lead to the color change from red to blue with concomitant of the red shift of the absorption band at 525 to 645 nm undergone the aggregation process. On the other hand, AuNPs/GQDs nanosensor in the presence of Lys performs the off-on fluorescence at 450 nm without color change in PBS solution pH 7.4. Interestingly, no interference of any amino acids towards Cys and Lys detection highlighted a high efficacy in selective sensing aspect. For sensing application, the detection limit of Cys and Lys was 5.88 μM and 16.14 μM, respectively, with an acceptable % recovery of 101–106 in real samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Thyroid shielding in cone beam computed tomography: Recommendations towards appropriate use,"Pauwels R., Horner K., Vassileva J., Rehani M.M.",2019-01-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Child, Child, Preschool, Cone-Beam Computed Tomography, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phantoms, Imaging, Radiation Dosage, Radiation Protection, Radiography, Dental, Thermoluminescent Dosimetry, Thyroid Gland, Young Adult, Cone beam CT, Radiation dose, Radiation protection, Thyroid, Thyroid collar","The objective of this paper is to provide recommendations towards the appropriate use of thyroid shielding in dental cone beam CT (CBCT). Based on current evidence of thyroid radiosensitivity, dosimetric data in the presence and absence of shielding, and a depiction of potential adverse effects of thyroid shielding, a concise set of recommendations was prepared. According to current risk models, thyroid sensitivity is particularly high at a young age, and much higher for females. In the literature, involving adult male, female and paediatric reference phantoms, the use of a tightly fitted thyroid collar with a lead-equivalent thickness of at least 0.25 mm has consistently shown a significant reduction (average: 45.9%) of the equivalent dose to the thyroid. It can therefore be recommended that thyroid shielding should be routinely used for children undergoing CBCT scanning and is recommended for adults up to the age of 50. The increase of the X-ray tube current from automatic exposure control systems due to thyroid shielding can be avoided by placing the shielding collar after acquiring the scout images. Should real-time tube current modulation be implemented in dental CBCT imaging in the future, perspectives regarding the appropriate use of shielding may change according to current trends in CT. In view of the manifestation of metal artefacts, shielding is best avoided if radiological evaluation of tissues below the lower border of the mandible is needed.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

In vitro and ex-vivo permeation studies were performed as well as retinal cell viability tests. The appearance of the eye drop formulations and their pH, osmolality and viscosity were within acceptable range. The formulations containing hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural polysaccharide found in the eye, displayed excellent mucoadhesive properties. An increasing CCB content of the eye drops, obtained by heating method (sonication at the temperature of 70 °C for 1 h) to form ternary CCB/CD/polymer complex, resulted in higher drug permeation through a semipermeable membrane, simulated artificial vitreous humor and scleral tissues, especially from the formulation containing randomly methylated βCD and HA (0.5% w/v).

Many species can shed pathogenic Leptospira, including domestic cats (felis catus), which might be able to pose a risk to humans. There are no studies on Leptospira infections in cats in Thailand, but in other countries, it was demonstrated that cats can shed pathogenic Leptospira with high prevalences. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether outdoor cats in Thailand shed pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, and to determine antibody prevalence and risk factors associated with Leptospira infection. Two hundred and sixty outdoor cats were prospectively recruited. Urine samples were tested by real-time PCR targeting the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Urine was additionally cultured for 6 months in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris medium to grow Leptospira. Antibodies against 24 serovars (Anhoa, Australis, Autumnalis, Ballum, Bataviae, Bratislava, Broomi, Canicola, Celledoni, Copenhageni, Coxi, Cynopteri, Djasiman, Grippotyphosa, Haemolytica, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Khorat, Paidja, Patoc, Pomona, Pyrogenes, Rachmati, Saxkoebing, Sejroe) belonging to 16 serogroups were determined using microscopic agglutination tests. Risk factors were analysed by Fisher's exact test. Urine samples of 2/260 cats (0.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1%–2.8%) were PCR-positive, but none of the 260 urine samples were culture positive. Leptospira antibodies were detected in 14/260 cats (5.4%; 95% CI: 3.0%–8.6%) with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:160 (serovars: Anhoa, Autumnalis, Celledoni, Copenhageni, Djasiman, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Patoc). Cats aged ≥4 years were significantly more often infected with Leptospira than younger cats. No other significant risk factors were found. In conclusion, outdoor cats in Thailand can shed DNA and, possibly, viable, pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, although at a much lower prevalence than expected when compared to countries with similar climate. Thus, cats can be a potential source of infection for people. Further studies are needed to determine the role of cats in transmitting this zoonotic disease in Thailand.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

This is the first report on electrochemical immunosensor based on gold-labeled monoclonal anti-LipL32 for rapid, simple and sensitive determination of LipL32. The sensor consisted of two LipL32-specific antibodies: an unlabeled capture primary antibody (Anti-1°Ab) and an electrochemically detectable gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Au-2°Ab). The Anti-1°Ab was immobilized onto the modified screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) to form the anti-LipL32 surface. The electrochemical signal response was determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In the presence of LipL32, the sensor displayed a significant increase in current response in a concentration-dependent manner, but no observable signal was detected in the absence of LipL32. The linearity between LipL32 concentration and the measured current was found in a range of 1–100 ng/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) (3SDblank/Slope) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (10SDblank/Slope) were found to be 0.28 and 0.93 ng/mL, respectively. This sensor was successfully applied to detect pathogenic Leptospira whole cell lysates samples with the satisfactory results. The promissing results suggested that this immunosensor might be an alternative tool for diagnosis of leptospirosis.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology; diagnosis, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

As a result, the faradaic area-specific resistance (ASR) significantly increased, and the performance of the cell decreased due to the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction originating from the loss of the reaction sites. However, after preannealing the single cells at 400 °C for 2 h prior to start-up, the change in grain size and faradaic ASR varied with the start-up heating rate was well suppressed by the enhanced interfacial stability between the electrolyte and cathode.

The function of the peroneus longus muscle is to stabilise the foot and ankle joint. A deterioration of the structural and mechanical properties of this muscle can potentially lead to foot problems in older adults. This study aimed to investigate the effects of age on structural, histological, and mechanical features in peroneus longus muscle samples taken from embalmed cadavers of two different age groups; young adult (30–60 years) and old adult (over 60 years). Materials and methods: The mechanical property was analysed through the results of cross-sectional area, tensile, tensile stress, and modulus of elasticity. The arrangement of the collagen in the perimysium and tendon was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Fatty infiltration within the musculotendinous junction was evaluated by Masson’ trichrome stained muscle sections. Results: This study thus provides evidence that there are indeed age-induced mechanical property changes in the peroneus longus muscle, which include reductions in the tensile force, tensile stress, and modulus of elasticity, and is related to the malformation of collagen fibrils and the massive fat accumulation in the musculotendinous junction. Conclusions: These alterations may further result in a reduction of muscle strength and quality in an older person.","genergyal, medical","Anatomy, Histology"
Extending the stalk enhances immunogenicity of the influenza virus neuraminidase,"Broecker F., Zheng A., Suntronwong N., Sun W., Bailey M.J., Krammer F., Palesea P.",2019-09-01,"Animals, Antibodies, Viral, Cross Reactions, Dogs, Female, HEK293 Cells, Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus, Hemagglutinins, Humans, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype, Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype, Influenza Vaccines, Influenza, Human, Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Neuraminidase, Orthomyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae Infections, Vaccination, Immunodominance, Influenza virus, Neuraminidase, Vaccine","Influenza viruses express two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). Anti-NA antibodies protect from lethal influenza virus challenge in the mouse model and correlate inversely with virus shedding and symptoms in humans. Consequently, the NA is a promising target for influenza virus vaccine design. Current seasonal vaccines, however, poorly induce anti-NA antibodies, partly because of the immunodominance of the HA over the NA when the two glycoproteins are closely associated. To address this issue, here we investigated whether extending the stalk domain of the NA could render it more immunogenic on virus particles. Two recombinant influenza viruses based on the H1N1 strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) were rescued with NA stalk domains extended by 15 or 30 amino acids. Formalin-inactivated viruses expressing wild-type NA or the stalk-extended NA variants were used to vaccinate mice. The virus with the 30-amino-acid stalk extension induced significantly higher anti-NA IgG responses (characterized by increased in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC] activity) than the wild-type PR8 virus, while anti-HA IgG levels were unaffected. Similarly, extending the stalk domain of the NA of a recent H3N2 virus enhanced the induction of anti-NA IgGs in mice. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that the subdominance of the NA can be modulated if the protein is modified such that its height surpasses that of the HA on the viral membrane. Extending the stalk domain of NA may help to enhance its immunogenicity in influenza virus vaccines without compromising antibody responses to HA. IMPORTANCE The efficacy of influenza virus vaccines could be improved by enhancing the immunogenicity of the NA protein. One of the reasons for its poor immunogenicity is the immunodominance of the HA over the NA in many seasonal influenza virus vaccines. Here we demonstrate that, in the mouse model, extending the stalk domain of the NA protein can enhance its immunogenicity on virus particles and overcome the immunodominance of the HA without affecting antibody responses to the HA. The antibody repertoire is broadened by the extended NA and includes additional ADCC-active antibodies. Our findings may assist in the efforts toward more effective influenza virus vaccines.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; animal vaccines, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Microbiology, Immunology, Insect Science, Virology"

Methods: Three electronic databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched to identify human studies in 12 languages on CR (hemisection, trisection, and premolarization) and RR (amputations and RRs without removal of crown portions). Five peer-reviewed journals, references of relevant publications, and reviews were hand searched. Assessment by 3 independent reviewers was based on the following predefined Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study Design question: “For teeth in patients undergoing surgical therapy by CR versus RR, what is the expected probability of survival according to longitudinal studies with strictly defined outcome measurements and inclusion/exclusion criteria?” Clinical investigations with at least 12 months of follow-up were included. Studies and level of evidence were appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. Results: Thirty-four articles were obtained for final analysis. Data could be extracted from 19 studies (CR and RR OVERALL: N = 2667 [19 studies], CR: n = 111 [3 studies], and RR: n = 1127 [9 studies]). A random effects model showed weighted mean survival rates of 85.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76.7–91.5) for CR and RR procedures OVERALL. Individual data showed weighted mean survival rates of 81.9% (95% CI, 72.0–88.8) for CR and 87.2% (95% CI, 71.7–94.8) for RR. There was no statistically significant difference between CR and RR (P = .89, odds ratio calculation) or between maxillary and mandibular molars (P = .81, Fisher exact test). Conclusions: Overall, CR and RR procedures showed good outcome rates. Large-scale randomized controlled trials should be conducted to strengthen the evidence.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The formation of the Ni2P phase on the AC, which was produced from commercial charcoal, as well as its structural and acidic properties was characterized by hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction analysis, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements performed at −196 °C, and ammonia-temperature programmed desorption. The effects of the Ni/P molar ratio, nickel loading level, reaction temperature, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the catalytic activity were elucidated. The complete formation of the Ni2P phase on the AC was observed at a Ni/P ratio of 1.5, while smaller Ni2P crystallite sizes were observed at lower Ni/P ratios. In addition, it was observed that the acidity increased and the specific surface area decreased with an increase in the nickel loading level, presumably because nickel phosphate is not readily reduced to Ni2P. The 5.37-Ni2P/1.5-TPR catalyst (Ni loading level of 5.37 mmol/g AC and Ni/P molar ratio of 1.5) exhibited good activity and stability during the HDO of WCO. The high-quality deoxygenated product primarily consisted of n-alkanes at the moderately high temperature of 300 °C and GHSV of 2.33 min−1. Based on the results, we propose that the mechanism underlying the hydrotreatment of WCO involves hydrogenolysis, hydrodeoxygenation, dehydration-decarbonylation, and hydrogenation. To conclude, the synthesized Ni2P/AC catalyst could readily deoxygenate WCO at atmospheric pressure, producing n-paraffins as the primary component.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This study sought to evaluate whether cefepime monotherapy is noninferior to combination regimens. Study Design: Multicenter, open-label, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial. Setting & Participants: Adult incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis in 8 PD centers in Thailand. Interventions: Random assignment to either IP monotherapy of cefepime, 1 g/d, or IP combination of cefazolin and ceftazidime, 1 g/d, both given as continuous dosing. Outcomes: Primary end point: resolution of peritonitis at day 10 (primary treatment response). Secondary outcomes: initial response (day 5), complete cure (relapse/recurrence-free response 28 days after treatment completion), relapsing/recurrent peritonitis, and death from any cause. Noninferiority would be confirmed for the primary outcome if the lower margin of the 1-sided 95% CI was not less than −10% for difference in the primary response rate. A 2-sided 90% CI was used to demonstrate the upper or lower border of the 1-sided 95% CI. Results: There were 144 eligible patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis, of whom 70 and 74 patients were in the monotherapy and combination-therapy groups, respectively. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were not different between the groups. The primary response was 82.6% in the monotherapy group and 81.1% in the combination-therapy group (treatment difference, 1.5%; 90% CI, −9.1% to 12.1%; P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the monotherapy group compared with the combination-therapy group in terms of initial response rate (65.7% vs 60.8%; treatment difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, −10.8% to 20.6%; P = 0.5) and complete cure rate (80.0% vs 80.6%; treatment difference, −0.6%; 95% CI, −13.9% to 12.8%; P = 0.7). Relapsing and recurrent peritonitis occurred in 4.6% and 4.6% of the monotherapy group and 4.2% and 5.6% of the combination-therapy group (P = 0.9 and P = 0.8, respectively). There was nominally higher all-cause mortality in the monotherapy group (7.1% vs 2.7%; treatment difference, 4.4%; 95% CI, −2.6% to 11.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). Limitation: Not double blind. Conclusions: IP cefepime monotherapy was noninferior to conventional combination therapy for resolution of CAPD-associated peritonitis at day 10 and may be a reasonable alternative first-line treatment.

However, objective evaluation to identify posturographic characteristics to enable clinical differentiation is limited. Method: Postural sway abnormalities in 35 atypical parkinsonian patients (19 PSP, 16 MSA), 35 matched PD patients, and healthy subjects were assessed under static posturography with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC). Results: With EO, MSA patients showed a significantly greater mean ML sway than PD patients (p = 0.03), but with EC even more parameters were significantly different, including mean sway in both ML (p = 0.02) and AP directions (p = 0.01), sway area (p = 0.001), and sway path length (p = 0.003). While differences between MSA and PD were seen in both ML and AP directions, significant differences between PD and PSP were limited to greater mean ML sway (p = 0.01) with EO, greater mean (p = 0.002) and maximal AP sway (p = 0.02) amongst PSP patient with EC. Moderate and significant correlation was demonstrated between HY stage and mean AP sway amongst APD patients (r = 0.56, p < 0.01) and in PSP patients (r = 0.62, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our study identifies a number of objective sway measures assessed with EC that are potentially useful for clinical differentiation between APDs and PD. In comparison to PD, MSA showed greater sway area and a mean sway distance in both AP and ML directions, while the difference was limited to AP in PSP. Significant correlation between HY stage and sway parameters further supports postural sway as a potential disease progression marker in APDs.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

This temperature ensures that the chemical equilibrium reaction between NO2 and N2O4 can be neglected since at this temperature almost only NO2 exists. At 373 K, the membrane selectivity of NO2 over N2 is predicted to be about 4.2 (ZIF-90), 5.2 (ZIF-8), and 10.6 (ZIF-78). In addition, it is shown that N2O4 can be neither adsorbed nor diffuses inside these ZIF materials, which makes these ZIFs a promising materials for separation by membranes. Due to molecular sieving, only N2 and NO2 can pass the ZIF membranes.","computer science, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering, physics, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computational Mathematics"

Penetrating injury is the most common cause of AVIs; however, some AVI series had more blunt injuries. There is little information regarding differences between penetrating and blunt AVIs. The objective of the present study was to identify the differences between these two mechanisms in civilian AVI patients in terms of patient's characteristics, injury details, and outcomes. Method: From January 2007 to January 2016, we retrospectively collected the data of AVI patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital, including demographic data, details of injury, the operative managements, and outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The comparison of the data between blunt and penetrating AVI patients was performed. Results: There were 55 AVI patients (28 blunt and 27 penetrating). Majority (78%) of the patients in both groups were in shock on arrival. Blunt AVI patients had significantly higher injury severity score (mean(SD) ISS, 36(20) vs. 25(9), p = 0.019) and more internal iliac artery injuries (8 vs. 1, p = 0.028). On the other hand, penetrating AVI patients had more aortic injuries (5 vs. 0, p = 0.046), and inferior vena cava injuries (7 vs. 0, p = 0.009). Damage control surgery (DCS) was performed in 45 patients (82%), 25 in blunt and 20 in penetrating. The overall mortality rate was 40% (50% in blunt vs. 30% in penetrating, p = 0.205).

The relative performance of COIN-F is compared against COIN-E, NSGA-II and DPSO. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN-F over the contestant algorithms, especially in the search for the approximate true-Pareto frontier.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
A concept of demand charge subsidy due to wheeling charge in distribution system,"Larbwisuthisaroj S., Chaitusaney S.",2019-07-01,"Cost allocation, Demand charge subsidy, Line flows, Power transactions, Wheeling charge, Cost allocation, Demand charge subsidy, Line flow analysis, Power transaction, Wheeling charge","Industrial estates in Thailand, which typically receive electricity supply from distribution systems, can directly get supplied from private power producers in the local area. With this, private power producers and transaction customers need to pay wheeling charge to the main electric utility. Therefore, the demand charge of the entire customers should be decreased due to an increase of sharing customers. This paper proposes a concept of demand charge subsidy calculation for existing distribution customers due to wheeling charge. Because of the simplicity of postage stamp method and the reflection of extent of use of power flow based MW-Mile method, these methods are focused in this paper. The results show that the proposed concept computes the different demand charge subsidy depending on wheeling charge calculation methodologies.","electric power systems, fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this paper, we propose the event-related potential encoder network (ERPENet), a multi-task autoencoder-based model, that can be applied to any ERP-related tasks. The strength of ERPENet lies in its capability to handle various kinds of ERP datasets and its robustness across multiple recording setups, enabling joint training across datasets. The ERPENet incorporates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), in an autoencoder setup, which tries to simultaneously compress the input EEG signal and extract related P300 features into a latent vector. Here, we can infer the process for generating the latent vector as universal joint feature extraction. The network also includes a classification part for attended and unattended events classification as an auxiliary task. We experimented on six different P300 datasets. The results show that the latent vector exhibits better compression capability than the previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised autoencoder model. For attended and unattended events classification, pre-trained weights are adopted as initial weights and tested on unseen P300 datasets to evaluate the adaptability of the model, which shortens the training process as compared to using random Xavier weight initialization. At the compression rate of 6.84, the classification accuracy outperforms conventional P300 classification models: The XdawnLDA, DeepConvNet, and EEGNet achieving 79.37%-88.52% classification accuracy depending on the dataset.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Past studies have shown that some types of rehabilitative therapy can be useful. We hypothesized that BoNT together with a specific type of occupational therapy would be better than BoNT alone for treating WC patients comparing the effects with a patient-rated subjective scale. Methods: Twelve WC patients were randomized to two groups. Six received only BoNT therapy and 6 received BoNT & occupational therapy. The occupational therapy involved specific exercises of finger movements in the direction opposite to the dystonic movements during writing. BoNT was injected by movement disorders neurologists in the affected muscles under electromyography-guidance. The primary outcome was the patient-rated subjective scale at 20 weeks. Secondary exploratory outcomes included the writer's cramp rating scale (WCRS), writer's cramp impairment scale (WCIS), the writer's cramp disability scale (WCDS), handgrip strength and kinetic parameters. Results: The patient-rated subjective scale scores at 20 weeks were not significantly different between the two groups. Significant objective improvement was noted in the BoNT & occupational therapy group, as noted by the decrease (28%) in WCIS scores. Conclusions: Improvement of the primary outcome measure, the patient-rated subjective scale, was not achieved. However, significant improvement was found in the BoNT & occupational therapy group in a secondary measure of impairment. Our hypothesis-driven study results are likely limited by small sample size, and further large-scale studies of occupational therapy methods to improve the efficacy of BoNT seems worthwhile.","genergyal, pharmacology",Toxicology

The elderly show more postural sway when standing compared with young people. A sway fall occurs when the center of gravity moves outside the limit of stability. In order to reduce the fall risk from the excessive sway, this study presents the design of wearable balance assistance device for the elderly. Scissored-pair control moment gyroscopes were selected as a torque actuator. A two-axis inclination sensor was used to detect the inclined angle of the wearer's body. The direction of sway was calculated from the detected inclined angle. The designed device weighs 8.2 kg with a height of 32 cm × width of 40 cm × depth of 22 cm. A multi-segment model of a standing human was used to investigate the device's performance for balance recovery. According to the simulations, balance recovery in any direction was successfully accomplished with the appropriate initial angle. The relationship between the effective initial angle and detected inclined angle was subsequently established. The stability provided by activation of the device was able to limit the unstable user's sway boundary.

It is unclear whether LV can be used to predict mortality in cirrhotic patients. Methods: We enrolled 584 consecutive cirrhotic patients who underwent computerized topography (CT) of the abdomen for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance and 50 age, gender, race, and BMI-matched controls without liver disease. Total LV (TLV), functional LV (FLV), and segmental liver volume (in cm3) were measured from CT imaging. Cirrhotic subjects were followed until death, liver transplantation, or study closure date of July 31, 2016. The survival data were assessed with log-rank statistics and independent predictors of survival were performed using Cox hazards model. Results: Cirrhotic subjects had significantly lower TLV, FLV, and segmental (all except for segments 1, 6, 7) volume when compared to controls. Subjects presenting with hepatic encephalopathy had significantly lower TLV and FLV than those without HE (p = 0.002). During the median follow-up of 1145 days, 112 (19%) subjects were transplanted and 131 (23%) died. TLV and FLV for those who survived were significantly higher than those who were transplanted or dead (TLV:1740 vs. 1529 vs. 1486, FLV 1691 vs. 1487 vs. 1444, p < 0.0001). In the Cox regression model, age, MELD score, TLV, or FLV were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion: Baseline liver volume is an independent predictor of mortality in subjects with cirrhosis. Therefore, it may be useful to provide these data while performing routine surveillance CT scan as an important added value.

The stay independent brochure as a screening evaluation for fall risk in an elderly thai population,"Loonlawong S., Limroongreungrat W., Jiamjarasrangsi W.",2019-01-01,"Accidental Falls, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Geriatric Assessment, Humans, Independent Living, Male, Pamphlets, Psychometrics, Reproducibility of Results, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thailand, Falls, Psychometric property, Screening, Stay Independent Brochure, Thai elderly","Introduction: The Stay Independent Brochure (SIB) is a widely used fall-risk self-assessment tool, which is part of the Stopping Elderly Accident, Deaths & Injuries (STEADI) program in the US. However, the validity and reliability of the SIB have not been established in an elderly Thai population. Objective: To construct a fall risk screening tool based on the SIB in a Thai elderly population and investigate its psychometric effect in a community context. Methods: A total of 480 elderly participants volunteered to take part in this study from the Nakhon Ratchasima province. In the first part of the study, the original version of the SIB was translated into Thai (total 12 questions) and adapted into a modified version (total 18 questions). The translated SIBs were cross-culturally adapted and tested for content validity, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, construct validity and internal consistency. In the second part of the study, the psychometric properties of the translated SIBs were assessed using test-retest and inter-rater reliability and content and construct validity. Results: The SIBs had good content validity (IOC: 0.80 to 1.00), and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of test-retest and inter-rater reliability was excellent for both SIB versions (ICC 0.89–0.95). The construct validity of 18 questions was tested by principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation and using factor loading greater than 0.4, and yielded 6 factors that explained 59.1% of the variance in fall risk (more than 12 questions). The coefficient alpha was higher than the usually recommended value of 0.70 for the total score of both SIB versions. The convergent validity between the TUG and BBS tests was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: Based on psychometric properties, it is recommended that the two Thai versions of the SIB are an appropriate initial screening tool for the multi-steps fall risk assessment algorithm in predicting falls in an elderly Thai community.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology
Efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in patients with cirrhosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Chokesuwattanaskul R., Thongprayoon C., Bathini T., Torres-Ortiz A., O'Corragain O.A., Watthanasuntorn K., Lertjitbanjong P., Sharma K., Preechawat S., Ungprasert P., Kroner P.T., Wijarnpreecha K., Cheungpasitporn W.",2019-04-01,"Administration, Oral, Anticoagulants, Atrial Fibrillation, Hemorrhage, Humans, Liver Cirrhosis, Stroke, Warfarin, Anticoagulation, Atrial fibrillation, Cirrhosis, Liver failure, Meta-analysis, Systematic review","Objective: The atrial fibrillation-related stroke is clearly prevented by anticoagulation treatment, however, management of anticoagulation for AF in patients with cirrhosis represents a challenge due to bleeding concerns. To address this issue, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was performed. Methods: A literature search for studies reporting the incidence of AF in patients with cirrhosis was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database, from inception through July 2018. Results: 7 cohort studies including 19,798 patients with AF and cirrhosis were identified. The use of anticoagulation (%) among included studies ranged from 8.3% to 53.9%. Anticoagulation use for AF in patients with cirrhosis was significantly associated with a reduced risk of stroke, with a pooled HR of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.35–0.96). When compared with no anticoagulation, the use of anticoagulation was not significantly associated with a higher risk of bleeding, with a pooled HR of 1.45 (95%CI: 0.96–2.17). Compared to warfarin, the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was associated with a lower risk of bleeding among AF patients with cirrhosis. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that anticoagulation use for AF in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a reduced risk of stroke, without increasing significantly the risk of bleeding, when compared to those without anticoagulation.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

The most recommender systems use two kinds of recommendation techniques which are collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF). CF use combination of ratings from users in the system who are similar to target user to recommend. Users who are similar to the target user are called neighbors. Therefore, CF will give variety recommendations. CBF uses the past behavior of the target user to find a similar item to the target user’s behavior to recommend. Nowadays, there are many data on social networks including tweet data in the Twitter. Thus, many researchers have studied recommender systems which based on tweet using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract latent data from observed data. However, those researches use either CF or CBF with LDA only. However, disadvantages of CF are sparsity and cold-start problem. So, the system cannot efficiently recommend. For CBF, it cannot recommend a new product that users may be interested. Therefore, this research recommends tweets base on hybrid recommender system with LDA, which combines CF and CBF to solve disadvantages of CF and CBF. From experimental results, the proposed method outperforms in term of mean absolute error and coverage.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)"

Since total concentrations generally overestimate health risks, the objectives of this study were to determine the levels of bioaccessible As and Cd in rice cultivated in the Mae Tao, Tak Province and evaluate their potential health impacts in local adults. In total, 59 locally grown rice samples were analyzed for their total and bioaccessible concentrations. Bioaccessible concentrations were obtained from an in vitro digestion process. Inorganic As concentrations were estimated assuming that 63.2–63.5% of the total As is inorganic As. Rice contained inorganic As (45.2% of white rice and 57.1% of sticky rice) and Cd (51.6% of white rice and 32.1% of sticky rice) levels exceeding the Codex standards. The bioaccessibilities of As (16.3–70.0%) and Cd (Null to 83.7%) in rice varied widely. The concentrations of bioaccessible As, which were 1–1.2 times greater than those of bioaccessible Cd, indicate a higher possibility of As absorption into the human body. Positive significant relationships were found between total and bioaccessible As (R 2 = 0.568 for white rice and R 2 = 0.704 for sticky rice) and Cd (R 2 = 0.874 for white rice and R 2 = 0.862 for sticky rice). The hazard quotient (HQ) of inorganic As exposure accounted for approximately 93.4% of hazard index (HI). Approximately 2–6 in 10,000 residents over a lifetime of 75 years could suffer from cancer as a result of daily rice consumption. Therefore, the consumption of the home-grown rice in this study should be limited.","environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

Acoustic Reduction Technique (ART) T2 weighted (T2w) periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) has been studied in brain MR but not abdominopelvic imaging. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the image quality and acoustic noise level of ART T2w PROPELLER sequence in comparison with the conventional T2w PROPELLER sequence in pediatric abdomino-pelvic imaging. Methods: Eleven consecutive pediatric patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic MRI were scanned on a 3 Tesla magnet using standard and ART T2w PROPELLER sequences. After scanning completion, objective sound level measurements were performed with a sound level meter and microphone. Mann-Whitney U test was used for a non-parametric two-tailed statistical analysis of acoustics, image rating and scan time with significance level set to 0.05. Overall inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results: Eleven pediatric patients (4 females and 7 males) between 26 days and 18 years of age (mean = 10.0, SD = 5.8) were included. ART T2w produced lower levels of acoustic noise than standard technique in a comparison of mean decibel readings from eleven trials of standard and ART T2w (p value = 0.00008). Streak artifacts were rated greater in ART T2w by both raters (p-value = 0.00278 and 0.00252). There was no significant difference in bile duct blurring, respiratory ghosting, pulsation, fat suppression or hepatic parenchymal depiction. Conclusion: Presence of additional streaking artifacts should be considered along with the benefit of reduced acoustic noise from ART T2w.","vessels and marine engineeringneering, medical","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The presence of peroxy acid functional groups on the composites was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) of the MMS-PA composites revealed the irregular structure of porous silica attached with the MNPs. The surface area of the MMS-PA was calculated to be 1089 m2 g−1, which is significantly lower than that of the starting mesoporous silica. As measured using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), MMS-PA exhibited saturation magnetization of 0.12 emu/g, indicating that the heterogeneous oxidant could respond to an external magnet. The oxidizing activity of the synthesized MMS-PA composites was investigated using vinyl acetate as a model substrate; the yields of the corresponding epoxide products were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. At room temperature, the freshly prepared MMS-PA gave 52% yield of the product, and the yield decreased only slightly to 47% for the recycled MMS-PA obtained by reactivating the recovered MMS-PA with concentrated H2O2 in acidic medium.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

Normally, a conventional U shape heat exchanger is installed in the bath, but it provides low heat removal. Thus, this study designs a novel W serpentine shape heat exchanger with identical heat transfer area to the conventional one for increasing heat removal performance. The performance of the heat exchange is tested with various flow velocities in a cross-section in range of 1.6 to 2.4 m·s− 1. Mathematical models of this process have been formulated in order to simulate and evaluate the heat exchanger performance. The results show that the developed models give a good prediction of the plating solution and cooling water temperature, and the novel heat exchanger provides better results at any flow velocity. In addition, the W serpentine shape heat exchanger has been implemented in a real hard chromium electroplating plant. Actual data collected have shown that the new design gives higher heat removal performance compared with the U shape heat exchanger with identical heat transfer area; it removes more heat out of the process than the conventional one of about 23%.","environmental, biochemistryistry, chemistry, coastal engineering","Environmental Engineering, Biochemistry, Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

We sought to study: (1) the outcomes and predictors of mortality for NONAs undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) and (2) the accuracy of ACS-NSQIP mortality risk calculator in this special population. METHODS Using the 2007 to 2015 ACS-NSQIP database, we included all patients older than 90 years of age who underwent an emergent operation with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for ""digestive system."" Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality. NONAs' mortality rates for different combinations of risk factors were also studied and compared to the ACS-NSQIP calculator-predicted mortality rates. RESULTS Out of a total of 4,456,809 patients, 4,724 NONAs were included. The overall 30-day patient mortality and morbidity rates were 21% and 45%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, several independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified, including recent history of weight loss, history of steroid use, smoking, functional dependence, hypoalbuminemia and sepsis or septic shock. The mortality among NONAs with a history of steroid use and a recent history of weight loss was 100%. Similarly, the mortality of NONAs with recent history of weight loss who presented with preoperative septic shock was 93%. The ACS-NSQIP calculator significantly and consistently underestimated the risk of mortality in all NONAs undergoing EGS. CONCLUSION Most NONAs undergoing EGS survive the hospital stay and the first 30 postoperative days, even in the presence of significant preexisting comorbidities. However, the combination of recent weight loss with either steroid use or septic shock nearly ensures mortality and should be used in the discussions with patients and families before a decision to operate is made. The ACS-NSQIP surgical risk calculator should be used with caution in these high-risk patients.",medical,"Surgery, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

Poly(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate) (PMPS) coated on NR particles (PMPS-g-NR) was successfully prepared by surface grafting polymerization using a redox couple initiator. PMPS-g-NR was treated by ozone at different feeding rates (50, 75, 100, and 125 mg/h) and treatment times (15, 30, 60, and 120 min) leading to an increase in polar function. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) showed that unsaturated bond (840 cm−1) was consumed by ozone resulting in higher intensities of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. The highest percent gel content of ozonized PMPS-g-NR was found at 100 mg/h at each ozone treatment time. After preparation as a polymer electrolyte, the electrical properties were significantly improved. Ozonized PMPS-g-NR showed that the highest ionic conductivity of ozonized PMPS-g-NR was 1.96 mS cm−1 using an ozone feeding rate of 75 mg/h for 60 min while PMPS-g-NR was 0.41 mS cm−1. The solar cell conversion efficiency (ƞ) of ozonized PMPS-g-NR at 75 mg/h for 60 min was 1.51% having a higher value than PMPS-g-NR (0.35%).

The catalytic performance was then investigated with respect to the molar ratio of tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane, as well as the reaction temperature and reaction time. The optimal catalyst was prepared using tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane in a molar ratio of 0.8:0.2, giving both high xylose conversion and furfural selectivity (greater than 94%) at 170 °C for 2 h. In addition, the catalyst had a high turnover frequency and could be reused without treatment for up to three cycles. The high turnover frequency in the xylose dehydration reaction was attributed to the three-dimensional structure of the KIT-6 mesoporous silica that facilitates the diffusion of both the reactant and products in the xylose dehydration reaction.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Risk factors are not well understood. Objective: The objective of our project is to study the prevalence and risk factors of AR in children living in the Bangkok area. Methods: A cross-sectional, multi-center survey using new GAN core questionnaires on current AR and risk factors was completed by 3,074 parents of children aged 6–7 years and by 3,217 children aged 13–14 years, directly. Results: The prevalence of current AR in children aged 6–7 years and 13–14 years was 15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]:13.8–16.3%) and 17.5% (95% CI: 16.2–18.8%), respectively. The prevalence of severe AR in children aged 6–7 years and 13–14 years was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6–1.3%) and 1.9% (95% CI: 1.4–2.4%), respectively. Co-morbidity with asthma and eczema was 27.1% and 24.6%, respectively. Significant factors associated with AR include parental history of asthma (p =0.025), parental history of AR (p < 0.001), parental history of eczema (p < 0.001), lower respiratory tract infection in the first year of life (p < 0.001), breastfeeding (p = 0.019), current use of paracetamol (p < 0.001), exercise (p < 0.001), current cat exposure (p = 0.008), and truck traffic on the street of residence (< 0.001).

The cell wall peptidoglycan of the strain was found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant phospholipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol. The characteristic whole-cell sugars were identified as glucose, xylose, galactose and mannose. The major menaquinones were found to be MK-9(H 6 ), MK-10(H 6 ) and MK-10(H 8 ), and the major cellular fatty acids were identified as iso-C 16:0 , iso-C 15:0 , anteiso-C 15:0 and anteiso-C 17:0 . Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain AZ1-19 T is closely related to Micromonospora costi CS1-12 T (98.75% similarity), Micromonospora avicenniae 268506 T (98.75%), Micromonospora haikouensis 232617 T (98.68%) and Micromonospora siamensis TT2-4 T (98.61%), whilst the corresponding phylogenetic analysis based on partial gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene sequences indicated that strain AZ1-19 T forms a clade with M. avicenniae 268506 T with a high bootstrap value. The DNA G + C content was determined to be 69.8 mol%. Moreover, a combination of DNA–DNA relatedness values and some phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties indicated that the strain could be distinguished from closely related species. Therefore, it is considered that strain AZ1-19 T represents a novel Micromonospora species for which the name Micromonospora azadirachtae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AZ1-19 T (= KCTC 39941 T = NBRC 112784 T = JCM 32148 T = TISTR 2559 T ).","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Biology"

Buying decisions on Durio zibethinus L. or Durian cv. Monthong are not instantaneous. Packaging designers and marketers need to understand how color stimuli impact the customer's buying decision process. The color attributes of durian images, such as hue, saturation, and intensity based on HSI color system were evaluated for examining the color and generating stimuli. A psychophysical experiment was conducted based on the feelings of “deliciousness,” “attractiveness,” and “naturalness” from the packaging, as these feelings impact buying decisions. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that saturation had a significant effect on all the feelings that influence buying decisions. The multiple regression analysis showed that the relationships between “Attractiveness of Flesh (Att-F)” and “Deliciousness of Flesh (Del-F)” and the buying decision were significant. In addition, the relationship between the saturation levels set by Adobe Photoshop and Chroma difference (ΔC* ab ) indicated that the appropriate Chroma difference (ΔC* ab ) should be in the range of 21 to 28 to achieve the highest satisfaction and a predicted probability of buying of more than 90%.","sociology, chemistry, coastal engineering","Human Factors and Ergonomics, Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Results showed that DON biodegradation rate in the samples was suppressed by phenol at 3.4-62.9%. The inhibition was observed clearly at phenol concentrations of 250 mg/L or greater and increased with the concentration. Having phenol degraders as the test culture did not change the patterns of phenol inhibition on DON biodegradation.

In this study, two-dimensional plane strain condition is setup for modelling the problem while the lower bound solution of the problem is obtained by employing the finite element approach of lower bound limit analysis. The lower bound optimization problem is cast as the second-order cone programming, and is solved by a conic programming algorithm. For practical use, the results of lower bound solution are summarized in the form of dimensionless stability charts of the load factor that is a function of the cover depth ratio of opening, overburden stress factor and soil friction angles. Plastic yielding zones predicted from the lower bound analysis are discussed and examined for these dimensionless parameters while the computed lower bound solutions are validated with an existing solution. Finally, a closed-form approximate expression is developed for predicting the lower bound solution of the load factor for the problem with practical ranges of cover depth ratios of opening, overburden stress factors, and soil friction angles. New opening stability factors with respect to soil cohesion and unit weight as a function of cover depth ratios of opening and soil friction angles are presented.","engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

The long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with adverse events. We evaluated the efficacy of rebamipide for peptic ulcer prevention. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted between July 2014 and November 2017. Patients receiving dual antiplatelets for ≥ 1 year with no history of peptic ulcer bleeding or perforation were recruited and randomly assigned to the rebamipide (300 mg/day) group or the placebo group. Patients who used proton pump inhibitors were excluded. The primary endpoint was a new mucosal break on esophagogastroduodenoscopy at 3 or 12 months after treatment initiation. The secondary endpoints were hematocrit changes from the baseline, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chest pain. Antiplatelet function was assessed. Results: In total, 95 eligible patients were identified; 12 were excluded, and 83 patients were randomized, with 66 (79.5%) and 59 (71.1%) patients eligible at the 3- and 12-month follow ups, respectively. The baseline characteristics were equivalent between the groups. During the 12 months of follow up, 13 patients (43.3%) taking rebamipide and 19 (65.5%) taking the placebo experienced mucosal injury (P = 0.07). Two patients (6.7%) taking rebamipide and eight (27.6%) taking the placebo had peptic ulcers ≥ 5 mm or < 5 mm with pigmented spots (P = 0.03). The changes in hematocrit were not different between the two groups. Neither bleeding ulcers nor chest pain was observed.

The G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30)-mediated PKc pathway is involved in the inhibition of the potassium channel in HEK-239 cells. GPR30 mediates rapid actions of aldosterone in vitro. There are no reports available regarding the aldosterone action on other PKc isoforms and GPR30 proteins in vivo. The aim of the present study was to examine rapid actions of aldosterone on protein levels of phosphorylated PKc (p-PKc) delta, p-PKc epsilon, and GPR30 simultaneously in the rat kidney. Methods. Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline solution or aldosterone (150 μg/kg body weight). After 30 minutes, abundance and immunoreactivity of p-PKc delta, p-PKc epsilon, and GPR30 were determined by Western blot analysis and immunohisto-chemistry, respectively. Results. Aldosterone administration significantly increased the renal protein abundance of p-PKc delta by 80% (p<0.01) and decreased p-PKc epsilon protein by 50% (p<0.05). Aldosterone injection enhanced protein immunoreactivity of p-PKc delta but suppressed p-PKc epsilon protein intensity in both kidney cortex and medulla. Protein abundance of GPR30 was elevated by aldosterone treatment (p<0.05), whereas the immunoreactivity was obviously changed in the kidney cortex and inner medulla. Aldosterone translocated p-PKc delta and GPR30 proteins to the brush border membrane of proximal convoluted tubules. conclusions. This is the first in vivo study simultaneously demonstrating that aldosterone administration rapidly elevates protein abundance of p-PKc delta and GPR30, while p-PKc epsilon protein is suppressed in rat kidney. The stimulation of p-PKc delta protein levels by aldosterone may be involved in the activation of GPR30.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

However, there was no such study in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and budget impact of CRC screening modalities for average-risk persons in Thailand. Methods: A decision tree coupled with a Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy using a societal perspective. The input parameters were obtained from a CRC screening project at a Thai tertiary care hospital, Thai health care costs and databases, and systematic literature review. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 US Dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Finally, budget impact analysis was conducted. Results: At the Thai ceiling threshold of societal willingness-to-pay of 4,706 USD, the screening colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT, starting at age 50, was cost-effective, as compared to no screening resulting in 15.09 and 15.00 QALYs with the ICERs of 600.20 and 509.84 USD/QALY gained, respectively. Colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT could prevent 17.9% and 5.7% of early stage cancer and 27.8% and 9.2% of late stage cancer per 100,000 screening over lifetime when compared to no screening, respectively. The colonoscopy screening was cost-effective with the ICER of 646.53 USD/QALY gained when compared to FIT. The probabilities of being cost-effective for the colonoscopy and FIT were 75% and 25%, respectively. Budget impact analysis showed the colonoscopy screening required an 8-times higher budget than FIT. Conclusions: Colonoscopy offers the best value for money of CRC screenings in Thailand. Annual FIT is potentially feasible since it requires less resources. Our findings can be used as part of evidence for informing policy decision making.Key points for decision makers There was a lack of cost-effective study of colorectal cancer screening programs in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluated lifetime health outcomes and costs, and the cost-effectiveness of colorectal screening options for average-risk persons in Thailand. Colonoscopy screening every 10 years is cost-effective with high probability of being cost-effective as compared with annual fecal immunochemical test. Screening by annual fecal immunochemical test is more feasible in terms of human resource and budgetary burden. Colorectal screening programs provides an opportunity for early diagnosis and treatments to prevent advance colorectal stages and avoid higher consequent costs. This study contributes a new evidence-based knowledge for Thailand and can be used to support policy decision making process.",medical,Health Policy

As a result of poor post-harvest drying and inappropriate storage conditions, rice grains are often damaged through fungal spoilage as well as mycotoxin production. The objective of this research was to evaluate the possibility of using the near infrared spectroscopy, with a wavenumber range between 12500 and 4000 cm−1 (800–2500 nm), as a rapid method for detection of aflatoxins in brown rice. Firstly, storage trials were carried out to generate representative of samples contaminated and non-contaminated with aflatoxins. These data were used to create a partial least squares regression model using 120 brown rice samples with the required near infrared spectral data and aflatoxin concentration levels that were determined using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays method. The accuracy of developed models was externally validated using the test set. The statistical model developed from the treated spectra (vector normalization; SNV) provided the best accuracy in prediction with a coefficient of determination of prediction (r2) of 0.95, a root mean square error of prediction of 415.00 µg kg−1 and a bias −54.00 µg kg−1. The model developed showed good predictive performance which suggests that it could have practical applications as a rapid method to detect aflatoxins in brown rice.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Spectroscopy

The pathology of the neuromuscular control system in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (SDCP) could contribute to atypical movement patterns leading to the inefficiency performance including the STS task. However, there was also a lack of evidence about kinematics, kinetics, and especially mechanical work during the STS task in children with SDCP aged 7–12 years old. Research question: What were the differences in mechanical work, kinematics and kinetics during STS task between children with SDCP and typically developing (TD) children? Methods: Eleven children with SDCP (GMFCS I-II) and eleven age and gender-matched control TD children with an age range of 7–12 years were enrolled. Motion analysis and force plate systems were used to collect data. All participants performed the STS task from an adjustable chair. Independent sample t-test and two-way analysis of variance were used in this study. Results: The children with SDCP took a longer time and used more mechanical work during STS than TD children. At the beginning of the STS task, children with SDCP showed more trunk flexion and posterior pelvic tilting; in addition, during the STS task they also presented more trunk, hip, and knee flexion than TD children. However, the children with SDCP showed less ankle dorsiflexion compared with TD children. For the kinetic variables, asymmetry was found in children with SDCP. The maximum hip and knee extension moment, plantar flexion moment, and peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF) of the non-dominant leg were higher than the values of the dominant leg in these children. Significance: Even though, children with SDCP who are able to independently STS. They were also a mechanically less efficient performance during STS task. Therefore, this task still needs to be trained during rehabilitation sessions.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biophysics, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Rehabilitation"

Previously, we reported increases in oxidative stress and LINE-1 protein (ORF1p) expression in human BlCa tissues. In this study, we measured 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-oxoguanosine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), H3K9me3 and HP1α in bladder tissues obtained from BlCa patients. Reactivation of LINE-1 by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through chromatin remodeling was investigated in seven BlCa cell lines. We found that 5mC was decreased, but 8-OHdG, H3K9me3 and HP1α levels were increased in BlCa tissues relative to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. OGG1, H3K9me3 and HP1α expression in BlCa tissues were positively correlated with 8-OHdG levels. Following H 2 O 2 treatment, LINE-1 transcript expression was increased in VM-CUB-1 and TCCSUP, whereas AluYa5 and AluYb8 transcripts were increased in BFTC905 cells. Basal expression of LINE-1 ORF1p varied among BlCa cell lines from none to very high. H 2 O 2 treatment clearly increased expression of ORF1p in VM-CUB-1, TCCSUP and BFTC905. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that 5′-LINE-1 promoters became further enriched in H3K4me3 and H3K18ac in VM-CUB-1 and BFTC905 cells treated with H 2 O 2 . In contrast, 5′-LINE-1 promoters became more enriched in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in UM-UC-3 treated with H 2 O 2 . In summary, decreased 5mC, but increased 8-OHdG, H3K9me3 and HP1α expression were demonstrated in human BlCa tissues, indicating global DNA hypomethylation, increased oxidative stress and altered histone methylation in BlCa. Chromatin structures were profoundly changed in BlCa cells exposed to ROS, but expression of LINE-1 transcript and protein were at most modestly increased. ROS enhanced expression of full-length LINE-1 elements only in cell lines with pre-existing activation, which was paralleled by increased formation of active chromatin at LINE-1 promoter loci.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Physiology (medical)"

Chrysotobibenzyl has been reported to decrease cell metastasis, according to the results of an anchorage-independent growth assay; however, its underlying mechanism has not been investigated yet. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chrysotobibenzyl on lung cancer cell migration and drug sensitization and its mechanism. Methods: Cell viability, cell proliferation and drug sensitization were determined by MTT assay. Cell migration was analyzed using a wound-healing assay. Transwell migration and invasion were analyzed using Boyden chamber assay. Mechanisms of chrysotobibenzyl against metastasis including cell migration, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Results: Treatment with chrysotobibenzyl was applied at concentrations of 0–50 µM and the results showed non-cytotoxicity in human lung cancer cells (H460, H292, A549, and H23) and other non-cancerous human cells (HCT116, primary DP1 and primary DP2). However, 50 µM of chrysotobibenzyl significantly altered cell proliferation in H292 cells at 48 h. In addition, 1–50 µM of chrysotobibenzyl significantly inhibited H460 and H292 cell migration, invasion, filopodia formation, and decreased EMT in a dose-dependent manner at 48 h, which were correlated with reduced protein levels of integrins β1, β3, and αν, p-FAK, p-AKT, Cdc42, and Cav-1. We also established shRNA-Cav-1-transfected (shCav-1) H460 and H292 cells. shCav-1 transfected cells can decrease cell migration and downregulate the expression of integrins β1, β3, and αν when compared with the control. Moreover, chrysotobibenzyl was shown to suppress EMT indicated by the reduction of EMT markers (Vimentin, Snail, and Slug), and sensitize lung cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. Conclusion: Treatment with chrysotobibenzyl inhibited lung cancer cell migration via Cav-1, integrins β1, β3, and αν, and EMT suppressions. The downregulation of integrins in response to the compound not only inhibited cell metastasis, but also sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by using a random-effects model to characterize TC and estimated the prevalence of thyroid diseases in FAP patients. Twelve studies (n = 9821) were included. Pooled prevalence of TC, benign thyroid masses, and endocrinologic thyroid disorders in FAP were 2.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3–4.8], 48.8% [95% CI 33.8–64.0], and 6.9% [95% CI 4.5–10.3] respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed higher prevalence of TC in studies with fewer participants, studies that used screening ultrasound to diagnose TC, and studies that were published after 2002. TC diagnosis preceded the diagnosis of FAP in 34% of the patients. The means age at diagnosis of FAP and TC were 29 and 31 years, respectively. 95% of the patients were female and the most common pathology was of papillary subtype (83.3%). Most mutations (79.2%) were located at the 5′ end of APC gene. In summary, benign thyroid disorders are common in FAP, yet, TC is an uncommon phenomenon.

Our study is based on more than 200 000 fruits representing 478 plant species, associated with 369 insect species. Insect host-specificity was remarkably high: only 20% of seed predator species were associated with more than one plant species, while each tree species experienced seed predation from a median of two insect species. Phylogeny, but not plant traits, explained patterns of seed predator attack. These data suggest that seed predators are unlikely to mediate indirect interactions such as apparent competition between plant species, but are consistent with their proposed contribution to maintaining plant diversity via the Janzen–Connell mechanism.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics"

In this study, both computational and experimental approaches were conducted to explore the effect of the cell and microwell sizes on the ability of cell-trapping in a triangular microwell. From computational studies, it was found that the interaction between a spanwise vortex on the upper part and counter-rotating streamwise vortices at the leading edge helped to form a pair of secondary streamwise vortices deeper inside the microwell. The strength and size of these secondary streamwise vortices, which depended on the size of the microwell, played an important role in the arrangement of entrapped cells. The experimental results, with both microbeads and white blood cells (WBCs), were in good agreement with the simulated ones, and suggested that the ratio between the cell and microwell sizes was an important factor in the efficacy of single-, double- and multiple-cell cell-trapping. Entrapment of canine WBCs (size distribution between 7–15 µm) attained a highest single-cell trapping efficiency of 20.4 % in the array of 40-µm triangular microwells of 30 µm depth at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/h, but this was reduced to 16.5 and 10.6 % in the 60- and 80-µm microwells, respectively, under the same conditions.",engineering,"Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The preparation of adsorbents involved electrospinning of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) solution, radiation-induced grafting (RIG) of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto electrospun nanofibers, and functionalization of poly-GMA grafted s-PP nanofibrous mats with different amines, including ethanolamine (EA) diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA). The effect of different amination parameters: namely, amine concentration, reaction time, temperature, and degree of grafting (DG) on the degree of amination (DA), was evaluated. The nanofibrous mats containing amine were tested for CO2 adsorption in a fixed bed column operated under various parameters such as amine density, amine type, initial CO2 concentration and temperature. The adsorbents recorded CO2 adsorption capacities of 2.87, 2.06, and 0.94 mmol/g for EA-, DEA- and TEA-containing adsorbents, respectively, at 30°C using initial CO2 concentration of 15%. This was coupled with the same order of high amine efficiency of 75, 57, and 31%. Results demonstrated that the nanofibrous adsorbent containing amine had strong potential for CO2 capture application.","mixing and separation, energy, Economics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Economics and Econometrics"

In this paper, we present a deep learning model that combines recurrent neural networks with a probabilistic graphical model, as well as, a variational inference-based dropout approach. We benchmark our model on one of the largest Thai corpora called “BEST 2010”. Our model outperforms all baseline methods without relying on extra manually annotated resources and external knowledge.","data processing, fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

How often these patients exceed the recommended dose limits for occupational radiation exposure of >100 mSv for 5 years and >50 mSv in a single year from CT alone remains unknown. This study aimed to quantify radiation doses from CTs received by stone patients before their evaluation at a tertiary care stone clinic. Methods: From November 2015 to March 2017, consecutive new patients enrolled into the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU™) had the dose-length product of every available CT abdomen/pelvis within 5 years of their initial visit recorded, allowing for an effective dose (EDose) calculation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with exceeding recommended dose limits. Models were created to test radiation reducing effects of low-dose and phase-reduction CT protocols. Results: Of 343 noncontrast CTs performed, only 29 (8%) were low-dose CTs (calculated EDose <4 mSv). Among 389 total patients, 101 (26%) and 25 (6%) had an EDose >20 mSv and >50 mSv/year, respectively. Increased body mass index, number of scans, and multiphase scans were associated with exceeding exposure thresholds (p < 0.01). The implementation of a low-dose CT protocol decreased the estimated number of scans contributing to overexposure by >50%. Conclusions: Stone patients referred to a tertiary stone center may receive excessive radiation from CT scans alone. Unnecessary phases and underutilization of low-dose CT protocols continue to take place. Enacting new approaches to CT protocols may spare stone patients from exceeding recommended dose limits.",medical,Urology

The automated platform for image capturing consists of xy-table, which have work space of 220 mm x 220 mm,accuracy of 0.05 mm, and vertical z-axis for image focusing. With the automated platform, each well of 96-well plate can be automatically captured with high resolution. Next, the counting algorithm is a program for counting and analyzing the images. The algorithm is developed from Halcon library. The results show that the accuracy of the counting algorithm is good enough for the application. Moreover, with this system, there is no additional process of nontransparent liquid to achieve contrast-enhanced image during image capturing.

The in-vitro studies proved that the metal oxides have the potential to generate the NADPH in the presence of electron donor, the usual components of photoautotrophic growth conditions. When the NADPH regeneration was applied in Synechocystsis, the strain showed improved growth and ethanol production. This improved ethanol synthesis is attributed to the increased availability of NADPH to the ethanol synthesis pathway and redirection of closely related carbon metabolism into the ethanol synthesis. Under optimized light intensity and NADP addition, the maximum ethanol production of 5,100 mg/L was observed in MgO mediated extracellular NADPH regeneration after 25 days of cultivation, which is 2-fold higher than the control. This study indicates the feasibility of metal oxide mediated extracellular NADPH regeneration of Synechocystis to increase the production of ethanol.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

A significant decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was observed for ΔramA, indicating reduced carbon flow to the TCA cycle in ΔramA. To create an efficient pyruvate producer, the ramA gene was deleted in a strain lacking the genes involved in all known lactate- and acetate-producing pathways.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of MA use on long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) methylation patterns in association with MA-induced paranoia. This study recruited 123 normal controls and 974 MA users, 302 with and 672 without MA-induced paranoia. The Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism was used to assess demographic and substance use variables. Patterns of LINE-1 methylation were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) was used to estimate overall LINE-1 methylation (mC) while COBRA classified LINE-alleles into four patterns based on the methylation status of two CpG dinucleotides on each strand from 5′ to 3′, namely two methylated (mCmC) and two unmethylated (uCuC) CpGs and two types of partially methylated loci (mCuC that is 5′m with 3′u and uCmC that is 5′u with 3′m CpGs). MA users showed higher % mCuC and % mCuC + uCmC levels than controls. Use of solvents and opioids, but not cannabis and alcohol dependence, significantly lowered % uCmC levels, while current smoking significantly increased % uCuC levels. MA-induced paranoia was strongly associated with changes in LINE-1 partial methylation patterns (lowered % uCmC), heavy MA use, lower age at onset of MA use, and alcohol dependence. Women who took contraceptives showed significantly lower LINE-1 % mC and % mCmC and higher % uCuC levels than women without contraceptive use and men. The results show that MA-induced changes in LINE-1 partial methylation patterns are associated with MA-induced paranoia and could explain in part the pathophysiology of this type of psychosis. It is argued that MA-induced neuro-oxidative pathways may have altered LINE-1 partial methylation patterns, which in turn may regulate neuro-oxidative and immune pathways, which may increase risk to develop MA-induced paranoia.","psychologyhiatry, neuroscience","Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

We measured formaldehyde removal rates at concentrations similar to those caused by new furniture or office photocopiers. We also measured CO2 and humidity changes, counted the stomata density and monitored leaf color and shape changes. Controls were an artificial polyester “fern” and methanol as the VOC. All plants reduced formaldehyde from 0.75 ppm to below 0.2 ppm in six hours. The plants fall into two major groups with different responses: one group showed high removal rates: Boston fern (0.85 m h−1), golden pothos (0.41 m h−1), Spanish moss (0.44 m h−1) and spider plant (0.40 m h−1) - faster than the artificial fern (0.09 m h−1). They also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde. Another group absorbed formaldehyde at a significantly lower rate (dumb cane: 0.07 m h−1; aloe vera: 0.17 m h−1; and Chinese evergreen: 0.09 m h−1) and had a generally different overall behavior from the ‘fast’ group - different CO2, humidity and variance changes - suggesting a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism. An ‘intermediate case’, snake plant (0.29 m h−1), has a slower rate than the fast group but also exhibited other changes, suggesting some combination of both mechanisms. Overall good correlations between formaldehyde uptake rates and stomata counts, total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rates were shown by all these plants.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering, sociology","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Geography, Planning and Development, Building and Construction"

Removal of GA at 0.1 mM in 200 g/L NaCl solution at pH 7 was 90% after 75 min irradiation using 5 g/L of the photocatalyst. The GA removal followed pseudo-first order reaction with a rate constant of 0.0303 min−1. At pH 5 or at 300 g/L NaCl, the photocatalytic removal of GA was almost completely inhibited. Similar inhibitions were observed when adding dissolved organic carbon (from humic acid) at 10 and 200 mg/L, or Br− at 120 mg/L to the system. The removal rate of GA markedly increased with increasing pH (5–9), photocatalyst loading (2–8 g/L) and under 350 nm UV (compared to visible light). On the contrary, the removal rate of GA markedly decreased with increasing NaCl and initial GA concentrations (0–300 g/L for NaCl and 0.1–0.4 mM for GA). A quenching experiment was also conducted; electron holes (h+) and superoxide ((Figure presented.)) were found as the main reactive species responsible for the removal of GA while [rad]OH had a very limited effect.","genergyal, water engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is the main cause of hepatitis C, has a high mutation rate due to the lack of proofreading activity of the RNA polymerase enzyme. The NS3/4A serine protease is an important target for anti-HCV drug discovery and development because of its crucial role in the cleavage of the polypeptides involved in viral replication. In the present study, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation was performed to elucidate the effect of the single point mutations R155K and D168A in the HCV genotype 1 NS3/4A protease on the structural dynamics, molecular interactions and susceptibility of asunaprevir (ASV), a second-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitor.

The catalysts included homogeneous acids (i.e. H2SO4, H3PO4 and HCl), and heterogeneous carbonaceous solid acids (CSAs) synthesized from the hydrothermal treatment of glucose, cellulose and lignin. It was found that the highest phenolic monomers yield was achieved from CSA derived from lignin (CSAlignin). In addition, this catalyst showed the highest activity and stability after 5 consecutive cycles, which was related to its high acidity as well as its low acid leaching compared to CSACellulose and CSAGlucose. The effects of catalyst loading, reaction temperature, reaction time, and solvent type (i.e. methanol, ethyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), acetone) on the depolymerization performance were also performed. It was observed that the reaction at 350 °C for 3 h using MIBK as solvent with CSAlignin loading of 10 wt% gave the maximum total phenolic yield of 32.8%, from which 4-ethylphenol and guaiacol were the major phenolic products from the reaction.

Since the dispersity of graphene in the polymer matrix is the key parameter of controlling the properties of the composites, the ABS/graphene masterbatches with high concentration of graphene were produced via three techniques: Dry mixing; solvent mixing and coagulation techniques. The obtained high concentration ABS/graphene masterbatches were then mixed with pure ABS and melt extruded to produce ABS/graphene composites filament with 1 wt% of graphene. The ABS/graphene composites preparing via solvent mixing and coagulation were found successfully 3D printed.

Currently, no worldwide data exist on this topic and limited published data exist on the impact of atopic comorbidity, type of allergy and foods eliminated on growth. We therefore set out to perform a worldwide survey on growth and impacting factors in food allergic children. Methods: A prospective growth survey was performed of children (aged 0–16 years) on an elimination diet with confirmed immunoglobulin (Ig)E and non-IgE mediated food allergies. Data collected included: weight-for-age, weight-for-height, height-for-age, head circumference, body mass index, type of food allergy and eliminated foods, allergic comorbidities and replacement milk/breast milk. Multivariable regression analysis was used to establish factors that affected growth. Results: Data from 430 patients from twelve allergy centres were analysed: median age at diagnosis and data collection was 8 months and 23 months, respectively. Pooled data indicated that 6% were underweight, 9% were stunted, 5% were undernourished and 8% were overweight. Cow's milk elimination lead to a lower weight-for-height Z-scores than other food eliminations and mixed IgE and non-IgE mediated allergy had lower height-for-age Z-scores than IgE mediated allergy. Children with only non-IgE mediated allergies had lower weight-for-height and body mass index. Atopic comorbidities did not impact on growth. Conclusions: Stunting is more common in children with food allergies than low weight. Children particularly at risk of poor growth are those with non-IgE and mixed IgE and non-IgE mediated allergies, as well as those with cow's milk allergy.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

Recently, health hazards have arisen in Japan regarding P. candollei-derived products containing potent estrogenic compounds. Therefore, the development of standardization methods for P. candollei materials is an urgent problem requiring resolution. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an effective analytical technique because it enables the development of sensitive and specific assays of the target compound through antigen−antibody reaction. Here, we produced a monoclonal antibody against Kwa (MAb 11F) by immunizing Kwa-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugates prepared using an N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) mediated method. Stability and cross-reactivity tests of MAb 11F revealed that the MAb 11F is stable for at least 4 months at 4 °C and is highly specific to Kwa. The detectable concentration range of an indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) using MAb 11F exhibited values of 1.53–48.8 ng/mL with the limit of detection (LOD) of 1.13 ng/mL. Validation analyses revealed that the developed icELISA is precise, accurate, and reliable enough to be applied to P. candollei-derived samples and products for their standardization.","plant science; biochemistryistryhemistry; sEconomicsdary products; flavonoids, including anthocyanins, drug literature index, pharmacology","Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Brake pads consist of fillers, lubricants, abrasives, reinforcing fibers, and binders. These are compacted together as raw materials. Each component is responsible for a different specific property to help the brake pad reduce the speed of the vehicle. The forming of a brake pad begins with compression of friction powder in a rigid mold with a complicated contour. It is then compacted by vertically pressing punches to form a body of complicated shape and homogeneous density. The strength of the brake pad, which is a main property in the compacted material, primarily depends on the type of fiber reinforcing material. Since the ability of fiber to flow is poor due to its high internal friction and its random arrangement. These two characteristics cause non uniformity in density and elastic modulus. Pressure equalization is an adjustment of the filling depth of the powder which otherwise would have an uneven fill inf the cavity of the mold. The pressure equalization of the filled powder is shown to correlate with the brake pad dimensional accuracy and uniformity of density.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The calcination temperature was varied from 600 to 1100 °C with an increment of 100 °C. On the basis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, it was found that the crystallite and particle sizes of BTO increased as the calcination temperature increased. The average particle size of BTO was close to its crystallite size at low calcination temperatures. However, a large difference between crystallite and particles sizes was evident at high calcination temperatures, indicating the formation of several crystallites in an individual particle. According to the XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses, the BTO particles evolved from a cubic to a tetragonal structure at a calcination temperature of 800 °C. The cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation of sol-gel derived BTO particles occurred at a critical crystallite size of about 30 nm and a particle size of about 100 nm. We anticipate that the obtained results here can be a useful guideline and reference for the preparation of nanocrystalline BTO particles with a desirable size and phase structure.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

In this study, we detected EBV in the normal stomach (NS; n = 19), chronic gastritis (CG; n = 36), intestinal metaplasia (IM; n = 40), gastric dysplasia (GD; n = 15), and gastric adenocarcinoma (GC; n = 33) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the latent membrane protein (LMP1) gene of EBV. EBV-PCR amplification was positive in 42.1%, 36.1%, 22.5%, 13.3%, and 33.3% of NS, CG, IM, GD, and GC, respectively. For further clarification in EBVaGC, we performed EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) in PCR-positive cases of GD and GC. Four GC cases were EBER-ISH positive (12.1%), while both GD cases were EBER-ISH negative. In addition, we determined the distribution of the EBV strain (type A or B) based on EBNA3C sequence and EBV variants based on LMP1 variation (wild-type and 30-bp deletion variants; wt-LMP1 or del-LMP1).

Incorporation of hydrogen by-product from NaOCH3 production for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation: Process analysis and economic evaluation,"Charoensuppanimit P., Kitsahawong K., Kim-Lohsoontorn P., Assabumrungrat S.",2019-03-01,"CO2 capture, CO2 hydrogenation, Hydrogen sources, Methanol production, Sodium methoxide, CO2 capture and utilization, CO2 hydrogenation, Economic analysis, Hydrogen source, Methanol production, Sodium methoxide","A major problem regarding the production of methanol via the CO2 hydrogenation is the source of hydrogen that is still expensive and not economically sustainable. Utilization of hydrogen available as a by-product from other processes may resolve such issue. In this work; therefore, we evaluate the potentiality of incorporating the hydrogen by-product from the NaOCH3 production for the synthesis of methanol via hydrogenation of CO2, a greenhouse gas released from industry. Due to the limited availability of hydrogen from NaOCH3 production, a detailed analysis of kinetic in the reactor systems including, 1) the adiabatic fixed bed, 2) the isothermal multi-tube, and 3) the adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with an intercooler, are simulated using Aspen Plus in order to select the most appropriate reactor system that maximizes the conversion of hydrogen and CO2. The adiabatic fixed bed reactor appears the most appropriate since it consumes the highest amount of CO2, and shows the highest Profitability Index when compared to other reactor systems. In addition, methanol produced from this proposed process can provide a 16.4% reduction in the methanol feedstock required for the upstream process of NaOCH3 production. An analysis using Aspen Economic is also performed in this work which reveals that the saving cost generated from the recycle of methanol to the upstream process is almost comparable to the costs of construction and operation of the process of methanol synthesis. According to our useful sensitivity analysis, a methanol price as well as hydrogen and CO2 feed rates directly influenced the feasibility of the proposed process. The obtained result indicates that this proposed process is potentially feasible when 1) the price of methanol increases, and 2) the availability of hydrogen increases due to the increased NaOCH3 production capacity over than 1.5 times of the current scale.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

However, we found that there was a proportion of broodfish in our laboratory that appeared to be healthy but which tested positive for Fno. We therefore hypothesized that Fno might be able to be transmitted from subclinically infected tilapia mouthbrooders to their offspring through the current practice of fry production in tilapia hatcheries. To prove this, experimentally infected hybrid red tilapia broodstock were mated and their offspring were examined for the presence of Fno. In this study, three pairs of infected broodfish were mated for natural spawning and fertilized eggs from each couple were then collected from the female mouths for artificial incubation. The newly hatched larvae were cultured for 30 days and sample collection was performed at different developmental stages i.e. yolk-sac larvae, 5 and 30-day old fry. The results showed that the ovary and testis of all 3 pairs of the broodstock, as well as their fertilized eggs and offspring were Fno positive by Fno-specific PCR and in situ DNA hybridization. In summary, this study revealed that with the current practice in tilapia hatcheries, Fno might be able to transmit from subclinically infected tilapia mouthbrooders to their offspring. Therefore, using Fno-free broodfish in tilapia hatcheries should be considered in order to produce Fno-free tilapia fry.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Infectious Diseases"

All major findings were consistent across both populations. The association between childhood disorder and past-year disorder remained after controlling for demographics, childhood and adult trauma (and service factors in the ADF). Childhood non-interpersonal trauma was not associated with past-year disorder in either population. The pathway between childhood trauma and past-year disorder was fully mediated by the spectrum of common childhood disorders, but not by childhood anxiety, depression or alcohol use disorders alone. Identification, intervention and prevention of childhood disorders is imperative. Investment in interventions targeting the influence of childhood traumatic events on the whole spectrum of childhood disorder, not only PTSD or anxiety, is a priority.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Timed Up and Go test in typically developing children: Protocol choice influences the outcome,"Bustam I.G., Suriyaamarit D., Boonyong S.",2019-09-01,"Age Factors, Child, Child Development, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Male, Physical Functional Performance, Postural Balance, Walking Speed, Child, Mobility, Postural balance, Timed Up and Go test","Background: The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is one of the most popular functional dynamic balance tests in children with typical and atypical development. However, the TUG protocol varies in terms of turning-point markers and verbal commands. Research question: Would the outcomes of TUG be different if a different TUG protocol, especially turning-point markers and verbal commands, was used in different age and gender? Methods: Two hundred and ten typically developing children aged 6–12 years participated in the study. They were separated into 7 groups according to age. All participants were randomly selected to perform the TUG test in 6 conditions of a cone, a line, and a picture as turning-point markers under nonqualitative and qualitative verbal instructions in terms of the walking speed. The best TUG score (in seconds) of 3 trials in each condition was obtained for analysis. Results: The time to complete the TUG test was decreased by age. The fastest time was found in the picture condition under qualitative and nonqualitative verbal instructions in all age groups. Additionally, using qualitative verbal instruction resulted in faster times than nonqualitative verbal instruction for all turning-point markers and in all age groups. Significance: This study provided evidence that the outcome of the TUG test was influenced by turning-point markers and verbal instructions in all age groups. Therefore, a reliable TUG test protocol should be considered in order to measure the change in functional dynamic balance of children.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biophysics, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Rehabilitation"

A maximum adsorption capacity of 2.87 mmol/g was achieved for the sample with degree of grafting of 300% and degree of amination of 94% at feed concentration of 15% at 30 °C. This was accompanied by good mechanical characteristics and a very high amine efficiency that reached 75% at room temperature, suggesting that the obtained fibrous adsorbent has high potential for CO2 adsorption.","mixing and separation, physics",Radiation
Serum protein expression in equine glandular gastric disease (Eggd) induced by phenylbutazone,"Tesena P., Yingchutrakul Y., Roytrakul S., Wongtawan T., Angkanaporn K.",2019-01-01,"Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, Blood Proteins, Horse Diseases, Horses, Male, Phenylbutazone, Stomach Diseases, EGGD, Horse, Marker, NSAIDs, Proteomics","Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) is a common disease in sport horses. This disease might be associated with usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating inflammatory diseases. Although gastroscopy has been an effective method for diagnosisbut a less invasive, and inexpensive method is preferred. This study used proteomic technology to identify candidate serum proteins that might be used as markers of NSAIDs induced EGGD. Five Thoroughbred horses were given high doses of NSAID, phenylbutazone to treat lameness. The experiment was divided into three periods: (i) Pre-EGGD period, (ii) during EGGD period, and (iii) Post-EGGD period. Gastroscopy were used to diagnose EGGD, serum was collected to perform gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in order to identify serum proteins in each group. The candidate serum proteins were computationally predicted for the interaction between phenylbutazone and proteins, tissue specific expression, and association to gastric ulceration. After EGGD induction, all horses showed clinical signs of colic with marked congestion and erosion appearing in the mucosa of the glandular stomach whereas no change was observed in the mucosa of non-glandular stomach. Our proteomic results identified 14 proteins that might be used as EGGD markers. These proteins were highly expressed in the glandular stomach and some proteins were associated with phenylbutazone or ulcer development. However, confirmation of these candidate marker proteins is required with specific antibodies in the larger horse population before they can be considered for application in the field.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
Glochidion zeylanicum leaf extracts exhibit lifespan extending and oxidative stress resistance properties in Caenorhabditis elegans via DAF-16/FoxO and SKN-1/Nrf-2 signaling pathways,"Duangjan C., Rangsinth P., Gu X., Zhang S., Wink M., Tencomnao T.",2019-11-01,"Animals, Antioxidants, Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins, DNA-Binding Proteins, Flavonoids, Forkhead Transcription Factors, Longevity, Malpighiales, Oxidative Stress, Phenols, Plant Extracts, Plant Leaves, Plants, Medicinal, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction, Transcription Factors, Aging, Antioxidants, Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-16/FoxO, Glochidion zeylanicum, SKN-1/Nrf2","Background: Glochidion zeylanicum (GZ), a common plant in Thailand and Eastern Asia, is rich in antioxidants. However, the possible anti-aging and oxidative stress resistance properties of GZ leaf extracts (hexane and methanol extracts) have not been reported. Purpose: We aimed to provide the first science-based evidence of the beneficial effects of GZ on anti-aging and oxidative stress resistance in the Caenorhabditis elegans model. Methods: The phytochemical composition of the hexane and methanol extracts were analyzed using GLC-MS and LC-MS. Fingerprinting analysis of the extract was performed by RP-HPLC. We determined total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant properties via DPPH and ABTS assays. Oxidative stress resistance, anti-aging and lifespan were studied in C. elegans treated with leaf extracts. Results: GZ leaf extracts protected the worms against oxidative stress and attenuated ROS accumulation. The expression of stress-response genes, such as SOD-3, and GST-4 were up-regulated, whereas HSP-16.2 was down-regulated after GZ treatment. The oxidative stress resistance properties of GZ possibly involved the DAF-16/FoxO and SKN-1/Nrf-2 transcription factors. GZ leaf extracts improved pharyngeal pumping function and autofluorescent pigment attenuation suggesting anti-aging properties. GZ leaf extracts modulated the lifespan extension in C. elegans. Conclusion: This study reports novel anti-aging and antioxidant activities of GZ leaf extracts, suggesting a novel bioactivity for a medicinally important plant and supplementary drug against oxidative stress.","plant science; biochemistryistryhemistry; sEconomicsdary products, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

The key mechanisms involved in this process include changes in allergen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells. Methods: We studied 25 allergic rhinitis patients undergoing subcutaneous house dust mite–specific immunotherapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied before and after 10, 30 weeks, and 3 years of AIT. Der p 1-specific T regulatory cell responses were investigated by characterization of Der p 1-MHC class II tetramer–positive cells and correlated with nasal symptom score. Results: Twelve of 25 AIT patients matched with their MHC class II expression to the Der p 1 peptide-MHC class II tetramers. A significant increase in the numbers of Der p 1-specific FOXP3+Helios+CD25+CD127− Treg cells after 30 weeks was observed, which slightly decreased after 3 years of AIT. In contrast, Der p 1-specific immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3)+CD25+ Treg cells decreased substantially from baseline after 3 years of AIT. ILT3+ Treg cells displayed compromised suppressive function and low FOXP3 expression. In addition, Der p 1-specific IL-10 and IL-22 responses have increased after 30 weeks, but only IL-10+ Der p 1-specific Treg cells remained present at high frequency after 3 years of AIT. Increased number of FOXP3+Helios+ and IL-10+ and decreased ILT3+ Treg cell responses correlated with improved allergic symptoms. Conclusion: The results indicate that AIT involves upregulation of the activated allergen-specific Treg cells and downregulation of dysfunctional allergen-specific Treg cell subset. Correction of dysregulated Treg cells responses during AIT is associated with improved clinical response.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Herein, a novel platform for the separation and quantification of both target steroids in herbal medicines based on electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (ePADs) has been created. The ePAD was composed of Whatman SG81 chromatography paper, 3D-printed devices and a commercial screen-printed electrode. Whatman SG81 silica-coated paper was used for the separation of dexamethasone and prednisolone based on the difference in their partition coefficients during the flow of the mobile phase. The optimal mobile phase was composed of 60% ethyl acetate in cyclohexane and required 7 min for separation. The separated steroids on the paper were then quantified by electrochemical detection using differential pulse voltammetry, in which the 3D-printed devices facilitated the measurement. Analytical detection ranges of 10–500 μg mL−1 were obtained for both dexamethasone and prednisolone (r2= 0.988 and 0.994, respectively). The limits of detection for dexamethasone and prednisolone were 3.59 and 11.98 μg mL−1, respectively, whereas the limits of quantification were 6.00 and 20.02 μg mL−1, respectively. The amounts of both target steroids derived from real herbal medicine samples determined by the proposed method were comparable to those obtained with assays using standard high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, a simple evaporation step can be used to increase the concentration of the samples before analysis. These ePADs are simple, low-cost, rapid, and very promising for on-site quantitative detection.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

The obtained MCC was first modified by oxidation using sodium periodate in order to cleave the carbon-carbon bonds at the C2 and C3 of the pyranose ring to form 2,3-dialdehyde cellulose. These activated aldehyde groups significantly facilitated the sulfonation carried out using potassium metabisulfite. The sulfonic acid group contents, surface morphology, and water solubility of the obtained products were characterized by titration, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, and zeta potential. High sulfonic acid group content was achieved for the obtained SC samples (i.e., 305–689 μmol/g). The increase in the sulfonic acid group content resulted in the gradual change in the surface morphology and water solubility of the SC samples. The obtained results imply that sugarcane bagasse is a promising raw material for the production of SC with good water solubility.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
The potential of mucoadhesive polymer in enhancing efficacy of direct immersion vaccination against Flavobacterium columnare infection in tilapia,"Kitiyodom S., Kaewmalun S., Nittayasut N., Suktham K., Surassmo S., Namdee K., Rodkhum C., Pirarat N., Yata T.",2019-03-01,"Adhesives, Animals, Aquaculture, Bacterial Vaccines, Chitosan, Fish Diseases, Flavobacteriaceae Infections, Flavobacterium, Gills, Immersion, Mucous Membrane, Polymers, Static Electricity, Surface Properties, Tilapia, Vaccination, Vaccines, Inactivated, Bath vaccination, Chitosan, Columnaris disease, Tilapia","Vaccination is the most effective approach for prevention of infectious diseases in aquaculture. Although immersion vaccination is more applicable compared to in-feed/oral administration and injection, this method suffers from low potency as the efficiency of uptake of antigens through mucosal membranes is limited. In this study, we have successfully developed a mucoadhesive vaccine delivery system to enhance the efficacy of direct immersion vaccination against Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease in red tilapia. A formalin-killed negatively charged, bacterial cell suspension was used to prepare a mucoadhesive vaccine by electrostatic coating with positively charged chitosan. Our results demonstrate that the chitosan-complexed vaccine greatly increases its mucoadhesiveness, thus increasing the chances of vaccine uptake by the gill mucosa and improving the protection obtained against columnaris infection. The surface charge of the chitosan-complexed vaccine was altered from anionic to cationic after chitosan modification. Tilapia were vaccinated with the prepared chitosan-complexed vaccine by immersion. The challenge test was then carried out 30 and 60 days post vaccination, which resulted in a high level of mortalities in the non-vaccinated and uncomplexed vaccine groups. A high relative percentage survival (RPS) of vaccinated fish was noted with the mucoadhesive vaccine. Our results indicated that the naked vaccine failed to protect the fish from columnaris infection, which is consistent with the mucoadhesive assays performed during the study showing that the naked vaccine was unable to bind to mucosal surfaces. This system is therefore an effective method for immersion vaccination in order to deliver the antigen preparation to the mucosal surface membrane of the fish.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; animal vaccines, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

Here, we investigated the CD33 expression of monocytes in human blood samples processed at different temperatures and in dependence on their phagocytic activity against opsonized Escherichia coli. The samples were stained by fluorescently labelled anti-human CD14 to specify the monocyte population, anti-human CD33 antibodies to evaluate CD33 expression and analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In blood samples kept at 37°C or first pre-chilled at 0°C with subsequent warming up to 37°C, the percentage of CD33-positive monocytes as well as their relative fluorescence intensity was up-regulated compared to samples kept constantly at 0°C. After exposure to E. coli the CD33 relative fluorescence intensity of the monocytes activated at 37°C was 3 to 4 times higher than that of those cells kept inactive at 0°C.

Partial sequence analyses of exon 7 of the ABO locus of cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus (M. mulatta) macaques: Indeterminate phenotypes show the presence of the O blood group,"Kanthaswamy S., Oldt R.F., Said R., Grijalva J., Falak A., Jensen A., Vizor C., Houghton P., Bunlungsup S., Malaivijitnond S., Smith D.G.",2019-12-01,"ABO Blood-Group System, Alleles, Animals, Exons, Gene Frequency, Genetics, Population, Histocompatibility Testing, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Species Specificity, ABO loci, longtail macaques, non-human primates, rhesus macaques, Sanger sequencing","Compatibility tests to identify A, B, and O alleles are critical for establishing suitable donor-recipient matches among experimental animals. Using a qPCR-based SNP probe assay, we have identified A, B, AB, and indeterminate blood group phenotypes in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. We have hypothesized, albeit without molecular confirmation, that the indeterminate phenotype represents homozygosity for the null O allele at the macaque ABO locus. The indeterminate phenotype represents the unsuccessful detection of either A or B alleles using primers targeting the A-specific and B-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a variable region of exon 7 of the ABO locus. These SNPs are associated with two functional sites, detected using two allele-specific probes in the qPCR assay where the codons leucine and methionine (at codon 266) and glycine and alanine (at codon 268) are required for the synthesis of the A and B transferases, respectively. While reference sequences for the A and B alleles exhibited no novel mutations in the functional exon, plasmid Sanger sequence analyses showed unique mutations within the diagnostic target sites in 10 macaques exhibiting the indeterminate phenotype. Eight of these indeterminate individuals exhibited SNPs at codon 268 that should prevent the syntheses of an A or B transferase. While the two other indeterminate samples had functional codons that were consistent with A or B alleles, mutations in either their probe- or primer-binding sites that altered their peptide sequences probably impeded their detection by our assay.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Genetics"

In Factory MC, Halanaerobium sp. was the initial dominant genus, which gradually decreased while Lentibacillus sp., Halomonas sp., and Tetragenococcus sp. began to appear in the middle phase. Diversity was the highest in the late fermentation phase. On the contrary, in Factory SQ, high diversity was observed right from the early phase till the late fermentation phase. The bacterial communities varied at different stages of fermentation as well. The most common genera were Peptostreptococcus sp., Peptoniphilus sp., Gallicola sp., Fusobacterium sp., Halanaerobium sp., and Vagococcus sp.

We investigated the incidence, etiologies, outcomes, and predictive factors for 30-day mortality in patients with ALF. Methods: We conducted a population-based study of ALF patients hospitalized between 2009 and 2013 from the Thai Nationwide Hospital Admission database, which comprises 76% of all admissions from 858 hospitals across 77 provinces in Thailand. ALF was diagnosed using ICD-10 codes K72.0 and K71.11. Patients with liver cirrhosis were excluded. Results: There were 20,589 patients diagnosed with ALF during the study period with 12,277 (59.6%) males and mean age of 46.6 ± 20.7 years. The incidence of ALF was 62.9 per million population per year. The most frequent causes of ALF were indeterminate (69.4%), non-acetaminophen drug-induced (26.1%), and viral hepatitis (2.5%). Acetaminophen was the presumptive cause in 1.7% of patients. There were 5502 patients (26.7%) who died within 30 days after admission. One patient (0.005%) underwent liver transplantation. The average hospital stay was 8.7 ± 13.9 days, and the total cost of management was 1075.2 ± 2718.9 USD per admission. The most prevalent complications were acute renal failure (ARF)(24.2%), septicemia (18.2%), and pneumonia (12.3%).

A higher bloating score after wheat compared to rice and mung bean was observed clearly after lunch but not after breakfast. Conclusion: Wheat ingestion produced more intestinal gas and more bloating and satiety scores compared to rice and mung bean, especially after lunch. This provides insight into the role of intestinal gas in the development of bloating symptoms in IBS.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

We assessed the use and outcomes for adolescents receiving monotherapy or undergoing treatment interruption in a regional Asian cohort. Methods: Regional Asian data (2001–2016) were analyzed to describe PHIVA who experienced ≥2 weeks of lamivudine or emtricitabine monotherapy or treatment interruption and trends in CD4 count and HIV viral load during and after episodes. Survival analyses were used for World Health Organization (WHO) stage III/IV clinical and immunologic event-free survival during monotherapy or treatment interruption, and a Poisson regression to determine factors associated with monotherapy or treatment interruption. Results: Of 3,448 PHIVA, 84 (2.4%) experienced 94 monotherapy episodes, and 147 (4.3%) experienced 174 treatment interruptions. Monotherapy was associated with older age, HIV RNA >400 copies/mL, younger age at ART initiation, and exposure to ≥2 combination ART regimens. Treatment interruption was associated with CD4 count <350 cells/μL, HIV RNA ≥1,000 copies/mL, ART adverse event, and commencing ART age ≥10 years compared with age <3 years. WHO clinical stage III/IV 1-year event-free survival was 96% and 85% for monotherapy and treatment interruption cohorts, respectively. WHO immunologic stage III/IV 1-year event-free survival was 52% for both cohorts. Those who experienced monotherapy or treatment interruption for more than 6 months had worse immunologic and virologic outcomes. Conclusions: Until challenges of treatment adherence, engagement in care, and combination ART durability/tolerability are met, monotherapy and treatment interruption will lead to poor long-term outcomes.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Even though a number of formulas based on the limit equilibrium or semi-empirical methods are proposed to predict the uplift capacity of piles in sands, there is a major limitation of the methods in obtaining the accurate predictions. In this paper, the computational limit analysis is employed to investigate the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands. The effects of the important variables including pile length and diameter, soil friction angle and unit weight, and roughness factor at soil-pile interface are examined extensively using the dimensionless parameters while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with the parameters are discussed and compared. Approximate statistical design equations of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands are developed based on the numerically derived solutions and the existing experimental data. It is found that the proposed design equations provide the most accurate prediction of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands as compared to the existing formulas.","fluidex; related topics, foundations and piles, engineering",Ocean Engineering

METHODS: We studied 52 patients with ERS (4 women; median age, 35 years) with recurrent VF episodes. Body surface electrocardiographic imaging and endocardial and epicardial electroanatomical mapping of both ventricles were performed during sinus rhythm and VF for localization of triggers, substrates, and drivers. Ablations were performed on VF substrates, defined as areas that had late depolarization abnormalities characterized by low-voltage fractionated late potentials, and VF triggers. RESULTS: Fifty-one of the 52 patients had detailed mapping that revealed 2 phenotypes: group 1 had late depolarization abnormalities predominantly at the right ventricular (RV) epicardium (n=40), and group 2 had no depolarization abnormalities (n=11). Group 1 can be subcategorized into 2 groups: Group 1A included 33 patients with ERS with Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, and group 1B included 7 patients with ERS without Brugada electrocardiographic pattern. Late depolarization areas colocalize with VF driver areas. The anterior RV outflow tract/RV epicardium and the RV inferior epicardium are the major substrate sites for group 1. The Purkinje network is the leading underlying VF trigger in group 2 that had no substrates. Ablations were performed in 43 patients: 31 and 5 group 1 patients had only VF substrate ablation and VF substrates plus VF trigger, respectively (mean, 1.4±0.6 sessions); 6 group 2 patients and 1 patient without group classification had only Purkinje VF trigger ablation (mean, 1.2±0.4 sessions). Ablations were successful in reducing VF recurrences (P<0.0001). After follow-up of 31±26 months, 39 (91%) had no VF recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: There are 2 phenotypes of ERS/J-wave syndrome: one with late depolarization abnormality as the underlying mechanism of high-amplitude J-wave elevation that predominantly resides in the RV outflow tract and RV inferolateral epicardium, serving as an excellent target for ablation, and the other with pure ERS devoid of VF substrates but with VF triggers that are associated with Purkinje sites. Ablation is effective in treating symptomatic patients with ERS/J-wave syndrome with frequent VF episodes.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

The problem is challenging due to various nonlinear temporal and difficulty for longer-step ahead prediction. The recurring congestion on rush-hour and non-recurring congestion on accidents are the main patterns. While most of the previously proposed techniques focus on rush-hour, unexpected accidents that affect local traffic were not considered in these works. To improve the prediction, we propose an ensemble deep neural network to archive the recurring and non-recurring congestion together combining CNN and LSTM architectures. Furthermore, the accident information is utilized and embedded using stacked autoencoder. An experiment was conducted on two data sets: England's Highways and Thailand's Expressways. The results showed that a combination of CNN and LSTM can be improved by using an embedded vector of accident information.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

A few hours of downtime often occurred in a day which directly impacted on the production and in turn led to the late weekly shipment. On average, in 2018, only 83% of the shipments were on time (the target is 95%). One of the main root cause was the lack of materials due to unorganized inventory management that caused longer time to find materials. In order to reduce the downtime and improve the space utilization of the warehouse, inventory management and warehouse management systems were reviewed and a number of solutions were introduced. Firstly, inventories were classified and slow-moving or unused items were removed from the warehouse. Secondly, ABC analysis was introduced for the active ones. The layout of the warehouse was re-designed and a new operations system was developed. The result shows that inactive items had occupied most of the warehouse space equivalent to 1,342 pallets which were put in the disposal list. Moreover, new material handling equipment was brought into the warehouse to facilitate its operations.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, decision sciences","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Patients with cirrhosis, especially decompensated cirrhosis, are more prone to develop AKI than those without cirrhosis. The hepatorenal syndrome type of AKI (HRS–AKI), a spectrum of disorders in prerenal chronic liver disease, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) are the two most common causes of AKI in patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Differentiating these conditions is essential due to the differences in treatment. Prerenal AKI, a more benign disorder, responds well to plasma volume expansion, while ATN requires more specific renal support and is associated with substantial mortality. HRS–AKI is a facet of these two conditions, which are characterized by a dysregulation of the immune response. Recently, there has been progress in better defining this clinical entity, and studies have begun to address optimal care. The present review synopsizes the current diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment modalities of HRS–AKI and as well as AKI in other chronic liver diseases (non-HRS–AKI) so that early recognition of HRS–AKI and the appropriate management can be established.",medical,Gastroenterology

To determine whether the effects of ZOL would persist without further infusions, we compared changes in left hip and spine BMD over 36 months in participants randomized to ZOL 5 mg at baseline and month 12 (and to continue TDF) or to switch TDF (without receiving ZOL). We also compared changes in the plasma bone turnover markers (BTMs) C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX; bone resorption), and procollagen type 1 N propeptide (P1NP; bone formation) and determined whether CTX and P1NP changes at month 3 predicted BMD changes at month 36. Changes were compared in the per-protocol populations, which included 32 (74%) of 43 participants randomized to ZOL and 37 (88%) of 42 participants who switched TDF. Despite not receiving ZOL after month 12, mean hip and spine BMD change from baseline were stable and remained greater with ZOL at month 36 than with TDF switching (spine: 7.5% versus 2.7%, mean difference 4.7%, p < 0.001; hip: 5.5% versus 1.5%, mean difference 4.0%, p < 0.001). CTX and P1NP levels declined in both groups but significantly more with ZOL. Only percent changes in P1NP at month 3 correlated inversely with BMD changes at month 36 (spine: rho = −0.442, p < 0.001; hip: rho = −0.373, p = 0.002).

Objective: Our study aims to investigate the expression of microRNAs (miRNA), including miR-10a/b, let-7a, and miR-21, in urinary exosomes isolated from patients with active lupus nephritis (LN) compared to inactive LN. Methods: The exosomes were obtained from long-term follow up LN patients during active and 4 months after treatment (n = 3). The expression of candidate miRNAs was validated in group of LN patients with renal flare (n = 13) and remission stage (n = 18) using qPCR. All exosomes were characterized by NanoSight and western blotting. The correlation between miRNA expressions and kidney functions was studied. Results: We found that let-7a and miR-21, but not miR-10a/b, were significantly down-regulated in LN patients with active disease compared with inactive disease. Long-term follow-up patients also showed down-regulation of let-7a and miR-21 during disease flare while the expressions were elevated after complete course of treatment. Although the miRNA expressions were not significantly correlated with classical kidney injury markers, negative correlations were found in both protein leakages and glomerular filtration rate. Conclusion: Our result suggested that urinary exosome-associated miRNA, let-7a and miR-21, could be used to guide the clinical stage of LN patients and possibly plays a role in epigenetic regulation of the kidney during the disease. Its expression might be able to use as liquid biopsy, however, validation in large sample size is required to show it significant in clinical implication.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC have a more favorable prognosis compared with HPV-negative OPSCC, leading to investigation and adoption of de-escalation treatment protocols. The baseline rate of HPV prevalence in certain populations is of epidemiologic significance. We aimed to evaluate the rate of high-risk HPV in a large cohort of Thai patients, including OPSCC, oral SCC (OSCC) and laryngeal SCC (LSCC). Methods: In total, 504 patients with HN cancer (110 OPSCC, 260 OSCC and 134 LSCC) who had been treated in Chulalongkorn University between 2010 and 2016 formed the sample set. All histological slides were reviewed to validate the diagnosis and render the histological type as keratinizing (K), non-keratinizing (NK) or non-keratinizing with maturation (NK-M). Immunohistochemistry with p16 was performed in all cases and scored semiquantatively. Positive and equivocal cases were tested by the high-risk HPV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH). Validation with quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (qPCR) was performed in p16-positive OPSCC. Results: The OPSCC were represented by NK (7.3%), NK-M (16.4%) and K (76.4%) types, with an HPV incidence of 100, 22.2 and 4.7%, respectively. The average HPV prevalence in OPSCC was 14.5%. The concordance with p16/ISH was 51.6%, while concordance of the NK morphology with positive HPV ISH was 100%. ISH-qPCR concordance in p16-positive OPSCC was 72.7%. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC had significantly more tumors with a NK histologic type, tonsillar location, earlier clinical stage, less association with smoking, and, finally, better outcome and longer survival time. In non-OPSCC, p16-positive HPV-associated cancers were found in only 1.5% of OSCC (4/260) and LSCC (2/134). Conclusion: A low rate of HPV-related OPSCC was found in Thai patients. The NK morphology was an excellent predictor of high-risk HPV infection in OPSCC. For OPSCC patients, HPV-positive ones had a significantly longer survival time than HPV-negative ones. There was a lack of p16-positive HPV-related OSCC and LSCC. Morphology and p16 status had a poor predictive value for detecting HPV in OSCC and LSCC.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Oncology, Cancer Research"

The aqueous mixtures of Emim-AC and 6 types of inorganic salts, including NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, NaNO3, KNO3 and Mg(NO3)2 were individually prepared and were tested at the same condition to pretreat rice straw. Among these salt mixtures, a combination between Emim-AC and NaCl was the best method providing the highest reducing sugar at 3.099 mg/ml. Then, the simplex lattice design was applied to find the optimum proportion of Emim-Ac, NaCl and water in the pretreatment mixture. The experimental data obtained from the design were analyzed with ANOVA and the mathematical model of mixture formulation was constructed with high correlation coefficient (R2). The highest yield of reducing sugar at 16.5967 mg/ml was obtained in the formulated mixture containing 0.9% of NaCl, 71.856% of Emim-AC and 9% of water.

The analysis includes the effect of crack surface interference, i.e., crack surfaces are not allowed to overlap, that magnifies the SIF and crack opening displacement (COD) in an opened portion of the crack. For a range of possible web cracks in typical hot-rolled W shapes listed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual, the effective mode-I SIF is a function of applied stress, web crack length, crack eccentricity, and flange-to-web area ratio of the W shape. The depth-to-width ratio of W shape is not a significant parameter in the calculation of SIF. The analysis results show that the conventional (overlapping) solution underestimates the SIF at the tension-side crack tip under bending up to 12%. The effect of crack surface interference only exists between the conditions for complete crack opening and complete crack closure. Both conditions are governed by axial-to-bending stress ratio.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanics of Materials, Metals and Alloys"

Chicken feather meal is a rich source of amino acids that may serve as a peptide hydrolysate to inhibit NO activity. Anti-inflammatory hydrolysates of chicken feather meal were prepared and fractionated into five samples based on molecular mass. The smallest fraction (<0.65 kDa) exhibited the highest NO inhibitory activity without cytotoxicity towards macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Further subfractions were sufficient to obtain amino acid sequences by Q-TOF LC-MS/MS ESI analysis. Of these, the SNPSVAGVR (885.97 Da) peptide and its corresponding pure synthetic peptide have inhibitory activity against NO production by RAW 264.7 cells (IC50=(55.2±0.2) mM) without cytotoxicity. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR results revealed that the peptide of the obtained fraction reduced transcript expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines iNOS, TNF-a, COX-2 and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

MPO was derived from the Spirulina platensis specie due to its ease of harvesting and high yield of pyrolysis oil. The dried algae were fed into a continuous pyrolysis reactor to produce pyrolysis oil, from which MPO was extracted. ULO from vehicle engine was obtained from a vehicle service center and treated by flocculating and filtering. The blends were prepared to 100:0, 80:20, 50:50, 20:80 and 0:100 of MPO and ULO ratios, and tested for properties in accordance to ISO 8217, residual marine fuels. The results of the testing demonstrate that the blend of 20% MPO and 80% ULO, termed Microalgae Lubricant Blend (MLB20), can be a promising low sulfur marine fuel. The property tested and their results for MLB20, are as follows: 910.9 kg/m3density at 15 °C, 87.26 mm2/s kinematic viscosity at 50 °C, 0.461 %wt sulfur content, 0.515 %wt ash, 4.1 %vol. water content, and a total acid number of 5.4 mg KOH/g. MLB20 meets the majority of ISO 8217 specifications except for relatively high ash, acidity and water content. The pyrolysis process produced a yield of 41.37% liquid phase with MPO yield of 18.65%. The total cost of MPO production was 953.23 THB/liter, of which 73% is attributed to the algae nutrient cost. From the blending calculation, it was determined that the MLB20 cost is 198.65 THB/liter which is approximately 171 THB/liter higher than the LSFO market price. The barriers to MLB20 viability as LSFO are mainly the ISO 8217 standard's strict ash, acidity and moisture requirements and MPO cost; specifically the nutrient cost.","geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Genjiko is a scent-matching game in which players smell five scents and guess which are identical. The game is so simple and attractive that even a beginner can enjoy. However, aromatic wood and utensils such as a censer used in traditional Genjiko are very costly 1 and they are definitely not affordable for beginners. In this study, we developed a gaming system named eGenjiko that conforms to real Genjiko’s rules. The system has a computer-controlled censer that selects randomly five scents and diffuses them. After smelling all the scents, a player answers the matching pattern of five scents using simple notation by drawing on a tablet device. Then the system returns the correct answer. Using our eGenjiko, a single player who is not familiar with Genjiko can enjoy the game casually, without inviting other players.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Human-Computer Interaction
Population genetics of the ABO locus within the rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus (M. fascicularis) macaque hybrid zone,"Oldt R.F., Kanthaswamy S., Montes M., Schumann L., Grijalva J., Bunlungsup S., Houghton P., Smith D.G., Malaivijitnond S.",2019-02-01,"ABO Blood-Group System, Animals, Blood Grouping and Crossmatching, Genetics, Population, Humans, Hybridization, Genetic, Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulatta, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Thailand, ABO blood types, interspecies hybridization, long-tailed macaques, molecular diagnostics, rhesus macaques","Knowledge of the macaque ABO blood group system has been critical in the development of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as a translational model. Serving not only as a useful homologue of the disease-linked ABO system in humans, macaque ABO blood groups must be typed in colonies prior to performing experimental procedures requiring blood transfusion or transplantation. While the rates of blood type incompatibility and the distributions of A, B and AB blood groups are known in large samples of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus (M. fascicularis) macaques, there is a dearth of blood type data from macaque populations occupying the rhesus-cynomolgus hybrid zone in Southeast Asia. Using molecular phenotyping, we profiled ABO blood group distributions of 232 macaques from 10 populations in the hybrid zone and compared them to pure blood populations of the two species. We found that while these distributions are significantly different in most populations, there was a lack of differentiation between the hybrid and cynomolgus macaques as well as between the Thai and neighbouring populations. This supports a more expansive model of hybridization between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques than often proposed and highlights the increased need for consideration of population genetic structure in biomedical studies that employ macaques as animal models. Additionally, we report an enrichment of indeterminate blood types in the hybrid populations.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Immunology, biochemistryistry, medical","Immunology, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

However, the evolution of antiviral drug resistance is a major problem for treatment of HCV infected patients. Understanding of drug-resistance mechanisms at molecular level is therefore very important for the guidance of further design of antiviral drugs with high efficiency and specificity. Paritaprevir is a potent inhibitor against HCV NS3/4A protease genotype 1a. Unfortunately, this compound is highly susceptible to the substitution at D168 in the protease. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations of paritaprevir complexed with wild-type (WT) and two mutated strains (D168 N and D168Y) were carried out. Due to such mutations, the inhibitor-protein hydrogen bonding between them was weakened and the salt-bridge network among residues R123, R155 and D168 responsible for inhibitor binding was disrupted. Moreover, the per-residue free energy decomposition suggested that the main contributions from key residues such as Q80, V132, K136, G137 and R155 were lost in the D168 N/Y mutations. These lead to a lower binding affinity of paritaprevir for D168 N/Y variants of the HCV NS3/4A protease, consistent with the experimental data. This detailed information could be useful for further design of high potency anti-HCV NS3/4A inhibitors.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, Mathematics","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Computational Mathematics"

The work compared the performance of two species of vetiver named Songkhla 3 (Chrysopogon zizaniodes) and Prachuap Khiri Khan (Chrysopogon nemoralis) in absorbing lead, zinc, and cadmium in contaminated soils. Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), and Allium tests were conducted to determine toxicity of treated soil. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was also used to increase heavy metals concentration in solution in soil, which led to an increase in translocation and bioaccumulation factors. In general, results showed that concentration of heavy metals decreased in soil and increased in both the shoots and roots of vetivers during a 4-month treatment period. TCLP results indicated that the concentration of zinc and cadmium in contaminated soil was reduced over treatment time, and significantly increased after EDTA was applied. To confirm vetiver performance in phytoremediation, Allium testing showed that remained heavy metals in treated soils had no effect on nucleus aberration. Songkhla 3 and Prachuap Khiri Khan showed similar trends in their ability to remediate lead, zinc, and cadmium from contaminated soil. Both species could accumulate higher concentrations of heavy metals in their shoots and roots over time, and with EDTA application.","plant science; biotechnology; biotechnology and bioengineeringneering; waste/pollutant treatment, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Plant Science"

In this study, we examined 30 rice varieties, which revealed significant differences in the photosynthetic performance responses under salt stress conditions during the reproductive stage, which ultimately affected yield components after recovery. In rice with a correlation between net photosynthetic rate (PN) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) under salt stress, PN was found to be negatively correlated with filled grain number after recovery. Applying stringent criteria, we identified 130,317 SNPs and 15,396 InDels between two “high-yield rice” varieties and two “low-yield rice” varieties with contrasting photosynthesis and grain yield characteristics. A total of 2,089 genes containing high-and moderate-impact SNPs or InDels were evaluated by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, resulting in over-represented terms in the apoptotic process and kinase activity. Among these genes, 262 were highly expressed in reproductive tissues, and most were annotated as receptor-like protein kinases. These findings highlight the importance of variations in signaling components in the genome and these loci can serve as potential genes in rice breeding to produce a variety with salt avoidance that leads to increased yield in saline soil.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

This allows developers to access GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements; therefore, precise positioning could be determined. Some limitation is that the location of the embedded GNSS antenna (and phase centre) within the Smartphones is not disclosed by any manufacturers. This paper aims to determine Xiaomi Mi8's GNSS antenna phase centre and its performances. The positioning accuracy is computed and later compared with a controlled position where the observations are obtained by a GNSS survey receiver; Trimble R10 where the nearest Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) with baseline length of approximately 5.3 km is used as reference base stations in relative positioning computations. Their positioning results are achieved from a commercial GNSS processing software; CHC Geomatics Office (CGO) version 1.0.6. It is found that the Mi8 GNSS antenna phase centre is located on the top left of the Smartphone; approximately 2.8 cm from the centre and 0.9 cm from the top edge. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in Northings, Eastings and elevations are within centimetre level of accuracy when the screen is facing upwards.

However, the expected benefits cannot always be obtained. One of the reasons is the inadequate skill and experience of personnel for normal situation and changed situation. The skills and experiences are required for some tasks in the normal situation, although personnel can follow the static information which is created based on a planned scenario. In the changed situation, the static information may become inappropriate. The appropriate information must be updated and provided to personnel using the current information and conditions. Otherwise, the personnel cannot perceive the actual situation and select the countermeasures properly. Consequently, undesired productivity and mistakes tend to occur. Thus, this research aims to develop a support system for improving productivity and for reducing the number of mistakes in the process of prefabricated member installation by identifying available resources, collecting actual conditions, managing knowledge, generating alternative methods, and providing appropriate information. The system is developed by the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, a multi-agent system, and a database using Microsoft Visual Studio, Java Agent Development Framework (JADE), and Microsoft SQL Server. The RFID technology is employed for identifying resources. The multi-agent system consists of the following seven agents: (1) information providing agent, (2) general information agent, (3) specific information agent, (4) actual condition recording agent, (5) alternative generating agent, (6) quality assurance and control agent, and (7) evaluation agent. Additional five user interface agents are included in a user interface container. The database stores data such as inspection results, and other related information and knowledge.

In pairwise amino acid sequence alignments using the Pro-Pol protein, PepMMV shared the closest identities with broad bean true mosaic virus and cowpea mosaic virus, 56% and 53.9% respectively. In contrast, in alignments of the amino acid sequence of the coat protein (small and large coat proteins) PepMMV shared the closest identities to APMoV and red clover mottle virus, 54% and 40.9% respectively. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the conserved domains for the Pro-Pol from all members of the family Secoviridae confirmed the comovirus nature of the virus. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses supports proposing PepMMV as a new species of the genus Comovirus.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Molecular Biology, Genetics, Virology"

Methods: Data collected 2001 to 2016 from PHIVA 10-19 years of age within a regional Asian cohort were analyzed using competing risk time-to-event and Poisson regression analyses to describe the nature and incidence of morbidity events and hospitalizations and identify factors associated with disease-related, treatment-related and overall morbidity. Morbidity was defined according to World Health Organization clinical staging criteria and U.S. National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS criteria. Results: A total 3,448 PHIVA contributed 17,778 person-years. Median age at HIV diagnosis was 5.5 years, and ART initiation was 6.9 years. There were 2,562 morbidity events and 307 hospitalizations. Cumulative incidence for any morbidity was 51.7%, and hospitalization was 10.0%. Early adolescence was dominated by disease-related infectious morbidity, with a trend toward noninfectious and treatment-related morbidity in later adolescence. Higher overall morbidity rates were associated with a CD4 count <350 cells/μL, HIV viral load ≥10,000 copies/mL and experiencing prior morbidity at age <10 years. Lower overall morbidity rates were found for those 15-19 years of age compared with 10-14 years and those who initiated ART at age 5-9 years compared with <5 or ≥10 years. Conclusions: Half of our PHIVA cohort experienced a morbidity event, with a trend from disease-related infectious events to treatment-related and noninfectious events as PHIVA age. ART initiation to prevent immune system damage, optimize virologic control and minimize childhood morbidity are key to limiting adolescent morbidity.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Influence of CaO precursor on CO2 capture performance and sorption-enhanced steam ethanol reforming,"Nimmas T., Jamrunroj P., Wongsakulphasatch S., Kiatkittipong W., Laosiripojana N., Gong J., Assabumrungrat S.",2019-08-02,"Bi-functional, Bi-functional catalysts, Breakthrough periods, CaCO3, Carbonate precursor, CO2 sorption, Ethanol reforming, Spherical particle, Bi-functional material, CaCO3, CaO, CO2 sorption, Sorption-enhanced steam ethanol reforming","This work presents the effect of calcium and carbonate precursors on properties of CaCO3. The synthetic CaCO3 samples were transformed into CaO and tested their application to high-temperature CO2 capture. Four different sorbent precursors were investigated in this work, including calcium chloride (CaCl2) and calcium acetate (CaAc2) as calcium precursor, and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2) as carbonate precursor. The results show that both calcium and carbonate precursors affect morphologies of CaCO3; CaCO3,Cl-Urea, and CaCO3,Cl-Na have calcite phase, whereas mixed-phases of calcite (30%) and vaterite (70%) are observed with CaCO3,Ac-Na, and aragonite is found with CaCO3,Ac-Urea. CaCO3,Cl-Na exhibits small cubic (rhombohedral) particle, CaCO3,Cl-Urea possesses spherical particle with rough surface, CaCO3,Ac-Na has spherical-like morphology with smooth surface, and CaCO3,Ac-Urea possesses aggregated form of CaCO3 particles. For application to CO2 capture, CaO derived from CaCO3,Ac-Urea provides the highest CaO conversion of 80% at 700 °C. The synthetic CaO-based sorbents were further incorporated with nickel oxide to form one-body bi-functional catalysts for H2 production from sorption-enhanced steam ethanol reforming. The results show that 87%H2 purity could be obtained with pre-breakthrough period of 60 min. Sorbent reactivity can be maintained the production of H2 for at least 10 consecutive cycle tests.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Methods: This phase III trial was conducted in 13 geographically diverse countries across 5 influenza seasons (2011-2014). Children were randomized 1:1 to IIV4 or control. Active surveillance was performed for influenza-like episodes (ILE); influenza was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The total vaccinated cohort was evaluated (N = 12,018). Results: 5702 children experienced ≥1 ILE; 356 (IIV4 group) and 693 (control group) children had RT-PCR-confirmed influenza. Prevalence of ILE was similar in RT-PCR-positive and RT-PCR-negative cases regardless of vaccination. Breakthrough influenza illness was attenuated in children vaccinated with IIV4; moderate-to-severe illness was 41% less likely to be reported in the IIV4 group than the control group [crude odds ratio: 0.59 (95% confidence intervals: 0.44-0.77)]. Furthermore, fever >39°C was 46% less frequent following vaccination with IIV4 than with control [crude odds ratio: 0.54 (95% confidence intervals: 0.39-0.75)] in children with breakthrough illness. Health outcome analysis showed that, each year, IIV4 would prevent 54 influenza cases per 1000 children and 19 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 new influenza case. Conclusions: In addition to preventing influenza in 50% of participants, IIV4 attenuated illness severity and disease burden in children who had a breakthrough influenza episode despite vaccination.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

METHODS: Fifty three Thai patients with red and white lesions were divided into 3 groups: 17 cases of OLP, 19 cases of OLL and 17 cases of oral lichenoid drug reaction (OLDR), respectively. The medical records, photographs, histopathological evaluation and laboratory ANA and DIF results were analyzed. RESULTS: Atrophic pattern was the most commonly found pattern in the OLDR, OLP and OLL groups. In the OLP group, the DIF interpretation confirmed only 41.2% of cases as OLP, with 23.5% each as lichen planus (LP)/lupus erythematosus (LE) or negative findings. In the OLL group, the most common DIF interpretation (31.6% each) was LP/LE or non-specific finding. In the OLDR group, DIF interpretation was OLP or LP/LE (23.5% each), with 5.9% each of immune complex-mediated disease, compatible with OLP, and mixed connective tissue disease. Interestingly, 1 case in the OLDR group demonstrated mild to moderate dysplasia. There were no significant differences in ANA positivity or patterns between the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: An OLP-like lesion could be diagnosed as OLP, OLP/LE, chronic ulcerative-like lesion, immune-mediated disease or dysplasia.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Even though there has been an extensive investigation of the enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) as a biomarker of susceptibility for CVD, there are few reports studying PON1 in MDs. The aim of this study was to determine the association between PON1 activities as well as functional genotypes and MD diagnosis, clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods: PON1 activities and functional genotypes were assayed in 58 bipolar disorder (BD) and 32 major depressed patients (MDD) and compared with 59 controls. Results: Our findings show significantly lower PON1 total and CMPAase activities in MDs, which are partly related to the number of previous depressive and manic episodes. Lowered CMPAase activity is associated with a worse outcome of MDs as indicated by lowered quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF scale) and increased disability in the Sheeham scale. Conclusions: We hypothesise that lowered PON1 total and CMPAase activities may play a role in the pathophysiology of MDs by lowering antioxidant defences thereby increasing the risk of lipid peroxidation and inflammation; lowered inhibition of quorum-sensing lactones thereby increasing bacterial proliferation; and attenuated homocysteine thiolactone catabolism which may trigger immune-inflammatory response and/or induce neurotoxicity.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Previous research defines and proposes various architecture smells and each one affects software quality in different aspects. Architecture refactoring is a process that removes an architecture smell and improves quality of system without any changes in system behavior. However, removing one of the architecture smells may cause creating of another smell in the system which directly affects software quality. This research proposes a refactoring approach for Too Large Packages smell which is one of the architecture smells by using community detection in extracting process. This process uses for extracting the package which is identified as Too Large Packages smell into small ones and avoids additional impacts from newly appeared dependency-based architecture smells by focusing on Unstable Dependency smell. The proposed approach provides feasible solution to resolve impact from Too Large Packages smell which can be evaluated by comparing number of detected architecture smells and software metrics of before and after refactoring process.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Modification of PPy has been achieved via plasma polymerization of polyethylenimine (PEI) leading to increased number of free amino group (-NH2) on the surface of PPy. Subsequently, urease, selective catalytic enzyme for urea, has been covalently immobilized on the surface of PPy/PEI hybrid film. A combination of various techniques including CV and XPS was performed in order to confirm the existence of PEI and urease on the PPy film. Potentiometric responses of the PPy/PEI hybrid film showed the sensitivity of 56.15 mV/pUrea (r2 > 0.995) over the urea concentration ranging from 5.0×10-1 mM to 10.0 mM (pUrea 2.0-3.3). Detection limits and response linearity was in the normal range of urea level. The response time was approximately 30 seconds. Leaching test revealed that the PPy/PEI hybrid film showed minimal urease leaching out of the film during measurement, indicating that the PPy/PEI hybrid film can be a great alternative urea biosensor. The results of urea determination in standard urea solutions, blood and urine obtained by the PPy/PEI hybrid film correlated well with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

This study aims to validate the Thai version of the 15-item BNT (T-BNT) in participants with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and to externally validate the T-BNT using clinical and biomarker measurements. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited patients with AD, diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (n = 60), aMCI, diagnosed using the Petersen criteria (n = 60), and healthy controls (n = 62). We examined the internal consistency, concurrent and discriminant reliability of the T-BNT. We also assessed the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) and the Word List Memory (WLM) tests and measured apolipoprotein E polymorphism and serum levels of folic acid, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides. Results: This study validated a 10-item T-BNT (10T-BNT), which yielded good internal consistency (0.92), a one-factor unidimensional structure, and adequate concurrent and discriminant validity. Lower scores on the 10T-BNT highly significantly predict AD, but not aMCI, and are positively associated with VFT and WLM test scores. Furthermore, lowered 10T-BNT scores are significantly associated with the ApoE4 allele, lower folate levels and an increased triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio. Conclusions: This study validated the 10T-BNT and the total score on this scale is strongly associated with AD, impairments in semantic and episodic memory and biomarkers, which are known to modify memory via different mechanisms.","Nursing, medical","Psychiatric Mental Health, Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Compounds 10c, 11b, 11d and 11f displayed remarkable antimicrobial activity relating to their standard drugs Gentamycin, Amphotericin B and Ampicillin. Significantly, compound 10c showed broad spectrum activity against tested microbial strains. All the designed compounds were well occupied the binding site of the colchicine and interacted with both α- and β-tubuline interface (PDB ID: 3E22), which demonstrates that synthesized compounds are promising tubulin inhibitors. Also, the synthesized compounds occupied the catalytic triad and adenine-binding site, in the active site of β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III enzyme (PDB ID: 1MZS). The molecular docking results provided the useful information for the future design of more potent inhibitors. These preliminary results convinced further investigation and modifications on synthesized compounds aiming towards the development of potential cytotoxic as well as antimicrobial agents.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Previously only known to cause autosomal dominant myotonia or periodic paralysis, now recessive mutations have been found causing congenital myopathies and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Case presentation: A 27-year-old woman who was born with Arnold-Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, high-arched palate, bilateral hip dysplasia, and severe scoliosis presented for evaluation of episodic muscle stiffness and weakness. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed myopathy and widespread myotonia. Muscle histopathology showed marked fiber size variability, type I fiber predominance with minimal scattered necrosis and regeneration which was typical of a congenital myopathy with an additional finding of a lobulated structural pattern in type I fibers. Sequential individual gene testing revealed a novel de novo heterozygous c.2386 C > G, p.Leu796Val missense mutation in the SCN4A gene. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a dominant, heterozygous mutation in SCN4A causing a complex phenotype of congenital myopathy and myotonia with multiple congenital anomalies and unique muscle pathology findings. This case is another addition to the ever expanding phenotype of SCN4A mutations.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"
Gut Microbiota in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome—A Systematic Review,"Pittayanon R., Lau J.T., Yuan Y., Leontiadis G.I., Tse F., Surette M., Moayyedi P.",2019-07-01,"Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridiales, Enterobacteriaceae, Faecalibacterium, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Lactobacillaceae, Comparison, Infection, Inflammation, Intestine","Background & Aims: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common but difficult to treat. Altering the gut microbiota has been proposed as a strategy for treatment of IBS, but the association between the gut microbiome and IBS symptoms has not been well established. We performed a systematic review to explore evidence for this association. Methods: We searched databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CDSR, and CENTRAL, through April 2, 2018 for case–control studies comparing the fecal or colon microbiomes of adult or pediatric patients with IBS with microbiomes of healthy individuals (controls). The primary outcome was differences in specific gut microbes between patients with IBS and controls. Results: The search identified 2631 citations; 24 studies from 22 articles were included. Most studies evaluated adults presenting with various IBS subtypes. Family Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria), family Lactobacillaceae, and genus Bacteroides were increased in patients with IBS compared with controls, whereas uncultured Clostridiales I, genus Faecalibacterium (including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), and genus Bifidobacterium were decreased in patients with IBS. The diversity of the microbiota was either decreased or not different in IBS patients compared with controls. More than 40% of included studies did not state whether cases and controls were comparable (did not describe sex and/or age characteristics). Conclusions: In a systematic review, we identified specific bacteria associated with microbiomes of patients with IBS vs controls. Studies are needed to determine whether these microbes are a product or cause of IBS.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"
Mechanism study on the pyrolysis of the typical ether linkages in biomass,"Dai G., Zhu Y., Yang J., Pan Y., Wang G., Reubroycharoen P., Wang S.",2019-08-01,"Ether linkages, Heterolytic cleavage, High-energy barriers, Pyrolysis mechanism, Quantum chemical calculations, Rearrangement reactions, SVUV-PIMS, Unimolecular reactions, Biomass, Ether linkages, Pyrolysis mechanism, Quantum chemical calculation, SVUV-PIMS","The in-depth study of the cleavage behaviors of linkages in biomass is important for the better understanding of biomass pyrolysis mechanism. This study aimed to clarify the pyrolysis mechanism of the typical ether linkages in biomass including β-1,4-glycosidic bond, α-O-4 bond and methoxyl using cellobiose, benzylphenyl ether and guaiacol as the model compounds. Combining the detection of the key intermediates, especially radicals by SVUV-PIMS and the evaluation of the reaction pathways by density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations, it was found that the concerted cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bond was more kinetically favorable than homolytic cleavage and heterolytic cleavage, and the ring opening of cellobiose via the breakage of C1′-O was likely to occur before the cleavage of glycosidic bond. The α-O-4 bond in benzylphenyl ether was mainly cleaved by Cα-O homolysis, and it was easy for the formed radicals to recombine with each other to yield phenolic dimers. In the initial evolution process of methoxyl in guaiacol, homolytic demethylation was the most important unimolecular reaction, while demethoxylation and radical-induced rearrangement reactions were difficult to occur due to their high energy barriers. In the presence of the formed methyl radicals from homolytic demethylation reaction, these two reactions would occur since their energy barriers were significantly reduced at this condition.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Therefore, the regular maintenance is required to maintain the good condition due to road safety. The most significant process of bridge inspection procedures is sub structure inspection, which requires visual inspection as an initial step. This process is used to quick determine the damage severity i.e. appearance and crack that may cause damage to the structure strength. The current process requires that the experienced maintenance engineer to be on the field in order to visual inspect and estimate whether the maintenance is required. Yet, due to the limitation of number of expert engineers to be on the field, the photo verification is introduced to assist them so that they are no need on every inspection site. However, using human to verify has no standard and uncontrollable. They need to have experience and good knowledge. As well as it is highly depended on individual decision-making skill. Thus, in this paper, the deep learning technique will be presented to assist the expert for quality inspection process of bridge sub structure images. That is using image enhancement and then image splitting and overlapping for image pre-processing. After that applying CNNs for object classification. As a result, the total accuracy is 89% based on 3926 dataset.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications"

The objectives of this study are to determine the validity of the Thai version of the Scored PG-SGA (Thai PG-SGA) and examine the correlations with selected nutritional parameters. Methods: This observational analytic study included 195 cancer patients aged greater than 18 years at a university-affiliated hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. All patients were assessed for nutritional status by Thai PG-SGA in comparison to subjective global assessment (SGA). Anthropometry, body composition, and hand grip strength were evaluated. Results: According to PG-SGA global assessment categories, 39% (75) of 195 cancer patients were well nourished, 27% (53) were moderately malnourished and 34% (67) of patients were severely malnourished. Thai PG-SGA had a sensitivity of 99.1% and a specificity of 86.0% at predicting SGA classification. PG-SGA numerical scores were significantly different between well-nourished and malnourished groups (4.2 ± 2.4 Vs 16.3 ± 4.9; p < 0.001). The PG-SGA scores, nutritional status assessed by PG-SGA, and nutritional status assessed by SGA were correlated with weight, % weight loss in one month, body mass index, body fat, and hand grip strength (p < 0.001) respectively. Conclusions: Thai PG-SGA showed high sensitivity and good specificity in predicting malnutrition in Thai cancer patients.

Beyond the catalytic domain, this enzyme harbours seven additional C-terminal SH3-like repeats. We herein generated two truncated alternansucrases, possessing deletions of three and seven adjacent SH3 motifs, giving Δ3SHALT and Δ7SHALT. Δ3SHALT and Δ7SHALT exhibited kcat/Km for transglycosylation activity 2.3- and 1.5-fold lower than wild-type ALT (WTALT), while hydrolysis was detected only in the truncated ALTs, oligosaccharide patterns and polymer glycosidic linkage were similar to that of WTALT. The viscosities of ALT polymers increase by ˜100-fold at 15% (w/v), with gel-like states formed at 12.5, 15.0, and 20.0% (w/v) produced by polymer from WTALT, Δ3SHALT, and Δ7SHALT, respectively. The average nanoparticle sizes of Δ3SHALT and Δ7SHALT polymers were 80 nm, compared to 90 nm from WTALT. In conclusion, even relatively subtle differences in the structure of ALT-produced alternan give rise to profound impact on the glucan polymer physicochemical properties.","polymeric Materials Sciencerials, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Instead, the biosynthesis of 1,12-DDA by recombinant (r) microorganisms may offer a viable production route. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) can terminally oxidize fatty acids to ω-hydroxy-fatty acids and further to dicarboxylic acids (ω-oxidation). The wild type (r) CYP52A17 LL and its engineered L261S/L490S form, in which the two leucine residues were changed into serine (rCYP52A17 SS ), were expressed in Pichia pastoris and a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coexpressing the yeast NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase gene. Both organisms produced 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (HDDA) and 1,12-DDA from lauric acid. In vitro, microsomes containing rCYP52A17 SS extracted from the S. cerevisiae strain BY(2R)/pYeDP60-CYP52A17 SS were able to convert lauric acid to 12-HDDA quite efficiently. Biotransformation of lauric acid using S. cerevisiae BY(2R)/pYeDP60-CYP52A17 SS in culture gave the highest level of 12-HDDA (45.8 μM) at 24 h, which was oxidized to yield 20.8 μM of 1,12-DDA at 72 h. The recombinant S. cerevisiae BY(2R)/pYeDP60-CYP52A17 SS , which was initially cultured in YPGE, produced the highest yield of 1,12-DDA from coconut milk wastewater at 24 h. Hence, our designed S. cerevisiae strain BY(2R)/pYeDP60-CYP52A17 SS can potentially produce 1,12-DDA for industrial applications.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Immunology, Materials Science, environmental","Microbiology, Biomaterials, Waste Management and Disposal"

The μPAD was fabricated using a screen printing technique and the barcode-like paper sensor was then used for the detection of Mg(II) ions in RL and water samples. Using different types of paper media (paper towel, Whatman No.1 and Whatman No.4), the results indicate that the key factors in optimizing the quality of the fabricated μPAD include the viscosity of cis-1,4-polyisoprene solution which could be adjusted using different solvents and heating temperatures, the mesh screen size, the pore size of the paper substrates, and the dimension of the sample zone. The fabricated μPAD, which showed high chemical resistance, durability and design flexibility, was tested for the detection of Mg(II) ions using the reaction based on complexometric titration with EDTA where Eriochrome Black T was used as an indicator. An Android application “UBU OMg Sensor” was also developed to provide a simple, fast, and accurate means for end-users to interpret results generated by our developed μPAD.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

By focusing on residential scale of rooftop PVs, BESS has been developed and applied in many aspects especially in terms of electricity charge saving. Many papers propose the methodology to control the operation of BESS, while many papers propose the methodology to determine the battery capacity. As for this paper, the proposed methodology will simultaneously determine the operation schedule and battery capacity of BESS for rooftop PVs under a net-metering scheme (NMS). The main objective is to maximize the net present value (NPV) of the prosumers. The battery capacity will be constrained by the period of the NMS compensation which will be effective for only one year of each electricity bill. The numerical results show that, for the TOU tariff structure without demand charge, an appropriate BESS should have CNOM, DC as high as possible to increase the revenue from BESS and have PNOM, DC as low as possible to reduce the total investment cost (TTC). Also, by considering the limit period of the NMS compensation, an appropriate battery capacity should not be higher than monthly residential load consumption. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis of electricity tariff shows that the NPV will increase proportionally by the increment of electricity price, which will reduce the break-even year of the investment.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Therefore, SO2 and CO2 should be captured before being released into the atmosphere. However, the competitiveness between SO2 and CO2 for calcium carbonate (CaCO3)/calcium oxide (CaO) solid sorbents is still unclear. In this study, unsteady state computational fluid dynamics simulation in a riser of an industrial scale circulating fluidized bed boiler integrated with heterogeneous combustion, carbonation, calcination, and desulfurization reactions using a mixed feeding of CaCO3/CaO solid sorbents was developed in a two-dimensional model to investigate the competition between SO2 and CO2 capture. Then, the effect of three operating variables, the mixed solid CaCO3/CaO sorbent particle size, feed position, and the proportion of inlet fuel velocity on the SO2 and CO2 capture were evaluated using a 23 factorial experimental design. The CaCO3/CaO solid sorbent particle size had a significant effect on the SO2 capture, while the interaction between CaCO3/CaO solid sorbent particle size and feed position had a significant effect on the CO2 capture. The reaction rate for CO2 capture was higher than that for SO2 capture. For SO2 capture, CaO reacted with SO2 faster than CaCO3 while, for CO2 capture, solid sorbents had higher carbonation rate than calcination rate. In addition, the overall level of SO2 and CO2 capture with a mixed CaCO3/CaO solid sorbent feed was higher than those with the conventional CaO solid sorbent.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, process equipment, geobase; related topics, engineering, energy, environmental","Building and Construction, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

In this problem, the control input must be bounded in some specified range in order to prevent the system reaching into undesired properties, such as bifurcation. To cope with this practical issue, we propose in this paper a novel condition for static output feedback design for nonlinear polynomial or rational systems with constraints on input magnitudes. The proposed design condition is bilinear in the decision variables, and hence we provide an iterative algorithm to solve the design problem. At each iteration, the design condition can be cast as standard convex optimization using the sum-of-squares technique and thus can be efficiently solved via the existing software tools. In addition, the novel parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions allow extension to robust static output-feedback design of systems subject to parametric uncertainty. Validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated by numerical simulations.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Control and Systems Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

We aimed to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between PHIV children who initiated ART within 12 months of life and perinatally HIV-exposed uninfected (PHEU) children and to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes by timing of ART. Methods: This prospective cohort study included Thai children aged 12 to 56 months who were assessed with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at enrolment and at 48 weeks. Global Developmental Impairment (GDI) was defined as Early Learning Composite (ELC) ≤ 70 on the MSEL; typical developmental pattern was defined as ELC > 70 at both visits. Logistic regression was used to compare prevalence of any GDI. Predictors of changing ELC scores were analysed with generalized estimating equations linear regression model. Results: From 2016 to 2017, 50 PHIV (twenty-seven early ART within three months and twenty-three standard ART within three to twelve months) and 100 PHEU children were enrolled. Median (IQR) age at first assessment was 28 (19 to 41) months. PHIV children had lower age-relevant Z scores for weight, height and head circumference compared to the PHEU group (p < 0.05). The prevalence of overall GDI was 18% (95% CI 11 to 27) and 32% (95% CI 20 to 47) in PHEU and PHIV children respectively (p = 0.06). In subgroup analysis, 22% (95% CI 9 to 42) of early ART PHIV children and 44% (95% CI 23 to 66) of standard ART PHIV children had overall GDI. There was a higher rate of GDI in standard ART PHIV children (p = 0.01), but not in the early ART group (p = 0.62) when compared with PHEU children. The standard ART PHIV group demonstrated lower typical developmental pattern than both the early ART PHIV group and the PHEU group (57% vs. 77% vs. 82% respectively). Non-attendance at nursery school was associated with changes in ELC score during study participation (adjusted coefficient −3.8; 95% CI −6.1 to −1.6, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Preschool children with HIV who initiated ART in the first three months of life had a similar rate of GDI as PHEU children. Lack of nursery school attendance predicted poor developmental trajectory outcomes among PHIV children.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Some deployed traditional machine learning approaches: ARIMA, k-NN, etc. Recently, deep learning approach has shown promising results in this task. However, the accuracy is still limited since the raining period throughout the year in Thailand is very scarce, so most rainfall amount is zero. In this paper, we propose to cascade two deep learning networks to tackle this problem: one is a classification model to classify whether it rains or not, and the other is a regression model to predict rainfall amount. Our network is a combination of CNN and GRU, where CNN aims to capture relationship between various sensors and GRU aims to capture time-series information. Furthermore, we also perform multi-step forecasting by applying a rolling mechanism that uses the predicted rainfall and involved features to predict the next 6 steps. The experiment was conducted on hourly rainfall dataset for 6 years (2013-2018) provided from the public government sector in Thailand. We use RMSE as performance metric to evaluate three periods of rainfall: Overall, Rain, and non-rain periods and the results show that our cascading model is the winner with only 4.53% in term of RMSE which is the average percentage of difference from over all regions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, decision sciences, energy","Information Systems, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Information Systems and Management, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The hydrogenation (HDO) of oleic acid and palmitic acid as model compounds of palm oil over unsupported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo sulfide catalysts was performed in a Parr reactor to produce BHD. The effects of reaction parameters: temperature, hydrogen pressure and the atomic ratio of catalysts (Ni/(Ni + Mo) or Co/(Co + Mo)) on the conversion and product yields (mainly n-C15, n-C16, n-C17 and n-C18 hydrocarbons) were evaluated. The results show that the high pressure favored HDO pathway, while high temperature strongly affected the decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. At optimal conditions for oleic acid HDO, the efficient catalyst was NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) which gave high oleic acid conversion (100%), n-C18 selectivity (78.8%) and n-C18 yield (70.3%) whereas, for palmitic acid HDO, NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) also gave high palmitic acid conversion (95.2%), n-C16 selectivity (78.5%) and n-C16 yield (65.6%).","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The addition of THF to the polymer casting solutions produced TFC membranes with higher retention but lower permeance. The lowest structural parameter (~383 µm) was found for the TFC membrane with a 10% sPEEK – 10% THF support and led to water fluxes of 23 LMH in PRO mode and 11 LMH in FO mode using a DI water feed solution and a 0.5 M NaCl draw solution. A minimal membrane bottom surface porosity was necessary to accomplish satisfying water fluxes in FO. The SIM method resulted in TFC membranes with comparable selectivity but significantly higher permeance and smoother polyamide selective layers.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

The SWCC can be measured from laboratory or estimated from some empirical equations. Measured SWCCs are usually conducted for drying curve by using Tempe cell or pressure plate device. Because of the time consuming associate the absorption, the wetting SWCC can be approximated by estimating the magnitude of the hysteresis loop at the inflection point on the drying SWCC. The SWCC is commonly plotted as a curve between (gravimetric or volumetric) water content and and the logarithm of soil suction. The general shape of the SWCC looks similar to the S-shaped function. An accurate mathematical modelling of the S-shaped curve is usually required for engineering computation such as numerical analyses. In this paper, a new method to quantifying the SWCC, i.e., via the S-shaped equation proposed by Liu et al. (2013), is employed to represent the SWCC. Comparisons between the equation simulations and experimental data are made. Discussions on the equation simulations and characteristics of the mechanical properties of unsaturated soils are also presented.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Computational Mechanics, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Environmental Engineering"

This study investigated the reduction of AgNPs and dissociated silver ion (Agþ) toxicity on nitrifying sludge using cell entrapment technique. Three entrapment materials, including barium alginate (BA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and barium alginate (PVA-BA), were applied. The BA beads provided the highest reduction of silver toxicity (up to 90%) and durability. Live/dead assays showed fatality of entrapped cells after exposure to AgNPs and Agþ. The maximum AO rate of the BA-entrapped cells was 5.6 mg-N/g-MLSS/h. The AO kinetics under the presence of silver followed an uncompetitive inhibition kinetic model. The experiments with AgNPs and Agþ gave the apparent maximum AO rates of 4.2 and 4.8 mg-N/g-MLSS/h, respectively. The apparent half-saturation constants of the BA-entrapped cells under the presence of silver were 10.5 to 13.4 mg/L. Scanning electron microscopic observation coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated no silver inside the beads. This elucidates that the silver toxicity can be reduced by preventing silver penetration through the porous material, leading to less microbial cell damage. This study revealed the potential of the entrapment technology for mitigating the effect of silver species on nitrification.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; chemistryical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

Here, the mechanisms of prominent endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in FcGRIIb−/− mice were explored on bone marrow-derived macrophages using phosphoproteomic analysis. As such, LPS tolerance decreased several phosphoproteins in the FcGRIIb−/− macrophage, including protein kinase C-β type II (PRKCB), which was associated with phagocytosis function. Overexpression of PRKCB attenuated LPS tolerance in RAW264.7 cells, supporting the role of this gene in LPS tolerance. In parallel, LPS tolerance in macrophages and in mice was attenuated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) administration. This treatment induced several protein kinase C families, including PRKCB. However, PMA attenuated the severity of mice with cecal ligation and puncture on LPS tolerance preconditioning in FcGRIIb−/− but not in wild-type cells. The significant reduction of PRKCB in the FcGRIIb−/− macrophage over wild-type cell possibly induced the more severe LPS-exhaustion and increased the infection susceptibility in FcGRIIb−/− mice. PMA induced PRKCB, improved LPS-tolerance, and attenuated sepsis severity, predominantly in FcGRIIb−/− mice. PRKCB enhancement might be a promising strategy to improve macrophage functions in lupus patients with LPS-tolerance from chronic infection.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The semi-continuous mode of the reactor is employed to screen out the effect of operating parameters by ANOVA analysis. Superficial gas velocity is the crucial operating parameter, which provides a significant positive trend on CO 2 sorption capacity. Due to the interaction between operating parameters, the solid recirculating rate must be optimized to achieve high sorption capacity. The inclination of downer bottom should be greater than the angle of repose of the sorbent particle.

Quantitative calibration models to detect AFB1 were developed using the original and pretreated absorbance spectra in conjunction with partial least squares regression with prediction testing and full cross-validation. The statistical model from the external validation process developed from the treated spectra (standard normal variate and detrending) was most accurate for prediction, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.952, a standard error of prediction of 3.362 µg/kg, and a bias of-0.778 µg/kg.

However, results have been inconsistent across studies. Thus, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies measuring immune mediators in participants with OCD compared to healthy controls (HC) was conducted. The PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE electronic databases were systematically searched from inception through June 21, 2018. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria comprising data from 1001 participants (538 with OCD and 463 were HCs). Levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, and interferon-γ did not significantly differ between participants with OCD and healthy controls. In addition, the ex vivo production of TNF-α and IL-6 by isolated macrophages did not significantly differ between participants with OCD and HCs. Nevertheless, included studies have varied in methodological quality with the enrollment of samples that differed regarding medication status, the proper matching of OCD participants and HCs, age groups, and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities. In conclusion, an association between immune dysregulation and OCD remains unproven. Future studies should consider enrolling larger and more homogeneous samples with OCD.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Interobserver and intraobserver variation in the morphological evaluation of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features in Asian practice,"Liu Z., Bychkov A., Jung C.K., Hirokawa M., Sui S., Hong S., Lai C.-R., Jain D., Canberk S., Kakudo K.",2019-04-01,"Adenocarcinoma, Follicular, Amino Acid Substitution, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Biopsy, Fine-Needle, Cell Nucleus, Humans, Lymphatic Metastasis, Mutation, Observer Variation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf, Thyroid Cancer, Papillary, Thyroid Gland, Thyroid Neoplasms, digital pathology, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features, nuclear scoring system, observer variation, tumors of uncertain malignant potential","To evaluate the current diagnostic criteria in reporting nuclear features of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), nine Asian pathologists with expertise in thyroid reviewed virtual slides of 30 noninvasive follicular patterned thyroid lesions according to the nuclear scoring system originally proposed by an international expert and a more detailed scoring system proposed by the Asian Working Group. The interobserver agreement for nuclear grading score was generally moderate (kappa value = 0.452). The best consistency fell on the chromatin features (kappa value = 0.658–1.000). A fair to moderate interobserver agreement was demonstrated in the evaluation of nuclear elongation, nuclear overlapping, membrane irregularities and distribution of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) type nuclear features. A slight agreement was rendered for the evaluation of the nuclear enlargement. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to perfect when comparing results of both scoring systems. However, both scoring systems were not able to reliably separate NIFTP from an encapsulated follicular variant PTC with minimal lymph node metastasis or BRAF V600E mutation. Although the three-point nuclear scoring system for the diagnosis of NIFTP is widely used in Asian practice, interobserver variation was considerable.

Methods: We searched our radiologic database retrospectively from 2001 to 2017 for periurethral cystic lesions, identifying a total of 50 patients with 68 lesions. Final diagnoses in 68 lesions were bulking agents (27), urethral diverticula (29), and periurethral cysts (12). Two abdominal radiologists, blinded to clinical history, independently evaluated T1, T2, and post-contrast images. The readers assessed number, morphological features, location, connection to urethra and mass effect, signal intensity, and enhancement for each lesion. Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were performed for each univariate significant feature. The operative and pathologic reports were the reference standard. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging features found more often in bulking agents versus urethral diverticulum were multiple lesions (P = 0.011), upper or upper-mid-urethral location (P ≤ 0.0001), lack of internal fluid/fluid level (P = 0.002), no urethral connection (P = 0.005), T1 isointensity, and T2 mild hyperintensity compared to muscles but lower T2 signal than urine (P < 0.0001). Most cases of urethral diverticula and periurethral cysts were detected at mid- and lower urethra. Urethral diverticula were larger than bulking agents and periurethral cysts (P = 0.005 and P = 0.023) (mean diameter = 24, 16, 15 mm, respectively). Most bulking agents (93%) and urethral diverticula (90%) showed mass effect on urethra, while periurethral cysts (75%) did not (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Signal intensity and lesion characterization on magnetic resonance imaging can significantly differentiate bulking agent from urethral diverticulum and periurethral cyst. Radiologists should consider differential diagnosis of a bulking agent, especially when distinguishing characteristics described here are present to prevent incorrect diagnosis and ultimately unnecessary surgical intervention.","Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Gastroenterology, Urology"

The oxidized carbon nanosphere (OCN), a negatively charged carbon nanoparticle, has the potential to fulfill this requirement because it can efficiently deliver macromolecules into cells and allows endosomal leakage. However, fundamental insights into how OCNs are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, and the intracellular behavior of delivered molecules is lacking. Furthermore, how immune responses are stimulated by OCN-mediated delivery has not been investigated. Purpose: In this study, the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) was used to investigate the uptake mechanism and intracellular fate of OCN-mediated delivery of protein in macrophages. Moreover, the immune response triggered by OVA delivered by OCNs was characterized. Methods: Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice were used to study antigen uptake and intracellular trafficking. Mice were immunized using OCN–OVA combined with known adjuvants, and the specific immune response was measured. Results: OCNs showed no cytotoxicity against BMDMs. OCN-mediated delivery of OVA into BMDMs was partially temperature independent process. Using specific inhibitors, it was revealed that intracellular delivery of OCN–OVA does not rely on phagocytosis or the clathrin-and lipid raft/caveolae-mediated pathways. Delivered OVA was found to colocalize with compartments containing MHC class I, but not with early endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes. Immunization of OVA using OCNs in combination with the known adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A specifically enhanced interferon gamma (IFNγ)-and granzyme B-producing cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Conclusion: OCNs effectively delivered protein antigens into macrophages that localized with compartments containing MHC class I partially by the temperature independent, but not clathrin-and lipid raft/caveolae-mediated pathways. Increased CD8+ T-cell activity was induced by OCN-delivered antigens, suggesting antigen processing toward antigen presentation for CTLs. Taken together, OCNs are a potential protein antigen delivery system that stimulates the cell-mediated immune response.","biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, pharmacology, chemistry","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

Upstream areas are especially crucial for aquatic ecosystems since the mid- and downstream areas are continuously being utilized for agricultural and community purposes. Many parts of the basin have been at moderate risk of drought. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is an effective and widely accepted model used to identify complicated environmental problems and disasters and prioritize factors in environmental studies. This study emphasized on four main factors influencing drought: Climate, physical factors, soil and land utilization factors. Each factor contains ten sub-criteria to identify severity levels and specific issues. The major areas of the basin were facing different risk levels: moderate (21%), high (5.79%) and severe (0.07%). Precipitation and slope gradient were the main factors affecting drought risks. The problematic areas were agricultural areas located in midstream and downstream areas. Therefore, spatial mitigations and possible ways forward should focus on increasing moisture contents-to reduce soil erosion and enhance soil fertility-and create restrictions to ensure appropriate land use. The mitigations must take into account spatially critical factors and must also include an integrated plan for the entire basin area.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"
Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) attenuates polymicrobial sepsis with lps preconditioning (LPS tolerance) in FcGRIIB deficient lupus mice,"Ondee T., Gillen J., Visitchanakun P., Somparn P., Issara-Amphorn J., Phi C.D., Chancharoenthana W., Gurusamy D., Nita-Lazar A., Leelahavanichkul A.",2019-09-01,"Animals, Cytokines, Disease Models, Animal, Endotoxemia, Immune Tolerance, Lipocalin-2, Lipopolysaccharides, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Macrophages, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, RAW 264.7 Cells, Receptors, IgG, Recombinant Proteins, Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient macrophages, Lipocalin 2, Lupus, Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)","In patients with active lupus, spontaneous endotoxemia and possibly tolerance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potentially adverse complication. Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that FcGRIIb deficient mice (FcGRIIb-/-; a lupus mouse model) are susceptible to LPS tolerance-induced decreased cytokine responses that inadequate for the organismal control. Thus, understanding the relationship between FcGRIIb and LPS tolerance could improve the therapeutic strategy for lupus. LPS tolerance can be induced through sequential LPS stimulations in either cells or a model organism. In RAW264.7 (a mouse macrophage cell-line), sequential LPS stimulation induced the secretion of Lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) despite reduced cytokine secretion and severe energy depletion, as measured by the extracellular flux analysis, typical of LPS tolerance. In contrast, treatment with recombinant Lcn-2 (rLcn-2) attenuated LPS tolerance, as shown by an increase in secreted cytokines and altered macrophage polarization toward M1 (increased iNOS and TNF-α) in RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest a role of Lcn-2 in LPS tolerance attenuation. In bone marrow derived macrophages, Lcn-2 level was similar in LPS tolerant FcGRIIb-/-and wild-type (WT) cells despite the increased LPS tolerance of FcGRIIb-/-cells, suggesting relatively low basal levels of Lcn-2 produced in FcGRIIb-/-cells. In addition, attenuation of LPS tolerance effectuated by granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reduced Lcn-2 in both cell types, implying an inverse correlation between Lcn-2 and the severity of LPS tolerance. Consequently, rLcn-2 improved LPS tolerance only in FcGRIIb-/-macrophages and attenuated disease severity of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis pre-conditioning with sequential LPS injection (LPS-CLP model) only in FcGRIIb-/-mice, but not in WT mice. To summarize, inadequate Lcn-2 production in FcGRIIb-/-macrophage might, at least in part, be responsible for the inordinate LPS tolerance compared with WT cells. Additionally, supplementation of rLcn-2 attenuates LPS tolerance in FcGRIIb-/-macrophages in vitro, and in FcGRIIb-/-mice with LPS-CLP sepsis in vivo. In conclusion, Lcn-2 secreted by macrophages is possibly an autocrine signal to counter the reduced cytokine secretion in LPS tolerance.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

The results show that a coating of iron oxide particles is consistently distributed on the surface of powdered activated carbon (PAC), resulting in a decrease in the specific surface area and in the pH at the point of zero charge, even though the particle sizes of Mag-PAC and PAC were similar. A Mag-PAC dosage of 4 g/L exhibited efficient and fast DOM adsorption with a relatively short contact time of 5 min. The iron oxide coating on the surface of PAC may play an important role in the DOM removal efficiency. Temkin isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic models well described the DOM adsorption, suggesting that the adsorption of DOM onto Mag-PAC could be mainly governed by a chemisorption mechanism. Humic acid- and fulvic acid-like compounds and aromatic DOM with molecular weights (MWs) between 2610 Da and 3030 Da were efficiently removed by Mag-PAC, whereas aromatic DOM with an MW of 1760 Da was poorly removed. Our results demonstrate that the application of Mag-PAC for DOM adsorption is attractive and yields benefits as a posttreatment system for MBR effluent due to its efficient and fast DOM adsorption.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Ideally, the comparator has almost zero input offset current when all inverters are assumed to be identical. In practice, small amount of threshold voltage or current mismatches may cause the offset current to increase dramatically. A switched-capacitor inverter is added to the comparator circuit in order to mitigate such effect. During compensation phase, the switched inverter forms a feedback loop to generate a current that will compensate the input offset current. During comparison phase, the generated charge hold in the capacitor decreases the offset current significantly. To keep the loop stable, an R-C Miller's frequency compensator is also added. A prototype of the whole circuit using 0.18μm process is designed and analyzed to prove this concept. It operates at 1V DC supply with 870nA consumption, 1nA resolution and 50ns delay for ±100nA step input. Its input offset current is 13pA when there is no mismatch. When the mismatch is accounted, it increases to 164nA. After installation of the compensation circuit, the offset current is cut down to 19pA.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"

Here, we generated iPSC lines from two BSS patients with mutations in different genes (GP1BA and GP1BB: Termed BSS-A and BSS-B, respectively). The iPSC-derived MKs and platelets were examined under electron microscopy and stained by immunofluorescence to observe proplatelet formation and measure platelet diameters which were defined by circumferential tubulin. BSS-iPSCs produced abnormal proplatelets with thick shafts and tips. In addition, compared with the normal iPSCs, the diameters were larger in platelets derived from BSS-A and BSS-B with the means ± standard deviations of 4.34 ± 0.043 and 3.88 ± 0.045 μm, respectively (wild-type iPSCs 2.61 ± 0.025 μm, p < 0.001). Electron microscopy revealed giant platelets with the abnormal demarcation membrane system. Correction of BSS-A and BSS-B-iPSCs using lentiviral vectors containing respective GP1BA and GP1BB genes improved proplatelet structures and platelet ultrastructures as well as reduced platelets sizes. In conclusion, the iPSC model can be used to explore molecular mechanisms and potential therapy for BSS.",medical,Hematology

Methods: This study comprised 3282 participants aged 30-82 years. BMD was assessed at 3 skeletal sites using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Each participant's BMD status was classified as normal, osteopenia or osteoporosis. Periodontal assessments were the number of remaining teeth, plaque score, probing depth and clinical attachment level (CAL). The participants were classified into no/mild or moderate/severe periodontitis groups. The mean periodontal variables between BMD categories were compared. The association between the BMD status and moderate/severe periodontitis was analyzed using binary logistic regression. Results: Among the BMD categories, the greatest mean CAL and the lowest mean number of remaining teeth were found in the osteoporosis group. The mean CAL difference between the osteoporosis and normal BMD groups was 0.3 mm. In 337 participants with a plaque score of less than 40%, there was a significant association between osteoporosis and moderate/severe periodontitis. Conclusion: Skeletal BMD in the osteoporosis range was associated with moderate/severe periodontitis in individuals with fair oral hygiene, suggesting the benefit of special attention to the skeletal bone health of these individuals.","otorhinolaryngology, dentistry",Dentistry (all)

The fabrication of graphene-polypyrrole composite for application with dye-sensitized solar cells,"Loryuenyong V., Khadthiphong A., Phinkratok J., Watwittayakul J., Supawattanakul W., Buasri A.",2019-01-01,"% reductions, Composites material, Counter electrodes, Dye- sensitized solar cells, Graphene oxides, Mono-dispersed, Oxide reduction, Polymerization method, Polypyrrole composites, Reduced graphene oxides, Counter electrode, Dye-sensitized solar cells, Polypyrrole, Reduced graphene oxide","This research is to study the preparation of graphene-monodispersed polypyrrole composite materials for uses as a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The preparation started with the synthesis of graphene oxide (GO), followed by the preparation of composite films by polymerization method and the GO reduction process by ascorbic acid. The characterizations included thermal-gravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission electron microscopy (FESEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The DSSCs' efficiency tests were also conducted and analyzed. Based on the test results, it was found that DSSCs prepared from PPy/RGO-5 composite films with 5% by weight of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) could give an optimal efficiency. Nevertheless, the efficiency of such solar cells was much less than that of DSSCs with platinum counter electrode. This could be due to incomplete reduction of graphene oxide, resulting low electron transfer ability and electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of electrolyte solution.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicits immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity. Results: In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on both MHC binding affinity and MHC ligand peptidome datasets but also exhibits promising generalization to unseen MHC class I alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino acids as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length. Conclusions: The improved performance and the flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, computer science, Mathematics","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics"

Among the flaviviral proteins, the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the largest, most conserved, and major enzymatic component of the viral replication complex. Disruption of the common key NS5-host protein-protein interactions critical for viral replication could aid in the development of broad-spectrum antiflaviviral therapeutics. Hundreds of NS5 interactors have been identified, but these are mostly DENV-NS5 interactors. To this end, we sought to investigate the JEV- and ZIKV-NS5 interactomes using EGFP immunoprecipitation with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. We report here a total of 137 NS5 interactors with a significant enrichment of spliceosomal and spliceosomal-associated proteins. The transcription complex Paf1C and phosphatase 6 were identified as common NS5-associated complexes. PAF1 was shown to play opposite roles in JEV and ZIKV infections. Additionally, we validated several NS5 targets and proposed their possible roles in infection. These include lipid-shuttling proteins OSBPL9 and OSBPL11, component of RNAP3 transcription factor TFIIIC, minichromosome maintenance, and cochaperone PAQosome. Mining this data set, our study expands the current interaction landscape of NS5 and uncovers several NS5 targets that are new to flavivirus biology.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biochemistry, Chemistry (all)"

In this study, BC pellicles were simply deconstructed into fibrils suspension and then reconstructed into films with a supplement of alginate, gelatin and glycerol. The physical appearance of fabricated films resembled native BC but possessed improved ductility, enhanced flexibility, higher water uptake ability and better biocompatibility. The film was found to resist tearing under suture pullout strength in a hydrated state. In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed that the film was cytocompatible. A cell study using a human keratinocyte culture demonstrated enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation on the BCAGG film compared with BC/alginate film.

The aim of this review was to gather a body of evidence for the concept of a window of therapeutic opportunity, defined as a time interval following initial-onset disease during which adequate treatment will substantially modify the disease outcome and possibly even lead to cure, similar to what has been described for rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: We reviewed the literature and consulted leading experts in VKH disease to determine the consensus for the notion of a therapeutic window of opportunity in VKH disease. Results: We found a substantial body of evidence in the literature that a therapeutic window of opportunity exists for initial-onset acute uveitis associated with VKH disease. The disease outcome can be substantially improved if dual systemic steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppressants are given within 2–3 weeks of the onset of initial VKH disease, avoiding evolution to chronic disease and development of “sunset glow fundus.” Several studies additionally report series in which the disease could be cured, using such an approach. Conclusions: There is substantial evidence for a therapeutic window of opportunity in initial-onset acute VKH disease. Timely and adequate treatment led to substantial improvement of disease outcome and prevented chronic evolution and “sunset glow fundus,” and very early treatment led to the cure after discontinuation of therapy in several series, likely due to the fact that the choroid is the sole origin of inflammation in VKH disease.",medical,Ophthalmology

However, the function of DDX41 remains poorly understood in invertebrates. In a previous study, we identified the first DDX41 sensor in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (PmDDX41) and showed that it played a role in anti-viral response. In the present study, we demonstrated that PmDDX41 was localized in the cytoplasm of shrimp hemocytes. However, PmDDX41 was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of hemocytes in the presence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection or when stimulated by the nucleic acid mimics, poly(dA:dT) and poly(I:C). Similar results were observed when PmDDX41 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Immunoprecipitation further demonstrated that PmDDX41 bound to biotin-labeled poly(dA:dT) but not poly(I:C). The overexpression of shrimp PmDDX41 and mouse stimulator of interferon gene (MmSTING) in HEK293T cells synergistically promoted IFN-β and NF-κB promoter activity via the DEADc domain. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) also confirmed that there was an interaction between PmDDX41 and STING after stimulation with poly(dA:dT) but not poly(I:C). Our study is the first to demonstrate that PmDDX41 acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor that interacts with STING via its DEADc domain to trigger the IFN-β and NF-κB signaling pathways, thus activating antiviral innate immune responses.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Titanium dioxide nanotubes of defined diameter enhance mesenchymal stem cell proliferation via JNK- and ERK-dependent up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor-2 by T lymphocytes,"Singhatanadgit W., Toso M., Pratheepsawangwong B., Pimpin A., Srituravanich W.",2019-02-01,"Fibroblast growth factor-2, Human mesenchymal stem cells, Inflammatory response, inflammatory-associated mediators, Osteogenesis, proliferation, Titanium dioxide nanotubes, Titanium implants, Biocompatible Materials, Cell Line, Cell Proliferation, Cells, Cultured, Fibroblast Growth Factor 2, Humans, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Nanotubes, T-Lymphocytes, Titanium, Up-Regulation, inflammatory-associated mediators, osteogenesis-associated mediators, proliferation, stem cells, T lymphocyte, Titanium dioxide nanotubes","Long-term clinical success of a titanium implant not only depends upon osseointegration between implant and bone surface but also on the response of host immune cells. Following implantation of biomaterials, an inflammatory response, including T lymphocyte response, is ostensibly initiated by implant-cell interaction. However, little is known about the responses of T lymphocytes to titanium dioxide nanotubes. The present study aimed to explore the effect of titanium dioxide nanotubes on T lymphocytes in vitro and its biological consequences. The results of the present study showed that titanium dioxide nanotubes with diameter of 30–105 nm were non-cytotoxic to T lymphocytes, and the 105 nm titanium dioxide nanotube surface specifically possessed an ability to activate T lymphocytes, thus increasing DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In addition, the 105 nm titanium dioxide nanotubes significantly activated the expression of FGF-2 gene and protein in T lymphocytes although smaller nanotubes (i.e. those with diameters of approximately 30 and 70 nm) had little effect on this. The present study investigated the mechanism by which 105 nm nanotubes stimulated FGF-2 expression in T lymphocytes by blocking key MAPK pathways. The inhibitors of JNK1/2/3 and ERK1/2 significantly inhibited 105 nm titanium dioxide nanotubes-induced FGF-2 expression. Corresponding to the increased expression of FGF-2, only the supernatant from T lymphocytes cultured on 105 nm nanotubes stimulated human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. FGF-2 blocking antibody partially reversed the increased proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells, supporting the role of T lymphocyte-derived FGF-2 in enhanced human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. This suggests a significant role of T lymphocyte-titanium dioxide nanotube interaction in the proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells, which is pivotal to the formation of new bone following implant placement.","Materials Science, engineering","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

The compositions of the starting solutions were so simple, Ti(OC3H7 i)4:H2O:solvent = 1:(0.5 or 1.0):25 in mole ratios, that they contained no chelating or peptizing agents. In spite of the absence of chelating or peptizing agents, transparent sols were obtained except for the THF solution of H2O/Ti(OC3H7 i)4 = 1.0. All the transparent sols showed high stability in viscosity at least over 1 month. Titania thin films were prepared from the sols by spin- or dip-coating on Si(100) substrates via heat treatment at 700 or 900 °C. The stability of such additive-free sols was examined by comparing the thickness, refractive index, crystalline phase, crystallite size, and microstructure between films that were prepared from sols aged for 1, 5, and 30 days at room temperature. The thickness, refractive index, and crystallite size did not change noticeably with sol aging time. The films prepared from the THF-containing sols were anatase irrespective of the sol-aging time and heat treatment temperature. On the other hand, rutile phase was also observed when the films were prepared from 30-day-aged, 1-butanol-, or 2-butanol-containing sols, followed by firing at 900 °C. The films from the 2-butanol-containing sols also exhibited a change in microstructure at such a long sol aging time. These suggest that the 1-butanol- or 2-butanol-containing sols are unstable during aging while the THF-containing sol is stable as coating solution.

Pipecolinic acid was one of the most important metabolites; its level was decreased in the rotenone group as compared with the control. Supplementation with ECa233 before administration of rotenone raised pipecolinic acid to levels intermediate between controls and rotenone alone.

Although beneficial in obese patients, conventional laparoscopic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer is technically challenging, with a higher conversion rate to open compared with nonobese patients. We describe novel strategies to circumvent these difficulties. TECHNIQUE: The key steps are 1) lateral-to-medial colonic mobilization and left-sided mesorectal excision with the surgeon on the patient's right; 2) switching to the patient's left for right-sided mesorectal excision; 3) further rectal retraction with cotton tape and preperitoneal fat sling; and 4) caudal-to-cephalad mobilization of colon after distal transection, which facilitates extrapelvic mesenteric dissection and vessel ligation. RESULTS: These techniques optimize gravity to negate the lack of exposure due to visceral obesity. Triangulation is improved by changing the surgeon's position during mesorectal dissection. This allows accurate identification of anatomical planes and avoids excessive pneumoperitoneum pressures and Trendelenburg tilt. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting these strategies can facilitate laparoscopic mesorectal excision in the obese patient and may reduce conversion to open.","genergyal, medical",Gastroenterology

The conductivity increases with temperature and the values of activation energy of conduction are 64.69, 100.80, 103.78 and 108.12 kJ mol−1 for BSCY, BC, BSC, and BCZ, respectively. It is found that although BCZ exhibits relatively low conductivity, the material provides the highest CO yield at 550–800 °C, followed by BSCY, BSC, and BC, correlating to the crystallite size and BET surface area of the samples. Catalytic activity toward RWGS of composited Cu and electrolytes is also measured. Additional Cu (60 wt%) significantly increases catalytic activity. The CO yield increases from 3.01% (BCZ) to 43.60% (Cu/BCZ) at 600 °C and CO can be produced at temperature below 400 °C. There is no impurity phase detected in BCZ sample after exposure to CO2-containing gas mixture (600 °C for 5 h) while CeO2 phase is detected in BSC and BSCY and both CeO2 and BaO are observed in BC sample.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for fatal infection in children with lupus nephritis in under-resourced areas. Methods: Medical records of patients, who were admitted to a tertiary-care university-based hospital from January 2002 to July 2018 with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, were reviewed. Only patients aged less than 18 years with lupus nephritis and documented infection were included in the study. The primary outcome was infection-associated mortality. The logistic regression model was used to identify independent variables associated with fatal infection. Predicted probabilities of infection-related mortality adjusted for factors significant in multivariate analysis were calculated using marginal effects at representative values. Results: Infection-related deaths occurred in 27 of 179 patients (15.1%). Hospital-acquired infections occurred in 72 of 375 episodes of hospital admissions (19.2%) and 13 hospital-acquired infections (18.1%) resulted in fatal infection. Invasive fungal infections were the leading cause of death (44.4%) and pulmonary infections were the predominant site (55.5%). Haemoglobin levels and glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower in deceased versus surviving patients. Percentages of patients with hospital-acquired infections, invasive fungal infections and pulmonary infections were significantly higher in deceased than surviving patients. Urine protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, cumulative methylprednisolone dose and daily prednisolone dose were significantly higher in deceased than surviving patients. In multivariate analysis, a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio more than 20, invasive fungal infections and high daily prednisolone dose were independently predictive of fatal infection with adjusted odds ratio of 3.02 (95% confidence interval 1.02–8.97, p = 0.04), 15.08 (95% confidence interval 4.72–48.24, p < 0.001) and 1.03 (95% confidence interval 1.01–1.06, p = 0.04), respectively. A high daily prednisolone dose intensified the impact of invasive fungal infections and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on predicted probability of infection-associated mortality. Conclusions: Prevention of invasive fungal infections and minimization of daily prednisolone should be emphasized in routine clinical practice of children with lupus nephritis in under-resourced areas to achieve better survival. Children with lupus nephritis and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio should be under cautious surveillance for infection.",medical,Rheumatology

The ANCO consists of an insulated anaerobic filter (IAF) and condenser that are connected to an existing refrigerant of air conditioner. The system applied waste heat energy from an air conditioner to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. While the performance of air conditioner also could be enhanced by decreasing refrigerant temperature from transferring waste heat through the IAF system for increasing wastewater temperature. The waste heat from air conditioner could stimulate higher microbial activity in the IAF and at the same time, this could increase air conditioner performance. From the overall results, it was found that with wastewater flow rate 180 liter/day, the ANCO prototype could recycle waste heat approximately 2.82 kWh/day. The waste heat transferred into wastewater could increase water temperature up to averagely 35.4 °C. The system performance for removal of suspended solids (SS) and COD were averagely 49.9% and 49.3%, respectively. The coefficient of performance (COPOverall) of air conditioner was increased by 30.25% and electric consumption was decreased by 22.96%. The ANCO system could save electrical energy averagely 2.62 kWh/day. Then, the ANCO system can decrease heat into environment and decrease greenhouse gas emission 602 kgCO2eq/year. Therefore, the ANCO system was pronounced to be the prototype eco-friendly onsite-wastewater treatment system for green office building application.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Microorganisms are the main drivers of emerging antibiotic contaminant degradation in the environment. However, the feasibility and stability of the anaerobic biodegradation of TMP with sulfate as an electron acceptor remain poorly understood. Here, TMP-degrading microbial consortia were successfully enriched from municipal activated sludge (AS) and river sediment (RS) as the initial inoculums. The acclimated consortia were capable of transforming TMP through demethylation, and the hydroxyl-substituted demethylated product (4-desmethyl-TMP) was further degraded. The biodegradation of TMP followed a 3-parameter sigmoid kinetic model. The potential degraders (Acetobacterium, Desulfovibrio, Desulfobulbus, and unidentified Peptococcaceae) and fermenters (Lentimicrobium and Petrimonas) were significantly enriched in the acclimated consortia. The AS- and RS-acclimated TMP-degrading consortia had similar core microbiomes. The anaerobic biodegradation of TMP could be coupled with sulfate respiration, which gives new insights into the antibiotic fate in real environments and provides a new route for the bioremediation of antibiotic-contaminated environments.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",environmental,Environmental Science (all)

METHODS: The original Health Literacy in Dentistry (HeLD) was translated into Thai (HeLD-Th). The final version of the HeLD-Th was evaluated through a cross-sectional study of 160 participants in Thailand. Interview questionnaires and oral examination were performed. The reliability and validity of the HeLD-Th were determined. RESULTS: The internal consistency was acceptable, with an overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.76. The face and content validity were confirmed. Sufficient construct validity was revealed by exploratory factor analysis. The convergent validity (P ≤ .013) and discriminant validity (P = .017) were estimated. The concurrent validity and predictive validity were confirmed by significantly higher HeLD-Th scores (P < .001). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that approximately 60% of the variation in the HeLD-Th scores was explained by the final model. CONCLUSION: The HeLD-Th has sufficient psychometric properties to assess the oral health literacy of Thai adults with mild to moderate disabilities. There are some limitations of the study due to the small sample size, and the results are specific to Thai adults with disabilities.

Despite its in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the effects of CTX preventive therapy on tuberculosis (TB) remain unclear. Methods: Adults living with HIV enrolled in a regional observational cohort in Asia who had initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were included in the analysis. Factors associated with new TB diagnoses after cohort entry and survival after cART initiation were analysed using Cox regression, stratified by site. Results: A total of 7355 patients from 12 countries enrolled into the cohort between 2003 and 2016 were included in the study. There were 368 reported cases of TB after cohort entry with an incidence rate of 0.99 per 100 person-years (/100 pys). Multivariate analyses adjusted for viral load (VL), CD4 count, body mass index (BMI) and cART duration showed that CTX reduced the hazard for new TB infection by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI l 0.56, 0.93). Mortality after cART initiation was 0.85/100 pys, with a median follow-up time of 4.63 years. Predictors of survival included age, female sex, hepatitis C co-infection, TB diagnosis, HIV VL, CD4 count and BMI. Conclusions: CTX was associated with a reduction in the hazard for new TB infection but did not impact survival in our Asian cohort. The potential preventive effect of CTX against TB during periods of severe immunosuppression should be further explored.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami caused a serious physical damage to hotels and a high cancellation of bookings in the post disaster period, which, in turn, led to most THB 3 billion drop of the hotel and restaurant sector income in 2005 in Phuket. In addition, many tourism facilities in Phuket suffered bankruptcy or a slump, because they started their business again immediately after the reconstruction phase, while tourists did not really come back. This paper is an initiative study of our research project to evaluate the effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on Hotel Occupancy, with a focus on the speed for the physical reconstruction and tourism market recovery. We collected the physical reconstruction period and the hotel occupancy recovery data of six hotels that located in the Patong Beach of Phuket from 2003 to 2017. Through calculation, the average of damage rate (i.e., unavailability of the rooms in this study) is 55.89%, with an average speed for the physical reconstruction to rebuild the rooms about 6.07% of the overall rooms per month. The quotient of these two values indicates that the reconstruction period is around 9.2 months. However, the average period for reconstruction and tourism recovery is about 20 months. There is an about 11 months' delay between that hotel and resorts have finished the reconstruction and the tourists start to visit Phuket as usual. Therefore, the local government, local tourist authority, and hotel entrepreneurs can consider these findings in order to prepare the recovery plan for tourism industry in the future tsunami.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

The aim of this study was to obtain the most up-to-date estimated measure of the association between HBsAg levels and the development of HCC in patients. Methods: We performed a systematic review by searching for relevant studies on PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2002 to November 2017. We presented the effects of HBsAg levels at each cut-off value as the odds ratios (ORs) at 95% confidence interval (CI). We also investigated HCC and its potential risk factors including HBeAg, and HBV DNA. We registered our protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the registration number CRD42018081138. Results: We selected 10 studies representing 12 541 cases. At the 100 IU/ml cut-off, the OR for HCC at the high HBsAg level versus the low level was 4.99 (95% CI, 3.01-8.29) with high inconsistency (I2=79%). At the 1,000 IU/ml threshold, the pooled OR for HCC at the high HBsAg versus the low level was 2.46 (95% CI, 2.15-2.83) with low variance. We also found correlations between the risk of HCC and male gender (OR=2.12), hepatitis B e-antigen positivity (OR=2.99), or hepatitis B (HBV) viral load ≥ 2,000 IU/ml (OR=4.37). Conclusion: Our study revealed that HBsAg levels ≥ 100 IU/ml, and notably > 1,000 IU/ ml, are associated with an increased risk of HCC development.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Accordingly, pre-clinical research aimed at discovering clinically applicable genetic profiles is needed. However, how a given genetic profile affects cancer cell radiosensitivity is unclear. To address this issue, we performed a pilot in vitro study by utilizing EGFR mutational status as a model for genetic profile. Clonogenic assays of EGFR mutant (n = 6) and wild-type (n = 9) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines were performed independently by two oncologists. Clonogenic survival parameters SF2, SF4, SF6, SF8, mean inactivation dose (MID), D10, D50, α, and β were obtained using the linear quadratic model. The differences in the clonogenic survival parameters between the EGFR mutant and wild-type cell lines were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test. As a result, for both datasets, the p values for SF2, SF4, D50, α, and α/β were below 0.05, and those for SF2 were lowest. These data indicate that a genetic profile of NSCLC cell lines might be predictive for their radiation response; i.e., EGFR mutant cell lines might be more sensitive to low dose-and low fraction sized-irradiation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

To develop a subunit vaccine, an effective delivery system targeting the key elements of the protective immune response is a prerequisite. In this study, oxidized carbon nanospheres (OCNs) were used as a subunit vaccine delivery system and tuberculosis (TB) was chosen as a model disease. TB is among the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide and an effective vaccine is urgently needed. The ability of OCNs to deliver recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins, Ag85B and HspX, into bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs) was investigated. For immunization, OCNs were mixed with the two TB antigens as well as the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). The protective efficacy was analyzed in vaccinated mice by aerosol Mtb challenge with a virulent strain of Mtb and the bacterial burdens were measured. The results showed that OCNs are highly effective in delivering Mtb proteins into the cytosol of BMDMs and BMDCs. Upon immunization, this vaccine formula induced robust Th1 immune response characterized by cytokine profiles from restimulated splenocytes and specific antibody titer. More importantly, enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation was observed. However, it did not reduce the bacteria burden in the lung and spleen from the aerosol Mtb challenge. Taken together, OCNs are highly effective in delivering subunit protein vaccine and induce robust Th1 and CD8+ T cell response. This vaccine delivery system is suitable for application in settings where cell-mediated immune response is needed.","biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

VICTORY cumulative 12-month clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, and mucosal healing rates, and Truven 12-month hospitalization and surgery rates, were compared between Eras 1 and 2 using time-to-event analyses. Results: A total of 3661 vedolizumab-treated patients were included (n = 1087 VICTORY, n = 2574 Truven). In both cohorts, CD and UC patients treated during Era 2 were more likely to be biologic naïve. Compared with Era 1, Era 2 CD patients in the VICTORY consortium had higher rates of clinical remission (31% vs 40%, P = 0.03) and mucosal healing (42% vs 58%, P < 0.01). These trends were not observed for UC. In the Truven database, UC patients treated during Era 2 had lower rates of inflammatory bowel disease-related hospitalization (22.4% vs 9.6%, P < 0.001) and surgery (17.2% vs 9.4%, P = 0.008), which was not observed for CD. Conclusion: Since FDA approval, remission and mucosal healing rates have increased for vedolizumab-treated CD patients, and vedolizumab-treated UC patients have had fewer hospitalizations and surgeries. This is likely due to differences between patient populations treated immediately after drug approval and those treated later.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Gastroenterology"

Because companies want to maintain high quality of their products. Introducing a technology such as autonomous machine vision and computer-based algorithms would solve a problem. Typically, this detection requires human to inspect the pointer, however it takes time and sometimes the errors are caused by human eyes judgement. So, we can apply image processing and robotics to reduce number of staff, human error, time and cost in this inspection. Therefore, this paper presents an automatic system to detect, analyze and measure size of the defect on automobile cluster pointer. We introduced an adaptive intensity adjustment algorithm to solve a variation of intensity from taking image of various color of cluster pointer by a fix aperture camera. In the experimental result, our defection size measurement passed a bias test. Then, our system was tested in the real production line over 66,160 pieces within two months period.

Method: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and continuous EEG of all patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest from November 2013 to September 2016. Demographic, clinical data and immediate complications were collected. Characteristics of continuous EEG including EEG background, time to normal trace (TTNT) and electrographic seizures were reviewed by investigators. Cerebral performance category scales at 6 months’ follow up were evaluated and divided into good (grade 1–2) and poor (grade 3–5) outcome groups. Result: Six patients were included (two boys and four girls) with median age of 19.5 months (range13–128 months). Five patients (83.3%) presented with cardiac arrest from near-drowning and one patient with underlying acute lymphocytic leukemia presented an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Initial EKG rhythm was asystole in 3 patients (50%), pulseless activity in 1 patient (16.7%) and initially unknown in 2 patients (33.3%). Two patients (33.3%) who had EEG reactivity and TTNT within 5 minutes and 2.5 hours had good neurological outcome (CPC1). Four patients (66.7%) with absent EEG reactivity had poor neurological outcome (CPC4, 5 in 3 and 1 children respectively). Three patients from the poor outcome group had electrographic seizures, of whom 2/3 progressed to status epilepticus. Three out of four patients in the poor outcome group had the following complications: pneumonia, bleeding and pancreatitis. Conclusion: Early TTNT and EEG reactivity help to predict good neurological outcome in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Seizures and status epilepticus may predict poor neurological outcome.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

Our demonstration of the laboratory biodiesel production provided high quality of biodiesel comparable to the commercial biodiesel. Design of microreactor system for scaling-out to industrial capacity was performed. The simple layout of microreactor system provided great flexibility for operation and maintenance. Less energy consumption and a small number of operators relative to the conventional biodiesel production plant are required. Safety evaluation based on HAZOP and FMEA suggested that the microreactor system was relatively safer than that of the conventional one. The risk can be further reduced by regularly maintaining and calibrating equipment according to preventive maintenance schedule.","process equipment, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

The results indicated that the reactor with a 1% cell-to-matrix ratio required 184 days of operation to reach partial nitrification that produced anaerobic ammonium oxidation-suitable effluent. In contrast, partial nitrification was achieved from the beginning of the operation of the reactor with the 4% cell-to-matrix ratio. The oxygen-limiting zone (dissolved oxygen = 0.5–1.5 mg L−1), where nitrite-oxidizing activity has been suggested to be suppressed and ammonia-oxidizing activity was reported to be maintained, occurred at 10–230 µm from the gel matrices surface. In addition, the layer of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria observed in this zone is likely to have played a role in obstructing oxygen penetration into the inner region of the gel matrices. The next-generation sequencing results indicated that members of the family Nitrosomonadaceae accounted for 16.4–20.7% of the relative abundance of bacteria at the family level, while members of the family Bradyrhizobiaceae, to which the genus Nitrobacter belongs, accounted for approximately 10% of the relative abundance of bacteria at the genus level in the gel matrices.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; process design and equipment; immobilization of cells, environmental",Environmental Engineering

This method is suitable for real time forecast with high resolution time step and we use it to forecast for five-minute time step in this paper. However, Kalman filter requires real time measurement data to adjust forecast value, hence we propose an estimator model to help this approach to perform reliable forecast even when real time measurement data is unavailable. The dataset for building estimator model is set of historical data of power generation from neighbor PV rooftops and distance between PV rooftops. We use ARIMA model to estimate transition matrix for running Kalman filter. The performance of the test is measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Skill Score (SS). The obtained result shows that ARIMA model has lower accuracy compared to Kalman filter and estimator model. The real time data estimation from the estimator model can be used in Kalman filter to forecast PV power generation with good accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization"

To evaluate the biochemical methanation potential (BMP) of each biomass sample, linear regression equations have been developed. Herein the application of the linear correlation of cellulosic compositions and ultimate BMP to simplify a mathematic equation for further prediction was investigated. The study focused on the effect of a pretreatment operation on the prediction. The model hypothesized that the pretreatment process would change the ratio between easily digestible fraction (NDS), cellulose (Cel) and lignin (ADL), which changes methane production. The prediction equations provided R 2 = 0.5897 and for non-pretreated biomass and BMP for biomass after pretreatment provided R 2 = 0.7450. These showed clearly that NDS and Cel provided positive methane production and ADL was a retarding factor. Via the pretreatment process, the coefficient of NDS increased and during ADL decreased significantly, the calibrated coefficient can still be applied (p-value < 0.05). This equation is applicable for methane production from lignocellulosic biomass feedstock where shoreter time and lower cost for methane estimation in BMP assays will be promoted.",engineering,Civil and Structural Engineering

When there is an oxidative stress, it can cause the DNA to be damaged. Hence, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has been shown to be an indicator for oxidative DNA damage. This study aimed to determine the relative telomere length (RTL) and 8-OHdG levels in neoplastic tissues, adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, and blood leukocytes of musculoskeletal (MS) tumor patients. Neoplastic tissues were compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients (n = 46). Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of MS tumor subjects were compared to those of age-matched healthy controls (n = 107). RTL was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and 8-OHdG levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RTL in neoplastic tissues was significantly shorter than that in non-neoplastic tissues [1.12 (0.86–1.46) vs 1.45 (1.25–1.65), P = 0.001]. PBLs had lower RTL than non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients [1.04 (0.85–1.13) vs 1.45 (1.25–1.65), P < 0.001]. However, there was no significant difference between RTL in PBLs and in neoplastic tissues. In addition, PBLs of MS tumor patients had higher RTL than those of the controls [1.04 (0.85–1.13) versus 0.78 (0.68–0.90), P < 0.001]. The 8-OHdG levels in neoplastic tissues were remarkably higher than those in non-neoplastic tissues [8.14 (6.81–11.37) nM/μg/μl vs. 3.79 (2.53–6.17) nM/μg/μl, P < 0.001]. Furthermore, plasma 8-OHdG levels in MS tumor patients were markedly greater than those in the controls [102.50 (73.16–133.50) nM vs. 41.09 (6.81–11.37) nM, P < 0.001]. Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.7536 (95% confident interval (CI) 0.6602–0.8469) when the cut-off value of RTL in PBLs was 0.97. Also, plasma 8-OHdG levels depicted that when the cut-off value was 38.67 nM, the AUC was 0.7723 (95% CI 0.6920–0.8527). Moreover, ROC curve analysis showed that both RTL and 8-OHdG appeared to improve the sensitivity (85.68%) and specificity (70.91%) with the AUC 0.8639 (95% CI 0.7500–0.9500). This study suggested that blood leukocyte RTL and plasma 8-OHdG could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers to differentiate between MS tumor patients and healthy controls.

While several sources of keratin can be considered, the bioactivity of the keratins obtained can be quite different. In this study we discuss the processing and characterization of keratin from camel hair and goat cashmere. Specifically, the camel hair and cashmere were dissolved in an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride), and the characteristics of the soluble and insoluble keratin were evaluated. The structure and properties of the raw material, soluble, and insoluble keratin were studied. Compared to the starting material, the soluble keratin showed chemical changes viz. decrease of cysteine, and minor structural changes. Preliminary in vitro biological properties performed by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and scratch test showed good bioactivity in keratin from both sources. In particular, cell migration was observed to be faster when cells were cultured in the presence of soluble keratin extracted from camel hair and cashmere.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The bioactivities beneficial for cosmetic uses of A. crassna leaf extracts were explored. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The antiglycation activities were evaluated using a bovine serum albumin-fructose assay, and the anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were investigated via the inhibition of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secreted from human keratinocyte cells after UVB irradiation. The extracts were also evaluated for nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition using red ferric thiocyanate assays. The results showed that the young leaves and flowers of A. crassna, contained high total contents of 1–4 of which 3 presented as a major compound. The aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts of the young leaves showed higher antioxidant activities than that of the mature leaves. The extracts of the young leaves showed antiglycation properties with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.21 ± 0.54 μg/mL for the 70% ethanolic extracts, where the aqueous extracts of the young leaves had an IC50 value of 9.00 ± 1.38 μg/mL, while a positive standard, aminoguanidine, showed an IC50 value of 9.69 ± 0.75 μg/mL. The anti-inflammatory activities revealed that the aqueous extracts expressed strong IL-1α and IL-8 inhibitions, while the 70% ethanolic extract showed IL-1α and NO inhibitions. Both extracts did not show inhibitory activity on LOX and PGE2. The results suggest that the extracts of young leaves of A. crassna are promising active ingredients for further application in cosmetic and cosmeceutical industry.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

Recently, the maximum depth of excavation has increased up to approximately −25 m. Deep excavation in Bangkok subsoils requires consideration of the soil conditions and the real piezometric level of ground water. In general, Bangkok subsoil consists of 13~16 m of thick, dark grey soft-to-medium clay, followed by stiff, silty clay, before the first sand layer at 21~30 m. The piezometric level of ground water has risen to −13 m from its previous level of −23 m due to the control of deep well pumping for twenty years by the Thai Government. A diaphragm wall is normally used as a soil retaining structure. The behavior and performance of a diaphragm wall is usually predicted by the finite element method (FEM) using Mohr–Coulomb soil modeling as failure criteria, with the soil modulus parameters for soft and stiff Bangkok clay from the self-boring pressuremeter test. This paper presents a comparison between the diaphragm wall movements from FEM analysis predictions and field measurements for two projects, the new Bank of Thailand head office and the Rosewood Hotel, which were constructed with different techniques. The predicted movement agreed well with the field measurements.","water engineeringneering, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Driving in natural situations is the preferred assessment method; thus, we used a naturalistic driving environment to identify driving competency among individuals with PD in comparison to healthy age-matched controls. Methods: Based on a power analysis, we recruited 20 participants (10 with PD and 10 healthy age-matched controls). Each participant completed 3 tasks while driving the ChulaPD car, a 4-door sedan installed with computerized monitoring systems. The tasks were forward and backward vehicle movement, reversing into a parking space, and parking parallel to a sidewalk. Trip start and end times, vehicle speed, and acceleration and deceleration times were logged using steering wheel motion, location parking sensors, and dashboard cameras and compared between groups. Results: Age, gender, possession of a driver's license, present driving conditions, Thai Mini-Mental State Examination score, and driving experience did not significantly differ between groups. However, the PD group took longer to complete the driving tests (p = 0.002), had slower vehicle speeds (p = 0.002), longer brake times (p = 0.007), and decreased brake pressure ability (p = 0.009). Under normalized conditions, the ratio of failed driver's license tests was also higher among the PD group than in the control group (70 vs. 10%, p = 0.006). Conclusions: Individuals with PD had less-than-adequate driving ability based on our naturalistic setting.

High-pressure phases induce H-vacancy diffusion kinetics in TM-doped MgH2: Ab initio study for hydrogen storage improvement,"Pluengphon P., Bovornratanaraks T., Tsuppayakorn-aek P., Pinsook U., Inceesungvorn B.",2019-08-13,"Ab initio calculations, Doped-MgH2, Formation enthalpy, High pressure, High-pressure phasis, Pressure conditions, Vacancy diffusion, Vacancy mechanisms, Doped-MgH2, H-vacancy, High pressure, Hydrogen storage, Kinetics diffusion","The improvement of the hydrogen storage mechanism in TM-doped MgH2 by structural high-pressure effects has been found using ab initio calculation. Phase transition, formation enthalpy and H-vacancy mechanism of α-, β-, and γ-MgH2 with 3.125% of Ni, Pd and Pd dopants are analyzed under the pressure conditions of 0, 5 and 10 GPa. It is found that the enthalpy of β- and γ-phases based on the α-phase decreases in TM-doped systems, especially for the heavier atomic size of dopants (Pt > Pd > Ni). As a result, the γ-phase has become structural stable at ambient pressure. The occupation enthalpy of TM substitutions in β and γ phases is easier than that in the α phase, which indicates ability of mixing impurities. High pressure induces the occupation of H-vacancy in all compounds. The activation energy curves of MgH2 with Ni, Pd and Pt dopants are also analyzed, and the minimal barriers are significantly dominated in the γ phase.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is commonly present in natural water and acts as a disinfection by-product precursor. Adsorption is one of the promising technologies that is commonly applied for DOM removal. Interestingly, the properties of pig bone are such that it has a surface area and pore volumes that can adsorb DOM. Pig bone was synthesized as porous bone char (PBC). The results show that synthesized PBC at 900 C (PBC-900 C) provides a high volume of mesoporous structure. The adsorption process was best fitted with the pseudo-second-order and Freundlich isotherm model. Thus, the mechanisms occurred on the multilayer adsorption of the surface. PBC-900 C can remove approximately 70-80% of DOM with varying concentrations, from 0.2 g/L to 0.8 g/L. Furthermore, the results of fluorescence excitation-emission (FEEM) showed that humic acids and humic-like substances in water can be removed by using PBC at concentrations higher than 0.4 g/L. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that PBC is an alternative low-cost adsorbent which can be utilized for reduction of DBP precursors from water.","genergyal, water engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

This coating performance (30 min, 170 °C) was 22.18% of weight gain which was corresponded to 0.51 mmol/g of ion exchange capacity (IEC). Then, the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The appropriated pH was 6.5 and the equilibrium time was 420 min. At 30 °C, the adsorption capacity towards paraquat (PQ) was enhanced (4.5, 18.9 and 23.7 mg/g) when the initial concentration of paraquat was increased (10, 50 and 250 mg/L). The adsorption kinetics was fitted to the pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherm was suitable to Langmuir model. For the thermodynamic studies, the negative ∆G° revealed a spontaneous process, the negative ∆H° showed an exothermic process and the positive ∆S° displayed an enhanced disorder. Finally, the reusability of functionalized textile in methanol was reached 78.6% after six regeneration cycles and the stability of sample in various solvents was also studied.

Aims: This study investigated the effects of Thai traditional dance on balance performance among older women. Methods: Forty-three women aged 60–80 years, with mean scores between 45 and 52 points on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: a Thai traditional dance group (TTDG) (n = 22) and a control group (CG) (n = 21). TTD program comprised three dance sessions of 30–60 min per week over the course of 12 weeks while the CG kept their normal daily activities. Balance performance was assessed using standardized tests including the NeuroCom Balance Master® System (Version 9.2), the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) and the BBS. Results: The results revealed that overall balance was better for those in TTDG compared to the CG. There was a significantly lower sway velocity and faster weight transfer in the Sit-to-Stand Test (p ≤ 0.001) for those in the dance group. TTDG had quicker turn time in the Step Quick Turn Test (p ≤ 0.001), improved Step Up Over Test and Walk Across Test, faster movement time, walking speed, and a better score in the TUG after training (p ≤ 0.001). Discussion: A 3-weekly Thai traditional dance intervention significantly improved balance and mobility among older community-dwelling women as compared to normal daily activities. Conclusion: Thai traditional dance could potentially prevent age-related mobility and balance decline and its related fall risk.","biochemistryistry, medical","Aging, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

Recently, ENPs have been shown to cause cellular damage by inducing ROS (reactive oxygen species) both directly and indirectly, leading to the changes in DNA methylation levels, which is an important epigenetic mechanism. In this study, we investigated the effect of ENP-induced ROS on DNA methylation. Materials and methods: Human embryonic kidney and human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells were exposed to three different types of ENPs: Gold nanoparticles, silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), and chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs). We then evaluated the cytotoxicity of the ENPs by measuring cell viability, morphology, cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and ROS levels. Global DNA methylation levels was measured using 5-methylcytosine immunocytochemical staining and HPLC analysis. DNA methylation levels of the transposable elements, long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) and Alu, were also measured using combined bisulfite restriction analysis technique. DNA methylation levels of the TEs LINE-1 and Alu were also measured using combined bisulfite restriction analysis technique. Results: We found that HaCaT cells that were exposed to SiNPs exhibited increased ROS levels, whereas HaCaT cells that were exposed to SiNPs and CSNPs experienced global and Alu hypomethylation, with no change in LINE-1 being observed in either cell line. The demethylation of Alu in HaCaT cells following exposure to SiNPs and CSNPs was prevented when the cells were pretreated with an antioxidant. Conclusion: The global DNA methylation that is observed in cells exposed to ENPs is associated with methylation of the Alu elements. However, the change in DNA methylation levels following ENP exposure is specific to particular ENP and cell types and independent of ROS, being induced indirectly through disruption of the oxidative defense process.","biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, pharmacology, chemistry","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"
Comparative study of local gas-liquid hydrodynamics and mass transfer between conventional and modified airlift reactors,"Bun S., Chawaloesphonsiya N., Nakajima F., Tobino T., Painmanakul P.",2019-08-01,"Air-lift reactors, Bubble distributions, KLa coefficient, Liquid flow, Oxygen mass transfer, Airlift reactor, Bubble distribution, KLa coefficient, Liquid flow pattern, Oxygen mass transfer","Modified airlift reactor (MALR) was developed for improving the oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) by installing the slanted baffles in the riser compartment. MALR can enhance KLa value up to 97% compared to a regular reactor. However, insufficient analysis of the hydrodynamics and other oxygen transfer parameters of this new reactor has been performed to date. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse local gas-liquid dynamics and evaluate the oxygen transfer performance in MALR compared to regular reactors using clean water as a liquid phase. Air bubble distribution was employed in terms of bubble diameter, rising velocity, and interfacial area. Slanted baffles maintained the bubble size between 3.88 and 4.63 mm for the studied superficial gas velocity (Ug), which is smaller than that in airlift reactor (ALR) by approximately 0.2 mm. Bubble rising velocity (UB) is relatively increased with Ug, regardless of reactor classes. New reactor could extend the bubble residence in the water by lengthening the bubble stream path of the slanted baffles leading to decrease UB values about 39% and 52% compared to bubble column reactor (BCR) and ALR, respectively. These performances consequently resulted in an interfacial area almost two times higher than in regular reactors. Oxygen transfer improved in MALR with an extra amount of oxygen transfer efficiency of 1.57% and 0.63% over BCR and ALR, respectively. This resulted in the highest aeration efficiency (AE) compared to other examined reactors, following a trendline expression of AE 0.046 Ug-0.6. Insertion of slanted baffles produced 5% and 12.8% more dead zone volume than ALR and BCR, respectively. In conclusion, MALR can significantly enhance oxygen transfer performance due to the ability to maintain bubble size and extend the gas-liquid transfer period.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

SDS-PAGE revealed that ASC and PSC were classified as type I collagen, and the molecular weight of ASC was greater than that of PSC. Both types of collagen from sub-tropical fish scales contained greater imino acids compared to those from temperate fish scales. Carp from Japan and Bangladesh showed similar thermal stability, but lizardfish from Vietnam showed higher stability than lizardfish from Japan for both collagen types. Overall, PSC possessed a slightly lower denaturation temperature than the corresponding ASC, suggesting that a relationship between thermostability and the molecular mass of collagen, as observed in SDS-PAGE, might exist. Maximal solubility was noticed at acidic pH (1-4) and solubility obviously declined at a high salt concentration (>2 %). ASC and PSC from these fish scales could be applicable to the food industry in place of mammalian collagens.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering, engineering, Business","Biotechnology, Food Science, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Marketing"

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of wearing brass neck coils on cardiorespiratory and cerebrovascular functions in long-neck Karen women. A total of 28 Karen women (aged 23–66 years) were studied. Fourteen Karen women who had been wearing neck brass coils were compared with 14 Karen women with no neck coils. We also studied 14 age-matched city-living controls. Radiographic examination of 2 older Karen women wearing neck coils showed low levels of the clavicles. There were no group differences in resting heart rate and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was greater and functional capacity was lower in both Karen women than city-living controls (all p < 0.05). Karen women wearing neck coils demonstrated lower flow-mediated dilation, lung functions, including forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume during the first second, and cerebral blood flow velocity than Karen women without neck coils (all p < 0.05). Karen women wearing neck coils demonstrate reduced endothelial and pulmonary functions as well as cerebral perfusion compared with age-matched Karen women without neck coils living in the same villages. Brass neck coils worn by Karen women may elevate risks of developing cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular diseases. Novelty • Cerebral blood flow velocity and macrovascular and microvascular functions were lower in Karen wearing neck coils. • There appears to be substantial burden of brass neck coils exerted on physiological systems in Karen women.","medical, biochemistryistry, Nursing","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Physiology, Nutrition and Dietetics, Physiology (medical)"
Kinetics and localisation of haemin-induced lipoprotein oxidation,"Morales N.P., Chunephisal P., Janprasit J., Ishida Y., Luechapudiporn R., Yamada K.-I.",2019-10-03,"Adult, Hemin, Humans, Kinetics, Lipid Peroxidation, Lipoproteins, Male, Young Adult, ESR spin labelling, haemin, lipid peroxidation, lipoprotein","Haemin (iron (III)-protoporphyrin IX) is a degradation product of haemoglobin in circulating erythrocytes. Haemin may play a key oxidising agent for lipoprotein oxidation in patients with haemolytic anaemia. In this study, kinetic changes in chemical composition and target sites of haemin-induced LDL and HDL oxidation were investigated. Haemin initially induced the loss of α-tocopherol, followed by accumulation of lipid hydroperoxide (LP) and alteration of core lipid fluidity. The absence of LP in HDL was explained by the antioxidant activity of PON in addition to α-tocopherol. The target site of haemin was evaluated by ESR spin labelling with 5- and 16-doxyl steric acids. In the presence of t-BuOOH and haemin, ESR signal decay of the doxyl moiety demonstrated the initiation phase and the propagation phase of lipid peroxidation. The results of the lag time and the rate of signal decay indicated that haemin is located near the 16th carbon atom of the fatty acid chain in the phospholipid layer. The analyses of motion parameters, order parameter (S) of 5-DS and rotational correlation time (τ) of 16-DS, supported the observation that the lipid properties changed near the hydrophobic region rather than at the surface region of lipoproteins. Moreover, ESR spin labelling demonstrated that haemin molecules but not iron ions caused lipoprotein oxidation. In conclusion, haemin is a potent inducer of lipoprotein oxidation, and the target site for this oxidation is near the hydrophobic core of the lipoprotein leading to the loss of antioxidant activities and changes in lipid composition and physical properties.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry",Biochemistry

An automatic food categorization application would greatly help to identify and classify food categories. Food categorization is a complex problem since the number of category types can be more than one hundred. Many kinds of food are similar with only subtle differences in taste and presentation and this can lead to a problem called 'finegrained issue'. Recently, a bilinear model was employed which showed good accuracy and generated excessive features to capture details among different food categories, albeit with limited performance. Diverse food categories require disparate sets of features. Here, an attention mechanism was applied to capture suitable features and specifically identify each food category. Furthermore, the performance of a bilinear backbone was also enhanced by applying Inception in correlation with Inception-ResNet-v2 and Inception-v3 networks. The experiment was conducted on the Wongnai dataset containing various images that were separated into 83 classes. Results showed that our attentional model outperformed the traditional bilinear model, with an average of 16% improvement showing 3% and 44% as min-max performance values, respectively.","food products, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, decision sciences, energy","Information Systems, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Information Systems and Management, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Effect of C-MOx support on the oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of the PtCo catalysts in acid electrolyte and in proton exchange membrane fuel cell was explored at ambient pressure. It was found that the use of respective C-MOx support changed the morphologies (degree of alloying and particle sizes) as well as the electrochemical properties (electrode resistance and electrochemical surface area) of the obtained PtCo catalyst. In addition, it enhanced the formation of Pt atoms with a small d-electron occupancy, which consequently affected positively the ORR activity of the PtCo catalysts. Among the three utilized C-MOx support (C-TiOx, C-CeOx, C-MoOx), the C-MoOx exhibited the highest ORR activity in an acid electrolyte monitored in terms of kinetic current density and the highest current density of 570 mA/cm2 at 60 °C and 1 atm (abs) in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. In addition, it also achieved a comparable stability of PtCo catalyst to that of C-TiOx support, which were higher than that of the commercial carbon support.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The most popular models for solving problems are generative adversarial network (GAN) [1] models such as DiscoGAN [2] and CycleGAN [3]. In training process, input images with no desired properties, and output images with the desired properties are fed into the generative model to train the model. After training, the model can synthesize the desired properties from the input images without those properties. However, in practical usage, an input image may be different from the training process because the input image may be the image with or without the desired properties. This research proposes the method of training the generative model by giving input images with and without desired properties in the same way as when the model is used. Our proposed model enhances DiscoGAN with repeated property construction to generate images with desired properties. The model can use unpaired data as the training data, which makes data preparation more efficiently and more comprehensive than paired data. The proposed model obtained approximately 8% better Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [4] score compared to the DiscoGAN model.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

This paper proposes Model Predictive Control (MPC) of EMS to dispatch generation power in microgrid for minimum total operating cost. The load forecast is obtained by recurrent neural network for one day ahead. The efficiency and accuracy of load forecasting model affects the efficiency of dispatch algorithm of microgrid.

In addition to frank gastrointestinal (GI) rupture/puncture, sepsis can also be exacerbated by translocation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the GI tract to the systemic circulation (gut origin of sepsis). In the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans are abundant, along with their major PAMP components, endotoxin (LPS) and (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan (BG). Whereas the influence of LPS in bacterial sepsis has been studied extensively, exploration of the role of BG in bacterial sepsis is limited. Post-translocation, PAMPs enter the circulation through lymphatics and the portal vein, and are detoxified and then excreted via the liver and the kidney. Sepsis-induced liver and kidney injury might therefore affect the kinetics and increase circulating PAMPs.

This study aimed (i) to investigate the pooled prevalence and/or incidence of AF in patients with cirrhosis and (ii) to assess the mortality risk of AF in patients with cirrhosis. Patients and methods A literature search for studies that reported incidence of AF in patients with cirrhosis was carried out using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database from inception through July 2018. Pooled incidence with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random-effect model. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42018102664). Results Seven cohort studies including 385 866 patients with cirrhosis were identified. The pooled estimated prevalence of AF in patients with cirrhosis was 5.0% (95% CI: 2.8-8.6%). When studies that solely assessed patients undergoing transplant evaluation or on transplant waiting list were excluded, the pooled estimated prevalence of AF in patients with cirrhosis was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.5-15.2%). There was a significant association between AF and increased mortality risk in cirrhotic patients with a pooled odds ratio of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.36-1.53). Conclusion The overall estimated prevalence of AF among patients with cirrhosis is 5.0%. Our study demonstrates a statistically significant increased mortality risk in cirrhotic patients with AF.",medical,Medicine (all)

The CuO was deposited on CeO2 by deposition–precipitation at a nominal 10% by weight and the obtained CuO/CeO2 catalysts were characterized. The morphological structure of CeO2 influenced the catalytic activities in the OSRM reaction. The CuO/rod-shaped CeO2 (CuO/CeO2-R) gave the highest turnover frequency (TOF) and a CO concentration of less than 1% (v/v). The high catalytic performance of CuO/CeO2-R involved the well-dispersed CuO nanoparticles, level of Cu+ species as the active site, improved reducible oxide, number of relative oxygen vacancies and the stronger interaction between CuO and CeO2.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

However, phenolic compounds in TPOME might be leached to the environment. This study investigated the ability of grasses on reducing phenolic compounds in the leachate after TPOME application. Several pasture grasses in soil pots were compared after irrigating with TPOME from stabilization ponds, which contained 360-630 mg/L phenolic compounds. The number of soil bacteria in planted pots increased over time with the average of 108 CFU/g for mature grasses, while only 104-106 CFU/g were found in the unplanted control pots. The leachates from TPOME irrigated grass pots contained lower amounts of phenolic compounds and had lower phytotoxicity than that of control pots. The phenol removal efficiency of grass pots was ranged 67-93% and depended on grass cultivars, initial concentration of phenolic compounds and frequency of irrigations. When compared to water irrigation, TPOME led to an increased phenolic compounds accumulation in grass tissues and decreased biomass of Brachiaria hybrid and Brachiaria humidicola but not Panicum maximum. Consequently, the application of TPOME could be conducted on grassland and the grass species should be selected based on the utilization of grass biomass afterward.",environmental,Environmental Engineering

Transcript levels of the genes associated with loss of synaptic plasticity (Bdnf, Syn, GluN1, α7-nAChR, and M1-mAChR), formation of neurofibrillary tangles (Tau4 and Tau3), and amyloid plaques (App, Adam10, and Bace1), in the hippocampus of rats at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 days after ODX (D0, D1, D3, D6 and D9, respectively) were determined. Primarily, the sudden loss of androgen, as confirmed by the decreased serum testosterone levels and accessory sex organ weights, induced a chronological reduction in Syn (at D1), and increase in GluN1 (at D3), α7-nAChR, and M1-mAChR (at D6) and a decrease in Bdnf (at D9) transcript levels. Tau4 and Tau3 mRNA levels were increased at D6 and D9, respectively. No changes in App, Adam10, and Bace1 mRNA levels were detected within the 9-day study period. To confirm those changes were caused by androgen deprivation and not increasing age, the mRNA expression levels of those genes in 9-day orchidectomized rats (ODX-D9) were compared with age-matched intact rats. All changes of mRNA expression levels of the ODX-D9 rats were aligned with the D9 rats, except for GluN1 that was decreased in the ODX-D9 rats. Moreover, the total and phosphorylated tau protein levels were increased in the ODX-D9 rats. These results denote that androgen deficiency induces the early onset of neurodegeneration, while the loss of synaptic plasticity together with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles could be used as markers for neurodegenerative prediction.",neuroscience,Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience

In this paper, we propose a method to localize individual characters of text from background with texture and noise in digital images using adaptive thresholding, width-to-height ratio, and convolutional neural network. The proposed method consists of three main steps: preprocessing, text candidate localization and classification, and character candidate localization and classification. In preprocessing step, images are enhanced by average filter in order to reduce noise and make the texture background harmonious. Then text candidates in an image are localized and classified using adaptive thresholding and width-to-height ratio of bounding boxes. Finally, character candidates of each text are localized and a convolutional neural network is used to classify character candidates as either character or non-character. The experiments were conducted on a dataset obtained from ICDAR2013 containing the training set of 229 images and the testing set of 233 images.

Two mechanical defibrillation methods were studied to obtain a suitable preparation of nanocellulose suspension. A method of stock gel dilutions was selected since it provided longer stability of nanocellulose suspension. Then, physiological changes of spinach leaves coated with nanocellulose were measured compared with uncoated leaves. The results revealed that the coated leaves with 0.3 and 0.5% w/v nanocellulose concentrations displayed the significant retentions of appearance, chlorophyll, color, and moisture content after 3-day storage at 25 °C. Moreover, all of the coated samples exhibited the significant reduction of respiration rate in the range of 54–70%.

The effect of surfactant concentration on physical-chemical properties of nanoemulsions with entrapped curcumin, relevant to commercial applications, was addressed in this research. Furthermore, the functionality of nanoemulsified curcumin in terms of lipid oxidation inhibition was determined. Protection against varying pH and thermal treatments was more significant in the nanoemulsions at the elevated surfactant level, but at these high concentrations, the surface charges of the emulsions dramatically decreased under sodium salt addition, which may result in instability over time. Nanoemulsions showed the potential to inhibit malondialdehyde (MDA) formulation by protecting the entrapped curcumin and enhance its antioxidant activity when added to milk. The fortified milk with added curcumin systems had a yellow color compared to the control.

Meanwhile, for travelers, it is important to select sightseeing places and plan an appropriate route to them. There are many studies on recommendation systems for sightseeing places and their routes. However, in these conventional studies, there is a problem that the information of a place that is reluctantly visited by a traveler, such as on a business trip, becomes noise and, as a result, it might cause a recommendation system to suggest a sightseeing place that does not match the interests of the traveler. In addition, in general, it is difficult to form a good recommendation unless a large-scale data set of sightseeing places is collected and each location is actively evaluated by many users. In this study, we propose a method for extracting users' preferences based on the behavior of taking and editing photos of sightseeing places. The feature of our method is that it calculates the degrees of interest in photos that are actually taken by a user by counting the numbers of pictures and editing processes such as color adjustments and clipping, which are regarded as a part of the users' behavior of taking and editing photos of sightseeing places. This is done for the purpose of providing recommendations of sightseeing places. By associating the result of the content analysis of the sightseeing place photos with the degrees of a user's interest in the photos, it would be possible to extract the user's preferences from the sightseeing place photos. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated by several experiments using a prototype of our system.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Signal Processing, Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Materials and Methods: Periodontitis severity was determined using mean probing depth (PD) or clinical attachment level (CAL) and a categorical variable (no/mild, moderate, or severe). Oral hygiene was evaluated using plaque scores. Regression analyses assessed the associations between periodontal variables and sST2 or CRP levels, adjusting for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and high-density or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: The study population comprised 799 individuals, aged 50–73 years. After multivariable adjustment, greater mean PD/CAL, severe periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene were associated with elevated sST2 and CRP levels (p < 0.05).

This paper proposes a new pedestrian detection method by using an appearance-based multi-channel features. The method involves only the monocular environment since most cameras have only a single lens. A pedestrian is represented by the combination of channel features partly weighted according to the clearly visual appearance and occlusion. Handling partial occlusion is carried out by constructing a hierarchical region reduction structure. A full pedestrian image is disintegrated into several horizontal and vertical regions. Each region captures the outstanding appearance of pedestrian’s body. The features extracted from all regions are hierarchically combined to perform the concurrent detection of pedestrian’s occurrence. The experiment yielded good results using standard benchmark dataset. The performance evaluations on miss rate, average false positive per image, and the trade-off between running time and performance show that the proposed detection framework is a reasonable option for real world applications.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, Signal Processing, Information Systems, Modeling and Simulation, Hardware and Architecture"

The molar ratios of La/Al were varied from 0.01 to 0.15. Based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, La addition ap-parently resulted in increased basicity of the catalysts, which is related to increasing of oxygen mobili-ty. However, when considered the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption, it was found that Pt dispersion also increased with increasing the amount of La addition up to La/Al = 0.05. It is suggested that too high amount of La addition can inhibit the dispersion Pt due to surface coverage of La. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation essentially depends on both Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimposed on each other. Based on this study, the Pt/?-Al2O3 catalyst with La addition of La/Al molar ratio = 0.05 showed the highest activity due to its optimal Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility leading to its highest value of turnover frequency (TOF).","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The steam explosion technique could partially eliminate hemicellulose and lignin and increase the cellulose content, leading to improvement of the thermal properties and crystallinity of the treated fibers. With increasing the steam pressure and treatment cycles, changes of the fiber morphology were observed. Smaller widths and shorter lengths of the treated fibers could be obtained.

In this study, the codon-optimized xynA gene encoding xylanase A from the fungus Penicilium citrinum was successfully synthesized and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The levels of secreted enzyme activity under the control of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGAP) and alcohol oxidase 1 (PAOX1) promoters were compared. The Pc Xyn11A was produced as a soluble protein and the total xylanase activity under the control of PGAP and PAOX1 was 34- and 193-fold, respectively, higher than that produced by the native strain of P. citrinum. The Pc Xyn11A produced under the control of the PAOX1 reached a maximum activity of 676 U/mL when induced with 1% (v/v) methanol every 24 h for 5 days. The xylanase was purified by ion exchange chromatography and then characterized. The enzyme was optimally active at 55 ◦C and pH 5.0 but stable over a broad pH range (3.0–9.0), retaining more than 80% of the original activity after 24 h or after pre-incubation at 40 ◦C for 1 h. With birchwood xylan as a substrate, Pc Xyn11A showed a Km(app) of 2.8 mg/mL, and a kcat of 243 s−1. The high level of secretion of Pc Xyn11A and its stability over a wide range of pH and moderate temperatures could make it useful for a variety of biotechnological applications.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Risk-based traded demand response between consumers' aggregator and retailer using downside risk constraints technique,"Guo L., Sriyakul T., Nojavan S., Jermsittiparsert K.",2019-01-01,"Demand response, Demand response exchanges, Electricity demands, Electricity procurement, Forward contract, Restructured electricity markets, Risk strategies, Stochastic optimizations, Demand response exchange (DRX) market, Downside risk-constraint (DRC), Electricity retailer, Risk evaluation","Electricity retailer is the most critical player in the restructured electricity market. Retailer's electricity procurement problem is a big challenge for them. Electricity retailer can purchase their energy from various options such as pool market, forward contracts, and etc. A relatively new way with a lesser investigation is the demand response exchange market. In this paper, the risk-constrained stochastic power procurement problem of electricity retailers is formulated by modeling the uncertainty of pool-market price and consumers' electricity demand. The Downside risk constraints (DRC) risk-evaluation method is used to obtain risk-based power procurement scheduling of electricity retailers. By using the proposed method, conservative electricity retailer can experience a scenario-independent strategy over the stochastic optimization. In other words, the proposed risk strategy is such that impose more cost for electricity retailer while having an equal cost in all scenarios. Based on the obtained results, the operation cost of electricity retailers in all scenarios is closed to about $4827570, which is a relatively zero-risk strategy due to equality overall scenarios. Besides, results are compared in two cases to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed risk-evaluation method. Also, the Pareto front between risk-in-cost and expected cost can introduce an optimal risk-strategy for electricity retailers in the presence of uncertainties. Finally, the risk-averse strategy of electricity retailer is proposed to obtain the retailer's optimal conservative schedule during power procurement in the presence of uncertainties.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Model-Based Approach Integrated with Fault Circuit Indicators for Fault Location in Distribution Systems,"Ananthan S.N., Bastos A.F., Santoso S., Chirapongsananurak P.",2019-08-01,"Communication capabilities, Distribution system modeling, Distribution systems, Fault location estimates, Impedance based methods, Measurement locations, Model based approach, Model-based OPC, Fault Circuit Indicator, Fault Location, Model-Based","Distribution systems can have complex topologies consisting of taps and laterals which make fault location a difficult process. Fault circuit indicators (FCI) are useful devices which aid system protection and fault location by identifying the faulted line section of the distribution system. Impedance-based methods have been traditionally used for estimating the fault location from fault event report. These approaches make assumptions such as all lines in the distribution system being homogeneous and having the same line parameters which can lead to errors in the fault location estimate. However, to overcome the inaccuracy in fault location estimate requires the assistance of a protection engineer to compensate for known errors and calculate the actual distance to the fault from the measurement location which significantly slows down the outage recovery time. This can be overcome by using an automated model-based approach for fault location. This paper proposes an automated approach that uses the distribution system model along with FCI devices with communication capability to accurately estimate the exact fault location. This paper illustrates the benefits of the proposed approach for fault location by comparing it with other traditional methods using a modified IEEE 34 node test system.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

IEC 61850 has been introduced for the upgrading of an electrical substation to digital substation composed of many digital devices that help automate the electrical power control for the purpose of power stability. Sampled Values is a basic message protocol for the application of Wide Area Measurement and Control (WAMPAC), which requires manageable communication in a wide area over Ethernet layer. In this regard, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has recently been introduced as one of the communication technologies with that capability. This paper has reported on our first-step findings towards the development of a tool to help checking the feasibility of SDN technology in smart grid applications. Since the smart grid applications must be delay-critical, timing performances become essential and all the modules to be used in the tool development must be verified on that aspect. Particularly, for this paper, Mininet and ONOS controller have been tested. Their ability to emulate transmission link delay values is quantified and reported for the practical range of smart grid application usages.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Media Technology, Instrumentation"

The term ‘red flag’, was originally coined in 1989 to define the presence of non-cardinal features that may raise a suspicion of multiple system atrophy (MSA), or at least suggest alternative diagnosis to Parkinson's disease (PD). Since then, the term ‘red flag’, has been consistently used in the literature to denote the clinical history or signs that may signal to physicians the possibility of an atypical parkinsonian disorder (APD). While most red flags were originally based on expert opinion, many have gained acceptance and are now included in validated clinical diagnostic criteria of PD and APDs. The clinical appreciation of red flags, in conjunction with standard criteria, may result in a more accurate and earlier diagnosis compared to standard criteria alone. However, red flags can be clinical signs that are non-neurological, making the systematic assessment for them a real challenge in clinical practice. Here, we have conducted a systematic review to identify red flags and their clinical evidence in the differential diagnosis of common degenerative parkinsonism, including PD, MSA, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and dementia with Lewy body (DLB). Increasing awareness and appropriate use of red flags in clinical practice may benefit physicians in the diagnosis and management of their patients with parkinsonism.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

The detected cells are removed. The Circular Hough transform with high sensitivity is re-applied to the remaining region in order to detect the overlapped cells. The proposed method can be easily implemented into personal computers. The proposed algorithm was tested with many slides of canine red blood cell.

After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (>1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The objective of this review is to summarize the studies of resistant maltodextrin and its effect on metabolic profile, such as blood glucose, lipid profile, and body weight. Several studies support the idea that resistant maltodextrin may improve blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and obesity. However, the use of resistant maltodextrin should be limited to minimize the adverse effect on the gastrointestinal system. This review provides information regarding the benefits of resistant maltodextrin on metabolic health as well as its proposed mechanism to enhance the knowledge of this novel fiber.Key teaching points Resistant maltodextrin is a novel non-viscous dietary fiber classified as resistant starch type V that is produced by debranching of the starch structure. Resistant maltodextrin is fermentable in the colon and thus produces short-chain fatty acid. Resistant maltodextrin helps to maintain blood and lipid profiles as well as promote satiety and reducing food intake. High intake of resistant maltodextrin may cause gastrointestinal discomfort due to the gas production and increased osmotic pressure.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

However, evidence evaluating CTO-PCI is limited to observational studies and small clinical trials. Methods: In this open-label, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, PCI-eligible patients were assigned to receive either 1 of 2 strategies: PCI or no PCI for the qualifying de novo CTO lesion with the option for PCI of obstructive non-CTO lesions at the discretion of the operator. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Because of slow recruitment, the trial was stopped before completion of the 1284 planned enrollments. Results: Between March 2010 and September 2016, 834 patients were randomly assigned to the CTO-PCI (n=417) or no CTO-PCI (n=398) strategy. Among the patients assigned to the no CTO-PCI strategy, 78 (19.6%) crossed over to receive staged CTO-PCI within 3 days of randomization. The overall CTO-PCI success rate was 90.6%. Serious nonfatal complications associated with CTO-PCI occurred in 3 patients (1 stroke, 1 cardiac tamponade, and 1 patient with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia induced by intracoronary thrombus). Approximately half of the patients in each group underwent PCI for an average of 1.3 non-CTO lesions, resulting in a comparable residual SYNTAX score (Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery; 3.7±5.4 versus 4.0±5.9, P=0.42) confined to non-CTO vessels. During a median follow-up of 4.0 years (interquartile range, 2.4 to 5.1 years), there was no significant difference between the CTO-PCI and the no CTO-PCI strategies in the incidence of the primary end point (22.3% versus 22.4%, hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.37; P=0.86). Both CTO-PCI and no CTO-PCI strategy were associated with significant improvements but without between-group differences in disease-specific health status that was sustained through 36 months. Conclusions: CTO-PCI was feasible with high success rates. There was no difference in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events with CTO-PCI versus no CTO-PCI, but the study was limited by low power for clinical end points and high crossover rates between groups.

We previously reported that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was involved in PRRSV-induced immunosuppression during an early phase of infection. However, the exact mechanism associated with PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra immunomodulation remains unknown. To explore the immunomodulatory properties of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on porcine immune functions, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) and leukocytes were cultured with type 2 PRRSV, and the immunological role of IL-1Ra was assessed by addition of anti-porcine IL-1Ra Ab. The results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra reduced phagocytosis, surface expression of MHC II (SLA-DR) and CD86, as well as downregulation of IFNA and IL1 gene expression in the MoDC culture system. Interestingly, IL-1Ra secreted by the PRRSV-infected MoDC also inhibited T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, but not IFN-γ production. Although PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was not directly linked to IL-10 production, it contributed to the differentiation of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) within the culture system. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra downregulates innate immune functions, T lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation, and influences collectively with IL-10 in the Treg induction. The immunomodulatory roles of IL-1Ra elucidated in this study increase our understanding of the immunobiology of PRRSV.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

This was a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected adults >50 years of age and free from CVDs from Thailand during 1 March 2016 and 30 May 2017. Ultrasonography of the carotid was performed and read by cIMT experienced neurologists who were blinded from the patient care. Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined by carotid plaque or cIMT of the common carotid artery (CCA) >0.9 mm. Totally 316 HIV-infected adults (61% males) were included. Median age was 54.4 years and 15.8% were diabetic, 40.2% had hypertension, and 12.7% were current smokers. The median duration of ART was 16.3 years and 32% were currently on boosted protease inhibitor. The mean overall cIMT of the common carotid arteries were 0.63 (IQR 0.55-0.72) mm. Men had higher cIMT than women, 0.64 (IQR 0.56-0.76) vs. 0.60 (IQR 0.53-0.70), p = .03. Overall, 3.8% had cIMT >0.9 mm and 24.4% had carotid plaque.

"The production of volatile fatty acids from Napier grass via an anaerobic leach bed process: The influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition","Kullavanijaya P., Chavalparit O.",2019-12-01,"Elephant grass, Hydrolysate, Napier Pak-Chong 1, Process parameters, VFAs, Elephant grass, Hydrolysate, Napier Pak-Chong 1, Process parameter, VFAs","The production of volatile fatty acid (VFA)-rich leachate as feedstock for methane production is an essential and rate-limiting step in two-stage grass biogasification. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition on the acidification of Napier grass in anaerobic leach bed reactors (AnLBRs). Four AnLBRs with 14.17 L effective volume were operated at ambient temperature for 28 days in each experiment. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of the control parameters, particularly leachate dilution and inoculum, in the regulation of grass solubilization. Different dilutions of leachate produced different grass degradation rates. These different dilutions generated 95.62-112.63 g of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) or 0.52-0.62 g SCOD/g VSadded for those diluted at 1.0-7.0-day intervals compared to 51.50 g SCOD or 0.28 g SCOD/g VSadded for those without dilution. Adding inoculums of 10-30% increased the SCOD to 67.01-115.65 g SCOD or 0.40-0.59 g SCOD/g VSadded. While leachate recirculation and the addition of a buffering agent had less influence on solubilization, which increased by only 6.80-16.41% of SCOD produced. These produced leachates contained orderly acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The proposed conditions (20% of added inoculum and leachate dilution at a 3.0-day interval), yielded practical degrees of solubilization and acidification of 46.61% and 62.21%, respectively, or 0.56 g SCOD/g VSadded and 0.26 g VFA/g VSadded. These results demonstrate that beneficial control conditions can promote the rapid and practical production of VFAs from grass biomass via an AnLBR.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
"A class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is associated with salt stress tolerance in a halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp.

The distinct physiological roles of FBAs in various organisms have been reported; however, in cyanobacteria, the functional characterization of FBAs and investigation of the intracellular dynamics of FBAs largely remains unknown. Here, we utilized a two-step chromatographic technique to identify a class I FBA (CI-FBA), which we named H2846. H2846 was induced by salt stress in the halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece 7418). Phylogenetic analysis showed that H2846-like CI–FBAs existed mainly in cyanobacterial species that inhabit hypersaline environments. Subcellular fractionation revealed that H2846 localized in the cytosolic and periplasmic spaces and size-exclusion chromatography suggested that H2846 formed a homohexamer. The CI-FBA activity of recombinant H2846-mediated cleavage of fructose bisphosphate (FBP) was characterized using a coupled enzymatic assay. This analysis allowed us to determine the Km and Vmax values of recombinant H2846, which were then compared to previously reported Km and Vmax values of several FBAs. Our data suggested that H2846 was likely responsible for the salt stress-induced CI-FBA activity from the total soluble protein extracts derived from Halothece 7418 cells. Moreover, heterologous expression of H2846 but not H2847, a class II FBA (CII-FBA), conferred salt stress tolerance to the salt-sensitive freshwater cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which only contains the CII-FBA, S1443. S. elongatus PCC 7942 with a S1443 gene deletion was complemented by H2847 expression, but was not complemented by expression of H2846. Taken together, these results indicate the functional differences between two distinct sets of FBAs in cyanobacteria. H2846 is an active CI-FBA that contributes to the mechanism of salt stress tolerance in Halothece 7418.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

This study was carried out to examine the association between TRYCAT patterning, memory impairments, psychopathological features and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in schizophrenia. The World Health Organization (WHO) QoL instrument-Abbreviated version (WHO-QoL-BREF), IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, cognitive tests, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Hamilton and Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) Rating Scales and the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale (FF) were measured in 80 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. Neural Network analysis shows that the total HR-Qol score is best predicted by (in descending order) HAMA, FF, HAMD, and psychosis. Partial least Squares (PLS) analysis shows that 56.7% of the variance in the WHO-QoL scores is explained by PHEMN / DAPS symptoms, while 64.3% of the variance in those symptoms is explained by TRYCAT patterning and episodic/semantic memory impairments. IgA responses to picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (all negatively) and anthranilic acid (positively) have highly significant indirect effects on WHO-QoL scores, which are completely mediated by cognitive impairments and PHEMN / DAPS symptoms. The results show that lowered HR-Qol in schizophrenia is strongly associated with noxious TRYCATs and that these effects are mediated by impairments in episodic / semantic memory and schizophrenia phenomenology, especially physio-somatic and anxiety symptoms. Mucosal activation of the TRYCAT pathway combined with a deficit in natural IgM isotype antibodies to TRYCATs determine cognitive impairments and DAPS/PHEMN symptoms, which together determine to a large extent lowered HR-QoL in schizophrenia.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Materials and methods: In this prospective longitudinal study, we included consecutive patients with or without glaucoma, either with open or with narrow angles but without peripheral anterior synechiae, who underwent phacoemulsification. Clinical factors and anterior segment parameters measured with optical biometry and optical coherence tomography were evaluated as preoperative predictors for IOP reduction at 6 months postoperatively. To find the best combinations of predictors, model selection was conducted using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator regression with cross-validation. Results: A total of 156 eyes from 109 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 74.89 (±8.54) years and the average preoperative IOP was 15.6 (±3.68) mmHg with 0.7 (range 0–4) glaucoma medications. The mean IOP reduction after phaco was 3.1 (±2.49) mmHg at postoperative month 6. After multivariate analysis, preoperative IOP (β = 0.49 [0.4–0.59] P < .0001), gonioscopy score (β = −0.14 [−0.23 to −0.06] P = .0001), anterior chamber depth (β = −0.85 [−1.64 to −0.07] P = 0.033), lens thickness (LT) (β = 0.87 [0.12–1.62] P = .024), and angle open distance 750 (β = −2.2 [−3.96 to −0.44] P = 0.014) were associated with IOP reduction. The best formula to correlate with IOP reduction was −4.76 + (0.46 × preoperative IOP) – (0.42 × LT) – (0.1 × gonioscopy score) – (0.66 × glaucoma status). Conclusion: Different formulas were developed and were able to improve the predictive value of the preoperative IOP. When used in combination, these formulas may help the clinician to know how much IOP reduction to expect after cataract surgery at 6 months postoperatively.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Critical Comments on EEG Sensor Space Dynamical Connectivity Analysis,"Van de Steen F., Faes L., Karahan E., Songsiri J., Valdes-Sosa P.A., Marinazzo D.",2019-07-30,"Brain Mapping, Computer Simulation, Electroencephalography, Humans, Brain connectivity, Directed transfer function, EEG, Granger causality, MVAR","Many different analysis techniques have been developed and applied to EEG recordings that allow one to investigate how different brain areas interact. One particular class of methods, based on the linear parametric representation of multiple interacting time series, is widely used to study causal connectivity in the brain. However, the results obtained by these methods should be interpreted with great care. The goal of this paper is to show, both theoretically and using simulations, that results obtained by applying causal connectivity measures on the sensor (scalp) time series do not allow interpretation in terms of interacting brain sources. This is because (1) the channel locations cannot be seen as an approximation of a source’s anatomical location and (2) spurious connectivity can occur between sensors. Although many measures of causal connectivity derived from EEG sensor time series are affected by the latter, here we will focus on the well-known time domain index of Granger causality (GC) and on the frequency domain directed transfer function (DTF). Using the state-space framework and designing two simulation studies we show that mixing effects caused by volume conduction can lead to spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF. Therefore, GC/DTF causal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or derived within analysis frameworks that model the effects of volume conduction. Since mixing effects can also occur in the source space, it is advised to combine source space analysis with connectivity measures that are robust to mixing.","genergyal, medical, Health Professions, neuroscience","Anatomy, Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Methods: A literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases from inception through April 2019. Pooled incidence with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42019131833). Results: Thirteen studies consisting of 10,587 patients undergoing HSCT were enrolled in this systematic review. Overall, the pooled estimated incidence of all types of arrhythmias following HSCT was 7.2% (95% CI: 4.9%-10.5%). With respect to the most common type of arrhythmia, the pooled estimated incidence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) within 30 days following HSCT was 4.2% (95% CI: 1.7%-9.6%). Egger's regression test demonstrated no significant publication bias in this meta-analysis of post-HSCT arrhythmia incidence. Conclusion: The overall estimated incidence of arrhythmias following HSCT was 7.2%.

We sought to understand associations between patient-reported perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of PD and clinical outcomes. Methods: In this cohort study, 2760 PD patients in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS) completed a questionnaire on their PD experience, between 2014 and 2017. In this questionnaire, PDOPPS patients rated 17 aspects of their PD experience on a 5-category ordinal scale, with responses scored from - 2 (major disadvantage) to + 2 (major advantage). An advantage/disadvantage score (ADS) was computed for each patient by averaging their response scores. The ADS, along with each of these 17 aspects, were used as exposures. Outcomes included mortality, transition to hemodialysis (HD), patient-reported quality of life (QOL), and depression. Cox regression was used to estimate associations between ADS and mortality, transition to HD, and a composite of the two. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used to estimate cross-sectional associations of ADS with QOL and depression. Results: While 7% of PD patients had an ADS < 0 (negative perception of PD), 59% had an ADS between 0 and < 1 (positive perception), and 34% had an ADS ≥1 (very positive perception). Minimal association was observed between mortality and the ADS. Compared with a very positive perception, patients with a negative perception had a higher transition rate to HD (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21, 2.30). Among individual items, ""space taken up by PD supplies"" was commonly rated as a disadvantage and had the strongest association with transition to HD (HR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.07, 1.53). Lower ADS was strongly associated with worse QOL rating and greater depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Although patients reported a generally favorable perception of PD, patient-reported disadvantages were associated with transition to HD, lower QOL, and depression. Strategies addressing these disadvantages, in particular reducing solution storage space, may improve patient outcomes and the experience of PD.",medical,Nephrology

The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, sociology, computer science","Modeling and Simulation, Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Human-Computer Interaction"

The PaHIV sample were randomized to initiate combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) when CD4 counts were 15–24% (immediate: n = 22) or when CD4 < 15% (deferred: n = 21). Follow-up scans were acquired approximately 52 weeks after baseline. Volumetric and shape descriptors capturing local thickness and surface area dilation were defined for the bilateral accumbens, amygdala, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus. Regression models adjusting for clinical and demographic variables examined between and within group differences in morphometry associated with HIV. We assessed whether baseline CD4 count and cART status or timing associated with brain maturation within the PaHIV group. All models were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. A pallidal subregion was significantly thinner in children with PaHIV. Regional thickness, surface area, and volume of the pallidum was associated with CD4 count in children with PaHIV. Longitudinal morphometry was not associated with HIV or cART status or timing, however, the trajectory of the left pallidum volume was positively associated with baseline CD4 count. Our findings corroborate reports in adult cohorts demonstrating a high predilection for HIV-mediated abnormalities in the basal ganglia, but suggest the effect of stable PaHIV infection on morphological aspects of brain development may be subtle.","medical, neuroscience","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Cognitive Neuroscience"

Moderate/high disability and disability progression were best predicted by sTNFR1 and age (positively) and ProgMS were best predicted by sTNFR1 (positively) and sTNFR2 (negatively), coupled with age and sex. A composite score reflecting the sTNFR1/sTNFR2 ratio showed a positive association with ProgMS after adjusting for age and sex. Conclusion: Increased sTNFR1 and age were positively associated with disability and disability progression, whereas increased sTNFR1 (positively) and sTNFR2 (negatively) were associated with ProgMS, suggesting a distinct role of them in the immunopathological mechanisms of MS.","Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology, Pharmacology"
Towards semi-synthetic microbial communities: Enhancing soy sauce fermentation properties in B. subtilis co-cultures,"Det-Udom R., Gilbert C., Liu L., Prakitchaiwattana C., Ellis T., Ledesma-Amaro R.",2019-06-03,"Bacillus subtilis, Coculture Techniques, Fermentation, Industrial Microbiology, Metabolic Engineering, Microbiota, Polymers, Soy Foods, Soybeans, Synthetic Biology, Xylose, Industrial microbiome, Metabolic engineering, Soy sauce, Synthetic biology, Synthetic microbial communities","Background: Many fermented foods and beverages are produced through the action of complex microbial communities. Synthetic biology approaches offer the ability to genetically engineer these communities to improve the properties of these fermented foods. Soy sauce is a fermented condiment with a vast global market. Engineering members of the microbial communities responsible for soy sauce fermentation may therefore lead to the development of improved products. One important property is the colour of soy sauce, with recent evidence pointing to a consumer preference for more lightly-coloured soy sauce products for particular dishes. Results: Here we show that a bacterial member of the natural soy sauce fermentation microbial community, Bacillus, can be engineered to reduce the 'browning' reaction during soy sauce production. We show that two approaches result in 'de-browning': engineered consumption of xylose, an important precursor in the browning reaction, and engineered degradation of melanoidins, the major brown pigments in soy sauce. Lastly, we show that these two strategies work synergistically using co-cultures to result in enhanced de-browning. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential of using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering methods for fine-tuning the process of soy sauce fermentation and indeed for many other natural food and beverage fermentations for improved products.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from a first-line NNRTI or boosted PI-based regimens to RPV-based regimens among virologically suppressed participants in resource-limited setting (RLS). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. Participants with plasma HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL receiving cART were switched from a PI- or NNRTI-based, to a RPV-based regimen between January 2011 and April 2018. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA level < 50 copies/mL after 12 months of RPV. The secondary endpoint was the virological response at 24 months and safety endpoint (change in lipid profiles and kidney function from baseline to 12 months). Results: A total of 320 participants were enrolled into the study. The rationale for switching to RPV was based on toxicity of the current regimen (57%) or desire to simplify cART (41%). Totally, 177 (55%) and 143 (45%) participants were on NNRTI and boosted PI, respectively, prior to switching to RPV. After 12 months, 298 (93%) participants maintained virological suppression. There were significant improvements in the lipid parameters: TC (− 21 (IQR − 47 to 1) mg/dL; p < 0.001), LDL (− 14 (IQR − 37 to 11) mg/dL; p < 0.001) and TG (− 22 (IQR − 74 to 10) mg/dL; p < 0.001). Also, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in eGFR (− 4.3 (IQR − 12 to 1.1) mL/min per 1.73m2; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In RLS where integrase inhibitors are not affordable, RPV-based regimens are a good alternative option for PLHIV who cannot tolerate first-line NNRTI or boosted PI regimen, without prior NNRTI/PI resistance.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Virology, Pharmacology (medical)"
"Increased chewing reduces energy intake, but not postprandial glucose and insulin, in healthy weight and overweight young adults","Borvornparadorn M., Sapampai V., Champakerdsap C., Kurupakorn W., Sapwarobol S.",2019-02-01,"Adult, Blood Glucose, Body Mass Index, Body Weight, Cross-Over Studies, Eating, Energy Intake, Feeding Behavior, Female, Humans, Insulin, Male, Mastication, Meals, Obesity, Overweight, Postprandial Period, Young Adult, bodyweight, caloric intake, chewing","Aim: This randomised cross-over design study aimed to investigate different chewing activities between healthy weight and overweight individuals and to determine the effect of chewing on energy intake and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: Forty-one participants were classified into healthy weight and overweight groups according to body mass index (BMI). In Phase I, bite size (g/bite), bite rate (bites/minutes), chewing frequency (chews/minutes) and chews (chews/g food) were recorded after a sandwich breakfast. In Phase II, the mass of a sandwich consumed after 15 and 50 chews per bite (results of Phase I) was recorded. Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin were also examined at 0 (baseline), 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes. Results: The results showed that the number of chews per bite was higher in lean participants as compared to overweight participants. Energy intake was highest in overweight participants who chewed 15 times per bite. Additionally, participants consumed less energy after 50 chews regardless of their BMI status. The results also demonstrated that 50 chews per bite insignificantly increased plasma insulin concentrations at every time point in both lean and obese subjects. Insulin concentrations were not significantly changed at each time point regardless of the number of chews. Conclusions: Overweight participants chewed less and ingested more calories. Chewing 50 times per bite could reduce caloric intake regardless of weight status, suggesting that slow eating via increased chewing may help to reduce energy intake during meals. However, chewing did not affect postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels in healthy young adults.",Nursing,Nutrition and Dietetics

Nevertheless, very few studies have assessed this association in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this cross-sectional survey, we investigated the association of cannabis use and suicidal attempts in adolescents from 21 LMICs, adjusting for potential confounders. Method: Data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey was analyzed in 86,254 adolescents from 21 countries [mean (SD) age = 13.7 (0.9) years; 49.0% girls]. Suicide attempts during past year and cannabis during past month and lifetime were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The overall prevalence of past 30-day cannabis use was 2.8% and the age-sex adjusted prevalence varied from 0.5% (Laos) to 37.6% (Samoa), while the overall prevalence of lifetime cannabis use was 3.9% (range 0.5%–44.9%). The overall prevalence of suicide attempts during the past year was 10.5%. Following multivariable adjustment to potential confounding variables, past 30-day cannabis use was significantly associated with suicide attempts (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.42–2.91). Lifetime cannabis use was also independently associated with suicide attempts (OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.74–3.04). Conclusion: Our data indicate that cannabis use is associated with a greater likelihood for suicide attempts in adolescents living in LMICs. The causality of this association should be confirmed/refuted in prospective studies to further inform public health policies for suicide prevention in LMICs.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

Methods: We conducted an Excel®-based budget impact model to estimate the preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer cases identified, mortality rate, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of two strategies from the healthcare payer perspective. The study population is a cohort of women 30-65 years of age presenting for cervical screening. Results: HPV primary screening triage with p16/Ki-67 dual stain showed higher sensitivity without losing specificity compared to conventional Pap smear. The improving the screening performance leads to decrease the prevalence of precancerous lesion, annual incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer case detected by new algorithm compared with conventional method were 31,607 and 38,927, respectively. In addition, the new algorithm was more effective and more costly (average QALY 24.03, annual cost $13,262,693) than conventional cytology (average QALY 23.98, annual cost $7,713,251). The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) per QALY gained was $1,395. The sensitivity analysis showed if the cost of cytology and HPV test increased three times, the ICER would fall to $303/QALY gained and increased to $4,970/QALY gained, respectively. Conclusion: Our model results suggest that screening by use of HPV genotyping test as a primary screening test combined with dual stain cytology as the triage of HPV positive women in Thai population 30-65 years old is expected to be more cost-effective than conventional Pap cytology.",medical,"Oncology, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

The structural morphology and crystalline nature of the synthesized catalyst was determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Three of the vital reaction parameters such as temperature, holding time and catalyst dosage were optimized through central composite design. A maximum bio-oil yield of 32.33% was observed for the high temperature at 320 °C, 0.75 g of catalyst dosage and 37 min of resident time. The maximum conversion was found at a lower temperature of 272 °C, the bio-oil yield of 27.66% was obtained with 0.45 g of catalyst dosage and 24 min of holding time which is an energy efficient optimum condition. The maximum bio-oil yield was influenced at a lower temperature due to the high catalytic activity. While compared to higher temperatures were not much influence was observed. It clearly states that the catalyst dosage playing a critical role in the lower temperature HTL reaction. GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of the produced bio-oil exhibits significant characteristics for biofuel applications. The Fe3O4 catalyst was recyclable for up to eight repeated cycles and constant bio-oil yield for the last four cycles. It shows the excellent reproduction ability towards HTL of Spirulina sp.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology; energygy, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"

Thermistor sensors were employed to control temperature on both components. From the tests, our temperature control system could stabilize the temperatures of both the syringe and the cold-bed within 2 oC. No significantly unstable temperature during the printing process was observed. The printing procedure was designed and validated as it could create the dot of the gelatin/fibroblast cell bioink on a glass slide with high percentage of viable cells.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Mechanical Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Methods: The 110 zirconia specimens size 5 × 5 × 1 mm were fabricated and randomly divided into 5 surface treated groups: Non-contaminated (PC) Saliva and silicone disclosing medium contaminated without cleansing (NC) Surface contaminated and cleansing with Phosphoric acid (PO) Ivoclean (IC) or Hydrofluoric acid (HF). The twenty of each surface treated specimens were selected and bonded with Panavia F2.0 (P) and Superbond C&B (S) for SBS test (n = 10). The data was analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis H and Mann–Whitney U test. The remaining specimens of each surface treated groups were examined by SEM and XRD. Results: The saliva and silicone disclosing medium contaminated zirconia without cleansing group (PNC) had the lowest SBS when Panavia F2.0 was used for cementation (p < 0.05). The SBS of surface cleansing groups (PPO, PIC and PHF) were not different from the non-contaminated group (PPC) (p > 0.05). However, there were no difference in SBS among groups when cementation with Superbond C&B (SPC, SNC, SPO, SIC and SHF) (p > 0.05). There was no morphologic changing that could be observed by SEM. The XRD showed little phase transformation when surfaces were contaminated and cleaned. Conclusions: The saliva and silicone disclosing medium contaminated zirconia should be cleaned with Phosphoric acid, Ivoclean or Hydrofluoric acid for 20 s prior to cementation with Panavia F2.0.

In this paper, we propose a control method to assist human-steering in order to improve the steering feel by using advanced process control with affinity to autonomous machine-steering. The proposed design is used to manipulate the steering angle so as to follow the reference steering angle while minimizing the quadratic cost function. The proposed control framework consists of three controllers: model predictive control (MPC), nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO), and reference generator. The MPC makes the steering angle follow the reference steering angle generated from the reference angle generator. The NDO estimates steering torque and disturbances from road such as self-aligning torque. The reference generator provides reference steering angle from the assist map and steering torque. We also describe how to adjust the cost function to design the steering feel.

Wastewater samples were collected from a printing factory located in Chao Phraya river basin where zero liquid-discharge standards are regulated. The FO filtration unit was operated in co-current mode with the cross-flow velocity of 600 mL/min using 2 M NaCl as draw solution. The FO membrane achieved 83.9-91.0% chemical oxygen demand and 91.2-99.9% color rejections. FO filtration of raw wastewater, coagulation-treated wastewater, and coagulation and adsorption-treated wastewater resulted in 56.3%, 49.0% and 46.1% of flux decline in 150 min. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry results revealed that cake formation caused by colloidal particles and pore blocking from precipitation were the major fouling mechanisms. Cake-enhanced concentration polarization also promoted adsorption of color and pigments at the membrane surface. Both fouling mechanisms were successfully mitigated by adsorption following coagulation pretreatment. Overall, the combined pretreatments and FO have potential for the effective treatment and reuse of ink printing wastewater.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; physicsical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

In all methods, detection was based on the complexation reaction of Cr(VI) with diphenylcarbazide on the μPADs. Cr(III) ions were oxidized to Cr(VI) by Ce(IV) prior to colorimetric detection on the μPADs. In the first method, oxidization of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the solution containing both trivalent and hexavalent chromium was performed using a batch procedure to obtain total chromium. A dual electromembrane extraction (DEME) technique for simultaneous preconcentration and extraction of chromium species and a single electromembrane extraction (SEME) for preconcentration and extraction of Cr(VI)/total chromium [quantified as Cr(VI) content after oxidation of Cr(III) ions to Cr(VI)] were used in the second and third methods, respectively. The electromembrane extraction was based on the electrokinetic migration of cationic Cr(III) and anionic Cr(VI) toward the cathode and anode, respectively, into the two different hollow fibres. Octanol-1 and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (DEHP) in octanol-1 (0.7% v/v) were the most suitable supported liquid membranes for extraction of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively. Among these methods, SEME showed the lowest limits of detection for both analytes. Under optimized conditions, linear calibrations were obtained for Cr(III) from 3 to 30 μg L−1 and for Cr(VI) from 3 to 70 μg L−1. The detection limits were 1.0 μg L−1 and 0.7 μg L−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. Our developed method was applied to analyse water samples spiked with different concentrations of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level.

Sales forecasting using ontology,"Taychatanompong A., Vatanawood W.",2019-01-01,"Additional datum, Data-sources, Ontology model, Ontology technology, Population data, Product sales, Relational Database, Sales forecasting, Ontology, Sales forecasting","—Sales forecasting typically uses relational database to collect the past sales information for the sales data analysis. The sales data alone may not be sufficient to infer what and why a particular product was sold during any particular time period. We intend to demonstrate how the relevant data sources are additionally connected and utilized on demands. We propose an alternative data model using the ontology technology to demonstrate the relationships among sales data, climate data, and population data. Our resulting ontology model for sales forecasting shows the correlations of multiple dimensional raw data and helps the marketing officer plan when and how to launch the promotion of the product sales. We develop a sufficient software tool to demonstrate our ontology model containing the past sales data, the climate and population data. The resulting test cases shows that the additional data to the sales data is usefully and flexibly handled using the ontology model.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

Methods: A double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial was conducted. Seventy postmenopausal women with low sexual function were randomized into two groups. They received weekly 50 mg of transdermal testosterone plus daily oral 1 mg estradiol valerate or only estrogen for 8 weeks. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, hematocrit, liver enzymes, lipid profiles, total testosterone, free and bioavailable testosterone, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and endometrial thickness were assessed before and after treatment. Results: After 8 weeks, the FSFI score significantly improved in both groups. However, the change of FSFI score in the testosterone group was significantly higher than in the only estrogen group, 7.2 ± 5.5 and 4.6 ± 3.9, respectively (p = 0.02). There were significantly increased serum total testosterone levels, but not the free or bioavailable form, in the testosterone group. There was no significant difference in serum SHBG levels after treatment between both groups. There was no serious adverse effect, only acne was found. Conclusion: The addition of low-dose testosterone gel to daily estrogen may improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, but further evaluation and safety data are needed.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology

However, the incidence and maternal/fetal outcomes of AF in pregnancy remain unclear. This study's aims were to investigate the pooled incidence of AF in pregnant women and to assess maternal/fetal outcomes of AF in pregnancy. Material and methods: A literature search for studies that reported incidence of AF in pregnancy, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database from inception through May 2018. Pooled incidence with 95%CI were calculated using a random-effect model. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42018095955). Results: We identified 7 cohort studies including 301,638 pregnancies. The pooled estimated incidence of AF in pregnancy among women with no known heart disease, and those with structural heart disease was 0.3% (95%CI: 0.01%–40.6%) and 2.2% (95%CI: 0.96%–5.01%), respectively. Among women with known AF, the pooled estimated incidence of recurrent AF in pregnancy was 39.2% (95%CI: 16.9%–67.2%). The pooled estimated incidence of pre-eclampsia and congestive heart failure among pregnant patients with AF was 4.1% (95%CI: 2.1%–7.8%) and 9.6% (95%CI: 5.7%–15.9%), respectively. The pooled estimated incidence of fetal events including premature birth, small for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, death was 26.6% (95%CI: 20.4%–34.0%). Conclusion: The overall estimated incidence of AF and recurrent AF during pregnancy is as high as 2.2% and 39.2%, respectively.

Evaluation of dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction by coupling with green-based agarose gel-electromembrane extraction: An efficient method to the tandem extraction of basic drugs from biological fluids,"Tabani H., Shokri A., Tizro S., Nojavan S., Varanusupakul P., Alexovic M.",2019-07-01,"Basic drugs, Biological fluids, Detection and quantifications, Electromembrane extractions, Extraction solvents, Extraction/separation, Microextraction, Optimized conditions, Chromatography, Gas, Clomipramine, Gels, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Liquid Phase Microextraction, Sepharose, Trimipramine, Basic drugs, Biological fluids, Dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction, Gel electromembrane extraction, Green-based extraction","Nowadays, developing new methods for the effective extraction/separation of drugs (present at trace levels) from complicated matrices (as biological fluids) is certainly a great challenge for many operators. In this regard, green-based agarose gel electromembrane extraction (G-EME) was for the first time combined with dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) toward G-EME/DLLME methodology (i.e., tandem extraction approach). Two basic drugs such as trimipramine (TRI) and clomipramine (CLO) extracted from the urine samples, were used as model compounds. Regarding method workflow, analytes were extracted from the 5 mL sample, through a synthesized agarose gel membrane, to the 700 µL aqueous acceptor phase under the optimized conditions (pH of acceptor phase: 2.0; pH of gel membrane: 2.0; pH of donor phase: 4.0, voltage value: 30 V, and extraction time: 25 min). In the next step, acceptor solution was poured to a conic vial and mixed with 100 µL alkaline solution (NaOH, 1 M). Afterwards, DLLME procedure took place again at optimal conditions, i.e., extraction solvent was carbon tetrachloride (10 µL), and dispersive solvent was acetone (100 µL). Ultimately, gas chromatography (GC) was applied for the detection and quantification of drugs. Such G-EME/DLLME configuration has brought two main advantages. Firstly, interferences such as proteins and other large biological molecules were eliminated from biological fluids via G-EME. Further, high enrichment factors (EFs of 260–370 refer to extraction recoveries of 52–74%) were obtained using DLLME with acceptable detection limits (1.0–3.0 ng mL−1). Finally, the suggested approach was successfully utilized to determine drugs at trace levels in urine samples.","mixing and separation, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Globally, HPV genotypes 6 and 11 are most often associated with anogenital warts. However, the diversity of HPV genotypes found in patients with genital warts in Thailand is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate HPV-associated anogenital warts in the Thai population and to assess whether genotypes found are represented in the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Methods: This study included 206 anogenital swab samples from patients who were diagnosed with anogenital warts. Detection of HPV DNA was performed using polymerase chain reaction to amplify the L1 gene and sequencing. Results: HPV was identified in 88.3% (182/206) of the samples. The majority of HPV genotypes were low-risk genotypes HPV6 (36.9%) and HPV11 (36.4%), which represented the most common infection found in genital warts in this study. Conclusion: Immunization with the quadrivalent vaccine (HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18) could potentially prevent genital warts caused by HPV infection.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Its current demand fluctuates largely due to the fast growing nature of business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) in Thailand. The company confronts a continuously increased amount of delayed deliveries resulting from the rising demand and insufficient existing resources. Opening more depots in high demand areas did not improve overall productivity for the company. One of the causes is the inappropriate allocation of postal codes for each depot. Some depots cannot handle the delivery demand while other depots are over capacitated. Re-clustering postal code allocations and determining proper number of vehicles deem necessary. The first phase of this work is to re-cluster postal code allocation using existing demand points to prove that the proposed cluster outperforms with the metric in percentage of delayed volumes. Unlike well-established companies, short term future demand for this company keeps changing; thus, future demand forecast is necessary and in this case ARIMA models are appropriate. This demand volume is the basis to determine appropriate number of vehicles coping with increasing demand. The result shows that applying this work slightly decreases the average percentage of mismatch from 15.76% to 14.73%. However, the percentages of mismatch of demand and depot capacity in all depots comply with the 30% constraint and the percentage of delayed volume complies with the 5% constraint.","management, fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering, Mathematics, physics","Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization, Instrumentation"

The study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity against human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and to evaluate drug permeation. In the case of cytotoxicity, HCECs were treated with drug solution, analyzed for percent viability. For permeation study, the modified-franz diffusion method was used to study permeation partition coefficient of lidocaine solution; moreover, the drug retained on the sclera was also determined. HCECs were treated with lidocaine solutions with the concentration range of 0.781-100 g/L. Significantly decrease in cell viability with the concentration above 12 g/L was detected by Resazurin metabolic rate assay. The permeation coefficient of lidocaine hydrochloride solution could not be determined because of drug absence in the receptor chamber. The entire drug loaded remained in the donor chamber and adsorbed on the surface of sclera tissue. The results suggested that topical lidocaine solution showed reasonably safe and lidocaine drops did not absorbed through the sclera. In present study, local topical anesthetic delivery of lidocaine was considered safe for ophthalmologic treatment.","bioengineeringneering and biology, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Potassium citrate compound is used to prevent stone recurrence but it has intolerable gastrointestinal adverse effects. We conducted a phase 2 clinical study of lime power regimen (LPR), a limeade-based supplement containing potassium and citrate for 6 months period of treatment, to evaluate its effects on biochemical and clinical aspects of recurrent urolithiasis. Methods: Seventy-four urolithiasis patients were randomly allocated to receive either LPR or placebo for 6 months in a double-blinded manner. Plasma and 24 h urine samples were collected to measure urinary pH, mineral excretion and urinary total antioxidant status, plasma for creatinine and plasma protein carbonyl, and stone for elemental analysis at the initiation and end-of-treatment (6 month). Adverse effects were recorded. Results: Administration of LPR significantly increased urinary pH, citrate and potassium excretion. Urinary levels of calcium and oxalate, and plasma protein carbonyl content were reduced, while urinary total antioxidant status was elevated by LPR treatment. Urinary supersaturation was decreased and urinary protein excretion was ameliorated in LPR-treated patients. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were rarely observed. None of the participants developed stone recurrence for the duration of the trial. Conclusion: Lime power regimen is a potential drug to correct urinary metabolic disorders associated with urolithiasis in high risk stone recurrent patients.

Mendelian inheritance of endogenous viral elements (EVE) of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in shrimp,"Taengchaiyaphum S., Srisala J., Bunphimpapha P., Supungul P., Tassanakajon A., Chaiyapechara S., Bowornpinyo S., Sritunyalucksana K., Flegel T.W.",2019-07-01,"Animals, Chromosomes, DNA, Viral, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Inheritance Patterns, Penaeidae, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Virus Diseases, White spot syndrome virus 1, Endogenous viral elements, EVE, Mendelian inheritance, White spot syndrome virus, WSSV","Previous work has shown that non-retroviral endogenous viral elements (EVE) are common in crustaceans, including penaeid shrimp. So far, they have been reported for infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). For the latter, it was shown that shrimp sperm were positive for an EVE of WSSV called EVE 366 , suggesting that it was heritable, since shrimp sperm (non-motile) do not contain mitochondria. However, to prove this hypothesis that EVE 366 was heritable and located in chromosomal DNA, it was necessary to carry out mating tests to show that EVE 366 could be detected in parental shrimp and distributed in their offspring in a Mendelian fashion. To do this, we analyzed two shrimp crosses using polyacrylamide gels with a multiple-allele, microsatellite marker Pmo11 as a quality control for single allele detection. In both crosses, all of the shrimp (parents and siblings) were positive for 2 Pmo11 alleles as expected. In Cross 1, the female was PCR-positive for EVE 366 while the male was negative, and in Cross 2, both the female and male were PCR-positive for EVE 366 . Individual analysis of the offspring of Cross 1 revealed a distribution of 1:1 for EVE 366 , indicating that the EVE 366 -positive female parent was heterozygous for EVE 366 . In the second cross, the distribution of EVE 366 in the offspring was 3:1, indicating that both PCR-positive parents were heterozygous for EVE 366 . These results supported the hypothesis that EVE 366 was present in shrimp chromosomal DNA and was heritable in a Mendelian fashion. This work provides a model to screen for heritable EVE in shrimp and shows that selection of one parent heterozygous for an EVE and the other negative for it can result in approximately half of the siblings positive and half negative for that EVE as expected. Dividing the siblings of such a cross into an EVE positive group and an EVE negative group followed by challenge with the originating lethal virus should reveal whether or not possession of that specific EVE results in any significant protection against disease caused by the homologous virus.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial diseases and parasites; diseases of aquatic organisms, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

The class of models used to predict the behavior of the battery are as follows: linear transfer function and nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) model. Model parameter estimation was implemented in MATLAB and the response data test was categorized into three sections including single-step, multi-step and random-step responses. With respect to single-step response, both the transfer function and HW model were able to predict the response curve. As expected, the linear model exhibited lower accuracy than the nonlinear model. For multi-step and random-step responses with various step-size, the linear model cannot cope with the experimental behavior and is not able to provide accurate prediction of battery dynamics. One of the first conclusions of the study was that the nonlinear characteristic of the battery cannot be ignored, and the linear model might be inappropriate to predict the dynamic behavior of the battery. The second result was that the nonlinear model with a classic structure was able to predict the response with various step size precisely. Results implied that the HW model proved to be a versatile choice for use within a zinc-air battery system.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, coastal engineering, computer science, engineering","Modeling and Simulation, Control and Optimization, Process Chemistry and Technology, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

However, it is consumable, expensive, and sometimes unavailable in the microsurgical laboratory. To solve this problem, we developed a microsuture made from human hair and needle gauge. Methods: Do-It-Yourself (DIY) microsuture is made from human hair and needle gauge 32G (BD Ultra-Fine Pen Needles 4 mm × 32G). Methods are explained step by step. This DIY microsuture (labeled as test microsuture) and nylon 8-0 (Ethilon suture 8-0, labeled as standard microsuture) were used for teaching orthopaedic residents to perform arterial anastomosis in chicken thighs. All residents practiced without knowing that test microsuture was made from the DIY method. After completing the training, quality of both microsutures was evaluated by questionnaire in topics of (1) thread quality (size, strength, elasticity, handing, knot perform, and knot security), (2) needle quality (size, curve, shape, sharpness, handling, and strength), (3) needle-thread interface (size, strength, and smoothness), and (4) overall quality of microsuture. Each category was evaluated by Likert score (5 = excellent, 4 = good, 3 = fair, 2 = poor, and 1 = very poor). Results: The DIY microsuture was performed in three steps: (1) insert human hair into needle gauge by microforceps, (2) bend needle into smooth curve, and (3) disconnect needle and create needle-hair interface. The questionnaire was completed by 30 orthopaedic residents and showed that thread quality of DIY and standard microsuture had good and good-to-excellent quality (mean Likert score: 3.77-4.23 and 3.80-4.27, respectively, with no statistical difference). Thread-needle interface quality of DIY and standard microsuture also had good and good-to-excellent quality (Likert score: 3.73-4.20 and 4.07-4.33, respectively, with no statistical difference). Needle part of DIY microsuture had lower quality than standard suture (fair-to-good compared with good-to-excellence quality, score 3.30-3.67 vs. 4.20-4.27, respectively, with a statistically significant difference, p-value < 0.05). However, overall quality of DIY suture and standard microsuture had good and good-to-excellent (mean Likert score: 3.73 and 4.00, respectively, with no statistical difference). Conclusion: The DIY microsuture from human hair and needle gauge could be an alternative for basic microsurgical training with lower cost, easy production, and more availability for use in practice with acceptable quality compared with that of standard microsuture.","surgery, medical",Surgery

Computational simulations were undertaken to determine the optimum geometry of 1. Anion sensing studies revealed that selectivity in anion detection depended on the polarity of solvent, acidity of binding unit and basicity of the anion. The ability to sense via naked eye observations using the strong basic anions (F − and CN − ) for both sensors arises from a deprotonation process at the binding sites attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition at the sensory unit. The discrimination of F − from CN − has been achieved by the optimization of solvent polarity. Sensor 1 offers a promising property over sensor 2 with a lower detection limit, a few of anion interference and higher stability.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics","Analytical Chemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Spectroscopy"

Subjects and Methods: This study recruited 70 patients with psoriasis and 76 healthy controls. Cytokine profiles were evaluated, including pro-inflammatory M1 (IL-1 + IL-6 + TNF-α), Th1 (IL-2 + IL-12 + IFN-γ), Th17 (IL-6 + IL-17), and immune-inflammatory response system (IRS = M1 + Th1 + Th17) profiles. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential included Th2 (IL-4), Th2 + T regulatory (Th2 + Treg, namely IL-4 + IL-10 + TGF-β), anti-inflammatory (Th2 + Treg + adiponectin), and the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory index. Results: There was a highly significant association between psoriasis and cytokine levels with an effect size of 0.829 and a particularly strong impact on IL-2 (0.463), IL-12 (0.451), IL-10 (0.532) and adiponectin (0.401). TGF-β and adiponectin were significantly lower while all other cytokines (except IFN-γ) were significantly higher in psoriasis than in controls. In addition, M1, Th1, Th17, Th2 + Treg, and IRS/Anti-inflammatory index were significantly higher in psoriasis patients than in controls. The IRS index, Th2 + Treg, and adiponectin predicted psoriasis with 97.1% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Conclusion: In conclusion, psoriasis is characterized by increased M1, Th1, Th2 and Th17 profiles together with lowered TGF-β and adiponectin. In addition, we propose a model based on a higher IRS and Th2 + Treg index coupled with lower adiponectin values, which may be used to externally validate the diagnosis of psoriasis. The most important single biomarker of psoriasis is adiponectin. Because the latter may play a role in the modulation of the chronic inflammatory response in psoriasis, adiponectin could be a new drug target to treat psoriasis.","Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology, Pharmacology"

The globularization of the protein is quantified by analyzing the scaling of the structure factor. The crossover from globular to random-coil structure involving segmental reorganizations is found to depend on the length scale and the temperature.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics, Statistics and Probability"

Different stationary phase combinations were investigated. An SLB-IL76 1D column results in good separation of the isomers but with negligible interconversion (1Dsep). Precise targeted heart-cuts (H/C; 3–15 s windows) and cryogenic trapping of selected sections eluting from this 1D column allows well controlled E/Z isomer ratios to be delivered to a 2D poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) phase column. This phase catalyses oxime interconversion, with separation; this is termed 2Dinter. This column set describes a 1Dsep × 2Dinter arrangement. The interconversion forward rate constant (k1 UE, calculated by using DCXplorer) was found to be independent of the %E isomer (i.e. first order kinetics); k1 UE increased at higher temperature (increased Gibbs activation energies, ΔGapp). In addition, a long 1D SLB-IL111 column gave oxime separation with interconversion (1Dinter). Comprehensive multiple H/C of the zone performed on the 2D PEG (2Dinter) at 40, 60 and 80 °C resulted in a 2D presentation (1Dinter × 2Dinter) with a unique rectangular display of interconversion from each H/C pulse with varied isomer concentration ratios. Data for k1 UE from 1DGC analysis suggests underestimation of k1 UE on 1Dinter SLB-IL111 from the 2D result. The k1 UE value on 2Dinter PEG column is more reliably evaluated by summation of all the 2Dinter profiles rather than that obtained from the average value for the individual H/C pulses.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

An original control law based on the Hamiltonian energy control principle for dc microgrid is considered. Using the port-controlled Hamiltonian property, we propose simple solutions to the system performance and stabilization problems when the interaction between power sources and constant power loads (CPLs). To corroborate the proposed control law, a prototype FC power converter (2.5-kW two-phase boost converter) is implemented in the laboratory. The Methanol FC system includes a fuel reformer that converts methanol and water liquid fuel into hydrogen gas to polymer electrolyte membrane FC (PEMFC) stack (2.5-kW, 50 V). The proposed control approach is realized with a digital estimate in a dSPACE MicroLabBox controller card. The experimental and simulation results verify that this is a good control scheme during constant power load cycles.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, decision sciences, physics","Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software, Information Systems and Management, Instrumentation"

Methods: Individuals with subacute (N = 23) and chronic LBP (N = 23) with their age- and gender-matched controls (N = 30) participated in this study. All recruited participants were required to perform the CCFT. The activation score (AS) and the performance index (PI) were recorded by an assessor who was blinded to the group of participants. Results: Approximately, 74% of subacute LBP participants and 60–65% of chronic LBP participants obtained abnormal AS and PI. AS was significantly lower in participants with subacute (P = 0.0002) and chronic LBP (P = 0.0009) than the control group. Likewise, the PI was significantly lower in participants with subacute (P = 0.0002) and chronic LBP (P = 0.0036) than the control group. Participants in the subacute LBP group showed significantly greater percentages of abnormal responses on the AS (P < 0.0001) and the PI (P = 0.0001) than the control. Discussion: Abnormal performance of cervical stabilizer muscles using the CCFT was demonstrated in a high proportion of participants with LBP.

We investigated the associations of periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria with spontaneous abortion. Methods: We conducted a matched case-control study in two tertiary hospitals in Khon Kaen, Thailand. Cases were 85 women with spontaneous abortion at <20 weeks of gestation matched to 85 controls on age, gestational age, and hospital. Full-mouth periodontal examinations were performed. Periodontitis was defined as at least one site with probing depth ≥5 mm and clinical attachment level ≥2 mm at the same site. Subgingival plaque samples were collected to determine the levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum using real time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The cases were significantly more likely to have periodontitis (50.6%) than the controls (21.2%; P = 0.007). Conditional logistic regression revealed a crude odds ratio (OR) of 4.1 for the association between periodontitis and spontaneous abortion (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9–8.9, P = 0.001). The OR decreased, but was still significant, after controlling for previous miscarriage (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.4–7.8, P = 0.006). There was no significant association between the levels of periodontopathic bacteria and spontaneous abortion. Increased levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were associated with periodontitis in both case and control groups. Association between increased T. forsythia levels and periodontitis was observed only in the case women. Conclusions: Periodontitis was more common in women with spontaneous abortions as compared with matched controls.

We reasoned that improved efficacy of delivery might be achieved through structural modification of the viral capsid to avoid pre- and postinternalization barriers to mammalian cell transduction. We generated multifunctional hybrid adeno-associated virus/phage (AAVP) particles to enable simultaneous display of targeting ligands on the phage's minor pIII proteins and also degradation-resistance motifs on the very numerous pVIII coat proteins. This genetic strategy of directed evolution bestows a next-generation of AAVP particles that feature resistance to fibrinogen adsorption or neutralizing antibodies and ability to escape endolysosomal degradation. This results in superior gene transfer efficacy in vitro and also in preclinical mouse models of rodent and human solid tumors. Thus, the unique functions of our next-generation AAVP particles enable improved targeted gene delivery to tumor cells.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

To improve the quality of metabolomics data, conventional data processing methods can be employed to remove technical variations. These methods do not consider sources of subject variation as separate factors from biological factors of interest. This can be a significant issue when performing quantitative metabolomics in clinical trials or screening for a potential biomarker in early-stage disease, because changes in metabolism or a desired-metabolite signal are small compared to the total metabolite signals. As a result, inter-individual variability can interfere subsequent statistical analyses. Here, we propose an additional data processing step using linear mixed-effects modelling to readjust an individual metabolite signal prior to multivariate analyses. Published clinical metabolomics data was used to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed method. We observed a substantial reduction in variation of each metabolite signal after model fitting. A comparison with other strategies showed that our proposed method contributed to improved classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we highlight the importance of patient metadata as it contains rich information of subject characteristics, which can be used to model and normalize metabolite abundances.

Green tea is richer in antioxidants compared to other forms of tea. Tea is composed of polyphenols, caffeine, minerals, and trace amounts of vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrates. The composition of the tea varies depending on the fermentation process employed to produce it. The phytochemicals present in green tea are known to stimulate the central nervous system and maintain overall health in humans. Skin aging is a complex process mediated by intrinsic factors such as senescence, along with extrinsic damage induced by external factors such as chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-A process known as photoaging-Which can lead to erythema, edema, sunburn, hyperplasia, premature aging, and the development of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers. UV can cause skin damage either directly, through absorption of energy by biomolecules, or indirectly, by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Green tea phytochemicals are a potent source of exogenous antioxidant candidates that could nullify excess endogenous ROS and RNS inside the body, and thereby diminish the impact of photoaging. Several in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that green tea supplementation increases the collagen and elastin fiber content, and suppresses collagen degrading enzymeMMP-3 production in the skin, conferring an anti-wrinkle effect. The precise mechanism behind the anti-photoaging effect of green tea has not been explored yet. Studies using the wormmodel have suggested that green teamediated lifespan extension depends on the DAF-16 pathway. Apart from this, green tea has been reported to have stress resistance and neuroprotective properties. Its ROS scavenging activity makes it a potent stress mediator, as it can also regulate the stress induced by metal ions. It is known that tea polyphenols can induce the expression of different antioxidant enzymes and hinder the DNA oxidative damage. Growing evidence suggests that green tea can also be used as a potential agent to mediate neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. EGCG, an abundant catechin in tea, was found to suppress the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ as it activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), along with inhibiting c-Abl/FE65-the cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase which is involved in the development of the nervous systemand in nuclear translocation. Additionally, green tea polyphenols induce autophagy, thereby revitalizing the overall health of the organism consuming it. Green tea was able to activate autophagy in HL-60 xenographs by increasing the activity of PI3 kinase and BECLIN-1. This manuscript describes the reported anti-photoaging, stress resistance, and neuroprotective and autophagy properties of one of the most widely known functional foods-green tea.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The highest THMs and HANs were 584 μg/L and 30 μg/L, respectively. Chloroform was the dominant species of the THM pool and trichloroacetonitriles were the dominant species for HANs. Water treatment plants using free chlorine (Thapra and Kota) formed more THMs than the plant using ClO2 (KKU). In the summer season, more brominate THMs were observed. In many locations, total THM concentrations were found to be higher than the drinking water standard of the Provincial Water Authority of Thailand. The concentration of THMs tended to increase with greater distance from the water plants (as water aged), while HAN concentrations decreased with distance, potentially because they were undergoing hydrolysis in the pipeline.","geobase; related topics, environmental",Water Science and Technology

There have been various reports on DMF production from hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, most reports employed high hydrogen pressure, long reaction times, and reactions under batch conditions. In this study, Cu-Pd bimetallic catalysts incorporated on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were used for selective hydrogenation of HMF to DMF using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor under continuous flow conditions. Synthesized catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, TEM, and H2-TPR techniques. 10Cu-1Pd/RGO exhibited 96% HMF conversion with 95% DMF yield under optimum reaction conditions with good stability with time on stream. XRD and XPS results pointed to the presence of a palladium-copper alloy, which could enhance both the activity and especially the stability in the conversion of HMF toward DMF. The effect of temperature, pressure, and feed flow rate were also investigated on the catalytic performance. The stability of catalyst was tested for 8 h time on stream, where it was found that the catalyst displayed good stability.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The traditional approach to identify such women who are at risk is based on risk factors from maternal characteristics, obstetrics, and medical history as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. An alternative approach to screening for preeclampsia has been developed by the Fetal Medicine Foundation. This approach allows the estimation of patient-specific risks of preeclampsia that requires delivery before a specified gestational age with the use of Bayes theorem-based model. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia at 11–13+6 weeks gestation in a large Asian population Study Design: This was a prospective, nonintervention, multicenter study in 10,935 singleton pregnancies at 11–13+6 weeks gestation in 11 recruiting centers across 7 regions in Asia between December 2016 and June 2018. Maternal characteristics and medical, obstetric, and drug history were recorded. Mean arterial pressure and uterine artery pulsatility indices were measured according to standardized protocols. Maternal serum placental growth factor concentrations were measured by automated analyzers. The measured values of mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor were converted into multiples of the median. The Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model was used for the calculation of patient-specific risk of preeclampsia at <37 weeks gestation (preterm preeclampsia) and at any gestation (all preeclampsia) in each participant. The performance of screening for preterm preeclampsia and all preeclampsia by a combination of maternal factors, mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor (triple test) was evaluated with the adjustment of aspirin use. We examined the predictive performance of the model by the use of receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration by measurements of calibration slope and calibration in the large. The detection rate of screening by the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model was compared with the model that was derived from the application of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations. Results: There were 224 women (2.05%) who experienced preeclampsia, which included 73 cases (0.67%) of preterm preeclampsia. In pregnancies with preterm preeclampsia, the mean multiples of the median values of mean arterial pressure and uterine artery pulsatility index were significantly higher (mean arterial pressure, 1.099 vs 1.008 [P<.001]; uterine artery pulsatility index, 1.188 vs 1.063[P=.006]), and the mean placental growth factor multiples of the median was significantly lower (0.760 vs 1.100 [P<.001]) than in women without preeclampsia. The Fetal Medicine Foundation triple test achieved detection rates of 48.2%, 64.0%, 71.8%, and 75.8% at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% fixed false-positive rates, respectively, for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia. These were comparable with those of previously published data from the Fetal Medicine Foundation study. Screening that used the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations achieved detection rate of 54.6% at 20.4% false-positive rate. The detection rate with the use of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline was 26.3% at 5.5% false-positive rate. Conclusion: Based on a large number of women, this study has demonstrated that the Fetal Medicine Foundation Bayes theorem-based model is effective in the prediction of preterm preeclampsia in an Asian population and that this method of screening is superior to the approach recommended by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. We have also shown that the Fetal Medicine Foundation prediction model can be implemented as part of routine prenatal care through the use of the existing infrastructure of routine prenatal care.","genergyal, medical",Obstetrics and Gynecology

While the recognition of cardinal parkinsonian features is usually straightforward, the appreciation of clinical features suggestive of specific parkinsonian disorders can be challenging, and often requires greater experience and skills. In this review, we outline the clinical features that are relevant to the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. We aim to make this process relatable to clinicians-in-practice, therefore, have categorised the list of clinical features into groups according to the typical sequence on how clinicians would elicit them during the examination, starting with observation of facial expression and clinical signs of the face, spotting eye movement abnormalities, examination of tremors and jerky limb movements, and finally, examination of posture and gait dysfunction. This review is not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, we have focused on the most common clinical signs that are potentially key to making the correct diagnosis and those that do not require special skills or training for interpretation. Evidence is also provided, where available, such as diagnostic criteria, consensus statements, clinicopathological studies or large multi-centre registries. Pitfalls are also discussed when relevant to the diagnosis.

The present study demonstrates a label-free detection of DNA using a nanofluidic device based on impedance measurements that is both sensitive and simple to operate. Using this device, the electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis effect on DNA conformation and the length dependence were examined. A low alternating voltage was applied to the nanogap electrodes to generate a high intensity field (>0.5 MV/m) under non-faradaic conditions. In addition, a 100 nm thick gold electrode was completely embedded in the substrate to allow direct measurements of a solution containing the sample passing through the gap, without any surface modification required. The high intensity field in this device produced a dielectrophoretic force that stretched the DNA molecule across the electrode gap at a specific frequency, based on back and forth movements between the electrodes with the DNA in a random coil conformation. The characteristics of 100 bp, 500 bp, 1 kbp, 5 kbp, 10 kbp, and 48 kbp λ DNA associated with various conformations were quantitatively analyzed with high resolution (on the femtomolar level). The sensitivity of this system was found to be more than about 10 orders of magnitude higher than that obtained from conventional linear alternating current (AC) impedance for the analysis of bio-polymers. This new high-sensitivity process is expected to be advantageous with regard to the study of complex macromolecules and nanoparticles.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Improvement of the current prediction model creates positive impact on variety of marine activities, such as search-and-rescue, disaster monitoring and power forecasting. Deep learning techniques was successfully deployed to improve model performance in many areas due to their ability to handle enormous amounts of information in a variety of inputs and their huge growth in recent years. Latest ocean current prediction employed a combination of two mature techniques, which are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to capture spatial and temporal characteristics of its nature. However, there is still room for improvement due to many modern techniques that still have not been employed, and domain knowledge in oceanic, such as lunar illumination, is not taken into account to improve prediction performance. This paper introduces the ocean surface prediction model that employs soft attention mechanism, transfer learning, and incorporation of domain knowledge inputs which are month number, lunar effect, and hour number.

Method The Delphi method was used to develop consensus statements through identification of clinical questions on diagnostic endoscopy. Three consensus meetings were conducted to consolidate the statements and voting. We conducted a systematic literature search on evidence for each statement. The statements were presented in the second consensus meeting and revised according to comments. The final voting was conducted at the third consensus meeting on the level of evidence and agreement. Results Risk stratification should be conducted before endoscopy and high risk endoscopic findings should raise an index of suspicion. The presence of premalignant mucosal changes should be documented and use of sedation is recommended to enhance detection of superficial upper GI neoplasms. The use of antispasmodics and mucolytics enhanced visualisation of the upper GI tract, and systematic endoscopic mapping should be conducted to improve detection. Sufficient examination time and structured training on diagnosis improves detection. Image enhanced endoscopy in addition to white light imaging improves detection of superficial upper GI cancer. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging is recommended for characterisation of upper GI superficial neoplasms. Endoscopic characterisation can avoid unnecessary biopsy. Conclusion This consensus provides guidance for the performance of endoscopic diagnosis and characterisation for early gastric and oesophageal neoplasia based on the evidence. This will enhance the quality of endoscopic diagnosis and improve detection of early upper GI cancers.","cancer research; diagnosis and prognosis; endoscopy and associologyated techniques, medical",Gastroenterology

Data were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health Wave 1 (2007–2010) for adults (≥ 65 years) from China, Mexico, Ghana, India, Russia and South Africa (n = 10,892, 52.8% women). We calculated country-specific prevalence of low grip strength, slow GS (≤ 0.8 m/s), and both measures combined. Using multivariable negative binomial regression, we separately assessed associations between low grip strength, slow GS, and both measures combined, with the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, accounting for selected socioeconomic factors. In women, low grip strength ranged from 7 in South Africa to 51% in India; in men, it ranged from 17 in Russia to 51% in Mexico. Country-specific proportions of slow GS ranged from 77 in Russia, to 33% in China. The concomitant presence of both was the lowest in South Africa and the highest in India (12.3% vs. 33%). Independent of age, those with both low grip strength and slow GS had between 1.2- and 1.5-fold worse functional disability scores, independent of comorbidities, low education, and low wealth (all country-dependent). Low grip strength, slow GS, and the combination of both, were all associated with higher levels of functional disability, thus indicating these objective measures offer a reasonably robust estimate for potential poor health outcomes.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Endocrinology"
Circulating turbulent fluidized bed regime on flow regime diagram,"Boonprasop S., Chalermsinsuwan B., Piumsomboon P.",2019-05-15,"Bed expansion, Bubbling fluidized bed, Circulating fluidized bed, Circulating turbulent fluidized bed regime (CTFB), Design parameters, Fast fluidized bed, Flow regimes, Superficial gas velocities, Bed expansion, Circulating turbulent fluidized bed regime (CTFB), Flow regime diagram, Gas – solid fluidization, Multi-phase flow, Regime mapping","Circulating turbulent fluidized bed (CTFB) regime was recently found under a low superficial gas velocity (U g ) system and contained the advantages of both a conventional turbulent fluidized bed, with an excellent mixing property between the gas and solid phases due to the high solid volume fraction (SVF), and a fast fluidized bed (FFB) or circulating fluidized bed (CFB) regime, which could be employed in a continuous mode. To observe the new flow regime, it was conducted in a plexiglas two-dimensional CFB reactor with a riser of 2.00 m height, 0.15 m width and 0.05 m depth. The interpretation of the SVF profiles along the riser height were used to determine the appearance the tubulent bed front where the turbulent bed was terminated. The identification of the CTFB was a profile without the appearance of a bed front in the riser. In conclusion, the development of a CTFB regime was caused by the turbulent bed expansion, which was affected by the magnitude of U g . There were three important criteria to perform a CTFB: a solid recirculating rate of at least 300 kg/m 2 .s, the regulated U g should be between a bubbling fluidized bed (U c ) and FFB (U tr ), and lastly, the most important design parameter, the riser height must be shorter than the maximum turbulent bed expansion, which depends on the choice of solid particles. The functions that showed a good agreement with the experimental results were applied to obtain the correlations that later became the compulsory part of addressing the boundaries for each fluidized bed regime. The advantage of the new flow regime diagram was that it included the aspects of operation and design if CTFB was the desire.","process equipment, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)
Steam reforming of acetic acid for hydrogenproduction: Catalytic performances of Ni and Co supported on Ce0·75Zr0·25O2 catalysts,"Phongprueksathat N., Meeyoo V., Rirksomboon T.",2019-04-05,"C-c bond cleavages, Carbon deposition, Catalytic performance, Catalytic steam reforming, Lower temperatures, Product distributions, Reaction temperature, Temperature range, Acetic acid, Ceria, Cobalt, Nickel, Steam reforming, Zirconia","The catalytic steam reforming of acetic acid over both Ni/ and Co/Ce0·75Zr0·25O2 (CZO) catalysts in the temperature range of 450–650 °C and steam-to-carbon molar ratios of 3–9 was studied. It was found that the complete acetic acid conversion was achieved for all the conditions investigated. Nevertheless, the C–C bond cleavage conversion was attained less than the acetic acid conversion at a given condition due to carbon deposition on the catalyst. However, hydrogen yield was obtained in the same trend as C–C bond cleavage conversion as well. The results revealed that the CZO as an active support prefers to promote the ketonization reaction to the C-C bond cleavage reaction at a lower temperature, and vice versa at a higher temperature. The Ni/CZO catalyst exhibits higher C–C bond cleavage conversion than the Co/CZO catalyst particularly at 650 °C whereas the Co/CZO catalyst is more active for ketonization reaction at low temperatures. However, as an increase in reaction temperature, the Co/CZO catalyst promotes ketonization reaction more pronouncedly toward aldol-condensation reaction thus giving rise to the carbon deposition. The results deduced from the effect of space velocity on the activity and product distribution suggested that the steam reforming of acetic acid over Ni/CZO catalyst is dominated by decomposition of acetic acid, while that of Co/CZO catalyst by ketonization reaction.","heat exchange, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The scaled boundary finite element formulation is established in a general framework allowing single-field and multi-field problems, bounded and unbounded bodies, distributed body source, and general boundary conditions to be treated in a unified fashion. The conventional polar coordinates together with a properly selected scaling center are utilized to achieve the exact description of the circular defining curve, exact geometry of the domain, and exact spatial differential operators. Standard finite element shape functions are employed in the discretization of both trial and test functions in the circumferential direction and the resulting eigenproblem is solved by a selected efficient algorithm. The computational performance of the implemented procedure is then fully investigated for various scenarios to demonstrate the accuracy in comparison with standard linear elements.",engineering,"Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture"

Currently, the lake is faced with serious problems as it is becoming shallow with a consequent decrease in the volume of water. Every year the local government invests a lot of resources to dredge and pump the lake bed of sediments. However, it is difficult to find suitable landfill areas to dump such large quantities of sedimentary soil. The purpose of this study was to improve the engineering properties of sedimentary soil using Portland cement for possible use in road construction. The sedimentary soils were mixed with cement in a 3-10% proportion by weight. The strength and durability of the improved soil were examined using unconfined compression and durability tests, respectively. A long-term strength improvement was observed and well-fitted to a power function. Soil-cement losses due to multiple wet-dry cycles were examined by means of durability tests. Finally, suitable cement percentages for sediment improvement are suggested to achieve the requirements for road base and subbase materials.","fluidex; related topics, grouting, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Mechanics of Materials"

However, this is challenging to accomplish in the field by current electroanalytical techniques, where tuning assay conditions towards a target analyte often results in poor selectivity and sensitivity for other species in the mixture. In this work, an electrochemical paper-based analytical device (ePAD) capable of performing simultaneous electrochemical experiments in different solution conditions on a single sample was developed for the first time. We refer to the system as a Janus-ePAD after the two-faced Greek god because of the ability of the device to perform electrochemistry on the same sample under differing solution conditions at the same time with a single potentiostat. In a Janus-ePAD, a sample wicks down two channels from a single inlet towards two discreet reagent zones that adjust solution conditions, such as pH, before flow termination in two electrochemical detection zones. These zones feature independent working electrodes and shared reference and counter electrodes, facilitating simultaneous detection of multiple species at each species’ optimal solution condition. The device utility and applicability are demonstrated through the simultaneous detection of two biologically relevant species (norepinephrine and serotonin) and a common enzymatic assay product (p-aminophenol) at two different solution pH conditions. Janus-ePADs show great promise as an inexpensive and broadly applicable platform which can reduce the complexity and/or number of steps required in multiplexed analysis, while also operating under the optimized conditions of each species present in a mixture.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

Effect of acrylonitrile content of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber on mechanical and thermal properties of dynamically vulcanized poly(lactic acid) blends,"Samthong C., Kunanusont N., Deetuam C., Wongkhan T., Supannasud T., Somwangthanaroj A.",2019-12-01,"Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, Cold crystallization temperature, Degradation temperatures, Dicumyl peroxide, Dynamic vulcanization, Mechanical and thermal properties, Polylactic acids, Thermal and tensile properties, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), dicumyl peroxide (DCP), dynamic vulcanization, mechanical properties, poly(lactic acid) (PLA)","We report here the morphology, thermal and tensile properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blends composed of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) with different acrylonitrile contents with/without dynamic vulcanization by dicumyl peroxide (DCP). The interfacial tension of PLA and NBR measured by contact angle measurement decreased as the acrylonitrile content of NBR decreased. Likewise, SEM images showed that the rubber particle size reduced with decreasing acrylonitrile content owing to the stronger interfacial adhesion between the PLA matrix and NBR domains. Incorporation of DCP at 1.0 phr for dynamic vulcanization led to higher crosslink density and, in turn, optimal tensile strength and tensile toughness as a result of the action of PLA-NBR copolymer as a reactive compatibilizer. The dynamic vulcanization of the blends containing low acrylonitrile NBR gave the most improved tensile properties because the free radicals from DCP decomposition preferentially attacked the allylic hydrogen atoms or double bonds of the butadiene backbone. Accordingly, more NBR macroradicals were generated and probably more PLA-NBR copolymers were produced. Moreover, further addition of DCP at 2.0 phr provided a large amount of crosslinked NBR gel, which significantly degraded the tensile properties. From the DSC results, dynamic vulcanization lowered the cold crystallization temperature, implying an improvement of cold crystallization. Finally, TGA results showed a higher degradation temperature as a function of DCP content, which suggested that thermal stability increased due to stronger interfacial adhesion as well as higher gel content. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

It involves UV-induced radical polymerization of acrylonitrile (AN) and methacrylic acid (MAA) monomers with crosslinking agent and photoinitiator: an alternative synthesis pathway to gamma radiation. Characteristic peaks of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that nitrile group was completely converted into amidoxime group. Eight hours of 60 W UV curing was enough for polymer gel formation. For the 4 to 1 ratio of AN to MAA, crosslinking agent concentration of 1 g/100 mL-monomers and photoinitiator content of 60 mL/100 mL-monomer, maximum uranium adsorption capacity of 17.02 mg/g adsorbent in seawater was achieved for sample spiked with 10 ppm uranium. For seawater sample spiked with 2,245 ppm uranium, the adsorption capacity reached 432.41 mg/g adsorbent. The amidoxime polymer gel could be regenerated for at least eight cycles while retaining about 50% of the uranium uptake capacity. Thus, the present amidoxime polymer adsorbent is a high-efficiency seawater uranium recovery agent for both high and low uranium concentrations.","physics, energy","Nuclear and High Energy Physics, Nuclear Energy and Engineering"

Additionally, we isolated and cloned the 3′ end of Kiss1 cDNA, containing kisspeptin-10 (Kp10), from the ovaries of a clouded leopard and Siberian tiger. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that domestic cat Kiss1 cDNA is of 711 base pairs and caracal Kiss1 cDNA is of 792 base pairs, both having an open reading frame of 450 base pairs, encoding a precursor protein Kiss1 of 149 amino acids. The core sequence of the feline kisspeptin Kp10 was found to be identical in all species analyzed here and is highly conserved in other vertebrate species. Using an anti-Kp10 antibody, we found the immunoreactive kisspeptin to be localized in the periventricular and infundibular nuclei of the cat hypothalamus. The results show that kisspeptin is highly conserved among different feline families, and its immunoreactive distribution in the hypothalamus may indicate its physiological function in the domestic cat.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

The anti-oxidant, nitric oxide suppression, as well as the free radical scavenging activities of fusigen were tested in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B cells) and human dermal papilla cells (DP cells) using specific fluorescence dyes and flow cytometry analysis. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Results: Fusigen did not exert cytotoxicity in the human normal BEAS-2B and DP cells at concentrations up to 100 μM. Fusigen decreased basal levels of cellular ROS, as well as the levels of ROS induced by hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion enrichment. ROS decreasing effect was confirmed in DP cells. In addition, fusigen treatment suppressed intracellular NO levels in both BEAS-2B and DP cells. Conclusion: The optimal process of production of purified fusigen from A. melanogenum was determined.

Although amino acid variation in T-cell receptor variable chains often affects antigen specificity, dimorphism in the beta chain constant region (TRBC1 and TRBC2) is not thought to affect T-cell function. A recent study suggested that adoptive transfer of TRBC1-specific chimeric antigen-receptor-T cells provided an option for T-cell leukemia therapy that preserved T-cell immunity in the TRBC2 subset. This raises an important question as to whether TRBC1+T cells are qualitatively different from TRBC2+T cells.Design:Cross-sectional study.Methods:Sixty-six antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-infected individuals, including 19 viraemic controllers and 47 noncontrollers, were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for T-cell functional assays, tetramer analyses, TRBC1 staining and immunophenotyping.Results:Viraemic controllers had a higher proportion of circulating TRBC1+T cells than noncontrollers, raising the possibility that TRBC1+T cells might be associated with HIV control. TRBC1+T cells also showed more functional T-cell responses against both HIV and cytomegalovirus (P < 0.01). The immunophenotypes of TRBC1-bearing T cells were skewed towards naive and central memory phenotypes, whereas the majority of TRBC2-expressing T cells were terminally differentiated. Inverse correlations were observed between %TRBC1+T cells and HIV plasma viral load, which was most pronounced for CD8+ T cells (r =-0.7096, P = 0.00002357).Conclusion:These data suggest that TRBC1+T-cell responses are of better quality than their TRBC2 counterparts, which should be considered in immunotherapeutic strategies for HIV infection. Conversely, depletion of TRBC1+T cells as part of the treatment of TRBC1+ T-cell malignancies may lead to compromised T-cell response quality.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"
Investigation of leukocyte viability and damage in spiral microchannel and contraction-expansion array,"Suwannaphan T., Srituravanich W., Sailasuta A., Piyaviriyakul P., Bhanpattanakul S., Jeamsaksiri W., Sripumkhai W., Pimpin A.",2019-11-01,"Cell morphology, Cell viability, Contraction expansion, Intracellular structures, Leukocytes, Cell morphology, Cell viability, Contraction-expansion array, Intracellular structures, Leukocytes, Microfluidics, Spiral microchannel","Inertial separation techniques in a microfluidic system have been widely employed in the field of medical diagnosis for a long time. Despite no requirement of external forces, it requires strong hydrodynamic forces that could potentially cause cell damage or loss during the separation process. This might lead to the wrong interpretation of laboratory results since the change of structures and functional characteristics of cells due to the hydrodynamic forces that occur are not taken into account. Therefore, it is important to investigate the cell viability and damage along with the separation efficacy of the device in the design process. In this study, two inertial separation techniques-spiral microchannel and contraction-expansion array (CEA)-were examined to evaluate cell viability, morphology and intracellular structures using a trypan blue assay (TB), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Wright-Giemsa stain. We discovered that cell loss was not significantly found in a feeding system, i.e., syringe, needle and tube, but mostly occurred in the inertial separation devices while the change of cell morphology and intracellular structures were found in the feeding system and inertial separation devices. Furthermore, percentage of cell loss was not significant in both devices (7-10%). However, the change of cell morphology was considerably increased (30%) in spiral microchannel (shear stress dominated) rather than in CEA (12%). In contrast, the disruption of intracellular structures was increased (14%) in CEA (extensional and shear stress dominated equally) rather than spiral microchannel (2%). In these experiments, leukocytes of canine were used as samples because their sizes are varied in a range between 7-12 μm, and they are commonly used as a biomarker in many clinical and medical applications.","mixing and separation, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

MaaS aims to give a new travel experience to travelers, in terms of access to the services and seamless trips on one single platform. The organization of MaaS requires a new player, a MaaS provider, who mediates the travelers (customers) and transport services. The MaaS provider takes the roles of data provider, integrator, and MaaS operator. In many pilot and implementation of MaaS schemes around the world, the MaaS providers come from various stakeholders and employ various business models. MaaS providers are crucial in that they lead the cooperation among all stakeholders and are the driving force of the services. In Bangkok, Thailand, where MaaS is a relatively new concept, the identification of a suitable MaaS provider was explored. Taking the local transport conditions, both demand and service conditions, scenarios of probable MaaS providers were investigated. The study method included literature reviews and collection of present transport setting, including the organizational arrangement. Expert interview and focus group meeting were used to form a concrete understanding and to imply the possibility of the MaaS provider in Bangkok. Three scenarios of Maas providers were set: public transport service provider, private transport service provider and third party, and Public Private Partnership. The results disclose issues that need to be resolved if the stakeholder would serve as the MaaS provider. Several implications are drawn to set the directions of MaaS development and a possible MaaS provider in Bangkok.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering","Transportation, Safety Research, Urban Studies, Engineering (all)"

Pre-weld heat treatment conditions consist of a solution treatment at a temperature of 1473 K for 7.2 ks and three over-aging processes at temperatures of 1393, 1413, 1433 K for 7.2 ks. All as-received and pre-weld heat treated specimens received the same post-weld heat treatment, which consisted of a solution treatment at a temperature of 1473 K for 7.2 ks and precipitation aging at a temperature of 1118 K for 86.4 ks. From the results, it can be seen that the higher temperature of the solution treatment with respect to the pre-weld heat treatment provided coarser gamma prime particles precipitating in a gamma matrix with a more uniform microstructure and very fine gamma prime precipitated particles. Furthermore, when followed by the post-weld heat treatment or standard heat treatment of the alloy, the final microstructures of all as-received and pre-weld heat treated specimens were very similar with regard to uniform gamma prime particles. No significant effect of pre-weld heat treatment conditions on the microstructure was found after post-weld heat treatment.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

For the development and improvement of the integrated process systems, the optimization problem has more than one conflicting objective functions to be optimized (i.e., thermodynamic performance, environmental impacts, annual profit, capital and operating costs) simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions. In this work, MOO of a sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification (SEG) integrated with an SOFC and gas turbine (GT) system, for combined heat and power production from Eucalyptus wood chips as biomass feedstock, is investigated. Firstly, the model of this integrated plant is developed in Aspen Plus that can be divided into five parts: (1) SEG, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC, (4) catalytic burning, GT and CO2 compression, and (5) Portland cement production. As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions. The Pareto-optimal solutions are ranked based on the normalized variations for decision variables uncertainty. At the end of this study, robust MOO of the integrated plant is performed, with respect to uncertainties in the market and operating parameters.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate emotional behavioral development and identify salient predictors of resilience among long-Term survivors of PHIV. Design: Prospective investigation of children with PHIV compared with demographically similar perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) and HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) children, all from Thailand and Cambodia. Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; parent version) was administered at baseline and annual follow-up visits (median follow-up of 3 years) to children age 6 14. Resilience was defined as consistent CBCL scores on the Internalizing, Externalizing or Total Problem T scales within normative ranges (T-scores <60) at every time point. Generalized estimating equations examined CBCL scores over time and logistic models examined demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural predictors of resilience. Results: Participants included 448 children (236 PHIV, 98 PHEU, 114 HUU), with median (interquartile range) age at first evaluation of 7 (6 9) years. Children with PHIV exhibited similar rates of resilience as PHEU and HUU on the Externalizing and Total Problems scales. Resilience on the Internalizing scale was more likely in PHEU (71%) compared with PHIV (59%) or HUU (56%), P=0.049. Factors associated with resilience in adjusted models included: HIV-exposed but uninfected status, higher household income, Cambodian nationality, female sex, and caregiver type. Conclusion: Despite biopsychosocial risks, resilience is observed among PHIV and PHEU children.

Can We Trust Privacy Policy: Privacy Policy Classification Using Machine Learning,"Narksenee M., Sripanidkulchai K.",2019-08-01,"Information users, K nearest neighbor (KNN), Mobile applications, Personally identifiable information, Privacy information, Privacy policies, Recall and precision, Support vector machine (SVMs), machine learning, natural language processing, personally identifiable information transmission, text classification","Mobile applications frequently request privacy information from users to supposedly use to improve online service and applications. The collected data, such as personally identifiable information, raises users' concerns since some applications actually have malicious intentions to leak personal data. Privacy policies are an important resource as they are the sole source of information users can easily gain access in order to determine how applications plan to collect and use their data prior to downloading and using the application. However, users tend to ignore or gloss over privacy policies as they are often written in the complicated hard-to-understand language. Thus, users often miss crucial privacy-related information after reading such documents. In this paper, we experimentally determine how much we can trust an application's privacy policy by looking at the language used in more than 9,000 privacy policies and compare them to what the applications actually do. We attempt to classify whether or not applications transmit privacy-related information using machine learning with three classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), k- nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR). The best results show the average recall and precision of 0.81 and 0.31, respectively. High recall indicates that we are able to correctly identify most of the applications that transmit personally identifiable information. But, low precision indicates that we often over-identify applications as ones that transmit personally identifiable information when in reality they do not.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering","Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Control and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering"

According to the current concept, we reclassified VWD and low VWF by VWF levels ≤30 and 30 to 50 IU/dL, respectively. Type 2 VWD was diagnosed if VWF activity to antigen ratio was ≤0.6. Bleeding severity was determined by the condensed MCMDM-1VWD bleeding score (BS).

This survey aimed to determine the current surgical approaches in primary and recurrent pterygium, and the ideal surgical techniques among Thai ophthalmologists. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 1150 ophthalmologists who are members of Royal College of Ophthalmologists of Thailand (RCOPT). A survey was conducted between 21 September and December 21, 2016. Results: 438 of 515 responded questionnaires were valid. The highest number of the respondents applied the bare sclera technique (BST) (37.4%) and conjunctival autograft transplantation (CAGT, 44.9%) in primary pterygium and recurrent pterygium, respectively. The recurrence was the most reported late postoperative complication. An ideal technique for primary pterygium surgery was CAGT (42.4%), whereas amniotic membrane transplant (AMT) with adjuvant therapy (27.4%) was most selected for recurrent pterygium. Around half of the respondents currently applied the ideal techniques in their practice. The inaccessible and unaffordable amniotic membranes or fibrin glues (58%) concerning about complications (26%), inexperience in surgical procedures (25%), large number of patients in the surgery waiting list, prolonged surgical time, and need for conjunctiva preservation in glaucoma patients were reported as the obstacles to the ideal techniques. Conclusions: BST and CAGT were the most selected surgical techniques for primary and recurrent pterygium, respectively.

Tissue engineering holds promise for building cartilage grafts that withstand the stresses in joint. Major challenges of functional cartilage tissue development are scaffolding materials and structure of scaffold to support cartilage tissue formation. Scaffolds for engineered cartilage have been involved with the use of synthetic and natural polymers. Synthetic polymers provide well-control mechanical properties, while they are relatively inert to cell adhesion and tissue formation. Instead, natural polymers allow inherent cellular interaction and are present in abundance. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were combined to form copolymer solution used in porous scaffold fabrication. Our goal was to investigate effects of PVA/CMC complex network on pore formation in scaffold and on cartilage tissue development. We found that addition of CMC into polymer solution could modulate scaffold architecture and swelling abilities. Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of PVA/CMC scaffold showed the peak at 1599 cm-1 of C=O group, indicating the incorporation of CMC into the scaffold. Chondrocyte viability was observed up to 14 days post-cell seeding.

The aim of this research was to study the antioxidant activity of C. mimosoides extracts in Caenorhabditis elegans, a widely used model organism in this context. Methods: C. elegans were treated with C. mimosoides extracts in a various concentrations. To investigate the protective effects of the extract against oxidative stress, wild-type N2 were used to determine survival rate under oxidative stress and intracellular ROS. To study underlying mechanisms, the mutant strains with GFP reporter gene including TJ356, CF1553, EU1 and LD4 were used to study DAF-16, SOD-3, SKN-1 and GST-4 gene, respectively.

The processes involve a large number of experiments for analysis of each sample due to the optimized conditions depending on the selected column sets. In this study, the analytical solutions of time summation model combined with temperature dependent linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) were derived for constant flow separation in GC × GC. The derived equations allow calculation of analyte retention time in first and second dimensional separation (1tR and 2tR), under temperature program separation employing any column combination with known LSER database. As a result, optimization software was developed enabling simulation of several hundred thousand GC × GC results (fingerprints) for separation of each sample. Good correlations between our predicted results and the results obtained with the previously established numerical approach, were obtained with the R2 of 1.000 and 0.998 for simulation of 1tR and 2tR, respectively. The developed approaches were further applied to simulation of 96,000 individual fingerprints in temperature programmed GC × GC, with the focus on application of 16 column sets including non-ionic liquid and ionic liquid (IL) stationary phases for separation of 678 model compounds. These approaches resulted in the computational time of 1 day compared with 1 year provided by the numerical method. Best column sets and experimental conditions (secondary column lengths and temperature programs) could then be extracted according to maximizing number of separated peaks in separation, which represents the quality of each fingerprinting.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The transition metal oxide semiconductors (e.g. TiO2, WO3, ZnO, and ZrO2)are have been widely used as photocatalysts for the hydrogen generation. Because of safety, low cost, chemical inertness, photostability and other characteristics (bandgap, corrosion resistance, thermal and environmental stability), TiO2 is considered as a most potential catalyst of the semiconductors being investigated and developed. However, the extensive applications of TiO2 are hampered by its inability to exploit the solar energy of visible region. Other demerits are lesser absorbance under visible light, and recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In this review, we focus on the all the possible reactions taking place at the catalyst during photo-induced H2 from water splitting reaction, which is green and promising technology. Various parameter affecting the photocatalytic water splitting reactions are also studied. Predominantly, this review is focussed on bandgap engineering of TiO2 such as the upward shift of valence band and downward shift of conduction bands by doping process to extend its light absorption property into the visible region. Furthermore, the recent advances in this direction including various new strategies of synthesis, multiple doping, hetero-junction, functionalization, perspective and future opportunities of non-metals-doped TiO2-based nanostructured photocatalysts for various photocatalytic applications such as efficient hydrogen production, air purification and CO2 reduction to valuable chemicals have been discussed.","energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Raising awareness of breast cancer is particularly important to help at risk women seek medical treatment for this disease. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the Indonesian women's level of knowledge about breast cancer risk factors, barriers, attitude and breast cancer screening. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study administered the breast cancer awareness Indonesian scale (BCAS-I) to 856 Indonesian women. Samples were selected in rural and urban combinations from three provinces by stratified random sampling. The ordinal logistic model was used to investigate the clustering effect of the participant's characteristics in this study. Results: Of the women, 62% lived in rural areas and 38% lived in urban areas. Living in an urban area was significantly associated with a lower knowledge of the risk factors. However, living in an urban area was significantly associated with better attitudes and healthier behaviours related to breast cancer awareness. Women with higher education levels had 70% worse attitudes toward breast cancer awareness. Women living South of Sumatera, women living in Yogyakarta, and unmarried women were 5.03, 3.84, and 1.56 times as likely to have higher perceived barriers, respectively. Conclusion: Urban women had a poorer level of knowledge of breast cancer risk factors compared to women living in more rural areas. The result of this study may reflect inadequate breast cancer awareness campaigns or a lack of breast cancer awareness campaigns. These findings suggest that additional education programs aiming to increase awareness and educate the public are needed.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Cardiovascular risk factors, including the predictor of subclinical atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), are reported to be associated with NCI. Data on NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV positive are limited, especially in Asian populations. We aimed to determine the prevalence of NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative aging Thai individuals. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with a cutoff of <25/30 for diagnosis of NCI. Depression was evaluated by PHQ-9 Patient Depression Questionnaire, with scores ≥5 indicating depression. cIMT measurement was performed by experienced neurologists, and abnormal cIMT was defined as cIMT ≥0.9 mm or presence of carotid plaques. Among 340 well suppressed and aging HIV-positive and 102 HIV-negative matched participants, the median age (interquartile range) was 55 (52-59) years and 61.5% were males. For HIV positive group, the median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 18.3 years with median CD4 of 615.5 cells/mm3, and 97.4% had current plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL. The most common antiretroviral agents used were tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (76.8%), lamivudine (70.3%), efavirenz (26.7%), and emtricitabine (23.8%). HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants performed comparably between each domain and had comparable prevalence of NCI (59.4% vs. 61.7%, p = .69). However, the HIV-positive group had a high prevalence of depression (24.71% vs. 13.73%, p = .019). HIV-positive status [adjusted odd ratio (aOR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-1.47, p = .71] and cIMT (aOR 1.17; 95% CI 0.77-1.79, p = .47) were not significantly associated with NCI. Given the high prevalence of NCI and depression among aging HIV-positive individuals, routine screening for NCI and depression should be integrated into the HIV care services.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Data was obtained by conducting interviews and with in-depth semi-structured questions with N=40 participants. The instrument was based on an integrated model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The interviews were audio-recorded and encrypted in NVivo 11. The results revealed that both Flemish and Thai participants perceived the value of e-coaching. The subjective norms of the participants show that Thai students and supervisors influence each other to use e-coaching. For Flemish, the supervisors have an essential role in influencing students. Both Thai and Flemish perceived the use of e-coaching as a comfortable mode of communication. The results explained by the theoretical framework of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance (TPB –TAM) variables also show some differences between the two contexts. The Thai participants are positive about the use of e-coaching because of its ease of use, and have intention to increase the use in the future; however, Flemish participants are skeptical towards this future. In general, Thai participants believe that using Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools can enrich their coaching process, while Flemish participants feel uncertain. Nevertheless, almost all participants agree that e-coaching is crucial for an effective coaching but should always be complemented to a face-to-face coaching.","personnel, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Combination of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage in malignant hilar biliary obstruction,"Kongkam P., Tasneem A.A., Rerknimitr R.",2019-04-01,"Bile Duct Neoplasms, Biliary Tract Surgical Procedures, Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde, Cholestasis, Drainage, Endosonography, Humans, Klatskin Tumor, Stents, Ultrasonography, Interventional, endosonography, ERCP, EUS, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma","Adequate biliary drainage (BD), defined as more than 50% of liver volume drained, is an ideal BD method in patients with advanced and unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction (MHBO). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with multi-segmental BD is technically challenging. ERCP with percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) or PTBD alone has cumbersome maintenance of PTBD line and external bag. The utility of EUS-guided BD (EUS-BD) has risen significantly over last 5 years mostly in the clinical setting of distal bile duct obstruction. Information on EUS-BD for malignant hilar biliary obstruction (MHBO) is thus far limited to only two small studies. This review suggests a new concept of a combination of ERCP and EUS-BD (CERES) for BD in MHBO as a primary BD method whereby ERCP with a single self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is placed into either the right or the left intrahepatic bile duct (IHD). If SEMS is placed in the right biliary system, EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) can subsequently be carried out. However, if the stent is placed into the left biliary system, EUS-guided hepaticoduodenostomy (EUS-HDS) is done. For MHBO with non-functioning right lobe of the liver, EUS-HGS is carried out after failed ERCP, or primary HGS can be carried out in the left lobe of liver. For MHBO with non-functioning left lobe of the liver, EUS-HDS is carried out after failed transpapillary stenting of the right lobe by ERCP. Based on our experience, CERES is promising as it can fulfil gaps of both PTBD and ERCP by allowing internal drainage that can circumvent the inconvenience associated with PTBD and offer higher technical success rate compared to ERCP with bilateral SEMS placement.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Gastroenterology"

The consequential effects on formation of unknown disinfection by-products (DBPs)by chlorination were evaluated in laboratory-scale experiments. Several hundred unsaturated DOM features with positive oxygen-subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon ((DBE–O)/C)were decomposed by the ozone-only treatment and AOP. The AOP decomposed some saturated (negative (DBE–O)/C))and reduced molecules, which had negative carbon oxidation states (Cos). Several hundred saturated oxidation by-products were detected after ozonation and the AOP. After chlorination, the samples pre-treated with ozone alone resulted in higher formation of unknown DBPs than the AOP pre-treated sample or the sample without oxidation. Over half of the DBP precursors, estimated by electrophilic substitution, were not totally decomposed by any oxidation process, but they were increased after the ozone-only process and AOP. DBP precursors produced by the ozone-only process or AOP formed unique unknown DBPs. Therefore, post-treatment processes after oxidation and before chlorination are important to minimize formation of unknown DBPs.","genergyal, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Besides the diversity of available medicines in the retail market, a lack of reliable documentations in the Thai healthcare system also causes an inconvenience to Thai citizens. Most healthcare information was limited its accessibility to Thai citizens in the effortless way. The dispersion of data and services leads to the cost raising and the increased medical errors. This paper presents a skillful medicine recommendation system initiate from Thai Household Remedy (THR) and Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS) information. We devise a Household Remedies Ontology, a model which illustrates relationships between personal information, indications of illness (symptom), its related household remedies for medication. The model allows ontology inferences and knowledge discovery to aid in selecting the proper medications for the diagnosed symptoms. We correlate THR, MIMS, and patient's personal information with the purpose to determine the semantical relationships among symptoms, medicines, its dose, drug interaction, and taken indication. Generally, the medicine selected by symptoms and the dose personalized by each patient. As a result of the development, we evaluated the satisfactory performance of the presented system through the review of Thai citizens. The result shows that the Thai household remedy recommendation system is a useful approach to help Thai citizens reaching out the proper household remedies or medicines.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

Mitigation plans are highly important, especially during crises such as flooding that have the potential to disrupt regular waste management services in cities. This study aims to identify practical approaches for impact mitigation and preparedness of MSWM services during floods. In this study, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is applied, using a panel of responsible providers and waste management and town planning specialists to assess appropriate impact mitigation alternatives. Flood impacts on MSWM in cities are classified into three situations: 1) Cannot collect waste from sources (CNC), 2) Cannot transfer waste for final disposal (CNT), and 3) Cannot collect and transfer waste for final disposal (CNC and CNT). The decision support system is designed based on the principles of sustainable development, and considers impacting criteria, namely environment, society and economic factors. The results show that modifying waste-hauling trucks is the most appropriate alternative for all situations to prepare for mitigating flood impact on MSWM services. The findings can help develop an appropriate mitigation management plan for waste management systems during floods that challenges practice to develop cities and communities sustainably and achieve the SDGs.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Economics","Waste Management and Disposal, Economics and Econometrics"

We previously developed bacterial cytological profiling (BCP) to understand the MOA of compounds in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Given how distantly related A. baumannii is to these species, it was unclear to what extent it could be applied. Here, we implemented BCP as an antibiotic MOA discovery platform for A. baumannii. We found that the BCP platform can distinguish among six major antibiotic classes and can also subclassify antibiotics that inhibit the same cellular pathway but have different molecular targets. We used BCP to show that the compound NSC145612 inhibits the growth of A. baumannii via targeting RNA transcription. We confirmed this result by isolating and characterizing resistant mutants with mutations in the rpoB gene. Altogether, we conclude that BCP provides a useful tool for MOA studies of antibacterial compounds that are active against A. baumannii.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by a deficit in IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to tryptophan catabolites. The presence and correlates of IgM isotype antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), nitroso (NO), and nitro (NO2) adducts in schizophrenia remain unknown. This study measured IgM antibodies to malondialdehyde (MDA), azelaic acid, phosphatidylinositol, oleic acid, NO-tryptophan, NO-albumin, NO-cysteinyl, and NO2-tyrosine in a sample of 80 schizophrenia patients, divided into those with and those without deficit schizophrenia, and 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly lower IgM antibody levels to all OSEs as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia and controls. Lowered IgM antibodies to MDA coupled with increased IgM levels to NO-cysteinyl and NO2-tyrosine strongly predict deficit schizophrenia versus non-deficit schizophrenia with an area under the ROC curve of 0.913. A large part of the variance (21.2–42.2%) in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and excitation is explained by IgM antibody titers to MDA (inversely) and NO-cysteinyl and/or NO2-tyrosine (both positively). Lower IgM antibodies to MDA are significantly associated with impairments in episodic memory including direct and delayed recall. These findings further indicate that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by lower natural IgM antibody levels to OSEs and relative increments in nitrosylation and nitration of proteins. It is concluded that deficits in natural IgM attenuate CIRS functions and that this impairment may drive negative symptoms and impairments in episodic memory and thus deficit schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Ethnic differences in platysmal perforators and its relevance for the platysma myocutaneous flap,"Giammarino A., Jitaree B., Gildener-Leapman N., Bialowas C., Muste J., Frank K., Gotkin R.H., Smith M.P., Tansatit T., Cotofana S.",2019-08-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anatomic Variation, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Chin, European Continental Ancestry Group, Facial Neoplasms, Female, Graft Survival, Humans, Male, Myocutaneous Flap, Perforator Flap, Reconstructive Surgical Procedures, Sex Factors, Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System, Ethnic differences, Neck surgery, Perforators, Platysma, Platysma myocutaneous flap","Background: Variable flap loss rates for the platysma myocutaneous flap have been reported for the Caucasian and the Asian population, which are 10.1% and 1.6%, respectively. This study was designed to investigate ethnic differences in the number and location of platysmal perforators that influence flap survival rates. Methods: The number and location of platysmal perforators were investigated in a total of 60 platysma muscles: bilaterally in 20 Caucasian (13 males and 7 females) and 10 Asian (5 males and 5 females) specimens using cadaveric dissections. Adjustment for inter-individual variability in platysma length and width was performed by standardizing each x-value to mandibular length and each y-value to mandibulo-clavicular distance. Results: A total of 64% of all detected platysmal perforators were found in the medial half of the muscle following the pathway of the external carotid artery. Individuals of Caucasian ethnicity had a mean number of 7.60 ± 2.0 perforators per side, whereas individuals of Asian ethnicity had a mean number of 13.05 ± 1.76 perforators per side (p < 0.001). Individuals of Asian ethnicity had a statistically significant increased number of platysmal perforators in the medial middle (2.95 ± 1.05 vs. 1.60 ± 1.08; p < 0.001) and lower (1.60 ± 1.35 vs. 0.73 ± 0.85; p = 0.003) regions of the platysma compared to those of Caucasian individuals. Conclusion: A significantly higher number of platysmal perforators were identified in the investigated Asian population. This provides a potential explanatory model for the reported lower platysma myocutaneous flap loss rates in the Asian population than in the Caucasian population.","surgery, medical",Surgery
Penaeus monodon IKKs Participate in Regulation of Cytokine-Like System and Antiviral Responses of Innate Immune System,"Nhnhkorn Z., Amparyup P., Kawai T., Tassanakajon A.",2019-01-01,"Animals, Arthropod Proteins, I-kappa B Kinase, Immunity, Innate, Penaeidae, Roniviridae, Vibrio, White spot syndrome virus 1, Antiviral responses, IKK-NF-κB signaling cascade, Penaeus monodon, Shrimp immunity, White spot syndrome virus","The IKK-NF-κB signaling cascade is one of the crucial responsive mechanisms in inflammatory and immune responses. The key kinase proteins called inhibitor of kappa B kinases (IKKs) serve as the core elements involved in cascade activation. Here, the complete ORFs of IKK homologs, PmIKKβ, PmIKKε1, and PmIKKε2, from the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon were identified and characterized for their functions in shrimp antiviral responses. The PmIKK transcripts were widely expressed in various examined tissues and the PmIKKε protein was detected in all three types of shrimp hemocytes. Only the PmIKKε1 and PmIKKε2 were responsive to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), yellow head virus (YHV) and a bacterium Vibrio harveyi infection, while the PmIKKβ exhibited no significant response to pathogen infection. On the contrary, suppression of PmIKKβ and PmIKKε by dsRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a rapid death of WSSV-infected shrimp and the significant reduction of an IFN-like PmVago4 transcript. Whereas, the mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides, ALFPm3 and CrustinPm5, and a transcription factor, PmDorsal were significantly increased, those of ALFPm6, CrustinPm1, CrustinPm7, PmVago1, PmRelish, and PmCactus were unaffected. Overexpression of PmIKKβ and PmIKKε in HEK293T cells differentially activated the NF-κB and IFNβ promoter activities, respectively. These results suggest that the PmIKKβ and PmIKKε may act as common factors regulating the expression of immune-related genes from various signaling pathways. Interestingly, the PmIKKs may also contribute a possible role in shrimp cytokine-like system and cross-talking between signaling transductions in innate immune responses.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Phylogenetic evidence of a novel lineage of canine pneumovirus and a naturally recombinant strain isolated from dogs with respiratory illness in Thailand,"Piewbang C., Techangamsuwan S.",2019-08-19,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Dog Diseases, Dogs, Genome, Viral, Mutation, Phylogeny, Pneumovirus, Pneumovirus Infections, Reassortant Viruses, Respiratory Tract Infections, Thailand, Viral Proteins, Canine pneumovirus, Genetic recombination, Phylogenetic analysis, Thailand","Background: Canine pneumovirus (CPV) is a pathogen that causes respiratory disease in dogs, and recent outbreaks in shelters in America and Europe have been reported. However, based on published data and documents, the identification of CPV and its variant in clinically symptomatic individual dogs in Thailand through Asia is limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the emergence of CPV and to consequently establish the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the CPV strains from 209 dogs showing respiratory distress in Thailand. Results: This study identified and described the full-length CPV genome from three strains, designated herein as CPV_CP13 TH/2015, CPV_CP82 TH/2016 and CPV_SR1 TH/2016, that were isolated from six dogs out of 209 dogs (2.9%) with respiratory illness in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three Thai CPV strains (CPV TH strains) belong to the CPV subgroup A and form a novel lineage; proposed as the Asian prototype. Specific mutations in the deduced amino acids of these CPV TH strains were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence, suggesting potential substitution sites for subtype classification. Results of intragenic recombination analysis revealed that CPV_CP82 TH/2016 is a recombinant strain, where the recombination event occurred in the L gene with the Italian prototype CPV Bari/100-12 as the putative major parent. Selective pressure analysis demonstrated that the majority of the nucleotides in the G/glycoprotein were under purifying selection with evidence of positive selection sites. Conclusions: This collective information on the CPV TH strains is the first evidence of CPV emergence with genetic characterization in Thailand and as first report in Asia, where homologous recombination acts as a potential force driving the genetic diversity and shaping the evolution of canine pneumovirus.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)
An overview of the immunogenicity and effectiveness of current human rabies vaccines administered by intradermal route,"Denis M., Knezevic I., Wilde H., Hemachudha T., Briggs D., Knopf L.",2019-10-03,"Antibodies, Viral, Antibody Formation, Humans, Injections, Intradermal, Rabies, Rabies Vaccines, Treatment Outcome, Vaccine Potency, Immunogenicity, Intradermal route, Post-exposure prophylaxis, Pre-exposure prophylaxis, Rabies vaccines","Pre- as well as post-exposure prophylaxis plays an important role in controlling the number of deaths associated with human rabies. Rabies vaccines, classically injected intramuscularly, are now also administered by intradermal (ID) route. Vaccines to be administered by the ID route should meet the same quality, safety and efficacy specifications as vaccines for intramuscular (IM) use. The aim of this paper is to provide information based on publicly available data regarding the ID use of rabies vaccines and to identify potential needs for further analysis of the potency, immunogenicity and effectiveness of rabies vaccines administered by this route. A first literature search, focused on the immunogenicity of rabies vaccines given by ID route, identified 338 publications in the period 1997–2018, 40 of which were included in our analyses. A second search investigating the effectiveness of ID vaccination resulted in 371 hits for the period 2007–2018, of which 13 suitable publications were retained. The immunogenicity of current rabies vaccines was analyzed in 3 ways: proportion of subjects reaching the antibody threshold of 0.5 IU/ml after ID vaccination, relationship between potency and immunogenicity of the vaccine given intradermally, and comparison of antibody responses after IM or ID vaccination. Overall, vaccines administered intradermally were found immunogenic. Post-exposure prophylaxis by ID route appeared at least as immunogenic as by IM regimens. By contrast, ID pre-exposure prophylaxis trended towards lower antibody titers than IM vaccination, but the observation was not associated with any clinical relevance. Vaccine effectiveness was assessed by investigating survival after exposure. Data from more than 30,000 patients who sought rabies post-exposure prophylaxis did not indicate that current vaccines administered by ID route lack efficacy. These results support current recommendations for ID vaccination against rabies. However, published data on ID performance were associated with significant weaknesses that future research should better address.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; human vaccines, biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Execution semantics were introduced in BPMN 2.0 to support the definition of executable processes. In order to test a BPMN model, many researchers focus on test case generation technique. Mutation Testing is a technique to evaluate the quality of test cases by introducing a fault to the original program and the mutated version of the program is called a mutant. A previous research [1] proposed mutation operators for a BPMN model. In order to apply the mutation operator, we need a framework for mutant generation. Thus, this paper proposes a framework for mutant generation based on Weak Mutation testing technique which can generate mutants, deploy mutants on BPMN Engine, and calculate three metrics which are execution time, mutation score, and test effectiveness.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

Various technologies have been used to address this issue including neuronavigator, intraoperative magnetic resonant imaging, intraoperative ultrasound, and fluorescence, each of which has certain drawbacks and limitations. In this study, authors demonstrate the technique of using stereotactically placed catheters as guidance during cerebral glioma resection and report the surgical outcomes. Materials and methods: This study included patients with intrinsic cerebral tumour adjacent to the eloquent structures. Catheter trajectories were planned using three-dimensional cerebral reconstruction on navigation software and catheters were stereotactically placed to mark the intended extent of resection. All craniotomies were performed in awake fashion under neurophysiologic mapping and continuous physical examination for safe maximal resection. Clinical outcome and intended versus actual extent of resection were analysed. Results: Between January 2015 and December 2016, 15 consecutive patients (8 males and 7 females) with intrinsic cerebral tumour underwent craniotomy with this technique. Median age was 43 years. Seven patients (46.7%) had worsening neurological status within 24 h postoperatively. Of these 7 patients, 6 patients (85.7%) regained preoperative neurological status by 6 months. The intended extent of resections were total, subtotal and partial in 3 (20%), 9 (60%), and 3 (20%) patients, respectively. The actual extent of resections were total, subtotal and partial in 3 (20%), 8(53.3%), and 4 (26.7%) patients, respectively. There were no catheter related complications. There was no 30-day postoperative mortality. Conclusions: Catheter guided resection along with awake surgery and neurophysiologic monitoring is a valid technique for infiltrative tumour, especially for ones locating near eloquent structures where the margin of error is low. This is a simple and economical technique which requires only standard equipment widely available to neurosurgical operating theatres.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

Methods: The medical records of 414 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with CD between 1970 and 2010 were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas from time of CD diagnosis and the cumulative rate of proctectomy from date of first perianal or rectovaginal fistula diagnosis were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Eighty-five patients (20.5%) diagnosed with CD between 1970 and 2010 had at least 1 perianal or rectovaginal fistula episode between January 1, 1970, and June 30, 2016. The cumulative incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas was 18% after 10 years, 23% after 20 years, and 24% after 30-40 years from CD diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas was significantly lower in patients diagnosed in 1998 or after than in patients diagnosed before 1998 (P = 0.03, log-rank). Among 85 patients developing perianal or rectovaginal fistulas, 16 patients (18.8%) underwent proctectomy for the treatment of perianal or rectovaginal fistulas during follow-up. Conclusions: In a population-based inception cohort of CD, one-fifth of patients were diagnosed with at least 1 perianal or rectovaginal fistula.

This compound exerts several biological activities, including neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. However, there is limited pharmacokinetic information on this compound, especially its distribution in neuronal tissue and its route of excretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of oxyresveratrol alone and in combination with piperine as a bioenhancer in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered with oxyresveratrol 10 mg/kg, oxyresveratrol 10 mg/kg plus piperine 1 mg/kg via intravenous or oxyresveratrol 100 mg/kg, oxyresveratrol 100 mg/kg plus piperine 10 mg/kg via oral gavage. Plasma, internal organs, urine, and feces were collected. Determination of the oxyresveratrol concentration in biological samples was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results: The combination with piperine had shown a significantly higher maximum concentration in plasma approximately 1500 μg/L within 1-2 h after oral dosing, and could increase oral bioavailability of oxyresveratrol approximately 2-fold. Oxyresveratrol could widely distributed most of the internal organs with a tissue to plasma ratio of 10-100 fold within 5 min after dosing. Urinary excretion of oxyresveratrol glucuronide was the major route of excretion after administration of oxyresveratrol alone and in combination with piperine. Conclusion: The addition of piperine could enhance some of the pharmacokinetic properties of oxyresveratrol via both intravenous and oral administration.

Repeat discectomy versus spinal fusion is constantly debated, and successful outcomes from both treatments remain unclear. Several meta-analysis studies have not reported re-operative rates between the two treatment methods; therefore, we seek to report these outcomes in the following systematic review and meta-analysis design study. The primary objective was to compare re-operative rates between repeat discectomy and fusion treatment. The secondary objectives included comparing clinical improvement, operative time, blood loss, complications, and postoperative hospital stay between repeat discectomy and fusion treatment. The data were gathered from the following sources: PubMed Medline, Ovid Medline, Cochrane database, and Google Scholars. Only comparative studies in humans were selected. There were initially 182 citations found. After the analysis, we found four studies that were compatible with our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the re-operative rate seemed to be higher in the discectomy group (9.09%) compared with the fusion group (2.00%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The primary cause of re-operation in the discectomy group is recurrent disc herniation. Two causes of re-operation in the fusion group are adjacent segmental degeneration and implant removal. Operative time and postoperative stay were significantly less in the discectomy group. The improvement rate was not different between the two groups. In conclusion, no difference in re-operation rates between the two surgical treatments was found based on the results of our study. Both treatment techniques have equal improvement rates and complications.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

The sample comprised 447 drinkers from four intervention communities and 388 from four non-intervention communities. All were subjected to a series of sequential interviews. Our findings showed that the availability of the community intervention had a significant effect on alcohol abstinence not only during Buddhist Lent (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.96, 3.85), but also 3 months after the end of Buddhist Lent (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.42, 3.38). Furthermore, the intervention was very effective among drinkers who took an abstinence pledge (OR = 7.04, 95% CI = 4.49, 11.04). However, the effectiveness of the community intervention weakened after the intervention it ended. Additional interventions might be required to maintain the effects of the community intervention.","sociology, medical","Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Sociology and Political Science, Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Not only the aircraft taking off and landing but also the aircraft landing in the airport need to be monitored. This paper proposes a saliency-based CNN (convolutional neural network) method for aircraft detection in the remote sensing images. Many researches of aircraft detection access to a method of R-CNN (region convolutional neural network), which generates two thousand or more of proposal regions as candidates of the aircraft. The researches of using a saliency map to extract the objects from the images are still not so many. We adapt a series of preprocessing as transforming to a gray scale image, deleting the noise, binarizing by threshold, the closing operation, and floodfill to generate a saliency map where the contours of all objects are reinforced. Compared to R-CNN, the using of a saliency map greatly reduces the number of proposal regions, thus improving the efficiency. After this, we find the contours of objects and the minimum rectangles enclosing objects to extract proposed regions. Then, we prepare a negative dataset consisting of different types of backgrounds including the land, grass land and concrete. And for a positive dataset, we prepare images of aircraft in different angles and different sizes. To add more variation data into the dataset, we also use methods of augmentation like elastic distortion and perspective transforms. Then, we train a CNN model using the prepared dataset, which can tell whether a proposed region contains aircraft, after training. At last, we use a method named recall to evaluate the performance of the scheme, attaining an average recall of 0.7217, which shows the rate of aircraft successfully detected in all aircraft.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems and Management, Media Technology, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

Semi-wild Assamese and stump-Tailed macaques were selected for the study, which was performed in Thailand. We investigated their locomotor kinematics and its relationship to habitat use. The macaques' positional behavior was recorded with two video cameras, and kinematic parameters were estimated during terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, using the markerless method. The data analyzed so far revealed that stump-Tailed macaques walk with longer, less frequent strides than Assamese macaques. Although stump-Tailed macaques present a smaller angular excursion of the shoulder joint than Assamese macaques, they exhibited a relatively large shoulder girdle motion and anteroposterior translation of the shoulder, which increased their stride length. Additionally, stump-Tailed macaques exhibited a digitigrade gait and elbow extension, suggesting a good adaptation to terrestrial locomotion. Assamese macaques, on the other hand, exhibited a gait that did not seem optimized for terrestrial locomotion, using the hands in a palmigrade posture and frequently flexing the fingers at varying degrees. The kinematic characteristics of the two species studied is consistent with previous field observations reporting that Assamese macaques are highly arboreal, whereas stump-Tailed macaques are more terrestrial.

"The effectiveness of cinacalcet: a randomized, open label study in chronic hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism","Susantitaphong P., Vadcharavivad S., Susomboon T., Singhan W., Dumrongpisutikul N., Jakchairoongruang K., Eiam-Ong S., Praditpornsilpa K.",2019-01-01,"Adult, Calcimimetic Agents, Calcium, Cinacalcet, Female, Fibroblast Growth Factors, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary, Kidney Failure, Chronic, Male, Middle Aged, Parathyroid Hormone, Phosphorus, Renal Dialysis, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome, Young Adult, chronic hemodialysis, Cinacalcet, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism","Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high incidences of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT. Methods: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were randomized to cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the achievement of >30% reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated to further explore the effect of cinacalcet on CKD-MBD parameters for 24-week follow up and 12 additional weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation. Results: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, p =.001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF-23, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24-week follow up and markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet. Conclusions: The effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF-23, and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery.

Discovery of a novel chalcone derivative inhibiting CFTR chloride channel via AMPK activation and its anti-diarrheal application,"Yibcharoenporn C., Chusuth P., Jakakul C., Rungrotmongkol T., Chavasiri W., Muanprasat C.",2019-07-01,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases, Animals, Biological Transport, Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase, Cell Line, Chalcones, Chloride Channels, Chlorides, Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator, Diarrhea, Epithelial Cells, Humans, Intestinal Secretions, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred ICR, AMPK, CFTR, Chalcone, Chloride secretion, Diarrhea","Secretory diarrhea is one of the most common causes of death world-wide especially in children under 5 years old. Isoliquiritigenin (ISLQ), a plant-derived chalcone, has previously been shown to exert anti-secretory action in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting CFTR Cl− channels. However, its CFTR inhibition potency is considerably low (IC50 > 10 μM) with unknown mechanism of action. This study aimed to identify novel chalcone derivatives with improved potency and explore their mechanism of action. Screening of 27 chalcone derivatives identified CHAL-025 as the most potent chalcone analog that reversibly inhibited CFTR-mediated Cl− secretion in T84 cells with an IC50 of ∼1.5 μM. As analyzed by electrophysiological and biochemical analyses, the mechanism of CFTR inhibition by CHAL-025 is through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of CFTR activity. Furthermore, Western blot analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) results suggest that CHAL-025 activates AMPK by binding at the allosteric site of an upstream kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). Interestingly, CHAL-025 inhibited both cholera toxin (CT) and bile acid-induced Cl− secretion in T84 cells and prevented CT-induced intestinal fluid secretion in mice. Therefore, CHAL-025 represents a promising anti-diarrheal agent that inhibits CFTR Cl− channel activity via CaMKKβ-AMPK pathways.","plant science; biochemistryistryhemistry; sEconomicsdary products; flavonoids, including anthocyanins, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology"

The complete triglyceride conversion was observed at 1.35 ± 0.05 times of the transition temperature. The packed alumina enhanced the ester content up to 20%; but it had no effect on the acetin content. Furthermore, this study also intended to determine the effects of the acetin content and thermal cracking on 19 fuel properties of lipid-based biofuel samples synthesized by supercritical ethyl acetate. The optimal condition was found at 380 °C, 20 MPa and ethyl acetate to oil molar ratio of 30:1. First, the density and kinematic viscosity of the biofuels were slightly higher than the maximum values specified by standards because of the presence of triacetin and polymerized products. Second, packing alumina balls increase the mixing intensity and thermal conductivity inside the tubular reactor resulted in higher contents of sulfated ash and carbon residue. Third, the acid values of the biofuel samples were considerably higher than the standard value of biodiesel. However, copper strip corrosion testing resulted in slight tarnishing (level 1A). The corrosiveness of fuels mainly originates from their sulfur compound content, neither biofuel sample was classified as a corrosive material. Furthermore, the high acid values of the samples interfered with the testing of oxidation stability. Finally, beneficial effects of triacetin on cold flow properties were revealed in this study. The cloud point and cold filter plugging point of lipid-based biofuels strongly depended on the thermal stress of the reaction conditions rather than the triacetin concentration.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, process equipment, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

To evaluate the effect in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), LINE-1 methylation levels and patterns have been measured both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Analysis of LINE-1 methylation in cocultured models between HNSCC cell lines and normal PBMCs was performed. The observation of PBMCs of HNSCC patients compared to PBMCs of normal controls was performed using the semiquantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis technique. Results: Downregulation of LINE-1 methylation was significantly found in the PBMCs cocultured with all HNSCC cell lines compared to normal PBMCs. Likewise, a reduction in LINE-1 methylation levels was observed in PBMCs of HNSCC compared to normal PBMCs (p < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the potential of the unmethylated alleles (uCuC) of LINE-1 for distinguishing the PBMCs of HNSCC patients from normal controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: Our data supported that the alteration of LINE-1 methylation levels in PBMCs was influenced by HNSCC secretions. Moreover, the unmethylated LINE-1 allele of PBMCs was proved to be an effective tumor marker and possesses a potential as HNSCC diagnostic tool.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify clusters of children with pHIV after similar developmental trajectories and predictors of belonging to select cognitive trajectory groups. Methods: Participants included children, 4-17 years of age, with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia. Cognitive measures included translated versions of Intelligence Quotient tests, Color Trails Tests and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration conducted semiannually over 3-6 years. The best fit of trajectory groups was determined using maximum likelihood estimation. Multivariate logistic regression identified baseline factors associated with belonging to the lowest scoring trajectory group. Results: Group-based trajectory analyses revealed a 3-cluster classification for each cognitive test, labeled as high, medium and low scoring groups. Most trajectory group scores remained stable across age. Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age. Children in the lowest scoring trajectory group were more likely to present at an older age and report lower household income. Conclusions: Group-based trajectory modeling succinctly classifies cohort heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes in pHIV. Most trajectories remained stable across age suggesting that cognitive potential is likely determined at an early age with the exception of a small subgroup of children who displayed developmental gains in select cognitive domains and may represent those with better cognitive reserve.

Objectives: To identify serum protein markers to detect ESGD using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Study design: Proteomic analysis and bioinformatics. Methods: ESGD was diagnosed using gastroscopy in 30 horses. Gastric ulceration was categorised into three groups: normal, mild/moderate and severe ESGD. Pooled sera from each group were compared using 1D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The candidate proteins for ESGD markers were selected based on their specifically high expression in nonglandular stomach, and their association with gastric ulceration using public gene and protein databases. Results: The prevalence of ESGD in this study was 43% (with mild/moderate ESGD at 33% and severe ESGD at 10%). The proteomic study revealed that the identified serum protein markers for normal equine stomach were B4GALNT2 and XDH. The marker for mild/moderate EGSD was KRT10, while the marker for severe ESGD was KLK13. Furthermore, markers for both ulcer types were SLC4A7, PPARG, FCGBP, PKP1, ASPRV1 and KRT5-like proteins. Main limitations: The functions of the identified proteins are not well characterised in horse. Proteomics is a tool for screening protein markers, but confirmation of putative protein markers with specific antibodies is required. Conclusions: In total, 10 serum proteins found in this study may be used as putative markers for ESGD. However, confirmation of candidate proteins with specific antibodies in a larger study cohort is necessary before it can be used in the veterinary clinic or on horse farms.

In the hybrid amino-CG@PDA microcomposite system, amino-CG was used to encapsulate PDA microspheres that act as a photothermal agent. Near infrared (NIR) irradiation is absorbed by the PDA to generate heat, releasing the amino-CG via gel-to-sol phase transition. By precisely controlling the transition temperature of amino-CG gel at 40 °C by adding a KCl hardening solution at the appropriate concentration, we successfully developed a composite hydrogel that dissolves at 40 °C when heated with NIR irradiation. The amino-CG@PDA was further composited into an aldehyde-introduced dextran hydrogel, which was reported to degrade by reaction with amino compounds. Utilizing the amino-CG release via NIR irradiation, we can successfully control the release of drug incorporated in the hydrogel, in which the NIR irradiation helps to diffuse amino-CG into the dextran hydrogel to initiate the hydrogel degradation by the reaction with aldehyde.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Process Chemistry and Technology, Organic Chemistry"

From preliminary experiments, the catalytic activity decreased in the order: STA25@MIL-101 > SBA25@SBA-15 > USY zeolite. This suggested that isoprene formation was favored with high surface area and high acid strength of catalyst. Then, the porous hybrid material of a MIL-101 metal organic framework and STA was studied in more detail. MIL-101 was not efficient for isoprene synthesis at mild reaction condition. On increasing STA loading, which was well correlated with the Brӧnsted acid property, the catalyst activity increased in the order: MIL-101 < STA30@MIL-101 < STA60@MIL-101. The high acidity catalyst gave high isoprene yield at optimum low temperature and low side reaction products. For the STA30@MIL-101 and STA60@MIL-101 catalysts, the isoprene yield could be sustained at 18.5% (0.4% SD) and 30.0% (1.5% SD), respectively over three recycling runs. It is apparent that no STA leaching from the low STA loading catalyst occurred. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Mammary metabolism and colostrogenesis in sows during late gestation and the colostral period,"Feyera T., Zhou P., Nuntapaitoon M., Sorensen K.U., Krogh U., Bruun T.S., Purup S., Jorgensen H., Poulsen H.D., Theil P.K.",2019-01-01,"Animal Feed, Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Animals, Body Fluids, Colostrum, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Female, Lactation, Lactose, Mammary Glands, Animal, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Animal, Swine, carbon balance, colostrogenesis, dietary fiber, IgG, onset of farrowing, plasma flow","The aims of this study were to investigate 1) the effect of high dietary fiber (DF; 19.3% to 21.7%) supplemented to late gestating sows on mammary uptake and metabolism of energy substrates as well as colostrum production and 2) the ontogeny of colostral fat and lactose synthesis using mammary carbon balance, and colostral protein using IgG as a biomarker. Sows were fed either a control diet (CON) consisting of a standard gestation diet (14.6% DF) until day 108 of gestation and a transition diet (16.8% DF) from day 109 of gestation until farrowing or a high DF treatment where part of the daily ration was replaced with a high DF supplement (FIB). The FIB sows received 19.3% and 21.7% DF in the last 2 wk prior to farrowing. Sows were surgically implanted with permanent indwelling catheters at day 75 ± 2 of gestation and blood samples were collected at 6 different time points in late gestation and at 11 different time points within 24 h after the onset of farrowing. Colostrum samples were collected at 0, 12, and 24 h after the onset of farrowing. Arterial concentration of acetate (P = 0.05) and colostral fat content (P = 0.009) were greater in FIB sows compared with CON sows. Plasma IgG dropped from day-10 relative to farrowing (P < 0.001), suggesting an uptake by the mammary glands. Mammary plasma flow (P = 0.007) and net mammary uptake of glucose (P = 0.04) increased during farrowing while dietary treatment had no effect on net mammary uptake of other energy substrates during late gestation and farrowing. The net mammary uptake of carbon from glucogenic precursors did not equate to the sum of carbons secreted in colostral lactose and released as CO 2, indicating that carbons from ketogenic precursors were likely used for colostral fat and for oxidation. Mammary nonprotein carbon uptake matched the mammary output, indicating that the majority of colostral fat and lactose were produced after the onset of farrowing. In conclusion, high DF included in the diet for late gestating sows increased colostral fat content by 49% but this substantial dietary response could not be explained by the increased carbon uptake from short chain fatty acids during the colostral period. The nonprotein carbon balance of mammary glands during farrowing suggests that the majority of colostral fat and lactose were produced after the onset of farrowing, whereas the drop in plasma IgG in late gestation suggests that the mammary glands take up this colostral component prior to farrowing.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Food Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Genetics"

The AMO-LDH based oxide catalysts with various ratios of Mg/Al were studied for the chemical and physical properties and the activity on esterification of benzoic acid with 2-ethylhexanol. The catalysts were characterized using BET, XRD, TGA, and XPS. Moreover, the acid-base properties were studied by using NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, both XANES and EXAFS. As a result, the Mg/Al mixed oxides after calcination at 500 °C still had the clay structure, and were found to possess both acid and base sites. As the Mg/Al ratio increased, the total density of acid and basic sites decreased. Moreover, the acid-basic strength depended on their phase compositions and coordination number. The activity of calcined LDHs catalysts was tested for the esterification of benzoic acid with 2-ethylhexanol, aimed at producing 2-ethylhexyl benzoate as the desired chemical. The products were analyzed using GC–MS/TOF. In summary, the conversion of benzoic acid was enhanced significantly using the Mg–Al mixed oxides as the catalysts, owing to the acid-base sites (both Mg2+–O2− and Al3+–O2− pairs) of the catalysts. The catalyst with the Mg/Al ratio of 4:1 can convert 66% benzoic acid to 2-ethylhexyl benzoate. Moreover, the other products were composed of 2-ethylhexanal, 3-heptanone, and 3-heptanol because of acid-base pairs.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; chemistryical, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Catalysis, Environmental Science (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this study, we perform a variable selection based on three statistical methods: partial correlation, stepwise regression, and subset regression, to specify the important meteorological variables for solar irradiance prediction in Thailand. The results show that spatial averaging of NWP forecasts over 7×7 grid points provides a reduction of 3.42% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) from NWP forecasts. Model output statistics with and without variable selection can further improve output from spatial averaging by 41.32% and 41.89% NRMSE respectively.

Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Information Systems, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications"
Development of gelatin hydrogel pads incorporated with Eupatorium adenophorum essential oil as antibacterial wound dressing,"Chuysinuan P., Chimnoi N., Reuk-Ngam N., Khlaychan P., Makarasen A., Wetprasit N., Dechtrirat D., Supaphol P., Techasakul S.",2019-02-06,"Anti-bacterial activity, Anti-microbial activity, Antibacterial, Eupatorium adenophorum, Gelatin, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Surgical procedures, Antibacterial, Essential oil, Eupatorium adenophorum, Gelatin, Hydrogel","Abstract: In this study, gelatin hydrogel was obtained by mixing a 10 wt% gelatin solution with essential oil extracted from Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng plant (Crofton weed). This study aimed to fabricate gelatin hydrogel pads containing 5–30% v/v Eupatorium adenophorum emulsion. Incorporation of emulsion into hydrogels caused increase in gel fraction because of a change in the cross-link capacity and decrease in Young’s modulus, levels of stress at maximum load, and fraction of strain at yield, dose-dependently. Furthermore, the swelling and weight loss properties of the tested hydrogels increased with an increase in the emulsion content. E. adenophorum emulsion-loaded gelatin hydrogel pads for patients with open wounds as a result of injury or surgical procedure were evaluated by analyzing the release profiles and the antimicrobial activity of the hydrogels. The emulsion-loaded hydrogel pads presented good antibacterial activity against the test pathogens. The composition of E. adenophorum essential oil was analyzed using GC–MS to further determine the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil. All the emulsion-loaded gelatin hydrogels inhibited the growth of the tested pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the antibacterial activity increased with the increase in initial amount of emulsion in the hydrogels. Thus, hydrogels show potential for use as antibacterial wound dressings.

Six contexts that needs to address for forming sustainable energy sector: 1) Economy's prospect growth and investors' confidence, 2) The risk from economic uncertainty and energy price fluctuations, 3) Environmental issues and climate change, 4) Reliance on imported energy and deficit trade balance, 5) Cost of living from energy expense, and 6) Social conflict from lack of data transparency. The scenario analysis together with an energy accounting model, LEAP [1] are used in this paper. Two scenarios, Reference Scenario (REF) and Blueprint Scenario (BLU), are analyzed to illustrate the picture of Thailand's energy sector from 2014 to 2036. REF underlines a continuation of current government policies (up to 2014). Meanwhile, BLU aims at integrating all plans in TIEB to address the changing and challenging contexts Thailand will encounter in the future while keeping the balance between financial cost and benefit and the potential environmental impacts. Thailand's energy consumption is forecasted to increase 1.8 times (REF) and 1.5 times (BLU) in 2036 compared to 2013. Net Energy import will continuously increase from 2013 accounting for 48% of all primary energy demand and might reach 84% (REF) within 2036; on the other hand, Blueprint Scenario will decrease the imported energy down to only 72% in 2036 [2].","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Conventionally, thermal energy is produced from biomass via combustion process with low thermodynamic efficiency. Conversely, gasification of biomass integrated with innovative power generation technologies, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), offers much higher conversion efficiency. Typically, energy conversion process has multiple conflicting performance criteria, such as capital and operating costs, annual profit, thermodynamic performance and environment impact. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) methods are used to found the optimal compromise in the objective function space, and also to acquire the corresponding optimal values of decision variables. This work investigates integration and optimization of a Sorption Enhanced Steam Biomass Gasification (SEG) with a SOFC and Gas Turbine (GT) system for the production of power and heat from Eucalyptus wood chips. The energy system model is firstly developed in Aspen Plus simulator, which has five main units: (1) SEG coupled with calcium looping for hydrogen-rich gas production, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC-GT for converting hydrogen into electricity, (4) catalytic burning and CO2 compression, and (5) cement production from the purge CaO stream of SEG unit. Then, the design and operating variables of the conversion system are optimized for annual profit, annualized total capital cost, operating cost and exergy efficiency, using MOO. Finally, for the implementation purpose, two selection methods and parametric uncertainty analysis are performed to identify good solutions from the Pareto-optimal front.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

An understanding of the structural properties of HPβCD and its derivatives, based on the number of 2-hydroxypropyl (HP) substituents at the α-D-glucopyranose subunits is rather important. In this work, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the conformational changes of singleand double-sided HP-substitution, called 6-HPβCDs and 2,6-HPβCDs, respectively. The results show that the glucose subunits in both 6-HPβCDs and 2,6-HPβCDs have a lower chance of flipping than in βCD. Also, HP groups occasionally block the hydrophobic cavity of HPβCDs, thus hindering drug inclusion. We found that HPβCDs with a high number of HP-substitutions are more likely to be blocked, while HPβCDs with double-sided HP-substitutions have an even higher probability of being blocked. Overall, 6-HPβCDs with three and four HP-substitutions are highlighted as the most suitable structures for guest encapsulation, based on our conformational analyses, such as structural distortion, the radius of gyration, circularity, and cavity self-closure of the HPβCDs.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The study area was Dang-Yai subdistrict, Baan Mai Chaiyapot district, Buriram province, Thailand. The sampling of particulate matter of less than 10 μm (PM10) was performed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day between 14th and 18th December 2015 inclusively. The PM10 was collected on a glass fiber filter using a nylon cyclone connected to a personal air pump with an air flow rate of 1.7 L/min. The samples were extracted by a microwave digester, and the metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The average exposure concentrations of the workers to Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb were 0.0073 ± 0.0084, 0.2083 ± 0.6362, 0.3499 ± 0.3738 and 0.1297 ± 0.1746 μg/m3, respectively.

Chitosan (CS) is a potential biomaterial for scaffolds due to the rich functionality and cationic property. However, the conventional fabrication of CS-based scaffolds requires more or less toxic cross-linking reagents, and the control of the mechanical property is achieved by the dose of such reagents. In this study, CS scaffolds embedding CS whiskers (CSWK) and hydroxyapatite (HA) are developed via thiol-maleimide Click reaction, of which no by-products generated, followed by alternate soaking of calcium chloride (CaCl2) and disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4). Incorporation of CSWK favors the densed networks and improves the compressive strength. The subsequent HA deposition is not only for gel reinforcement but also osteocompatibility and osteoinductive properties after transforming to scaffold via freeze-drying. In addition, CSWK promotes the HA deposition on/in the gel. The use of Sarcoma osteogenic (SAOS2) cell model confirms cell compatibility as well as cell penetration of CS-CSWK-HA scaffolds. As the mechanical strength of the osteoblast cell compatible CS-CSWK-HA scaffolds can be tuned based on the contents of CSWK, HA, and the degree of crosslinking (via thiol-ene), the CS-CSWK-HA scaffolds are potential material for bone tissue engineering.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Recombinant plasmids with one, two and four cassettes of the MIP gene have been successfully constructed in the pPICZαA expression vector to study the effects of gene copy number on MIP production. The MIP protein can be detected by dot-blot analysis from the culture broth of P. pastoris KM71H 24 h after placement in MMH induction medium. The secretion levels of MIP protein in culture broth at 72 h after induction indicated that P. pastoris KM71H with one cassette of the MIP gene had highest MIP protein levels (4.19 ± 0.96 mg L−1). The transcription levels of the MIP gene increased proportionately with copy number. However, the amount of secreted MIP protein showed no correlation. The MIP molecular mass was 5756.951 Da, as confirmed by typical MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The MIP protein in culture broth was purified by two steps purification including SP Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography followed by ultrafiltration (10 kDa MW cutoff). The percentage of MIP recovery after the two-step purification was 70%, with a single band in a native-PAGE. The biological activity of tryptic hydrolyzed MIP was determined via the expression of the glucose transporter 4 gene (GLUT4) in H9c2 (2-1) cell line by RT-qPCR, and the results demonstrated that the MIP protein can induce glucose uptake and upregulation of GLUT4 mRNA transcription at 3 h and that this activity was related to Humalog® insulin.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; expression systems for foreign products; microbial, biochemistryistry",Biotechnology

Information about position along the horizontal and vertical axes is available from an object’s position on the retina, while position along the depth axis must be inferred based on second-order cues such as the disparity between the images cast on the two retinae. Past work has revealed that object position in two-dimensional (2D) retinotopic space is robustly represented in visual cortex and can be robustly predicted using a multivariate encoding model, in which an explicit axis is modeled for each spatial dimension. However, no study to date has used an encoding model to estimate a representation of stimulus position in depth. Here, we recorded BOLD fMRI while human subjects viewed a stereoscopic random-dot sphere at various positions along the depth (z) and the horizontal (x) axes, and the stimuli were presented across a wider range of disparities (out to ~40 arcmin) compared to previous neuroimaging studies. In addition to performing decoding analyses for comparison to previous work, we built encoding models for depth position and for horizontal position, allowing us to directly compare encoding between these dimensions. Our results validate this method of recovering depth representations from retinotopic cortex.

Given limited data of 2-dose regimens in pediatric population, this study aimed to compare the immunogenicity between 2-dose and 3-dose pre-exposure rabies immunization. Methods: This study was conducted among healthy children aged 2–12 years. They were randomized to 2-dose vaccination (2D) on days 0 and 28 or 3-dose vaccination (3D) on days 0, 7, and 28. Purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV-Verorab™) was administered intramuscularly.

RVNA titers ≥0.5 IU/ml were considered adequate antibody. T cell specific response to rabies vaccine antigen was measured using the interferon-gamma enzyme linked immunospot assay. Results: From September to October 2017, 107 participants (51% males), 78 in 2D group and 29 in 3D group were enrolled. Median age was 5.8 years (IQR 4.4–7.3). All participants had RVNA titers ≥0.5 IU/ml after primary vaccination [GMT 2D: 18.6 (95%CI 15.9–21.8) and 3D: 16.3 (95%CI 13.2–20.1 IU/ml), p = 0.35]. At 1-year prior to receiving the booster, only 80% of the children in 2D group maintained RVNA titers ≥0.5 IU/ml compared to 100% of the children in 3D group (p = 0.01). However, all participants in both groups had RVNA ≥0.5 IU/ml at 7-day post booster vaccination [GMT 2D: 20.9 (95%CI 17.4–25.3) and 3D: 22.2 (95%CI 15.8–31.4) IU/ml (P = 0.75)]. The median number of IFN-γ secreting cells at 7-day post-booster dose was 98 and 128 SFCs per 106 PBMCs in the 2D and 3D groups, respectively (P = 0.30). Conclusions: Two-dose primary rabies immunization provided adequate antibody at post primary vaccination and post booster.

Improving the quality of state variable feedback under the lack of global positioning is imperative for enhancing the motion control performance. This paper proposes an alternative method of wheel slip angle estimation requiring only on-board measurement. The kinematics-based analytical solution is derived so that the slip angle of any free-rolling wheel can be estimated from the measured information of the wheel rolling speed and steering angle, along with the yaw rate and the linear accelerations of the mobile platform. The complete estimation of state variables: traveling speed, sideslip and radius of curvature is obtained from kinematic relationships. An experimental prototype of planar mobile platform is modified from a scaled RWD vehicle with free-rolling front wheel. During extremely sliding random motion, the estimated wheel slip angle and state variables are validated with the motion captured data. This proposed estimation technique can be applied for motion control applications of wheeled mobile robots and automobiles.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computational Mechanics, Control and Systems Engineering, Instrumentation"

Consequently, the need to study and monitor coral reefs is rapidly increasing in order to better understand the impact of environmental change on ocean ecology. There are two major approaches to monitoring coral reef. First, remote sensing, by using satellite imagery and/or aerial photography coral can be studied in large quantity in a very short period of time. The downside of this approach is that images obtained by satellite normally do not have enough spatial resolution and its images are not able to record very deep underwater objects. The second approach is using a diver to perform a detailed investigation of coral reef, which gives a lot more detail, but this approach is very time-consuming and expensive. Our aim is to use a small, commercially available camera as a tool to automatically monitor coral in real-time with the least possible human intervention. The main purpose of this research is to demonstrate that a consumer camera, with a little modification, can be used to detect coral bleaching. The modification was done so that the camera can record images in near-infrared range, which is important for coral detection. In this study, 5 coral species (Porites sp., Turbinaria sp., Acropora sp., Goniopora sp.and Pavona sp.), representing common local species, were induced to bleach by exposure to high water temperature for 24 hours. Images were taken periodically and 6 indices were constructed from those images.

Objective: To determine the benefit of HLA-B allele prescreening and the measurement of drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells in the prevention and identification of the culprit drug in patients with SCARs. Methods: A total of 160 patients with SCARs were recruited from 6 university hospitals in Thailand over a 3-year period. HLA-B alleles were genotypically analyzed. The frequencies of drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells in patients with SCARs were also measured. Results: The drugs commonly responsible for SCARs were anticonvulsants, allopurinol, beta-lactams, antituberculosis agents, and sulfonamides. If culprit drugs had been withheld in patients carrying known HLA-B alleles at risk, it would have prevented 21.2% of SCAR cases, mainly allopurinol- and carbamazepine-related SCARs. Culprit drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells could be identified in 45.7% (53 of 116) of patients with SCARs caused by 5 major drug groups, particularly in patients diagnosed with drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (50.0%), followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (46.0%), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (31.3%). According to our study, high frequencies of drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells were significantly demonstrated in patients who suffered from DRESS phenotype, having anticonvulsants or the drugs belonging to the “probable” category based on the Naranjo algorithm scale, as the culprit drugs. Conclusions: HLA-B prescreening would succeed in preventing only a minority of SCAR victims. Drug-specific IFN-γ-releasing cells are detectable in almost half of patients. Better strategies are required for better SCAR prevention and culprit drug confirmation.",medical,Immunology and Allergy
Synthesis of Cu/TiO2 catalysts by reactive magnetron sputtering deposition and its application for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O to CH4,"Mekasuwandumrong O., Jantarasorn N., Panpranot J., Ratova M., Kelly P., Praserthdam P.",2019-12-01,"CO2 reduction, Electron hole recombination process, Inductive coupled plasma, Photo-catalytic, Photocatalytic reduction, Physio-chemical properties, Reactive magnetron sputtering, Reactive magnetron sputtering deposition, CO2 reduction, Cu/TiO2, Magnetron sputtering, Methane, Photocatalytic","In the present work, a series of Cu/TiO2 catalysts were successfully synthesized by using pulsed direct current (DC) reactive magnetron sputtering of Cu targets under Ar atmosphere onto various TiO2 supports. The physiochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by using inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Vis spectroscopy, N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), PL spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activities of all the catalysts were studied via the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O to CH4 under UV light irradiation. The Cu/TiO2 catalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the uncoated TiO2 supports and the ones made using an impregnation technique. The electron trapping of copper species, which prolonged the electron-hole recombination process, promoted photocatalytic activity of the Cu-doped catalysts. Moreover, the specific morphologies of the Cu species deposited on TiO2 supports and the smaller change of bandgap energy of the sputter coated catalysts also resulted in an improvement of photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and test a method for measurement of skin reduction associated with application of such energy devices. Twenty-five healthy participants with mild to moderate skin laxity of the arms were enrolled. Pinpoint microtattoos were placed at each of the treatment sites to delineate two 6 × 12 cm rectangles per subject. A non-stretchable filament, tape and marking pen apparatus was used to measure the size of each rectangle before treatment and at follow-up visit by two blinded investigators. After randomization, one side received a single pass with a radiofrequency device (6.78 MHz), while the contralateral side received multiple passes. Participants underwent two treatment sessions to each side 2 weeks apart, and returned for follow-up 4 weeks after the second treatment. Length and area measurement were analyzed to assess precision and accuracy of measurements and to compare efficacy of treatment between pre- and post-treatment. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) demonstrated substantial inter-investigator reliability and precision in length measurements (CCC, 0.94 to 0.98 in pre-treatment; 0.95 to 0.98 in post-treatment). Measurements at the 6-week post-treatment follow-up demonstrated a statistically significant skin reduction in all six of the measured parameters. A simple skin measurement method requiring minimal instrumentation can quantitatively evaluate skin shrinkage associated with non-invasive skin-tightening devices.","dermatology and venergyeology, medical","Surgery, Dermatology"

In this paper, we propose a scheme of transforming a basic flowchart into a coloured Petri net so that the designated model could be validated beforehand. A set of mapping rules is proposed to construct the resulting coloured Petri net from a given flowchart. The basic data types, including integer, boolean, and string, are coped in order to simulate the changing of state of variables in the flowchart. The resulting coloured Petri net are simulated and verified to ensure the correctness of its behavior using CPN tools.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

We evaluated the adverse events associated with the use of zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/nevirapine (NVP) for neonatal PEP during the first 6 weeks of life. Methods: A prospective cohort of non-breast-fed HIV-exposed infants was conducted at 5 clinical sites in Thailand. Study population included 100 high-risk HIV-exposed infants (maternal HIV RNA > 50 copies/mL prior to delivery or received antiretroviral therapy less than 12 weeks) and 100 low-risk HIV-exposed neonates. High-risk infants received ZDV/3TC/NVP for 6 weeks whereas low-risk HIV-exposed neonates received a 4-week regimen of ZDV. Complete blood count, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were assessed at birth, 1, 2 and 4 months of life. Results: From October 2015 to November 2017, 200 infants were enrolled, of which 18.5% had low birth weight < 2500 g. The proportion of infants with anemia grade 2 or higher at 1 and 2 months of life between ZDV/3TC/NVP and ZDV prophylaxis was 48.5% vs 32.3% (P=0.02); nevertheless, severe anemia (grade 3) was not significantly different; 9.2% vs 10.2% (P=0.81), respectively. At 1 month old, infants on ZDV/3TC/NVP prophylaxis had significantly higher grade 2 anemia versus infants on ZDV alone (33.0% vs 13.4%; P=0.001); however, no difference was observed at 2 months old. No differences in neutropenia or hepatotoxicity between infant prophylactic regimens were observed. Conclusions: Triple antiretroviral neonatal PEP with ZDV/3TC/NVP for 6 weeks in high-risk HIV-exposed infants did not significantly increase the risk of short-term toxicity compared with ZDV-monotherapy prophylaxis.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Because it could separate different sizes of cells and has potential to integrate together with other components for a biological study of a single cell. However, hydrodynamic forces in spiral section and other components could potentially cause cell to death and change in cell physical and biological properties, but there was rarely such study so far. Therefore, the investigation of cell viability in a setup of spiral microchannel including feeding system and spiral microchannel was performed in this work. Beside the cell viability investigation, the change in cell morphology and intracellular structures were also investigated. The results indicated that stresses - extensional and shear stresses might be the important factors affecting cell death. The significant loss of cell viability was not found in feeding system but 15-18% of cell loss occurred in a spiral microchannel instead.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical Engineering, Instrumentation"
Pyrolysis of Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata waste for bio-oil production using a fly ash derived ZSM-5 catalyst,"Soongprasit K., Sricharoenchaikul V., Atong D.",2019-05-01,"Bio oil, Drop tubes, Fast pyrolysis, Pongamia pinnata, Py-GCMS, ZSM-5, Bio-oil, Biomass, Drop-tube pyrolyzer, Fast pyrolysis, Pongamia pinnata, Py-GCMS, ZSM-5","Fast pyrolysis of Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata waste (PPW) was performed using a scaled-up 180-cm drop-tube pyrolyzer with fly ash (FA)-derived ZSM-5 (FA-ZSM-5) as a deoxygenation and denitrogenation catalyst to upgrade the liquid products. The oil from P. pinnata is typically extracted to produce bio-fuel leaving a large amount of PPW that has some 20% (v/v) oil content. Since the PPW is inedible, due to its toxicity from karanjin and di-ketone pongamol, it represents a potential non-food competing ‘green’ biofuel feedstock. The FA-ZSM-5 catalyst applied in this work was synthesized using alkali hydrothermal treatment of coal FA to yield FA-ZSM-5 with a 329 m 2 /g surface area and 37.18 Å pore diameter. Pyrolyzer-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to locate the optimal operating window prior to executing a scaled-up reactor operation at 400–700 °C). A maximum bio-oil yield of 43.1% by proportion was obtained at 500 °C, while the solid and gas products were 32.5% and 24.4%, respectively. Oleic acid was a major component in the bio-oil obtained from the non-catalytic condition, while ketones were prominent (79.4%) when FA-ZSM-5 was used, albeit with a low hydrocarbon (HC) selectivity. From the carbon chain length analysis, thermal cracking to smaller molecules was dominant in the presence of the FA-ZSM-5 catalyst, inducing a low HC yield in the liquid product.","chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

Methods: This is a retrospective pre and post, observational, quality improvement study conducted in an 18-bed medical-surgical-cardiac, tertiary intensive care unit. We included patients consecutively admitted from October 1 to March 31 (pre-period 2015-2016, post-period 2016-2017) who were mechanically ventilated beyond 48 hours. A multidisciplinary team, including a family advisor, implemented the following interventions using rapid “Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles:” (a) standardized pain and sedation assessments, (b) standardized sedation goal setting, and (c) non-pharmacological strategies to manage pain and agitation. We did not implement any specific sedation protocol. We used audit and feedback to reinforce change. Results: The post-intervention phase started once sedation scores were documented q12h for >60% of patients. The groups (n = 45 per group) were similar regarding demographics, severity of illness, and mechanical ventilation duration, but different in length of intensive care stay. The cumulative dose of midazolam equivalent was significantly lower in the post-intervention period (3.71 vs 2.65 mg/kg/mechanical ventilation day, P = 0.009, 95% CI: −1.12 (−1.89, −0.31)). Morphine equivalent usage went from 3.51 to 2.57 mg/kg/mechanical ventilation day (P = 0.066, 95% CI: −0.67 [−1.44, 0.05]). There were no significant pre-post-differences in the use of other sedative agents, rates of iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome or severe pain, nor medication cost. Conclusion: Implementation of a multifaceted QI project was successful at increasing standardized assessments of pain and agitation, and was associated with a significant reduction in midazolam use.

The aim of the study was to examine modes of death and clinical outcomes in Thai patients with HCM. Methods: Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013, 166 consecutive patients with HCM diagnosed in our institution were evaluated. Five patients were excluded because of non-Thai ethnic groups (n = 3) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction at initial presentation documented by coronary angiography (n = 2). The final study population consisted of 161 patients with HCM. HCM-related deaths included: (1) sudden cardiac death (SCD) - death due to sudden cardiac arrest or unexpected sudden death; (2) heart failure - death due to refractory heart failure; or (3) stroke - death due to embolic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. MACEs included: (1) SCD, sudden unexpected aborted cardiac arrest, fatal, or nonfatal ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia); (2) heart failure (fatal or non-fatal), or heart transplantation; or (3) stroke - fatal or non-fatal embolic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. Results: One hundred and sixty-one Thai patients with HCM (age 66 ± 16 years, 58% female) were enrolled. Forty-two patients (26%) died over a median follow-up period of 6.8 years including 25 patients (16%) with HCM-related deaths (2%/year).

Complete HERV sequences betray their endogenous retroviral origin, with open reading frames in gag, pro, pol and env being flanked by two long terminal repeats containing promoter and enhancer sequences with the capacity to regulate HERV transactivation and the activity of host genes in spite of endogenous epigenetic repression mechanisms. HERV virions, RNA, cDNA, Gag and Env, and antibodies to HERV transcriptional products, have variously been found in the blood and/or brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients, with the HERV expression level being associated with disease status. Furthermore, some HERV-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as rs662139 T/C in a 3-kb region of Xq22.3 containing a HERV-W env locus, and rs391745, upstream of the HERV-Fc1 locus on the X chromosome, are associated with MS susceptibility, while a negative association has been reported with SNPs in the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein-encoding genes TRIM5 and TRIM22. Factors affecting HERV transcription include immune activation and inflammation, since HERV promoter regions possess binding sites for related transcription factors; oxidative stress, with oxidation of guanine to 8-oxoguanine and conversion of cytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine preventing binding of methyl groups transferred by DNA methyltransferases; oxidative stress also inhibits the activity of deacetylases, thereby favouring the acetylation of histone lysine residues favouring gene expression; interferon beta; natalizumab treatment; impaired epigenetic regulation; and the sex of patients.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Methods: A cross-sectional study of IBD patients treated with VDZ with VTLs checked between July 1, 2016, and March 1, 2017, was conducted. Mucosal healing was defined as absence of mucosal ulcers in Crohn's disease (CD) and Mayo endoscopic score ≤1 for ulcerative colitis (UC). Normal CRP was defined as ≤8 mg/L. Results: A total of 171 patients (62% CD, 31% UC, 7% indeterminate colitis) were included. Median VTLs was 15.3 ug/mL (range, 0-60), and 1 patient had detectable antibodies to VDZ. Patients with a normal CRP had a median VTLs of 17.3 ug/mL vs 10.7 ug/mL in high CRP patients (P = 0.046). This was noted in CD (20.3 vs 10.4 ug/mL; P = 0.005) but not in UC patients (14.4 vs 20.8; P = 0.72).

The resultant nanostructured La2O3 possessed high specific surface area of 211.5 m2/g, and Ni/La2O3-m catalysts maintained the initial morphology upon thermal treatment. The mesostructure was beneﬁcial to obtain and maintain Ni nanoparticles with sizes between 4–6 nm. Ni/La2O3-m catalysts exhibited superior activity and stability in dry reforming of methane, showing excellent performance in activating both CH4 and CO2 due to more catalytically active Ni sites and increased interfaces. In situ DRIFTS indicated that bidentate carbonate participates in coke elimination. Combined with CO2-TPD and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that Ni/La2O3-m catalyst has stronger capability to promote the formation of bidentate carbonate due to the increased interfaces by enhancing Ni dispersion, which leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Catalysis, Environmental Science (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"
Semantic segmentation on remotely sensed images using an enhanced global convolutional network with channel attention and domain specific transfer learning,"Panboonyuen T., Jitkajornwanich K., Lawawirojwong S., Srestasathiern P., Vateekul P.",2019-01-01,"Channel attention, Convolutional networks, Deep convolutional neural networks, ISPRS Vaihingen, LANDSAT, Multi-class segmentations, Transfer learning, Channel attention, Deep convolutional neural networks, Global convolutional network, ISPRS Vaihingen, Landsat-8, Multi-class segmentation, Transfer learning","In the remote sensing domain, it is crucial to complete semantic segmentation on the raster images, e.g., river, building, forest, etc., on raster images. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network is the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network. Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution remotely sensed images. Second, ""channel attention"" is presented in our network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features). Third, ""domain-specific transfer learning"" is introduced to alleviate the scarcity issue by utilizing other remotely sensed corpora with different resolutions as pre-trained data. The experiment was then conducted on two given datasets: (i) medium resolution data collected from Landsat-8 satellite and (ii) very high resolution data called the ISPRS Vaihingen Challenge Dataset. The results show that our networks outperformed DCED in terms of F1 for 17.48% and 2.49% on medium and very high resolution corpora, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)
Hydrogen production from the oxidative steam reforming of methanol over Au–Cu nanoparticles supported on Ce1-xZrxO2 in a fixed-bed reactor,"Luengnaruemitchai A., Pojanavaraphan C., Kumyam A., Thunyaratchatanon C., Gulari E.",2019-01-15,"Bimetallic catalysts, Cu nano-particles, Electron transfer, Identical conditions, Monometallic catalysts, Oxidative steam reforming, Oxidative steam reforming of methanols, Temperature range, CeO2–ZrO2, Copper, Gold, Methanol, Oxidative steam reforming, Solid solution","Oxidative steam reforming of methanol over monometallic gold (Au) and bimetallic Au-copper (Cu) supported on ceria-zirconia (CeO2–ZrO2) was examined over the temperature range of 200–400 °C in a fixed-bed reactor. The composition of CeO2–ZrO2 supports was also studied for their catalytic activity. The Au/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalyst exhibited the highest methanol (CH3OH) conversion level (96.7%) and hydrogen (H2) yield (59.7%) due to the formation of a homogeneous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution. When Cu was introduced in the Au catalysts, all of the bimetallic catalysts presented a better stability for CH3OH conversion as well as H2 yield in comparison to the monometallic catalysts, which was due to the partial electron transfer from Cu to Au metals. The performance of the Au–Cu/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 catalysts, which was evaluated under identical conditions, was ranked in the order: 3Au1Cu > 1Au3Cu > 1Au1Cu.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) is an essential enzyme for the HIV replication, and therefore, it is an important target for antiretroviral drugs development, particularly from natural products. Auricularia polytricha (AP) is an edible mushroom with several important therapeutic properties. These properties will be investigated as HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Methods: The sequential hexane (APH), ethanol (APE) and water (APW) extracts from AP were screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR. The extract that consistently showed the strong HIV-1 PR inhibition was further investigated for its phytochemical constituents. The compounds were purified by column chromatography. The isolated compounds were structurally elucidated using 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, FTIR, and GC/MS techniques. Each compound was screened against HIV-1 PR to determine its inhibitory activity and to provide an explanation for the activity found in the extract. Results: Hexane crude extract of AP (APH) exhibited significant inhibition on HIV-1 PR activity. Four major compounds isolated from APH fraction were identified to be two triacylglycerols, linoleic acid and ergosterol. Moreover, all four compounds showed significant inhibition of HIV-1 PR activity. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that AP is a good source of fatty esters, fatty acids and ergosterol. These natural products exhibit anti-HIV-1 properties by blocking HIV-1 PR. These important biological results warrant further development of AP as an alternative antiretroviral drug.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Gabapentin and pregabalin to treat aggressivity in dementia: a systematic review and illustrative case report,"Supasitthumrong T., Bolea-Alamanac B.M., Asmer S., Woo V.L., Abdool P.S., Davies S.J.C.",2019-04-01,"Aged, Aggression, Alzheimer Disease, Calcium Channel Blockers, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Gabapentin, Humans, Male, Pregabalin, Treatment Outcome, Clinical pharmacology, dementia, neurology, pharmacotherapy, statistics and study design, systematic review","Aims: The prevalence of dementia is rising as life expectancy increases globally. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including agitation and aggression, are common, presenting a challenge to clinicians and caregivers. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed evidence for gabapentin and pregabalin against BPSD symptoms of agitation or aggression in any dementia, using six databases (Pubmed, CINHL, PsychINFO, HealthStar, Embase, and Web of Science). Complementing this formal systematic review, an illustrative case of a patient with BPSD in mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia, who appeared to derive benefits in terms of symptom control and functioning from the introduction of gabapentin titrated up to 3600 mg day −1 alongside other interventions, is presented. Results: Twenty-four relevant articles were identified in the systematic review. There were no randomized trials. Fifteen papers were original case series/case reports of patients treated with these compounds, encompassing 87 patients given gabapentin and six given pregabalin. In 12 of 15 papers, drug treatment was effective in the majority of cases. The remaining nine papers were solely reviews, of which two were described as systematic but predated PRISMA guidelines. Preliminary low-grade evidence based on case series and case reviews suggests possible benefit of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with BPSD in Alzheimer's disease. These benefits cannot be confirmed until well-powered randomized controlled trials are undertaken. Evidence in frontotemporal dementia is lacking. Conclusion: Gabapentin and pregabalin could be considered for BPSD when medications having stronger evidence bases (risperidone, other antipsychotics, carbamazepine and citalopram) have been ineffective or present unacceptable risks of adverse outcomes.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

A tailormade diagnostic test on the 10 underlying academic reading skills was constructed. Each skill was measured by four test items using a pass criterion of 75% (≥ 3 out of 4). The TSC was performed on the skill scores and ten personal attributes of 297 first-year university students. The precluster step generated three subclusters. Further analysis (N= 221) created a predictive solution of five clusters with 95.5% accuracy. A final analysis using Pearson's correlation revealed four groups of positive relationships. Lead users from each type were then assigned self-tutoring lessons to learn for two weeks. The results revealed that 56% of lead users had equal or higher scores and 68% of them passed an equal or higher number of skills than in the pretest. Students' types disclosed by the TSC were thus able to predict and the IDF was able to diagnose and scaffold most of the students in academic reading skills. Because the IDF was not so powerful for lower-proficiency students, future research should focus more on those students.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, sociology","Computer Science (all), Education"

There is indirect evidence that C cells may be derived from progenitor cells of the midline thyroid primordium. This is supported by the recent concept of the endodermal origin of lateral thyroid anlagen and several case reports. We aimed to search for neuroendocrine cells in TGD cysts and to characterize immunophenotype of the thyroid follicles and epithelial lining of TGD. Out of 98 TGD cysts, 70% contained both cyst-lining epithelium and thyroid follicles, whereas 30% possessed only cyst-lining epithelium. Specimens eligible for immunohistochemistry (n = 61) were stained for thyroid-specific and neuroendocrine markers. Thyroid remnants were positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and other thyroid tissue-specific markers and negative for calcitonin. TGD epithelium showed strong p63 positivity. We found that respiratory epithelium in 9.8% of TGDs contained neuroendocrine cells positive for calcitonin, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin but negative for carcinoembryonic antigen. In 44.2% of the cases, we detected compact buds, microscopic structures appearing as nests of epithelial cells with a biphasic population of basal (p63+) and central (TTF-1+) cells. Thyroid remnants in TGD expressed full spectrum of thyroid-specific markers and contained no C cells. Instead, calcitonin-expressing neuroendocrine cells were found among the respiratory epithelium of TGD. These cells can be a potential source of neuroendocrine tumors mimicking medullary carcinoma in median anlage derivatives. We also discovered precursor compact buds with dual immunophenotype and proposed a concept of their morphogenesis.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"
Effect of light on blinking in patients with idiopathic isolated blepharospasm,"Wu Y., Cho H.J., Panyakaew P., Savant C.S., Wu T., Dang N., Hallett M.",2019-10-01,"Aged, Blepharospasm, Blinking, Case-Control Studies, Electromyography, Eyeglasses, Female, Humans, Light, Male, Middle Aged, Photic Stimulation, Photophobia, Retinal Ganglion Cells, Rod Opsins, Blepharospasm, Blink rate, Dystonia, Photophobia","Objective: Melanopsin may be involved in the pathophysiology of photophobia in idiopathic isolated blepharospasm. We assessed the efficacy of blocking wavelengths of melanopsin absorption to reduce blinking in blepharospasm as a possible surrogate for photophobia. Methods: Twenty-one participants (11 blepharospasm and 10 healthy controls) were studied. There were three sessions: (1) a baseline condition to measure the blink rate (BR) without intervention; (2) two conditions where the participants received intermittent light stimuli with high or low intensity without wearing study lenses; (3) four conditions in which the participants received intermittent light stimuli with high intensity while wearing one of four different lenses: tinted lenses with neutral gray or FL-41, or coated lenses that block 480-nm or 590-nm wavelength. The primary outcome measure was the BR. Results: The blepharospasm group blinked more frequently than controls in dim room conditions. Patients reported greater photosensitivity compared to controls based on the questionnaire and exhibited a higher BR with intermittent light stimuli. The BR decreased for both groups when using 480-nm and 590-nm blocking lenses. In the patients, 480-nm and 590-nm blocking lenses reduced the mean BR by 9.6 blink/min and 10.3 blink/min, respectively, while in the control group, the mean BR decreased by 4.4 blink/min and 4.3 blink/min, respectively. Conclusions: Blepharospasm patients had increased BR with light stimuli which decreased with 590-nm and 480-nm blocking lenses. The 480-nm- and 590-nm- coated lenses might have therapeutic potential in treating photophobia although BR does not appear to be an optimal biomarker for photophobia.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"
Optimal Overbooking Decision for Perishable Resources with Jointly Stochastic Booking and Show-up Requests,"Jongcheveevat S., Phumchusri N., Vilasdaechanont A.",2019-01-09,"Available capacity, Decision makers, Opportunity costs, perishable resources, Request rejections, Revenue management, Risky decisions, Uncertain demand, Overbooking model, perishable resources, revenue management","Overbooking is a methodology in revenue management to optimize important decision making for perishable resources or services with uncertain demand. Overbooking allows an incoming booking to be accepted in exceedance of an available capacity because it is believed that some booking will be cancelled later. It is a complicated and risky decision since the decision maker needs to minimize both outsourcing cost and opportunity-lost cost simultaneously. When there are two classes of resources, it is not necessary to always outsource the insufficient and Iow-priced resources. Upgrading customers to high-priced resources is possible. The objective of this research is to develop overbooking models for (1) one class of resources and (2) two classes of resources (ie, high and low price) to minimize total cost i. e., opportunity cost, cost of upgrading and outsource cost). The main contribution of this research is that, unlike other existing literatures, the opportunity cost considered is specifically identified in the situation where too much booking request rejection of each type of resources is present. Sensitivity analysis of our model is also shown for managerial insights.","fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

To test the hypothesis that intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide; BIIB093) reduces ischemic brain water uptake, we quantified the lesional net water uptake (NWU) on serial CT scans from patients enrolled in the phase 2 GAMES-RP Trial (Glyburide Advantage in Malignant Edema and Stroke). Methods- This was a post hoc exploratory analysis of the GAMES-RP study. Noncontrast CT scans performed between admission and day 7 (n=264) were analyzed in the GAMES-RP modified intention-to-treat sample. Quantitative change in CT radiodensity (ie, NWU) and midline shift (MLS) was measured. The gray and white matter NWU were also examined separately. Repeated-measures mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of intravenous glibenclamide on MLS or NWU. Results- A median of 3 CT scans (interquartile range, 2-4) were performed per patient during the first 7 days after stroke. In a repeated-measures regression model, greater NWU was associated with increased MLS (β=0.23; 95% CI, 0.20-0.26; P<0.001). Treatment with intravenous glibenclamide was associated with reduced NWU (β=-2.80; 95% CI, -5.07 to -0.53; P=0.016) and reduced MLS (β=-1.50; 95% CI, -2.71 to -0.28; P=0.016). Treatment with intravenous glibenclamide reduced both gray and white matter water uptake. In mediation analysis, gray matter NWU (β=0.15; 95% CI, 0.11-0.20; P<0.001) contributed to a greater proportion of MLS mass effect, as compared with white matter NWU (β=0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13; P=0.001). Conclusions- In this phase 2 post hoc analysis, intravenous glibenclamide reduced both water accumulation and mass effect after large hemispheric infarction. This study demonstrates NWU is a quantitative and modifiable biomarker of ischemic brain edema accumulation. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Some short tandem repeat sequences, distributed throughout the human genome, can play a role as cis-regulatory elements of the genes. Distributions of tandem long (≥10) and short (<10) A-T repeats in the genome are different depending on gene functions. Long repeats are more commonly found in housekeeping genes and may regulate genes in harmonious fashion. Mononucleotide A-repeats around transcription start sites interact with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) to regulate gene expression. miRNA-bound AGO alterations in cancer have been reported; consequently, these changes would affect genes containing mononucleotide A- and T-repeats. Here, we showed an unprecedented hallmark of gene regulation in cancer. We evaluated the gene expression profiles reported in the Gene Expression Omnibus and found a high density of 13–27 A-T repeats in the up-regulated genes in malignancies derived from the bladder, cervix, head and neck, ovary, vulva, breast, colon, liver, lung, prostate, kidney, thyroid, adrenal gland, bone, blood cells, muscle and brain. Transfection of cell-penetrating protein tag AGO1 containing poly uracils (CPP-AGO1-polyUs) to the lung cancer cell lines altered gene regulation depending on the presence of long A-T repeats. CPP-AGO1-polyUs limited cell proliferation and the ability of a cancer cell to grow into a colony in lung cancer cell lines. In conclusion, long A-T repeats up-regulated many genes in cancer that can be targeted by AGO1 to change the expression of many genes and limited cancer growth.",biochemistryistry,Genetics

Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients with an edentulous area at the posterior mandible were enrolled. Thirty OsseoSpeed EV Astra Tech implants (Dentsply Sirona), 4.2 mm in diameter, were placed. Twenty implants were placed without bone regeneration (no dehiscence group), while 10 presented with favorable bone defects and received simultaneous guided bone regeneration with dental implant placement (dehiscence group). At the time of implant placement, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, resonance frequency analysis was utilized. The changes in ISQ values within group were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the mean ISQ values between the no dehiscence and dehiscence groups were compared using unpaired t tests. Results: All implants were successfully integrated without complication. The no dehiscence group demonstrated mean ISQ values of 74.30 ± 6.01, 69.58 ± 5.30, 71.10 ± 5.80, 75.08 ± 3.93, and 77.85 ± 3.18 at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively.

We investigated if added angiographic embolisation after endoscopic haemostasis to high-risk ulcers could reduce recurrent bleeding. Design After endoscopic haemostasis to their bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers, we randomised patients with at least one of these criteria (ulcers≥20 mm in size, spurting bleeding, hypotensive shock or haemoglobin<9 g/dL) to receive added angiographic embolisation or standard treatment. Our primary endpoint was recurrent bleeding within 30 days. Results Between January 2010 and July 2014, 241 patients were randomised (added angiographic embolisation n=118, standard treatment n=123); 22 of 118 patients (18.6%) randomised to angiography did not receive embolisation. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 12 (10.2%) in the embolisation and 14 (11.4%) in the standard treatment group reached the primary endpoint (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.46; p=0.745). The rate of reinterventions (13 vs 17; p=0.510) and deaths (3 vs 5, p=0.519) were similar.

ESI-MS spectra for different forms of tau protein (full-length, fragments, phosphorylated, etc.) in the presence of CLR01 indicate a primary binding stoichiometry of 1:1. The relatively high charging of the protein measured from non-denaturing solutions is typical of intrinsically disordered proteins, such as tau. Top-down mass spectrometry using electron capture dissociation (ECD) is a tool used to determine not only the sites of post-translational modifications but also the binding site(s) of non-covalent interacting ligands to biomolecules. The intact protein and the protein-modulator complex were subjected to ECD-MS to obtain sequence information, map phosphorylation sites, and pinpoint the sites of inhibitor binding. The ESI-MS study of intact tau proteins indicates that top-down MS is amenable to the study of various tau isoforms and their post-translational modifications (PTMs). The ECD-MS data point to a CLR01 binding site in the microtubule-binding region of tau, spanning residues K294-K331, which includes a six-residue nucleating segment PHF6 (VQIVYK) implicated in aggregation. Furthermore, ion mobility experiments on the tau fragment in the presence of CLR01 and phosphorylated tau reveal a shift towards a more compact structure. The mass spectrometry study suggests a picture for the molecular mechanism of the modulation of protein-protein interactions in tau by CLR01.

High lactate levels are associated with parasitized erythrocyte sequestration in the microcirculation. To assess if there is an additional contribution to hyperlactataemia from relatively inadequate total oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and delivery were investigated in patients with malaria. Methods: Adult Bangladeshi and Indian patients with uncomplicated (N = 50) or severe (N = 46) falciparum malaria or suspected bacterial sepsis (N = 27) and healthy participants as controls (N = 26) were recruited at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh and Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, India. Oxygen delivery (DO 2 I) was estimated from pulse oximetry, echocardiographic estimates of cardiac index and haematocrit. Oxygen consumption (VO 2 I) was estimated by expired gas collection. Results: VO 2 I was elevated in uncomplicated median (IQR) 185.1 ml/min/m 2 (135-215.9) and severe malaria 192 ml/min/m 2 (140.7-227.9) relative to healthy persons 107.9 ml/min/m 2 (69.9-138.1) (both p < 0.001). Median DO 2 I was similar in uncomplicated 515 ml/min/m 2 (432-612) and severe 487 ml/min/m 2 (382-601) malaria and healthy persons 503 ml/min/m 2 (447-517) (p = 0.27 and 0.89, respectively). The VO 2 /DO 2 ratio was, therefore, increased by similar amounts in both uncomplicated 0.35 (0.28-0.44) and severe malaria 0.38 (0.29-0.48) relative to healthy participants 0.23 (0.17-0.28) (both p < 0.001). VO 2 I, DO 2 I and VO 2 /DO 2 did not correlate with plasma lactate concentrations in severe malaria. Conclusions: Reduced total oxygen delivery is not a major contributor to lactic acidosis in severe falciparum malaria.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

It is found that for low growth rates, anti-phase domain (APD) boundaries formed during the growth of GaAs on Ge can effectively act as the preferential nucleation position of InSb QDs. For high growth rates, InSb/GaAs QDs nucleate on both the APD boundary and the APD surface, leading to high density-InSb QDs. The QD morphologies on the APD boundary and the APD surface are distinctly different. The roles of growth rate and local growth position on the morphology of realized QDs are described. By varying the growth conditions, low density and locally aligned QDs as well as high density InSb QDs can be obtained.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Inorganic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Herein, an in situ forming biomimetic hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel was used as a matrix to dope a pH-controllable H2S donor, JK1, to form a novel HA-JK1 hybrid system. This HA-JK1 hydrogel was designed as an ideal delivery scaffold for JK1 with pH-dependent prolonged H2S releasing profile. In vitro study suggested that JK1 could induce the polarization of M2 phenotype indicating a higher pro-healing efficiency of macrophages. The in vivo studies on dermal wounds showed that the HA-JK1 hybrid hydrogel significantly accelerated the wound regeneration process through enhanced re-epithelialization, collagen deposition, angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the in vivo results also demonstrated a higher level of M2 polarization in HA-JK1 treated group with reduced inflammation and improved wound remodeling effects, which was consistent with the in vitro results. These observations could be considered as a key to the efficient wound treatment. Therefore, we suggest that HA-JK1 can be used as a novel wound dressing material toward cutaneous wound model in vivo. This system should significantly enhance wound regeneration through the release of H2S that induces the expression of M2 macrophage phenotype.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, biochemistryistry, engineering","Bioengineering, Ceramics and Composites, Biophysics, Biomaterials, Mechanics of Materials"

Ocular sequelae include corneal endothelial damage which can cause corneal oedema and failure, as well as glaucoma. Recurrences of inflammation are common and therefore patients are often exposed to long-term therapy. Oral therapy is available in the form of valganciclovir, although with the caveat of systemic side effects such as bone marrow suppression and renal failure necessitating regular interval laboratory monitoring. Recent reports have demonstrated that topical 2% ganciclovir solution may offer promising treatment outcomes in patients with CMV anterior uveitis with superior safety, cost-effectiveness and convenience profiles. An investigation into the relative equipoise of these therapies is warranted for these reasons. Methods and analysis The Systemic and Topical Control of Cytomegalovirus Anterior uveitis: Treatment Outcomes (STACCATO) trial is designed as a multicentre, block randomised by site, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of oral valganciclovir, 2% topical ganciclovir and placebo in treating PCR-proven CMV anterior uveitis. Participant clinical evaluation will occur at three study time points by a masked study ophthalmologist over a 28-day period to assess resolution of ocular inflammation (secondary outcome). A control group will provide additional information about the possible impact that the infected host's immune response may play in controlling local viral replication. The primary analysis is an analysis of covariance (three arms) correcting for baseline to compare quantitative CMV viral load in the anterior chamber (AC) aqueous fluid before and 7 days after treatment. Ethics and dissemination The University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research and the Khon Kaen University Institutional Review Board have given ethical approval. The results of this trial will be presented at local and international meetings and submitted for peer-reviewed journals for publication.

Furthermore, HD process itself might cause undesirable myocardial injury and enhance post HD hsTnI levels. This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to compare the hsTnI levels between 100 asymptomatic HD patients and their 107 matched non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The hsTnI levels in HD group were higher than non-CKD group [median (IQR): 54.3 (20.6–152.7) vs. 18 (6.2–66.1) ng/L, p <.001)]. The hsTnI levels reduced after HD process from 54.3 (20.6–152.7) ng/L in pre-HD to 27.1 (12.3–91.4) ng/L in post-HD (p =.015). Of interest, 25% of HD patients had increment of hsTnI after HD and might represent HD-induced myocardial injury. The significant risk factors were high hemoglobin level and high blood flow rate. In conclusion, the baseline hsTnI levels in asymptomatic HD patients were higher than non-CKD population. The dynamic change of hsTnI over time would be essential for the diagnosis of AMI. Certain numbers of asymptomatic HD patients had HD-induced silent myocardial injury and should be aggressively investigated to prevent further cardiovascular mortality.",medical,"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine, Nephrology"

Benzoxazine dimer is a good candidate for expressing multi-responsive properties based on the type of phenol in combination with its metal complexation. The present work proposes a vinyl monomer containing a benzoxazine pendant, which contains an azo group as the functional monomer. The copolymerization with methylmethacrylate (MMA) via atom transfer radical polymerization leads to a block copolymer, specifically, PA-Azo-C3-b-PMMA, which forms uniform nanoparticles. The ring opening of benzoxazine monomer results in dimer pendants. The copolymer obtained, PA-Azo-C3-b-PMMA, shows multi-responsive functions in terms of metal ion complexation, and UV responsiveness through the dimer pendants and azobenzene groups. The UV exposure results in loss of uniformity of the nanoparticles as well as a decrease in size. This work demonstrates the role of benzoxazine pendants in developing PMMA copolymer showing external stimuli responsive functions.","physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The causative spirochetes have reservoirs in mammalian hosts, but there has been limited analysis of the genomes of isolates recovered from animals. The aims of this study were to characterize genomic features of two Leptospira interrogans strains recently isolated from asymptomatic dogs in Thailand (strains CUDO5 and CDUO8), and to perform comparative genome analyses with other strains. Molecular adaptive evolution in L. interrogans as signaled by positive selection also was analyzed. Results: Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 had genome sizes of approximately 4.9 Mbp with 35.1% GC contents. Using monoclonal antibodies, strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were identified as serovars Paidjan and Dadas, respectively. These strains harbored genes known to be associated with acute and chronic infections. Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms phylogeny (SNPs) with 97 L. interrogans strains, CUDO5 and CUDO8 had closest genetic relatedness with each other. Nevertheless, the serovar determinant region (rfb locus) showed variations in the genes encoding sugar biosynthesis. Amongst 13 representative L. interrogans strains examined for molecular adaptive evolution through positive selection under the site-model of Phylogenetic Analysis of Maximum Likelihood, genes responsible for iron acquisition (tlyA and hbpA), motility (fliN2, flgK, and flhB) and thermal adaptation (lpxD1) were under increased selective pressure. Conclusions: L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 had close genetic relatedness as analyzed by SNPs phylogeny. They contained genes with established roles in acute and chronic leptospirosis. The rfb locus in both serovars showed gene variation associated with sugar biosynthesis. Positive selection analysis indicated that genes encoding factors involved in motility, temperature adaptation, and iron acquisition were under strong positive selection in L. interrogans. These may be associated with adaptation in the early stages of infection.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biotechnology, Genetics"

Increasing acid concentration, temperature and heating time resulted in the products with darker color, higher solubility, reducing sugar content, total dietary fiber and proportion of high molecular weight fiber fraction. An endothermic peak at 45–70 °C, having enthalpy of 1.66–2.14 J/g, was found from the samples processed under mild conditions (0.04–0.08% HCl, 100 °C, 60 min). However, harsher dextrinization conditions eliminated this endotherm. Dextrinization led to 1000-fold decrease in weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the products, comparing to the native starch. Stronger processing conditions yielded the resistant dextrins with slightly higher Mw but composing of shorter branched chains. During dextrinization, hydrolysis was a predominant step, while transglucosidation and repolymerization played key roles in modifying molecular structure and properties, especially dietary fiber content, of resistant dextrins.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"

Objective: To evaluate the effect of stimulation frequency or electrode contact location on speech disorders in PD patients with STN-DBS. Method: In this case-controlled study, we enrolled 50 PD patients with, and 100 PD patients without STN-DBS to compare their vocal intensities, measured by a sound pressure meter, and perceptual speech ratings, obtained from the speech sections of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and subjective ratings regarding the impediment of functional communication by stuttering. For patients with STN-DBS, comparisons were made between high-frequency (HFS; 130 Hz), low-frequency (LFS; 80 Hz), and off-stimulation. We also evaluated the effect of electrode contact locations on speech function. Results: Patients with STN-DBS had decreased vocal intensities and UPDRS scores compared to those without (p < 0.05). Vocal intensity was significantly lower during HFS than during LFS and off-stimulation (both, p < 0.05). Stuttering impeded STN-DBS patients’ communication to greater extent than for those without (p < 0.001). Vocal intensity was lower when active contacts were in the dorsal zone compared to those in the ventral zone (p < 0.05). Only STN-DBS treatment was a predictive factor for low vocal intensity (OR = 9.53, p = 0.04). Conclusion: High-frequency STN-DBS with dorsal zone contacts can aggravate certain speech problems in PD patients. Therefore, it is important to balance between motor control and speech impairments in these patients.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

Patients with spondyloarthritis who were prescribed the first TNFi between December 2009 and October 2014 in the Rheumatic Disease Prior Authorization registry were enrolled. Baseline clinical data were retrieved. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with discontinuation of drugs. Results Among 138 patients, 97 had ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and 41 had psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The effectiveness of TNFi in AS and PsA was 55% to 59% at 4 months and 75% to 96% at 3 years, as measured by a 50% decrease in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index from baseline. For PsA with peripheral arthritis, improvement of the joint count by 50% was observed in 61.8% of patients at 4 months and 100% at 3 years. Survival from TNFi was 63% for AS and 56% for PsA at 3 years. For AS, the factors associated with good response leading to discontinuation of TNFi were baseline patient global assessment 3 to 6/10 (hazard ratio [HR], 6.3) and the use of leflunomide (HR, 6.0) and infliximab (HR, 4.8). A good response (38.5%) was the most common cause of discontinuation of the first TNFi, followed by toxicity (28.2%), nonadherence (20.5%), and lack of effectiveness (12.8%). Conclusions Ankylosing spondylitis and PsA responded well to TNFi during the 3-year follow-up. The retention rate was approximately 60% for AS and PsA. A good response to the first TNFi was the most common reason for discontinuation.",medical,Rheumatology
Role of copper- or cerium-promoters on NiMo/Γ-Al2O3 catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol and bio-oil,"Sangnikul P., Phanpa C., Xiao R., Zhang H., Reubroycharoen P., Kuchonthara P., Vitidsant T., Pattiya A., Hinchiranan N.",2019-03-25,"Catalyst performance, Gross heating value, Guaiacol, Hydrodeoxygenation, Hydrogenation activity, Mild reaction conditions, Oxygenated compounds, Promoter, Cerium, Copper, Guaiacol, Hydrodeoxygenation, Promoter","Effect of copper (Cu) or cerium (Ce) as promoters for nickel-molybdenum/γ-alumina (NiMo/γ-Al2O3) catalyst on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol (GUA), a model oxygenated compound found in a bio-oil derived from woody biomass, was comparatively investigated. The addition of Cu- or Ce-promoters affected the physicochemical properties of the NiMo catalyst. The NiMo catalyst promoted by Cu showed the higher reducibility, whilst the Ce-promoter (2–8 wt% based on γ-Al2O3 content) provided the NiMo catalyst with a higher distribution of active metals and induced a greater difficulty in the reduction under hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. For the HDO of GUA at a mild reaction condition (10 bar initial H2 pressure and 300 °C) in the absence of solvent, the Cu-promoter enhanced the hydrogenation activity of the NiMo catalyst to convert GUA to phenol and methylphenols, one-atomic oxygen species. Whereas, the addition of Ce obviously inhibited the formation of coke on the catalyst surface after a long reaction period (6 h) and gave a higher GUA conversion level with increasing yield of phenols. For the HDO of real bio-oil obtained from the fast pyrolysis of cassava rhizome, the NiMo catalysts promoted by Cu or Ce at 4 wt% based on the γ-Al2O3 content showed a higher performance at eliminating the oxygenated compounds in the bio-oil, reducing the oxygen/carbon (O/C) molar ratio by over seven-fold from 1.75 to 0.24–0.25. Moreover, the gross heating value of the bio-oil was improved from 21.5 to ca. 29.0 MJ/kg after the HDO process. However, the addition of the Cu or Ce promoter did not inhibit coke deposition, possibly due to the acidic properties of the bio-oil that deteriorated the catalyst performance by metal leaching.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"
"Untangling a mess of worms: Species delimitations reveal morphological crypsis and variability in Southeast Asian semi-aquatic earthworms (Almidae, Glyphidrilus)","Jirapatrasilp P., Backeljau T., Prasankok P., Chanabun R., Panha S.",2019-10-01,"Animals, Aquatic Organisms, Asia, Southeastern, Base Sequence, Bayes Theorem, DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic, DNA, Ribosomal Spacer, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Oligochaeta, Phylogeny, Polymorphism, Genetic, Species Specificity, DNA barcodes, Earthworms, ITS2 secondary structure, Morphological crypsis, Morphological variability, Species delimitation","Semi-aquatic freshwater earthworms in the genus Glyphidrilus from Southeast Asia are characterized by both an extreme morphological crypsis among divergent phylogenetic lineages and a high morphological variability within the same phylogenetic lineages. The present study provides a new taxonomic framework for this problematic genus in SE Asia by integrating DNA sequence and morphological data. When single-locus and multilocus multispecies coalescent-based (MSC) species delimitation methods were applied to DNA sequence data, they usually yielded highly incongruent results compared to morphology-based species identifications. This suggested the presence of several cryptic species and high levels of intraspecific morphological variation. Applying reciprocal monophyly to the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene tree allowed us to propose the existence of 33 monophyletic species. Yet, often substantially more molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were obtained when species delimitation was based on COI and 16S rRNA sequences. In contrast, the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences suggested fewer MOTUs and did not recover most of the monophyletic species from the Mekong basin. However, several of these latter taxa were better supported when MSC species delimitation methods were applied to the combined mtDNA and ITS datasets. The ITS2 secondary structure retrieved one unnamed Mekong basin species that was not uncovered by the other methods when applied to ITS2 sequences. In conclusion, based on an integrative taxonomic workflow, 26 Glyphidrilus candidate species were retained and two remained to be confirmed. As such, this study provides evidence to suggest nine species new to science and to synonymize 12 nominal morphospecies. It also illustrates that the uncritical use of COI as a universal DNA barcode may overestimate species diversity because COI may be unable to distinguish between divergent conspecific lineages and different candidate species.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; evolutionary ecology; evolution and speciation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

PLA was first melt mixed with five loadings of TPU (10–50 wt%) on a twin-screw extruder, followed by injection molding. The addition of TPU was found to increase the impact strength, elongation at break and thermal stability of the blends, but decrease the tensile strength and Young’s modulus. Based on a better combination of the mechanical properties, the 70/30 (w/w) PLA/TPU blend was selected for preparing both single and hybrid nanocomposites with a fix total nanofiller content of 5 parts per hundred of resin (phr), and the OMMT/nSiO2 weight ratios were 5/0, 2/3, 3/2 and 0/5 (phr/phr). The Young’s modulus and thermal stability of the nanocomposites were all higher than those of the neat 70/30 PLA/TPU blend, but at the expense of reducing the tensile strength, elongation at break and impact strength. However, all the nanocomposites exhibited higher impact strength and Young’s modulus than the neat PLA. Among the four nanocomposites, a single-filler nanocomposite containing 5 phr nSiO2 exhibited the highest impact strength and thermal stability, indicating that there was no synergistic effect of the two nanofillers on the investigated physical properties. However, the hybrid nanocomposite containing 2/3 (phr/phr) OMMT/nSiO2 possessed a compromise in the tensile properties.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Few studies have investigated the incidence and risk factors of PNALD in adult patients receiving PN with newer generation intravenous lipid emulsions. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of PNALD in hospitalized adult patients. Methods: Patients expected to receive PN for more than 14 days and have normal liver tests at baseline during September 2016 to February 2017 were enrolled. All patients were followed until there were liver test abnormalities. Incidence, onset and characteristics of PNALD, calories intake, amount of fat and carbohydrate, types of fat, nutrition status, and incidence of infection were evaluated. Results: Forty-four adults were recruited. The incidence of PNALD was 59.1% (22.7% steatosis, 34.1% cholestasis, and 2.3% mixed type). Median onset of PNALD was 12.5 days (range: 4–42) and the onset was not significantly different between each subtype. In multiple regression analysis, severe malnutrition and amount of carbohydrate were independent risk factors for PNALD with an odds ratio of 13.25 (95% CI: 1.37–128.24; p = 0.026) and 21.61 (95% CI: 1.81–258.56; p = 0.015), respectively. Conclusions: PNALD was common in this group of patients. In contrast to previous studies, cholestasis was more common than steatosis, and the median onset was not different between each subtype. In severely malnourished patients, physicians need to exercise caution and monitor for PNALD intensively, and overfeeding of carbohydrate should be avoided to prevent PNALD from occurring.","medical, Nursing","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Nevertheless, it is unknown whether nitrosylation is involved in BP and whether there are differences in nitrosylation between BP1 and BP2. Methods: Serum IgM antibodies directed against nitroso (NO)-adducts were examined in MDD, BP1, BP2 and healthy controls, namely IgM responses to NO-cysteine, NO-tryptophan (NOW), NO-arginine and NO-albumin (SBA) in association with IgA/IgM responses to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, IgG responses to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and serum peroxides. Results: Serum IgM levels against NO adducts were significantly higher in BP1 and MDD as compared with healthy controls, whereas BP2 patients occupied an intermediate position. IgM responses to NO-albumin were significantly higher in BP1 and MDD than in BP2 patients. There were highly significant associations between the IgM responses to NO-adducts and IgG responses to ox-LDL and IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria. Conclusions: BP1 and MDD are characterized by an upregulation of the nitrosylome (the proteome of nitrosylated proteins) and increased IgM responses to nitrosylated conjugates. Increased nitrosylation may be driven by increased bacterial translocation and is associated with lipid peroxidation processes.

The system consists of (i) a biomass gasification module, (ii) a biochar utilization module, (iii) a chemical looping hydrogen generation module, (iv) an oxy-syngas combustion module, (v) a CO 2 electroreduction module, and (vi) heat recovery units. Bioenergy is progressively converted through biomass gasification, chemical looping hydrogen generation, syngas combustion, and CO 2 electroreduction.

Ultrasonically-assisted surface modified TiO2/rGO/CeO2 heterojunction photocatalysts for conversion of CO2 to methanol and ethanol,"Seeharaj P., Kongmun P., Paiplod P., Prakobmit S., Sriwong C., Kim-Lohsoontorn P., Vittayakorn N.",2019-11-01,"Electron hole recombination rate, Electron-hole recombination, High-intensity ultrasonic wave, Photocatalytic performance, Photoconversion, Photogenerated charge carriers, Reduced graphene oxides (RGO), Sono-assisted exfoliation, CO2 photoconversion, Photocatalyst, Sono-assisted exfoliation, Titanium dioxide","Converting CO2 to usable fuel may contribute to lowering of global warming, thus this study developed effective heterojunction photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 with water into methanol and ethanol fuels. The photocatalysts were prepared from combining surface modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cerium oxide (CeO2). The TiO2 surfaces were firstly modified via the sono-assisted exfoliation, with high intensity ultrasonic waves (ultrasonic horn, 20 kHz, 150 W/cm2) in 10 M NaOH for 1 h. Highly reactive nanosheets delaminated from outer surfaces of the primary TiO2 crystals leading to an increase in specific surface active area, light absorption and decrease in electron-hole recombination rate, which enhanced photocatalytic activity. Then, 0.75 wt% rGO and 1 wt% CeO2 were incorporated into the surface modified TiO2 to promote photogenerated charge separation, electron mobility and CO2 absorptivity. The modified TiO2/rGO/CeO2 photocatalysts exhibited superior photocatalytic performance by producing methanol at 641 μmol/gcath and ethanol at 271 μmol/gcath, almost 7 times higher than rates from pure TiO2. The significant improvement in CO2 photoconversion activity was mainly attributed to the high interfacial contact area and strong connection between the reactive delaminated TiO2 nanosheets, rGO and CeO2, which, in turn, facilitated the flow of large number of photogenerated charge carriers to react with the absorbed species, and the multi-step charge transportation due to the heterojunction effect that effectively retarded electron-hole recombination.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, medical, physics, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Environmental Chemistry, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Microstructure, phase composition, water absorption and granular agglomeration of the granules were characterized. SEM showed that the granule sizes of Sunmax were in the range of 0.8-1.5 mm whereas that of 3DP HA was relatively more uniform at about 1 mm. 3DP HA granules comprised the weaving of numerous minute crystals containing large pores and having high porosity while Sunmax granules were crushed granules and having low porosity. XRD analysis confirmed that Sunmax granules were biphasic hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate while 3DP HA granules were monophasic hydroxyapatite. Sunmax granules exhibited greater agglomeration volume than that of 3DP HA granules. However, the water absorption of 3DP HA granules was greater than that of Sunmax granules. The greater agglomeration ability of Sunmax granules was likely due to the collagen constituent of the granules which could act as adhesive to bind granules together in addition to water capillary action. In contrast, 3DP HA granules formed the agglomeration by the water film due to the capillary action only so the efficiency was lower although the water absorption was greater.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Also, the context of individual user has changed in the timeline (context-driven). In this work, a hotel hybrid recommendation method (CF+CBF) based on context-driven using LDA is proposed. Firstly, we find missing user ratings of user-hotel rating matrix by applying LDA on user ratings in order to get predicted score of hotels for a target user. Secondly, we find a group of users similar to target users (neighbors). Then, we apply context-driven to recommend hotels that meet current interest of target user.

Here we examined whether these biomarkers may aid in the classification of unknown subjects into the target class MDD. The aforementioned biomarkers were assayed in 60 first-episode, drug-naïve depressed patients and 30 controls. We used joint principal component analysis (PCA) performed on all subjects to check whether subjects cluster by classes; support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold validation; and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and SIMCA performed on calibration and validation sets and we computed the figures of merit and learnt from the data. PCA shows that both groups were well separated using the first three PCs, while correlation loadings show that all five biomarkers have discriminatory value. SVM and LDA yielded an accuracy of 100% in validation samples. Using SIMCA, there was a highly significant discrimination of both groups (model-to-model distance = 110.2); all biomarkers showed a significant discrimination and modeling power, while 100% of the patients were authenticated as MDD cases with a specificity of 93.3%. We have delineated that MDD is a distinct class with respect to neuro-immune and opioid biomarkers and that future unknown subjects can be authenticated as having MDD using this SIMCA fingerprint.

We examined the efferent brain-anorectal and spino-anorectal motor-evoked potentials (MEP) to characterize the locus of neuronal injury in patients with FI. Methods: We performed bilateral transcranial, translumbar, and transsacral magnetic stimulations in 27 patients with FI (19 female) and 31 healthy individuals (controls, 20 female) from 2015 through 2017. MEPs were recorded simultaneously from the rectum and anus using 4 ring electrodes. The difference in MEP latencies between the transcranial (TMS) and translumbar transsacral magnetic stimulations was calculated as cortico-spinal conduction time. MEP data were compared between patients with FI and controls. Patients filled out questionnaires that assessed the severity and effects of FI. Results: The MEP latencies with TMS were significantly longer in patients with FI than controls at most sites, and on both sides (P <.05). Almost all translumbar and transsacral MEP latencies were significantly prolonged in patients with FI vs controls (P <.01). The cortico-spinal conduction time were similar, on both sides, between patients with FI and controls. Ninety-three percent of patients had 1 or more abnormal translumbar and transsacral latencies, but neuropathy was patchy and variable, and not associated with sex or anal sphincter function or defects. Conclusions: Patients with FI have significant neuropathy that affects the cortico-anorectal and spino-anorectal efferent pathways.

Our study evaluates tools to identify aging PLWH who may forego CGA. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 357 PLWH ≥50 years old at the Red Cross, Thailand. Tools evaluated were the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Index (VACSI) and G-8, which is predictive among older cancer patients. CGA consists of eight tests: history of fall within 12 months, timed-up-and-go test (TUG), activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL (IADL), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Thai depression scale (TDS), mini nutritional assessment (MNA), and HIV symptom index (HSI). We considered ≥2 impaired domains on CGA to be abnormal results. Forty-nine percent (n = 175) had ≥2 impaired domains on CGA. Few participants had experienced a fall (11%) or abnormal TUG/ADL/IADL (<2%), and only MoCA/TDS/MNA/HSI were analyzed. A VACSI < 17 produces 85% sensitivity (Se) and 30% specificity (Sp) (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 63, 95%CI 58–69) and G-8 > 15.5 produces 90%Se and 33%Sp (AUC = 74, 95%CI 69–79) in identifying patients with <2 impaired domains. A G-8 > 13.5 produces 91%Se and 77%Sp (AUC = 89, 95%CI 86–92) in ruling out abnormal nutrition. Patients with VACSI < 17 and G-8 > 15.5 may forego CGA due to low likelihood of abnormal cognition, mood, nutrition, or symptom burden.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv; diagnosis and disease monitoring, medical","Dermatology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
The power of TDS technique for well test interpretation: a short review,"Escobar F.H., Jongkittnarukorn K., Hernandez C.M.",2019-03-01,"Formation testing, Limited entry, Non-linear regression analysis, Partial penetration, Pressure transient analysis, Trial-and-error procedures, Vertical anisotropy, Well test interpretation, Formation testing, Limited entry, Partial completion, Partial penetration, Short tests, Vertical anisotropy","Either pressure-transient analysis or rate-transient analysis can be interpreted by four methods: (1) conventional straight-line analysis, (2) type-curve matching procedure, (3) ACMM (automatic computer modeling matching), and (4) TDS (Tiab’s direct synthesis) technique. The first three methods have serious drawbacks and are commonly misused by engineers. It does not mean they are useless since they provide good results if used properly. For example, combination of (4), (1), and (3) are strongly recommended by the authors since type-curve matching are tedious and use trial-and-error procedures. ACMM is not only the most used method, but also the most risky methodology since the non-linear regression analysis used to match the pressure test with the model output leads to multiple solutions (none uniqueness of the solution). Moreover, some engineers employ it as an inverse problem when pretending to define the model by matching the data with any model. For those who do not know the way, any transportation means is good for. This is a very wrong alternative since engineers must choose the reservoir model and the ACMM helps to find out the solution. Type-curve matching is not only risky, but tedious and it fails to provide accurate results in short tests. Conventional analysis has no way of verification and some engineers confuse the flow regimes and draw the straight line on the wrong region leading to wrong interpretations. TDS technique may be the panacea to the above-mentioned problems since it uses direct analytical solutions with information coming from characteristic points found on the pressure and pressure derivative vs. time log–log plot on which the interpreter can better define flow regimes and verify results from different sources. In this paper we demonstrate the practicability and accuracy of TDS technique with some detailed examples and results are quite well. The intention of this paper is to encourage people the use of TDS technique and provide a state-of-the-art of it. Although not mentioned, TDS technique has been used by common well test interpretation software. The power of TDS is not only based upon the accuracy and capability verification, but also the possibility of artificially created non-existing flow regimes to further estimate/verify reservoir parameters. This means the best and only accurate option for short pressure test interpretations is TDS technique. Then, an engineer is welcome to use the output results with ACMM to obtain an accurate matching.","earth sciences, energy","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Energy (all)"

In addition, the effect of pH on adsorption mechanism and selective adsorption of five HANs individually and in an equimolar mixed solution were evaluated. The results indicated that the intraparticle diffusion rate constants of the mesoporous adsorbents were higher than that of the microporous NaY. In single solute, the order of adsorption preference (highest to lowest) was mono-HANs > di-HANs > tri-HAN. However, in mixed solute, the large molecular weight of the tri-HAN and di-HANs are more easily adsorbed than the smaller molecular weight mono-HANs. Except for SBA-15, the order of adsorption capacities in mixed HANs solute was not different compared to that observed for the single HAN solute, which might be caused by the higher accessibility to the active sites due to larger pore size. The ion-dipole electrostatic interaction was likely to be the main adsorption mechanism, and was favored at high pH values due to the high negative surface charge density of the adsorbent. The molecular structure of the HANs and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature affected the adsorption capacities and their selective adsorption from mixed solutes.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Complex linkages within the system are impacted by waste quantities and qualities. Due to the complex characteristic of stock and flow in a waste management system, it is difficult to design a sustainable management system that can handle varying conditions, particularly in case of a disaster. Interferences from the natural disaster i.e. flooding could potentially affect the entire MSWM system. Flooding is a major disaster in many regions of the world and poses a challenge as an external disturbance to any part of the waste management system. This research has applied the concept of system dynamics (SD) to understand patterns and evaluate flood impacts on the waste management systems of 22 districts that transport waste to the Nongkhaem transfer station in Bangkok, Thailand. The SD model of waste management illustrates waste generation trends and collection and transfer patterns to predict potential flood-affected areas. The research analyzed different flooding hazard scenarios and evaluated potential impacts within flood-prone areas. The results proved that flooding has various degree of impacts on the accumulated waste amounts of services areas within and outside the flooded areas. The findings can be a guideline to help prepare an appropriate mitigation plan for waste management under flood conditions.","water engineeringneering, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

This study aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors of recurrent VTE in Asian patients. Method: This is a retrospective cohort study in adult VTE patients who were diagnosed during 2004–2014, had no active cancer and followed-up for at least 1 year. Results: There were 198 patients. The mean age was 58.2 ± 17.6 years and 68.2% were female. The diagnoses were deep vein thrombosis (56%), pulmonary embolism (32%) or both (12%). They were provoked by major surgery in 21.7%. Thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome or protein C or protein S deficiency) was found in 11.6%. The recurrent rate during the median follow-up time of 52 months was 2.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46–3.31) per 100 patient-years. Presence of thrombophilia was independently associated with recurrences with the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 3.52 (95% CI 1.32–9.42, p = 0.01). There were 144 patients who discontinued anticoagulants. During the median time of 55 months after stopping anticoagulants, the recurrent rate was 4.3 per 100 patient-years. Thrombophilia was associated with recurrences with aHR of 4.00 (95% CI 1.42–11.31, p = 0.01), while male sex, younger age, provoking conditions and hormone use showed no significant association.

This study investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled nebulized sodium nitrite in 10 healthy subjects and 8 HbE/β-thal patients with high estimated pulmonary artery pressure. Nitrite pharmacokinetics, fraction exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (eRVSP) measured by echocardiography, and platelet activation were determined. Nebulized sodium nitrite at doses used in this study (37.5 and 75 mg for healthy subjects and 15 mg for HbE/β-thal patients) was well tolerated and did not cause changes in methemoglobin levels and systemic blood pressure. Absorption of inhaled nitrite was rapid with the absolute bioavailability of 18%. In whole blood, nitrite exhibited the dose-independent pharmacokinetics with clearance (CL) of 1.5 l/h/kg, volume of distribution (Vd) of 1.3 l/kg and half-life (t1/2) of 0.6 h. CL and Vd of nitrite was higher in red blood cells (RBC) than whole blood and plasma. HbE/β-thal patients had lower nitrite CL and longer t1/2 in RBC than healthy subjects. FENO increased immediately after inhalation. Following nitrite inhalation, eRVSP remained unchanged but platelet activation was suppressed as evidenced by inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced P-selectin expression and increase in phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASPSer239) in platelets. There were no changes in markers of oxidative and nitrosative stress after inhalation.

The minimum requirements to quantify microplastics were examined by comparing actual numbers of microplastics in these sample bottles with numbers measured in each laboratory. The uncertainty was due to pervasive errors derived from inaccuracies in measuring sizes and/or misidentification of microplastics, including both false recognition and overlooking. The size distribution of microplastics should be smoothed using a running mean with a length of >0.5 mm to reduce uncertainty to less than ±20%. The number of microplastics <1 mm was underestimated by 20% even when using the best practice for measuring microplastics in laboratories.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, regional and genergyal, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

B1b cells share many surface and functional characteristics with marginal zone B cells but differ in distribution and B cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathways. They are normally concentrated in the peritoneum, pleural cavities, spleen and bone marrow and function as efficient phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). While peritoneal B1b cells are relatively anergic, they may be activated by high cytokine levels, notably IL-10, IL-5 and IL-21, CD40 signalling and high doses of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in the context of pathogen invasion; TLR ligation is also necessary. Their anti-inflammatory effects include: secretion of natural IgM by splenic and bone marrow B1b cell subsets as an early response to pathogen invasion; tissue homeostasis and enabling the immunologically silent clearance of neoplastic and apoptotic cells; inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased production of TGF-β1, PGE2 and GcMAF by activated macrophages and dendritic cells; and, in the case of peritoneal B1 lymphocytes, acting as ultimate Breg precurors. Pro-inflammatory B1b properties may result from: abnormal trafficking; acting as APCs; and acting as a source of innate-response activator cells. Functional impairment or deficits in Bregs occur in multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

It achieves high accuracy and coverage by integrating the importance level of friends. This paper has two main contributions, namely, selecting higher-quality raters and improving the prediction step. From these two contributions, the proposed trust-based ant-colony recommender system could provide more accurate and wider-coverage prediction than existing systems. Design/methodology/approach: To obtain higher-quality raters, the data set was preprocessed, and then, trust values were calculated. The depth of search was increased to obtain higher coverage levels. This work also focuses on the importance level of friends in the system. Because the levels of influence on the active user of all friends are not equal, the importance level of friends is integrated into the system by transposing rater’s rating to the active user’s perspective and then assigning a weight to each rater. Findings: The experimental evaluation clearly demonstrates that the proposed method achieves better results in terms of both accuracy and coverage than existing trust-based recommender systems. It was found that integrating the importance level of friends into the system, which transposes ratings and assigns weight to each user, can increase accuracy and coverage. Originality/value: Existing trust-based ant-colony recommender systems do not consider the importance level of friends in the prediction step. Most of them only focus on finding raters and then using the rater’s real ratings in the prediction step. A new method is proposed that integrates the importance level of friends into the system by transposing a rater’s rating to match the active user’s perspective and assigning a weight for each rater. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves better accuracy and coverage than existing systems.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Information Systems, Computer Networks and Communications"

The advantages of topical over systemic antimicrobials include a higher concentration at the target site, fewer systemic adverse effects, and a lower incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Nowadays, topical antimicrobials are divided into three groups: disinfectants, antiseptics, and antibiotics. Only antiseptics and antibiotics can be applied to living skin; therefore, this review will focus only on these groups. The advantages of each topical antimicrobial are well established; however, their disadvantages remain prominent. It is widely known that antiseptics show higher cytotoxicity and a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, whereas antibiotics show a higher probability of bacterial resistance development. However, there are still many adverse effects, resulting from each topical antimicrobial. This review aims to summarize the possible adverse effects of commonly used antiseptics (biguanide, silver, iodine, chlorine compounds, and other antiseptics), antibiotics (bacitracin, mafenide, mupirocin, neomycin, and silver sulfadiazine), and natural antimicrobials (curcumin and honey).

Results are new such as crack branches at 120°, layered cracks, stepped crack surface and variable crack width. The zirconia coating has hexahedral shape as a honeycomb microstructure. Due to effect of heating-cooling, the first coating layer and near layers to substrate surface of zirconia coating will be contracted or do not be expanded while outside coating layers will be extended producing bi-interfacial de-bonding between particles and propagation to other crystals producing cracks and branching. Depth and width of the crack will be extended and increased in the coating layers producing stepped and layered cracks with branches. Propagation angles of branches are always 60°.

Theoretical calculation discloses that the doped oxygen atom and the nearby atoms accept electrons as reduction site to produce hydrogen, while the undoped fraction and cyano group take the duty to oxidize water. The delocalization of reactive sites drives charge shuttle on the plane, limiting recombination of charge carriers. Consequently, the modified g-C3N4 shows excellent photocatalytic activity with apparent quantum efficiency of 8.41% under 420 nm wavelength, surpassing pure g-C3N4 and other reported materials with defect compilation.

Anion-exchange macroporous resin beads were treated with a synthesis gel containing titanium isopropoxide, iso-propanol and diluted (0–5 wt.%) tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) aqueous solutions. The Ti-resin composite obtained was calcined at 600 °C to remove the resin. The presence of TPAOH in the precursor solution was essential for producing intact TiO 2 beads. The use of 1–1.5 wt.% TPAOH resulted in anatase beads, whereas further increase in the TPAOH content promoted the anatase to rutile phase transformations. Decreasing the heating rate used during calcination also resulted in changes in the TiO 2 composition from pure anatase (16 °C min −1 heating rate) to anatase with rutile impurities (0.5 °C min −1 heating rate). The photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 beads was evaluated for the degradation of acetone under ultraviolet irradiation. A high activity was displayed by the TiO 2 samples composed of anatase with rutile impurities, whereas the activity was lower for pure anatase samples or samples containing mainly rutile. The TiO 2 beads showed higher rates of charge carrier generation and slower charge trapping/recombination rates compared to a reference Cristal ACTiV™ PC500. In addition, the TiO 2 beads could be used in at least five consecutive catalytic cycles without any in-between cycle treatment, without significant changes in their activity. The TiO 2 beads prepared in this work are beneficial for photocatalytic applications in the gas-phase compared to powders due to easy handling, reduced pressure drop and attrition resistance.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Pleomorphic adenoma with bizarre myoepithelial cells: A diagnostic challenge on cytologic smear,"Taweevisit M., Thorner P.S.",2019-12-01,"Adenoma, Pleomorphic, Biomarkers, Tumor, Biopsy, Fine-Needle, Diagnosis, Differential, Female, Humans, Leiomyoma, Middle Aged, Salivary Gland Neoplasms, fine needle aspiration, myoepithelial cell, pleomorphic adenoma","The diagnosis on fine needle aspiration of salivary gland tumors with a myoepithelial component is challenging because myoepithelial cells can have a wide cytomorphologic spectrum. The authors report a case of a pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland that expands the spectrum of appearances that myoepithelial cells can show with this tumor. A 55-year-old female was found to have a right parotid gland mass. FNA showed hypercellularity, with loosely cohesive fragments of spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells admixed with small nests of epithelial cells. Interspersed may occasional bizarre cells possessing severely pleomorphic nuclei with hyperchromasia. The cytologic diagnosis was “suspicious for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.” A total parotidectomy was performed with complete resection of the tumor that was confirmed to be a pleomorphic adenoma. The pleomorphic cells noted on FNA were scattered throughout the tumor, and were positive by immunostaining for keratin, S-100 protein and p63, identifying them as myoepithelial cells. These cells did not show mitotic activity and were negative for Ki67. The pleomorphic adenoma showed extensive degenerative changes including central cyst formation, stromal hyalinization and hemosiderin deposition. On the basis of the combined light microscopic and immunohistochemical findings, there was no evidence to support a malignant change in the pleomorphic adenoma. It was concluded the pleomorphic myoepithelial cells were a degenerative change, reminiscent of what is seen in “ancient” schwannoma and some uterine leiomyomata. Our case expands the spectrum of appearances that can be seen in myoepithelial cells in the salivary gland.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology"

Methods: The Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (OSA-18) questionnaire and Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) were used as data collecting tools. The questionnaires were filled out by 16 parents of children who had an anterior crossbite with Class I skeletal pattern. The data were collected three times: one month preinsertion of the appliance; one day post-insertion; and one month post-insertion. Results: There were no significant differences between the OSA-18 or PSQ results collected at different times. Pearson’s correlation revealed no significant relationship between the posterior bite plane thickness and the difference in scores (P>0.05). Conclusion: Short-term treatment using such appliances does not initiate SDB symptoms, and the amount of increased posterior bite plane thickness does not relate to the severity of SDB symptoms.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

In situ catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha wastes using ZSM-5 from hydrothermal alkaline fusion of fly ash,"Vichaphund S., Wimuktiwan P., Sricharoenchaikul V., Atong D.",2019-05-01,"Hydrocarbon compounds, Hydrothermal treatments, Jatropha, Nitrogenous compounds, Oxygenated compounds, Pyrolysis temperature, Synthesized materials, ZSM-5, Fly ash, Jatropha, Pyrolysis, ZSM-5","In this work, ZSM-5 catalysts was successfully synthesized from fly ash via alkali fusion followed by hydrothermal treatment with the initial SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios of 24 and 40 (HZSM5-FA). HZSM-5 synthesized with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios of 40 exhibited superior physical and textural properties such as higher crystallinity, larger surface area, and smaller particle size. After synthesis, the catalytic activity of HZSM5-FA with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios of 40 was investigated via fast pyrolysis of Jatropha wastes in order to upgrade the evolved vapor using Py-GC/MS technique. In addition, the ZSM-5 prepared from chemical reagents (HZSM5-CV) were evaluated for comparison. The pyrolysis temperature was set at 500 °C with the Jatropha wastes to catalyst ratio of 1:1–1:10. The major components from non-catalytic fast pyrolysis were acids (51%) and nitrogen containing compounds (20%). Other organic compounds were ketones, alcohols, esters, ethers, phenols and sugars. The presence of HZSM5-FA contributed to the elimination of undesirable oxygenated compounds such as fatty acids which could mitigate problem regarding acidity and instability in bio-oil. In addition, this synthesized material also remarkably improved the hydrocarbon selectivity, especially aromatic hydrocarbons. Higher catalyst contents had positive effect on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and tended to promote deoxygenation and denitrogenation. At high catalyst proportion (biomass to catalyst ratio of 1:10), HZSM5-FA produced the highest hydrocarbon selectivity of 97%, mainly benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), which are valuable products due to their high heating values. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of HZSM5-FA was comparable to that of the HZSM5-CV in terms of reducing oxygenates as well as nitrogenous compounds and consequently increasing hydrocarbon compounds. Overall, HZSM-5 derived from fly ash can be economically used as a potential catalyst for pyrolysis oil upgrading applications.","chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

Plant samples were collected every 15 d during a 105-d experimental period. Accumulation of Cd in each part of the plant was determined using atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS), and the distribution of Cd was determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) and synchrotron radiation micro X-ray fluorescence (SR-micro-XRF). The highest concentrations of Cd accumulation of 889 ± 53 mg kg −1 in the underground part (roots) and 265 ± 26 mg kg −1 in the aboveground part (stems and leaves) in the presence of 1:1 M ratio of Cd:EDTA after 30 d of exposure were observed. Plants grown in the presence of either NTA or EDTA-NTA mixtures showed significant lower Cd accumulation levels. The LA-ICP-MS analysis showed that Cd was primarily accumulated in the aboveground part (stems and leaves), especially in the xylem and intercalary meristem. In addition, translocation factor was very low. Thus, P. purpurem could be considered as a candidate plant for cadmium phytostabilization.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Henry's constants are considered pressure and temperature dependent, while the polarity of H2S is included in the calculation of gas diffusivities. The model was validated with the experimental data using two hollow fiber membranes, i.e., polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), to analyze membrane wetting. The effects of pressure and temperature on the CO2 and H2S absorption and CH4 loss were investigated. From the model validation, the experimental results using PVDF and PTFE at 1 bar are in good agreement with non-wetting mode. At elevated pressures, non-wetting mode results correspond with the experimental results using PTFE, while the partially wetting mode well predicts the results of PVDF. The modeling results also indicate that increasing pressure and reducing temperature improves the absorption fluxes of CO2 and H2S, while the CH4 losses in this work are lower than 5.5%.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, mixing and separation, physics, engineering, coastal engineering","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

The layer-by-layer coating of the beads with two opposite charged molecules, positive-charged type A gelatin (GA), and negative-charged AL, using alternate soaking technique was introduced to stabilize the beads. The AL70HA30, AL50HA50 beads showed high stability because of high ionic crosslinked AL component. Two-layer coating resulted in an appropriate layer that maximized the stability of the AL/HA beads. The higher ratio of HA resulted in the higher water absorption ability but degradation rate was accelerated. An antibiotic gentamicin was loaded into the beads with the entrapment efficiency of 69–89%. The beads containing 30% and 50% HA and coated with two layers showed a sustained release of gentamicin while the release behavior was governed by the diffusion and degradation of the beads. The gentamicin released from all beads also potentially inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (gram-negative) bacteria up to at least 48 h.

A retrospective review of autopsies was performed to identify cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and determine the contribution of electron microscopy in making the diagnosis in those cases. Over a period of 17 years, there were 900 perinatal and pediatric autopsies. There were 7 cases (1%) of IEM, including 4 cases of Pompe disease, 1 case of I-cell disease, 1 case of bile acid synthesis defect, and 1 case of mitochondrial disease (Leigh syndrome). Electron microscopy was important in the diagnosis of I-cell disease and Pompe disease in our series. This technique enabled a prenatal diagnosis to be made from a chorionic villus biopsy in 2 cases with a positive family history. In less developed countries where upfront genetic testing may be too expensive and may need international referral, electron microscopy can still be useful for diagnosis of IEM, providing an affordable alternative with a more rapid turnaround time compared to gene mutation analysis or enzyme assay. Results can be used both for patient management and as a screen for which cases might benefit from genetic testing.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Pathology and Forensic Medicine"

Since mercury is a common contaminant in petroleum hydrocarbon production in Southeast Asia, minimal risk and environmental integrity should be concerned. Mercury concentration in surface sediment collected from the Gulf of Thailand in 2003 (89 stations), 2012 (174 stations) and 2013 (45 stations). Sedimentological characteristics, readily oxidizable organic carbon and calcium carbonate were determined. All analyses were carried out in our laboratory using cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. The results show an increase in trace amount of mercury in the Gulf's sediment. Average concentrations of mercury in surface sediments in the lower GOT collected in 2003, 2012 and 2013 were 24.4±9.00, 34.9±21.5 and 41.4±15.3 μg/kg dry weight (carbonate free basis). It is coincident to an increment in the number of platforms for natural gas exploration and production in the Gulf of Thailand. Spatial distribution of mercury in the sediments indicates a clearly linked to the exploration, development, production, and processing in petroleum and gas operation. Although the elevation of mercury level in the GOT's sediment does not showed high risk yet, treating and recycling of mercury contaminated substances generated during production are required in order to minimize the health risk in consumption of seafood collecting from the GOT.","petroleum engineeringneering, earth sciences, energy","Geochemistry and Petrology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Fuel Technology"

This research seeks to improve the removal efficiency of semisolid soils below their melting points using surfactant-based formulations containing different alcohol additives. To this end, cold water detergency of solid coconut oil and solid palm kernel oil was investigated in various surfactant/alcohol systems, including single anionic extended surfactants, single nonionic alcohol ethoxylate surfactants, and a mixture of anionic surfactants. A series of alcohols (2-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol) were added to the surfactant formulations to investigate cold water detergency improvement. While cold water detergency using surfactants alone was poor, it was considerably improved when optimum salinity (S*) and 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, or 1-nonanol were introduced to the studied surfactant formulations. The maximum detergency of solid coconut oil exceeded 90% removal in the 0.1 w/v% C14-15-8PO-SO4Na/0.2 w/v% 1-octanol/4 w/v% NaCl system (a final optimized surfactant system) at a washing temperature of 10°C versus 22.9 ± 2.2% in the surfactant alone (not at optimum salinity and no additive). Further analysis showed that improved cold water detergency using surfactant/intermediate-chain alcohols/NaCl could be correlated with high wettability (low contact angle) as well as favorable surfactant system-soil interaction as observed by lower interfacial tension values. In contrast, the improved cold water detergency was observed to be independent of dispersion stability. This work thus demonstrates that surfactant system design, including additives, can improve cold water detergency of semisolid soils and should be further explored in future research.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Therefore, parameterization of the state-feedback controllers is independent of the Lyapunov matrices. The proposed design condition is bilinear in the decision variables, and hence we provide an iterative algorithm to solve the design problem. At each iteration, the design condition is cast as convex optimization using the sum-of-squares technique and can be efficiently solved. In addition, the novel parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions are readily applied to robust state-feedback stabilization of polynomial systems subject to parametric uncertainty.

This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of double-dose INCS. Methods: Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of double-dose INCS vs standard-dose INCS for treating patients with AR were included. Data from the included studies were extracted and collected for meta-analyses. The outcomes were nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms, and adverse events. Results: Twelve studies (4166 patients) met the inclusion criteria. There were 5 pediatric studies (1868 patients), 5 adult studies (1414 patients), and 2 studies with mixed populations (884 patients). The meta-analysis results in adult patients favored the effects of double-dose INCS on: total nasal symptom score (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.41 to −0.08; 4 studies; 568 patients) and total ocular symptom score (SMD −0.27; 95% CI, −0.52 to −0.03; 1 study; 259 patients).

Their capacity for biofuel production has been widely improved using metabolically engineered strains. In this study, we employed metabolic engineering design with target genes involved in selected processes including the fatty acid synthesis (a cassette of accD, accA, accC and accB encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ACC), phospholipid hydrolysis (lipA encoding lipase A), alkane synthesis (aar encoding acyl-ACP reductase, AAR), and recycling of free fatty acid (FFA) (aas encoding acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase, AAS) in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Results: To enhance lipid production, engineered strains were successfully obtained including an aas-overexpressing strain (OXAas), an aas-overexpressing strain with aar knockout (OXAas/KOAar), and an accDACB-overexpressing strain with lipA knockout (OXAccDACB/KOLipA). All engineered strains grew slightly slower than wild-type (WT), as well as with reduced levels of intracellular pigment levels of chlorophyll a and carotenoids. A higher lipid content was noted in all the engineered strains compared to WT cells, especially in OXAas, with maximal content and production rate of 34.5% w/DCW and 41.4 mg/L/day, respectively, during growth phase at day 4. The OXAccDACB/KOLipA strain, with an impediment of phospholipid hydrolysis to FFA, also showed a similarly high content of total lipid of about 32.5% w/DCW but a lower production rate of 31.5 mg/L/day due to a reduced cell growth. The knockout interruptions generated, upon a downstream flow from intermediate fatty acyl-ACP, an induced unsaturated lipid production as observed in OXAas/KOAar and OXAccDACB/KOLipA strains with 5.4% and 3.1% w/DCW, respectively. Conclusions: Among the three metabolically engineered Synechocystis strains, the OXAas with enhanced free fatty acid recycling had the highest efficiency to increase lipid production.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology, energy, environmental","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Our simulations demonstrate that hydrogenated diamondized bilayer graphenes are thermodynamically stable with respect to bilayer graphene and hydrogen molecule even at 0 GPa, and additionally they are found to withstand the physical change in structure up to at least 1000 K, ensuring their dynamical and thermal stabilities. The studied hydrogenated diamondized bilayer graphenes are predicted not only to behave as direct and wide band gap semiconductors, but also to have a remarkably high resistance to in-plane plastic deformation induced by indentation as implied by their high in-plane elastic constants comparable to those of diamond and of lonsdaleite. The mechanical stability of the materials is confirmed though the fulfilment of the Born stability criteria. Detailed analysis of phonon vibrational frequencies of hydrogenated diamondized bilayer graphenes reveals possible Raman active and IR active modes, which are found to be distinctly different from those of hydrogenated diamond-like amorphous carbon and defective graphene and thus could be used as a fingerprint for future experimental characterization of the materials.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all)"

However, poor solubility and bioavailability makes Cur a poor therapeutic agent. As prodrug approaches can mitigate these limitations, we compared the protective properties of the Cur prodrug curcumin diethyl disuccinate (CurDD) against Cur in relation to oxidative stress induced in human ARPE-19 cells. Both CurDD and Cur significantly decreased H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protected RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced death. Both drugs exerted their protective effects through the modulation of p44/42 (ERK) and the involvement of downstream molecules Bax and Bcl-2. Additionally, the expression of antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 was also enhanced in cells treated with CurDD and Cur. In all cases, CurDD was more effective than its parent drug against oxidative stress-induced damage to ARPE-19 cells. These findings highlight CurDD as a more potent drug compared to Cur against oxidative stress and indicate that its protective effects are exerted through modulation of key apoptotic and antioxidant molecular pathways.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic basis of protein C and protein S deficiencies in Thai population. Methods: Healthy volunteers were tested for protein C activity and free protein S antigen. Subjects with low values were requested for repeated testing and exclusion of acquired causes. Cases with persistently low levels were assayed for respective gene mutations using direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MPLA) when PROS1 point mutation was undetectable. Results: For protein C activities (N = 5234), the values of men were lower than those of post-menopausal women (P < 0.001). In 17 of 18 subjects, there were 7 types of PROC mutations, 64.7% of which were p.R189W and 2 were previously unreported. Protein S levels (N = 5242) were highest in men, followed by post-menopausal and pre-menopausal women, respectively (P < 0.001). The repeatedly low protein S was mostly in female (88.2%). Among 29 subjects with protein S below the sex-specific 2.5 percentile cut-points, 4 types of mutations were found in 5 subjects (17.2%) with one previously unreported mutation. Free protein S levels were below 30 U/ml in all cases with mutations. The estimated prevalence of PROC and PROS1 mutations in Thai population was 0.69% and 0.22%, respectively. Conclusions: PROC mutations, especially p.R189W, are common in Thais. However, mildly depressed protein S levels were frequently found in women with undetectable PROS1 mutation.","genergyal, medical",Hematology

The PLLA/NaCl weight ratios were varied to be 1:8, 1:10, 1:12, and 1:15. The gentamicin sulfate (GS)-loaded PLLA-sericin hybrid scaffolds were prepared by immersion of the PLLA scaffolds in sericin solution containing GS at a concentration of 5 mg mL −1 and subsequently freeze-drying. From the results, the pore sizes of the neat and the GS-loaded PLLA-sericin hybrid scaffolds ranged between 290 and 346 µm. The pore interconnectivity of these scaffolds increased with an increase in the amount of NaCl. Both the neat and the GS-loaded PLLA-sericin hybrid scaffolds that had been fabricated at PLLA/NaCl weight ratio of 1:15 showed high interconnected porous structure. Both the water retention and the weight loss increased with increasing NaCl content and submersion time. The increase in the porous structure of the scaffolds with the increasing NaCl content resulted in an observed decrease in the compressive modulus. Moreover, the cumulative released amounts of GS increased with increasing the porous structure of the scaffolds. All the GS-loaded PLLA-sericin hybrid scaffolds showed high activity against the growth of both E. coli TISTR 780 and S. aureus TISTR 1466. Lastly, all the GS-loaded PLLA-sericin hybrid scaffolds were proven non-toxic to MC3T3-E1 cells, indicating their potential uses for bone tissue engineering.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

This paper aims to classify active and inactive sources from the information that can be inferred from parameters of a dynamical model that captures characteristics of EEG time series. We propose a state-space model for explaining coupled dynamics of the source and EEG signals where EEG is a linear combination of sources according to the characteristics of volume conduction. Our model has a structure that the sparsity pattern of the model output matrix can indicate the position of active and inactive sources. With this assumption, the proposed estimation method consists of two steps. Firstly, a subspace identification method is performed to estimate the dynamic matrix of the model and the mapping matrix from the state variable to EEG output. Secondly, the estimation of the output matrix in the state-space model from the mapping matrix is solved by a group lasso problem to promote a sparsity pattern. As a result, nonzero rows of the output matrix represent active source that corresponding to EEG data. We verify the performance of our method on randomly generated data sets that represent realistic human brain activities in a fair setting. An acceptable accuracy of 95 - 98% is obtained with a suitable selection of a problem parameter and a thresholding process to discard small magnitudes of the output matrix.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical Engineering, Instrumentation"
Arsenic health risk assessment related to rice consumption behaviors in adults living in Northern Thailand,"Chanpiwat P., Kim K.-W.",2019-11-01,"Consumption patterns, Eating behavior, Ingestion rate, Sticky rice, Thailand, White rice, Adult, Aged, Arsenic, Arsenicals, Diet, Environmental Monitoring, Family Characteristics, Female, Food Contamination, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Oryza, Risk Assessment, Thailand, Consumption pattern, Eating behavior, Ingestion rate, Sticky rice, Thailand, White rice","The rice consumption behaviors of Thai citizens vary among regions. However, the influence of different consumption patterns on arsenic (As) exposure has never been reported. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of rice consumption behavior on As exposure levels. White rice (n = 96) and sticky rice (n = 63) samples were collected from local households in northern Thailand. The actual rice consumption behavior (type, frequency, and amount of rice consumed) was surveyed from the households where the rice samples were collected and used to calculate individual As exposures. The white rice (2.1%) and sticky rice (6.3%) samples contained inorganic As at higher concentrations than the Codex standard (0.2 mg kg−1). Approximately 58.3% of participants consumed white rice for breakfast and sticky rice for lunch and dinner, while 41.8% of participants consumed only white rice or sticky rice daily. Wide variations of As exposure (1 × 10−4 to 2 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1) were found. The average As exposure from only sticky rice consumption and combined rice consumption was 2 times higher than the As exposure from only white rice consumption. The rice ingestion rate was the most important factor affecting the level of As exposure resulting from the white rice–only and combined rice consumption patterns. For the combined rice consumption pattern, 45.7 to 93.5% of the total As exposure was from sticky rice consumption. Regarding individual characteristics, older and lower weight participants tended to consume lower amounts of rice. Thus, lower As exposure and fewer health impacts were found in those participants.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Science (all), Pollution, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

To screen for novel anchoring proteins with improved efficiency, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall proteins (GPI-CWPs) suitable for attaching passenger proteins to the cell surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been developed. Here, the C-terminal sequences (CTSs) of putative GPI-CWPs were selected based on the criteria that the sequence must contain a serine/threonine-rich (S/T) region of at least 30% S/T content, a total threonine content of at least 10%, a continuous S/T stretch of at least 130 amino acids in length, and a continuous T-rich region of at least 10 amino acids in length. Of the predicted 790 proteins, 37 putative GPI-CWPs were selected from different yeast and fungal species to be evaluated for their performance in displaying yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein and β-glucosidase enzyme. This led to the identification of five novel anchoring proteins with higher performance compared to α-agglutinin used as benchmark. In particular, the CTS of uncharacterized protein in Kluyveromyces lactis, namely 6_Kl, is the most efficient anchoring protein of the group. The CTS of 6_Kl protein provided a β-glucosidase activity of up to 23.5 U/g cell dry weight, which is 2.8 times higher than that of the CTS of α-agglutinin. These identified CTSs could be potential novel anchoring protein candidates for construction of efficient arming yeasts for biotechnology applications in the future.","protein biochemistryistryhemistry; other proteins; microbial proteins; fungal, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
Role of cardiac mast cells in exercise training-mediated cardiac remodeling in angiotensin II-infused ovariectomized rats,"Jitmana R., Raksapharm S., Kijtawornrat A., Saengsirisuwan V., Bupha-Intr T.",2019-02-15,"Angiotensin II, Animals, Female, Mast Cells, Myocytes, Cardiac, Ovariectomy, Physical Conditioning, Animal, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Ventricular Remodeling, Chymase, Collagen content, Hypertrophy, TGF-β1","Aims: Regular exercise is recommended in postmenopausal women to prevent the development of heart disease, but mechanism underlying the protection is not completely understood. Many studies have suggested that exercise training notably mediated whole body immune and inflammatory functions. Whether exercise training prevents cardiac dysfunction after deprivation of female sex hormones by inhibiting cardiac immune activation is therefore interesting. Main methods: Nine-week treadmill running program was introduced in sham-operated and ovariectomized rats. In addition, chronic angiotensin II infusion was further challenged to activate pathological cardiac remodeling. Cardiac remodeling in associated with the density and degranulation of cardiac mast cells was then evaluated. Key findings: With exogenous angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy with myocardial fibrosis was shown similarly in both sham-operated controls and ovariectomized rats. Although exercise training did not prevent cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis was abolished by exercise. While ovariectomy increased both cardiac mast cell density and degranulation percentage, angiotensin II infusion only enhanced mast cell density. Exercise training could not decrease the density of mast cells, but it did normalize the percentage of degranulation in all groups. Correlation analysis suggested that cardiac mast cell activation is inversely associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy due to exercise training but is directly correlated to cardiac hypertrophy by angiotensin II infusion. Significance: Exercise training could attenuate cardiac mast cell hyperactivation induced by either deprivation of female sex hormones or excessive angiotensin II. Additionally, cardiac mast cells could be a solution in the distinction between physiological and pathological hypertrophic development.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of both unmodified and surface-modified nano-Al2O3 on the cure characteristics, mechanical properties, cross-link density and thermal stability of natural rubber (NR) nanocomposites. Results revealed that silane coupling agents were very effective to enhance maximum rheometric torque (R∞) and mechanical properties like modulus and tensile strength of nano-Al2O3-based NR nanocomposites. APTES offered higher value of cure rate index for NR compounds as compared to two other silane coupling agents. Among three silane coupling agents, TESPT provided highest improvement in the mechanical properties of NR/nano-Al2O3 composites. This might be explained by considering excellent improvement in the cross-link density of NR compounds in the presence of TESPT-treated nano-Al2O3. The incorporation of both TESPT- and OCTEOS-modified nano-Al2O3 into the NR matrix markedly improved the thermal stability of NR composites. Moreover, bi-functional silane TESPT not only increased the hydrophobicity of nano-Al2O3, but also improved the probability of sulfur cross-linking during cure process of NR compounds.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling is known to play a critical role in tooth development, including in initiation. However, it remains unclear whether Bmp signaling is also involved in cusp formation. To address this question, we examined cusp in two different transgenic mouse lines: mice with overexpression of Bmp4 (K14-Bmp4), and those with Bmp inhibitor, Noggin, (K14-Noggin) under keratin14 (K14) promoter. K14-Noggin mice demonstrated extra cusps, whereas reduced number of cusps was observed in K14-Bmp4 mice. To further understand how Bmps are expressed during cusp formation, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridisation analysis of three major Bmps (Bmp2, Bmp4, and Bmp7) in murine maxillary and mandibular molars from E14.5 to P3. The linear expressions of Bmp2 and Bmp4 were observed in both maxillary and mandibular molars at E14.5. The expression patterns of Bmp2 and Bmp4 became significantly different between the maxillary and mandibular molars at E16.5. At P3, all Bmps were expressed in all the cusp regions of the maxillary molar; however, the patterns differed. All Bmps thus exhibited dynamic temporo-spatial expression during the cusp formation. It could therefore be inferred that Bmp signaling is involved in regulating cusp formation.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Genetics, Developmental Biology"

First, alumina catalysts were synthesized by the solvothermal methods to obtain three different phase composition of alumina catalysts including γ-phase (G–Al), χ-phase (C–Al) and equally mixed χ–γ phases (M–Al). Then, all catalysts were modified with boron (G–Al–B, C–Al–B and M–Al–B). It was found that the boron modification increased the amounts of total acid sites and the ratio of weak to strong acid sites (WSR). The catalytic activity and product selectivity of six catalysts via catalytic ethanol dehydration at 200, 300, and 400 °C were measured. For all catalysts, it revealed that ethanol conversion increased with increased temperatures from 200 to 400 °C. At 200–300 °C, the unmodified catalysts tended to exhibit the higher catalytic activity than the boron-modified catalysts. However, at high temperature (400 °C), the boron modification tended to increase the catalytic activity, especially for the M–Al–B catalyst (complete ethanol conversion at 400 °C). Considering ethylene production, the M–Al–B exhibited the highest ethylene yield among other catalysts with 92% at 400 °C. For diethyl ether, it was observed that the M–Al catalyst gave the highest diethyl ether yield of 57% at 300 °C. This is because the boron modification increased the amounts of total acid sites, which can promote the production of ethylene, while this is not preferable for diethyl ether production, which is favored by weak acid sites.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Based on the pseudo-first order assumption, a drop of pressure technique was used to extract the reaction rate constant, in terms of overall reaction rate constant (kov) and second-order reaction rate constant (k2,MPDL), from the experimental absorption data. Additionally, the physical properties and mass transfer data (i.e., density, viscosity, Henry's constant, and liquid phase mass transfer coefficient) of aqueous MPDL solutions were experimentally measured and comprehensively discussed. In the present work, the experimental k2,MPDL is firstly introduced and can be expressed as: k2,MPDL=1.66×107Exp[Formula presented]. The results also show that the CO2 absorption kinetics of MPDL can be ranked as: MEA > DEA > AMP > MPDL > MDEA. Even though novel MPDL has faster kinetics than conventional MDEA, it possesses too slow absorption kinetics to be used as a single solvent. Thus, it should be promoted with a very reactive amine to improve the overall CO2 absorption performance.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, energy, engineering","Pollution, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Aims: The majority of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OpSCC) have favourable survival outcomes, but a significant minority of individuals will die of their disease. There are currently no definitive criteria with which to identify HPV-associated OpSCC patients with poor outcomes. Recent reports suggest that quantitative evaluation of T-cell subpopulations in OpSCC may be of prognostic value, but the methods used have limited utility in a clinical diagnostic setting. We therefore sought to determine the clinical prognostic utility of tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) evaluation in patients with HPV-associated OpSCC within the context of a diagnostic histopathology setting. Methods and results: Representative diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides from 232 consecutive HPV-associated OpSCC patients were classified as containing a high (TILHi; diffuse, lymphocytes in >80% of tumour and stroma), moderate (TILMod; patchy, present in 20–80% of tumour and stroma) or low (TILLo; sparse or absent, present in <20% of tumour and stroma) TILs. Interobserver reliability was assessed, and TIL category was then correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed statistically significant differences in OS and DFS estimates when TILHi and TILMod patients were compared with TILLo patients (P < 0.0001 for TILHi versus TILLo; P < 0.0001 for TILMod versus TILLo). Statistical significance was retained when TILHi and TILMod patients were grouped into a single category (TILHi) and compared with TILLo patients (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: We demonstrate the prognostic utility of TILs in patients with HPV-associated OpSCC in clinical practice.

Cultivation of microalgae Chlorella sp. in municipal sewage for biofuel production and utilization of biochar derived from residue for the conversion of hematite iron ore (Fe2O3) to iron (Fe) – Integrated algal biorefinery,"Ashokkumar V., Chen W.-H., Kamyab H., Kumar G., Al-Muhtaseb A.H., Ngamcharussrivichai C.",2019-12-15,"Biodiesel production, Biofuel production, Biomass productions, Chlorella sp, Extracted residue, Metallic iron, Municipal sewage, Nitrogen atmospheres, Biodiesel, Metallic iron conversion, Microalgae Chlorella sp., municipal sewage, Seaweed Sargassum","This study demonstrated the utilization of municipal sewage for high biomass production at large scale and achieved highest biomass yield of 46.3 tons and the lipid yield of 13.7 metric tons per acre in a year. The extracted crude lipid was analyzed for biodiesel production, and the yield attained was 92.5 wt% with respect to initial lipid weight. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residue obtained from two different algal biomass such as Chlorella sp. and Sargassum sp. were explored for biochar production through a slow pyrolysis technique at 400 °C. The hematite iron ore reduction with algal biochar was performed non-isothermally at 1100 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The metallic iron synthesis from hematite iron ore involves three major steps, and they were as follows (1) in this step the Fe3O4 was synthesized from Fe2O3 at the temperature of 350–450 °C; (2) this step contain the formation of FeO from Fe3O4 at the temperature of 700–850 °C; (3) finally the formation of metallic iron (Fe) was observed at higher temperature of 850–1100 °C. Herein, we established a novel low-cost microalgae-based biorefinery approach for the production of bioenergy and residue for metallic iron production from municipal waste.","fluidex; related topics, biotechnology, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Energy (all), Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

A seepage analysis is conducted using the random finite element method to obtain pore water pressure distribution. A stability analysis is performed to show the variation of safety factors and failure probability. The results show that the random field of the soil-water characteristic curve produces a significant variation of pore water pressure, while the random field of the effective friction angle is the most important parameter for probabilistic stability analysis.","water engineeringneering, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

The aim of this study was to investigate the apparent effectiveness of these channel blockers using a model of trigeminal activation in vivo. Rats were anaesthetized before electrically stimulating the dura mater adjacent the middle meningeal artery. Neurons responding to stimulation were recorded extracellularly using electrophysiological methods. l-Glutamate or NMDA, and Mg2+, memantine, or sodium controls were applied locally using microiontophoresis. Microiontophoretic application of Mg2+ or memantine into the trigeminocervical complex inhibited mechanically and electrically stimulated craniovascular afferents, and l-glutamate or NMDA-evoked neuronal activity at the second-order trigeminal synapse of craniovascular afferents. By contrast, intravenous administration of MgSO4 (100 mg/kg) or memantine (10 mg/kg) did not significantly affect electrically stimulated afferent-evoked activity within the trigeminocervical complex. The Mg2+ and memantine concentrations achieved after systemic administration may not effectively inhibit activation of the trigeminocervical complex, perhaps providing an explanation for the relatively poor efficacy of these NMDA receptor open-channel blockers for headache treatment in clinical studies. Nevertheless, the present results suggest blocking of NMDA-receptor open channels inhibits nociceptive activation of the trigeminocervical complex. Further exploration of such channel blockers as a therapeutic strategy for primary head pain is warranted.",neuroscience,Neuroscience (all)

Antifouling properties of blend membranes were also investigated. Flat sheet membranes were prepared by phase inversion technique using different concentrations of CA and PMVEMA. The prepared membranes were characterized and their performance was evaluated by measuring pure water flux, water uptake capacity and humic acid removal. Rejection of humic acid (HA) was observed to be around 97% for all the blend membranes because of electrostatic interactions between the functional groups of HA and blends. The fouling characteristics of the membranes was assessed using HA as a foulant and the antifouling capacity of blend membranes was observed to be greater with a flux recovery ratio of almost 95% when compared to bare CA, commercial CA (TechInc) and other reported CA blends used for HA rejection. Also, the blend membranes were very effective in removing heavy metal ions (Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cr+6) and humic acid simultaneously. Overall, the PMVEMA modified CA membranes can open up new possibilities in enhancing the hydrophilicity, permeability and antifouling properties.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Prevalence and factors associated with underweight children: A population-based subnational analysis from Pakistan,"Kumar R., Abbas F., Mahmood T., Somrongthong R.",2019-07-01,"Age Factors, Birth Order, Body Size, Child, Preschool, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diarrhea, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Pakistan, Patient Acuity, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Sex Factors, Thinness, community child health, epidemiology, nutrition, public health","Objectives This study aims to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with underweight children under the age of 5 in Punjab, Pakistan. Design We analysed cross-sectional household-level subnationally representative Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. Settings Punjab province, Pakistan. Participants 24 042 children under 5 years of age. Data analysis Multilevel multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Prevalence of moderately and severely underweight children was found to be (33.3% and 11.3%, respectively). Multivariate multilevel logistic regression results show that as the child grows older the likelihood of the child being underweight increases significantly (eg, children between 12 and 23 months are one and half times more likely to be underweight, whereas children between the ages of 36 and 47 months are two and a half times more likely to be underweight). Gender was found to be another significant factor contributing to underweight prevalence among children under the age of 5. The likelihood of a girl child being underweight is more than that of a boy child being underweight (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.0). Similarly, a child whose birth order is three or more is two times more likely to be underweight (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.5) relative to a child of a lower birth order. Moreover, diarrhoea also significantly increases the likelihood of the child being underweight (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5). Child size is another determinant for underweight prevalence among children under 5, for example, a child with a size smaller than average at the time of birth is 2.7 times more likely to be moderately underweight than a child with an average or larger than average size at the time of birth. Conclusion Rigorous community-based interventions should be developed and executed throughout the province to improve this grave situation of underweight prevalence in Punjab. Mother's education should be uplifted by providing them formal education and providing awareness about the importance of proper nutrition for children.",medical,Medicine (all)
Sugar-sweetened Beverage Tax and Potential Impact on Dental Caries in Thai Adults: An Evaluation Using the Group Model Building Approach,"Urwannachotima N., Hanvoravongchai P., Ansah J.P.",2019-01-01,"Causal loop diagrams, Complex dynamics, Dental caries, Group model building, Oral health educations, Potential impacts, stakeholders, Systems modelling, causal loop diagram, dental caries, group model building, stakeholders, sugar-sweetened beverage tax","Sugar-sweetened beverage tax (SSB tax) has been proposed in Thailand in an attempt to reduce sugar content in beverages and sugar consumption among the Thai population. However, it is uncertain if the SSB tax will translate into lower sugar consumption and consequently improve dental caries. This paper aims to elicit and represent the complex dynamic relationships between SSB tax, sugar consumption, and dental caries in Thailand. A group model building approach, based on the systems modelling methodology of system thinking, was used to engage stakeholders to develop a causal loop diagram (causal map) to elucidate the dynamic interrelationships of SSB tax on sugar consumption and dental caries. The causal loop diagram identified seven balancing feedback loops and one reinforcing feedback loop. The balancing loops operate to reduce the prevalence of dental caries and the impact of SSB tax on SSB consumption, while the reinforcing loop operates to maintain the share of SSB consumption among the Thai population. The main insight from this study suggests that implementing SSB tax alone will not achieve the desired oral health outcomes, without combining it with other non-tariff interventions—such as oral health education and improved access to oral health services. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","sociology, Business, decision sciences","Social Sciences (all), Strategy and Management, Information Systems and Management"

We sought to understand the association between health related quality of life, socioeconomic status and race among patients with kidney stones.Materials and Methods:Patients with stones at a total of 11 stone centers across the United States completed the WISQOL (Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire). The patient ZIP Code™ was used to estimate household income. A mixed effects regression model was constructed for analysis with ZIP Code as the random intercept.Results:A total of 2,057 stone formers completed the WISQOL. Lower income was independently associated with significantly lower health related quality of life (β = 0.372, p = 0.014), as were nonwhite race (β = -0.299, p = 0.001), unemployed work status (β = -0.291, p = 0.008), female gender (β = -0.204, p <0.001), body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2 (β = -0.380, p <0.001), 5 or more medical comorbidities (β = -0.354, p = 0.001), severe recurrent stone formation (β = -0.146, p = 0.045), enrollment at an acute care visit, or a preoperative or postoperative appointment (β = -0.548, p <0.001) and recent stone symptoms (β = -0.892, p <0.001).Conclusions:Lower income, nonwhite race and unemployed work status were independently associated with lower health related quality of life among patients with kidney stones. While clinical characteristics such as body mass and stone disease severity were also associated with health related quality of life, this study shows that socioeconomic factors are similarly important. Further research to understand the specific mechanisms by which socioeconomic status and race impact health may lend insight into methods to optimize clinical treatment of stone formers and patients with other chronic diseases.","genergyal, medical",Urology

Initially, health service utilisations were fully supported by the government and were subsequently followed by the Revolving Drug Fund. In the 2000s, four health financing schemes, namely the Social Security Organization, the State Authority for Social Security, the Health Equity Fund and Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI), were introduced with various target groups. However, as these voluntary schemes have suffered from a very low enrolment rate, the government decided to pilot the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, which offers a flat, co-payment system for health service utilisation. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the NHI in terms of its accessibility and in providing financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure. Methods: The data collection process was implemented in hospitals of two districts of Savannakhet province. A structured questionnaire was used to retrieve all required information from 342 households; the information comprised of the socioeconomics of the household, accessibility to health services and financial payment for both outpatient and inpatient department services. Binary logistic regression models were used to discover the impact of NHI in terms of accessibility and financial protection. The impact of NHI was then compared with the outcomes of the preceding, voluntary CBHI scheme, which had been the subject of earlier studies. Results: Under the NHI, it was found that married respondents, large households and the level of income significantly increased the probability of accessibility to health service utilisation. Most importantly, NHI significantly improved accessibility for the poorest income quantile. In terms of financial protection, households with an existing chronic condition had a significantly higher chance of suffering financial catastrophe when compared to households with healthy members. As probability of catastrophic expenditure was not affected by income level, it was indicated that NHI is able to provide equity in financial protection. Conclusion: The models found that the NHI significantly enhances accessibility for poor income households, improving health service distribution and accessibility for the various income levels when compared to the CBHI coverage. Additionally, it was also found that NHI had enhanced financial protection since its introduction. However, the NHI policy requires a dramatically high level of government subsidy; therefore, there its long-term sustainability remains to be determined.",medical,Health Policy

Three surveys were performed to map the area for the natural groundwater tracers radon, thoron and salinity. The results from all three surveys were internally consistent showing a point source adjacent to a large pier that serves the complex. It may be that a piling, driven into the ground to support the pier, intercepted a shallow aquifer and this resulted in an underground pathway between land and sea. Some low-density sediments are enriched in radium, we suspect from fly ash from a nearby power plant. Water quality parameters showed that total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) correlated strongly to nitrite, dissolved inorganic phosphate and silica, indicating a common source. Data analysis shows that diffuse seepage accounts for more discharge than the point source.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; estuarine, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water engineeringneering, pollutant transport, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

The 13C NMR spectra revealed that the synthesized HBE mainly had a dendritic structure as confirmed by the high degree of branching (DB). The addition of PEG in the resin enhanced degree of branching (DB) (from 0.82 to 0.90), epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) (from 697 g eq-1 to 468 g eq-1) as well as curing reaction. Adding 5-10 wt.% PEG in the resin decreased the onset and peak curing temperatures and glass transition temperature; however, adding 15 wt.% PEG in the resin have increased these thermal properties due to the lowest EEW. The curing kinetics were evaluated by fitting the experimental data of the curing behavior of all resins with the Šesták-Berggren equation. The activation energy increased with the increase of PEG in the resins due to HBE's steric hindrance, whereas the activation energy of HBE15P decreased due to a large amount of equivalent active epoxy group per mass sample. The curing behavior and thermal properties of obtained hyperbranched BPA/PEG epoxy resin would be suitable for using in electronics application.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Genes involved in this response that impact fungal fitness and host immune responses remain to be fully defined. In this study, we observed that a yeast ssd1 homolog, ssdA, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is involved in trehalose and cell wall homeostasis. An ssdA null mutant strain exhibited an increase in trehalose levels and a reduction in fungal colony growth rate. In contrast, overexpression of ssdA perturbed trehalose biosynthesis and reduced germination of conidia. The ssdA null mutant strain was more resistant to cell wall-perturbing agents, while overexpression of ssdA increased sensitivity. Overexpression of ssdA significantly increased chitin levels, and both loss and overexpression of ssdA altered subcellular localization of the class V chitin synthase CsmA. Strikingly, overexpression of ssdA abolished adherence to abiotic surfaces and severely attenuated the virulence of A. fumigatus in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Despite the severe in vitro fitness defects observed upon loss of ssdA, neither surface adherence nor murine survival was impacted. In conclusion, A. fumigatus SsdA plays a critical role in cell wall homeostasis impacting A. fumigatus-host interactions.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Biology"

The Mg-Al catalysts were synthesized via co-precipitation method and calcined at different temperatures at 450℃, 600℃ and 900℃. It revealed that the calcination temperature affected the physicochemical properties and the catalytic activity of these catalysts toward the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol. It was found that ethanol conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature from 200 to 400℃, whereas acetaldehyde selectivity decreased. At low reaction temperature (200-300℃), the non-calcined catalyst (Mg-Al-000) showed the highest ethanol conversion, which can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups on surface having acetaldehyde as a major product. The calcination process led to formation of mixed oxide phase in Mg-Al catalysts as proven by the XRD and FT-IR results. The catalyst calcined at 450℃ (Mg-Al-450) exhibited the highest basicity as measured by the CO 2 -TPD with ethanol conversion of 45.8% and acetaldehyde yield of 29.7% at 350℃.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Currently, available assays are laborious and require sophisticated laboratory expertise. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a recently introduced automated screening assay for G6PD deficiency by comparing with a routine spectrophotometric assay. Methods: An automated UV-based enzymatic (Mindray, PRC) and spectrophotometric assays were performed simultaneously in parallel to determine G6PD activity in 251 blood samples from the subjects. Results: The median G6PD activity value from spectrophotometric assay was significantly lower than that of from the automated assay. The mean difference was −2.0 U/g haemoglobin (−7.3 to 3.2; P < 0.0001). The mean activity values of both assays were strongly correlated with Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.8. Cohen's kappa statistics between assays was 0.77 (0.70-0.83). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the automated assay were 85.7%, 99.2%, 85.7%, 99.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive values of the automated assay for identifying intermediate G6PD activity levels were 40.0% and 25.0%, respectively.

The resulting MiSeq sequencing revealed the co-occurrence patterns of both abundant and rare microbial taxa within an impacted groundwater basin. Proteobacteria were the most common groundwater-associated bacterial phylum, mainly composed of the classes Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria. The phyla detected at less abundances were the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Nitrospirae. The members of detected groundwater microorganisms involved in natural biogeochemical processes such as nitrification, anammox, methane oxidation, sulfate reduction, and arsenic transformation. Some of the detected microorganisms were able to perform anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants. The resulting PCA indicates that major land usage within the sampling area seemed to be significantly linked to the groundwater microbial distributions.

The plastic fabrication process can be modified to form various shapes, colors and specifications according to customer needs. Consequently, the amount of plastic waste is increasing due to the increase in plastic consumption because of the increasing population. Moreover, the problem of marine plastic debris is on the rise globally, including in Thailand, which results from the irresponsibility of mankind. Generally, plastic waste in Thailand can be generated from industrial processes and households. These two waste sources have caused the rise in plastic waste, which has contributed to the problem of waste management in Thailand. Additionally, Thailand is one of the contributors to the leakage of plastic waste into the ocean, which results from inefficient waste management. To reduce the impacts of plastic waste, effective measures have to be applied, such as reducing, reusing and recycling (3Rs) or energy recovery from plastic wastes. To ensure the proper management of solid waste, Thailand has established the National 3R Strategy and the National Master Plan for Waste Management (2016–2021). Furthermore, Thailand also launched a “Plastic Debris Management Plan 2017–2021”, which comprises several approaches, such as promotion and introduction of eco-packaging design and eco-friendly plastic substitution, development of the material flow for plastic containers and packaging inventory, implementation of the 3Rs (reduce–reuse–recycle) strategy for plastic debris management, and the promotion of education for relevant stakeholders in the field of plastics and its alternative materials. In addition, the options to create more effective plastic waste management are to implement legislation or revise the laws to improve the efficiency and reduce the amount of plastic waste, such as imposing plastic bag fees, strengthening the 3Rs measures, and encouraging the implementation of a circular economy in plastic value chains.","environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

Because of the ferromagnetic property of the Fe nanoparticles, Fe-CNHs can be manipulated by applying a magnetic field. In this study, a heat treatment on Fe-CNHs under a vacuum condition at 50 Pa up to 800 °C was performed to enhance their magnetic property. An analysis of AC magnetic susceptibility at room temperature indicated that the magnetic susceptibility of Fe-CNHs was enhanced by more than twice using this vacuum heat treatment. This increase in the magnetic susceptibility should enhance the handling performance of the Fe-CNHs in fluid media, and this finding should be useful to develop catalyst supports which can be recovered using magnetic field. Additionally, an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that Fe was oxidized partially by residual air to form ferrimagnetic Fe3O4 (magnetite) in the vacuumed system, contributing to the enhancement in the magnetic susceptibility of Fe-CNHs. Meanwhile, the growth of bcc Fe crystal grain was observed. It was remarkable that the products observed here did not suffer from the transformation of Fe to paramagnetic Fe2O3. Also, there was no serious damage in the carbonaceous part of Fe-CNHs detected by microscopic observation. N2 adsorption analysis suggested that only a moderate increase in BET specific surface area of Fe-CNHs was observed by the vacuum heat treatment. All of these results suggest that while the magnetic property of Fe-CNHs is highly enhanced, most of the carbonaceous structures can be preserved by the present method. Such functionalization of Fe-CNHs cannot be achieved by conventional methods using heat treatment in air or in CO2–N2 mixture.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

The low-temperature desorption regime spatially limited to the vicinity of some Au nanoparticles (NPs) is catalytically enhanced, resulting in oxide pinholes which expand laterally into macro holes many times the size of the catalyzing NPs and with shapes dictated by the underlying crystallography. The high-temperature desorption regime causes homogeneous oxides thinning and, ultimately, complete oxide desorption. The temperature difference between the two regimes is ∼25 °C-60 °C. After oxide desorption and depending on Au size and GaAs surface orientation, Au particles may dissolve the fresh GaAs surface and form mobile AuGa2/Ga core/shell units, or form stationary AuGa2 crystallites, or the catalyzing Au particles may run with minimal reaction with the GaAs surface. These results will add to the fundamental understanding of many Au-based nanofabrication processes, particularly the epitaxial growth of vertical and lateral nanowires.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Premature small for gestational age infants fed an exclusive human milk-based diet achieve catch-up growth without metabolic consequences at 2 years of age,"Visuthranukul C., Abrams S.A., Hawthorne K.M., Hagan J.L., Hair A.B.",2019-05-01,"Adiposity, Anthropometry, Birth Weight, Female, Gestational Age, Growth, Humans, Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena, Infant, Newborn, Infant, Premature, Infant, Small for Gestational Age, Insulin, Insulin Resistance, Intensive Care, Neonatal, Male, Milk, Human, Weight Gain, adiposity, human milk, metabolic outcomes, premature infants, SGA infants","Objective To compare postdischarge growth, adiposity and metabolic outcomes of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) versus small for gestational age (SGA) premature infants fed an exclusive human milk (HM)-based diet in the neonatal intensive care unit. Design Premature infants (birth weight ≤1250 g) fed an exclusive HM-based diet were examined at 12-15 months corrected gestational age (CGA) (visit 1) for anthropometrics, serum glucose and non-fasting insulin, and at 18-22 months CGA (visit 2) for body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Of 51 children, 33 were AGA and 18 were SGA at birth. The SGA group had weight gain (g/day) equal to AGA group during the follow-up period. SGA had a significantly greater body mass index (BMI) z-score gain from visit 1 to visit 2 (0.25±1.10 vs '0.21±0.84, p=0.02) reflecting catch-up growth. There were no significant differences in total fat mass (FM) and trunk FM between groups. SGA had significantly lower insulin level (5.0±3.7 vs 17.3±15.1 μU/mL, p=0.02) and homeostatic model of assessment-insulin resistance (1.1±0.9 vs 4.3±4.1, p=0.02). Although regional trunk FM correlated with insulin levels in SGA (r=0.893, p=0.04), they had lower insulin level compared with AGA and no difference in adiposity. Conclusions SGA premature infants who received an exclusive HM-based diet exhibited greater catch-up growth without increased adiposity or elevated insulin resistance compared with AGA at 2 years of age. An exclusive HM-based diet may improve long-term body composition and metabolic outcomes of premature infants with ≤1250 g birth weight, specifically SGA.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

In this work, we propose image acquisition from colloidal solutions of AgNPrs using a combination of transmitted and scattered light. The developed measurement technique could be carried out by separately recording transmitted and scattering images of the solutions, using a mobile device camera prior to a calculation of the empirical absorption value (IA). The IA value of green for AgNPrs solutions was found to be in agreement with the absorption spectra obtained using a conventional spectroscopic technique. This technique was utilized for the quantifications of hydrogen peroxide and glucose. Good linearities between ΔIA and those typical analytes were observed. The limit of detection for the typical biosensor of glucose was 19.8 μM. As such, we expect the methodology herein developed for hydrogen peroxide and glucose determinations by means of monitoring the color change of transmitted and scatting images from solutions to contribute to the development of simple, rapid, and reliable detection systems to be further applied to biochemical analysis and clinical diagnosis, as well as to household biosensor applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry
Dissolved oxygen/free ammonia (DO/FA) ratio manipulation to gain distinct proportions of nitrogen species in effluent of entrapped-cell-based reactors,"Rongsayamanont C., Khan E., Limpiyakorn T.",2019-12-01,"Ammonia, Bioreactors, Nitrification, Nitrites, Nitrogen, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxygen, Dissolved oxygen, Dissolved oxygen/free ammonia ratio, Entrapped cell, Free ammonia, Partial nitrification","Oxygen-limiting and/or free ammonia (FA)-accumulating conditions are two common operating strategies for partial nitrification in wastewater. Controlling either bulk dissolved oxygen (DO) or free ammonia (FA) concentration to maintain partial nitrification can be challenging due to the strong interdependency between these two parameters as substrates for ammonia oxidation. In this study, DO/FA ratio is proposed as a controlling parameter for partial nitrification by entrapped-cell-based reactors. At DO/FA >1.5, both ammonia and nitrite oxidation proceeded without inhibition leading to complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. An effluent containing nitrate as the main nitrogen species can be produced at these ratios. At a DO/FA ratio range of 0.2–1.5, ammonia oxidation proceeded without efficiency deterioration, while nitrite oxidation decreased with decreasing DO/FA ratio. At the ratios of 0.2–0.6, an effluent containing mainly nitrite can be generated. At DO/FA <0.2, both ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation were inhibited and the effluent with nearly equal molar of ammonia and nitrite was obtained. By controlling DO/FA ratio, effluents with different proportions of nitrogen species can be produced allowing the entrapped-cell-based system to be adaptable as an initial reactor for various nitrogen removal approaches.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
The house dust mite allergen Der p 5 binds lipid ligands and stimulates airway epithelial cells through a TLR2-dependent pathway,"Pulsawat P., Soongrung T., Satitsuksanoa P., LeMignon M., Khemili S., Gilis D., Nony E., Kennedy M., Jacquet A.",2019-03-01,"Animals, Antigens, Dermatophagoides, Arthropod Proteins, Bronchi, Cell Line, Epithelial Cells, Humans, Hypersensitivity, Ligands, Lipids, Molecular Docking Simulation, Pyroglyphidae, Signal Transduction, Toll-Like Receptor 2, allergen, Der p 5, house dust mite, innate immune signalling pathways, lipid binding protein, TLR2","Background: Protein crystallographic studies suggest that the house dust mite (HDM) allergen Der p 5 potentially interacts with hydrophobic ligands. Der p 5, in association with its ligand(s), might therefore trigger innate immune signalling pathways in the airway epithelium and influence the initiation of the HDM-allergic response. Objective: We investigated the lipid binding propensities of recombinant (r)Der p 5 and characterized the signalling pathways triggered by the allergen in airway epithelial cells. Methods: rDer p 5 was produced in Pichia pastoris and characterized by mass spectrometry, multi-angle light scattering and circular dichroism. Its interactions with hydrophobic ligands were investigated in fluorescence-based lipid binding assays and in-silico docking simulations. Innate immune signalling pathways triggered by rDer p 5 were investigated in airway epithelial cell activation assays in vitro. Results: Biophysical analysis showed that rDer p 5 was monomeric and adopted a similar α-helix-rich fold at both physiological and acidic pH. Spectrofluorimetry experiments showed that rDer p 5 is able to selectively bind lipid ligands, but only under mild acidic pH conditions. Computer-based docking simulations identified potential binding sites for these ligands. This allergen, with putatively associated lipid(s), triggered the production of IL-8 in respiratory epithelial cells through a TLR2-, NF-kB- and MAPK-dependent signalling pathway. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Despite the fact that Der p 5 represents a HDM allergen of intermediate prevalence, our findings regarding its lipid binding and activation of TLR2 indicate that it could participate in the initiation of the HDM-allergic state.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

From a coal combustion process, a huge amount of coal waste such as bottom ash is generated. The most common method for coal-waste disposal is a landfill which creates the environmental problems. However, the coal-waste utilization like soil amendment is a better way to manage the waste as well as to reduce the environmental impacts and to increase the profit for the manufacturers. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to measure the properties of soil mixed with bottom ash from coal waste and to apply the bottom ash to improve the soil quality by growing one types of plants, chili, and to compare the results with the normal soil and soil with fertilizer. The operating parameters of this study are the compositions of coal-waste mixed with soil and fertilizer ranging from 0 to 30%wt. Furthermore, the pH, bulk density as well as soil texture are also measured and studied. From the results, it is found that bottom ash can help growing both plants especially chili with 10%wt bottom ash.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Thus, the synergy test by time-kill assay might be appropriate for the screening of the synergy. Objective: We aimed to test the adjuvant property of ascorbate with ceftriaxone, a frequently prescribed β-lactam antibiotic. Method: Ascorbate was tested with several bacteria from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli for i) bactericidal property of ascorbate, alone or with ceftriaxone-combination, by time-kill assay, ii) an influence on the killing-activity of bone-marrow-derived macrophage and iii) the attenuation of myositis mouse model. Result: The bactericidal synergy (determined with time-kill assay at 24 h) against S. aureus, but not other selected bacteria, was demonstrated in ascorbate (10 and 40 mM) plus ceftriaxone at the minimal inhibitory concentration (1x MIC). Ascorbate alone, without antibiotic, enhanced macrophage killing-activity and directly eliminated bacteria at the concentration 10–40 mM and 250 mM, respectively (both properties presented against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, but not other bacteria). Ascorbate with ceftriaxone also reduced bacterial burdens in muscle and serum cytokines of S. aureus-myositis mouse model. Moreover, the synergy against the clinical isolated methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by time-kill assay and myositis model also presented. Conclusion: Ascorbate-ceftriaxone synergy against S. aureus was demonstrated by time-kill assay and myositis model.

The reviews are separated into two groups, reviews originally written in English and non-English. Rather than discarding non-English reviews or constructing models for each origin language, we experiment with different ways of utilizing the non-English reviews by translating them into English. Results show that models constructed using the reviews originally written in English are also effective for translated reviews. This can significantly reduce the effort to understand the sentiment of reviews written in various languages by training only one model and applying it to text translated from any language.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Human-Computer Interaction, Signal Processing, Software, Information Systems and Management"

Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand have been conducting multicultural PBL titled ‘‘Global Awareness for Technology Implementation in the Solving of Global Issues’’ since 2015. The program is composed of online group work in remote setting, and both-ways visits to and from Japan and Thailand. This paper discusses in detail trend and characteristics of motivation and learning outcomes of multicultural PBL for students from Tokyo Institute of Technology and Chulalongkorn University. In so doing, this paper summarizes (1) process of Multicultural PBL, (2) functions and roles of on-line tools for communication for program implementation, and (3) result of comparative analysis. For comparative analysis, following methods were utilized; (1) pre and post survey using Likert scale, (2) content analysis using personal essays, and (3) participants observation. Based on the multicultural PBL’s objectives, five indicator-categories namely (1) global awareness, (2) multicultural understanding, (3) multicultural teamwork, (4) critical thinking, and (5) technology implementation are set. Several finding which are common to students from both universities for both years were observed. First, it was found out that students had high interests on going abroad before they join the program. Second, students are interested in advanced countries. Third, even before joining the multicultural PBL, students have realized the importance of respecting cultural differences. Forth, before the program, they are not yet prepared for finding solution for social issues, as wells as methods of technology localization/implementation. Fifth, after joining the multicultural PBL, students have increased understanding of cultural differences and knowledge on the topics related to two countries.

Methodology: Thirty-two rat molar pulps were mechanically exposed and assigned to 4 groups according to the pulp capping materials used Ca(OH)2, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), Biodentine™ and an untreated control group. After 4 weeks, the teeth were collected for microcomputed tomography to quantify reparative dentine formation. Histological analysis was then performed to evaluate the quality of the reparative dentine and the dental pulp tissue inflammatory reaction. Cyclin D1 and β-catenin expression was examined using immunofluorescence staining. The Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test was performed to determine significant differences. Results: The exposed dental pulps treated with Ca(OH)2, MTA and Biodentine™ exhibited reparative dentine formation near the exposure site. Fibrous tissues adjacent to the exposure site were observed in the untreated group. The microcomputed tomography evaluation of MTA and Biodentine™ groups revealed significantly greater reparative dentine formation compared with the control group (P = 0.0032 in the MTA group and P = 0.05 in the BiodentineTM group). From histological evaluations, the BiodentineTM group exhibited significantly greater reparative dentine formation grading compared with the control group (P = 0.0152). The pulp tissues treated with Ca(OH)2 and Biodentine™ exhibited a lower inflammatory score compared with those of the untreated control (P = 0.0291 in the Ca(OH)2 and P = 0.0110 in the BiodentineTM group). Ca(OH)2, MTA and Biodentine™ induced cyclin D1 expression in the dental pulp tissues adjacent to the reparative dentine. Moreover, the Biodentine™-treated defects demonstrated β-catenin expression in the pulp tissue adjacent to the newly formed reparative dentine, which was not observed with the other materials. Conclusion: All test materials promoted dentine bridge formation and stimulated cyclin D1 expression. The favourable outcome after direct pulp capping with Biodentine™ involved Wnt/β-catenin signalling. However, Wnt/β-catenin signalling did not participate in the mechanism by which Ca(OH)2 and MTA promoted reparative dentine formation.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Dissecting the genetic loci controlling salt tolerance in rice for improving productivity, especially at the flowering stage, remains challenging. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of salt tolerance based on exome sequencing of the Thai rice accessions. Results: Photosynthetic parameters and cell membrane stability under salt stress at the flowering stage; and yield-related traits of 104 Thai rice (Oryza sativa L.) accessions belonging to the indica subspecies were evaluated. The rice accessions were subjected to exome sequencing, resulting in 112,565 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) called with a minor allele frequency of at least 5%. LD decay analysis of the panel indicates that the average LD for SNPs at 20 kb distance from each other was 0.34 (r 2 ), which decayed to its half value (~ 0.17) at around 80 kb. By GWAS performed using mixed linear model, two hundred loci containing 448 SNPs on exons were identified based on the salt susceptibility index of the net photosynthetic rate at day 6 after salt stress; and the number of panicles, filled grains and unfilled grains per plant. One hundred and forty six genes, which accounted for 73% of the identified loci, co-localized with the previously reported salt quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The top four regions that contained a high number of significant SNPs were found on chromosome 8, 12, 1 and 2. While many are novel, their annotation is consistent with potential involvement in plant salt tolerance and in related agronomic traits. These significant SNPs greatly help narrow down the region within these QTLs where the likely underlying candidate genes can be identified. Conclusions: Insight into the contribution of potential genes controlling salt tolerance from this GWAS provides further understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms of rice at the flowering stage, which can help improve yield productivity under salinity via gene cloning and genomic selection.",biochemistryistry,"Biotechnology, Genetics"

In vitro resorbability of 3D printed hydroxyapatite in two different pH buffered solutions,"Thammarakcharoen F., Palanuruksa P., Suwanprateeb J.",2019-01-01,"Bone graft, Buffered solutions, Calcium phosphate crystals, Octacalcium phosphate, Resorbability, Sample surface, Soaking periods, Succinic acids, Bone graft, Hydroxyapatite, Octacalcium phosphate, pH, Resorbability","Resorability of 3D printed hydroxyapatite (3DP HA) in deionized water solution which was buffered with succinic acid-NaOH (pH 5.5) and Tris(hydroxymethyl aminomethane) (pH 7.4) for 1, 7, 14 and 28 days was carried out. Weight change and release of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were used to evaluate the sample resorption. It was found that the weight of samples soaking in both pH 5.5 and 7.4 solutions decreased with increasing soaking times, but the degree of decrease was greater at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.4. ICP-OES results showed that the release of Ca and P in both pH solutions increased with immersing times. The amount of Ca and P released at pH 5.5 was higher than at pH 7.4. Phase composition of the samples and the microstructure of the sample were characterized using XRD and SEM respectively. XRD analysis showed that hydroxyapatite (HA) and octacalcium phosphate (°CP) phases were found at the center of all samples, but the intensity of °CP peaks tended to decrease with increasing times. Only HA was found on the sample surface after immersion in both pH solutions at all soaking periods. After immersion, newly formed crystals were seen both at the center and/or on the surface of samples. These results suggested that pH could influence the resorption of the samples and also the formation of new calcium phosphate crystals.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

It has to be integrated with other Business Process Management system (BPM) components to implement specified functionalities related to the applications. The current efforts in integrating this technology into BPM are at a very early stage. To apply Blockchain into business processes efficiently, Blockchain and business process characteristics must be identified. Inconsistency of confirmation settlement that heavily relies on the implementation of consensus protocol poses a major challenge in business process operations, especially ones that are time-critical. In addition, validators, nodes responsible for performing consensus operations in a Blockchain system, can introduce bias and as a result are not trustable. This paper first defines Blockchain and also investigates the characteristics of Blockchain and business processes. Then, we suggest an architecture of business processes in Blockchain era to overcome the problems of time inconsistency and consensus bias. The architecture provides persistency, validity, auditability, and disintermediary that Blockchain offers. The architecture also provides flexibility by allowing business partner to select nodes in performing consensus; thus bias is mitigated.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, decision sciences","Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Information Systems and Management"
Painful and non-painful diabetic polyneuropathy: Clinical characteristics and diagnostic issues,"Gylfadottir S.S., Weeracharoenkul D., Andersen S.T., Niruthisard S., Suwanwalaikorn S., Jensen T.S.",2019-09-01,"Diabetic Neuropathies, Humans, Mass Screening, Pain, Severity of Illness Index, Clinical characteristics, Diabetic neuropathy, Diagnosis","Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes and can be either painful or non-painful. It is challenging to diagnose this complication, as no biomarker or clear consensus on the clinical definition of either painful or non-painful DN exists. Hence, a hierarchical classification has been developed categorizing the probability of the diagnosis into: possible, probable or definite, based on the clinical presentation of symptoms and signs. Pain is a warning signal of tissue damage, and non-painful DN therefore represents a clinical and diagnostic challenge because it often goes unnoticed until irreversible nerve damage has occurred. Simple clinical tests seem to be the best for evaluation of DN in the general care for diabetes. Screening programs at regular intervals might be the most optimal strategy for early detection and interventions to possibly prevent further neuronal damage and to lower the economic burden of this complication.",medical,"Internal Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism"

The properties of levan and LFOs depend on their chain lengths, thereby determining their potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries such as prebiotics and anti-tumor agents. Therefore, an ability to redesign and engineer the active site of levansucrase for synthesis of products with desired degree of polymerization (DP) is very beneficial. We employed computational protein design, docking and molecular dynamics to redesign and engineer the active site of Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase for production of LFOs with DP up to five (GF4), using two approaches: 1) blocking oligosaccharide binding track of GF3-LS complex with large aromatic residues and 2) eliminating hydrogen bond interactions between terminal glucose of GF4 and side chains of binding residues of GF4-LS complex. The designed enzymes and their product patterns from these two approaches were experimentally characterized. The experimental results show that the first approach was successful in creating N251W and N251W/K372Y mutants that synthesized LFOs with DP up to five. This work illustrates how computer-aided approaches can offer novel opportunities to engineer enzymes for desired products.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

If a specific questionnaire to screen for motion sickness susceptibility is available, it would have benefit for susceptible people. This aimed at examining test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Thai, non-English version Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire Short-Form (MSSQ-Short). METHODS: The original English-version MSSQ-Short was translated into Thai and then had a backward translation into English. The process of forward and backward translation was repeated until fulfillment of content and language equivalence between the backward translation and the original questionnaire. The Thai-version MSSQ-Short then was applied to people with history of motion sickness for two occasions with a 2-wk interval. The two questionnaires were examined for test-retest reliability and the first occasion was examined for internal consistency. MSSQ total raw score and percentile score between the first and second occasions were tested for correlation. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 30 subjects. The weighted kappa values between the two occasions for the 18 subitems of the MSSQ ranged from 0.38 to 0.86, with most being in the higher range. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the MSSQ raw score between the two occasions was 0.94. The internal consistency was 0.80. CONCLUSION: The Thai, non-English version MSSQ-Short had an acceptable value for reliability.

Hematite-catalysed scorodite formation as a novel arsenic immobilisation strategy under ambient conditions,"Tabelin C.B., Corpuz R.D., Igarashi T., Villacorte-Tabelin M., Ito M., Hiroyoshi N.",2019-10-01,"Acid mine drainage, Contaminated soils, Elevated temperature, Industrial wastewaters, Mine tailings, Possible mechanisms, Scorodite, Stretching vibrations, Arsenic, Arsenicals, Catalysis, Ferric Compounds, Iron, Oxidation-Reduction, Soil Pollutants, Sulfides, Waste Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification, Acid mine drainage, Arsenic, Scorodite, Waste rock and mine tailings, Wastewaters","Scorodite is an important mineral not only for arsenic (As) removal from industrial wastewaters but also in the mobility and final fate of As in waste rocks, contaminated soils and sediments, and mine tailings. Because of the mineral's high As-loading capacity and stability, numerous studies have been done to understand its formation. Unfortunately, most of these studies were limited to elevated temperatures (>70 °C), so the processes involved in scorodite formation under ambient conditions remain unclear. This study provides evidence of the catalytic effects of hematite on the formation of scorodite at 25 °C in a pyrite-rich natural geologic material. Scorodite peaks were detected in the XRD patterns of the leaching residues with and without hematite, but those in the former were stronger and more pronounced than the latter. These results suggest that the formation of scorodite was catalysed by hematite, a generalisation that is further supported by strong characteristic IR absorption bands of scorodite at 819 cm–1 (As–O bending vibration), 785 and 725 cm–1 (As–O stretching vibrations), and 2990 cm−1 (OH-vibration) as well as the distinct XPS binding energies of Fe(III)–As (709.7 eV), As(V)–O (44.8, 44.31 and 43.7 eV), O2− (530.5 eV) and coordinated water (531.3 eV) in scorodite. This phenomenon could be attributed to three possible mechanisms: (1) more rapid precipitation promoted by the “seeding” effect of hematite particles, (2) additional supply of Fe3+ from hematite dissolution under acidic conditions, and (3) enhanced oxidations of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and As(III) to As(V) on the surface of hematite.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

To the best of our knowledge, this report was the first to fully investigate the carotenoid profiles in a microalga of the genus Coelastrum. Upon use of limited nutrients as a stress condition, the strain was able to produce astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and lutein, as the major carotenoid components. Additionally, the carotenoid esters were found to be all astaxanthin derivatives, and β-carotene was not significantly present under this stress condition. Importantly, we also demonstrated that this practical stress condition could be combined with simple growing factors, such as ambient sunlight and temperature, to achieve even more focused carotenoid profiles, i.e., increased overall amounts of the aforementioned carotenoids with fewer minor components and chlorophylls. In addition, this green microalga was capable of tolerating a wide range of salinity. Therefore, this study paved the way for more investigations and developments on this fascinating strain, which will be reported in due course.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

We recently identified the participation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt) in the neuritogenic mechanism of AS and AA. In this study, we further investigated the possible upstream target molecule and the associated downstream signaling of both triterpenoids in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. Our immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays revealed that either AS or AA exerted neurite extension activity through inhibitory effect on glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). AS appeared significantly more potent in promoting neurite elongation than AA, and concurrently expressed a higher degree of inhibition on GSK3β and RhoA activations. The mediation of GSK3β and RhoA activities in AS-treated cells involved Akt signaling. Moreover, when using GW441756, a specific tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor signaling inhibitor, the ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, the inhibitory effects on GSK3β and RhoA and the neurite outgrowth induced by AS, but not AA, were totally suppressed. In conclusion, our findings supported the different upstream regulators of AS and AA in promoting neuritogenicity in Neuro-2a cells. Although both AS and AA could enhance neurite elongation through the suppression of GSK3β and RhoA activities, only AS could modulate the effect through TrkA receptor signaling.",neuroscience,Neuroscience (all)

Currently, Thailand set 15% as the minimum reserve margin when developing a PDP. It is expected that the higher reserve margin should yield the higher reliability level. However, stronger relationship between the reserve margin and the reliability level should be clearly investigated. This paper proposes a method to link between these two measures, systematically.

This work performed a series of batch cultivations of Chlorococcum humicola to assess biomass and carotenoid production in stirred tank and airlift photobioreactors under different light qualities and supplying strategies. RESULTS: White light was preferred for growth while blue light was suitable for carotenoid production during stationary phase. Batch cultivation in stirred tank photobioreactors subjected to two-staged lighting yielded higher carotenoid productivity than single-staged lighting, with the highest productivity obtained when providing white light at 5000 lx during growth phase and combination of white (100 000 lx) and blue (5000 lx) lights during stationary phase. Subsequent cultivation in internal-loop airlift photobioreactors under optimal light setting based on two-staged study produced higher biomass (855 ± 26 mg L−1) and carotenoid (8.11 ± 0.20 mg L−1 or 9.23 ± 0.23 mg g−1) than the cultivation in stirred tank systems with the same volume and operating condition. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of carotenoid from airlift photobioreactors revealed that lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin were major carotenoids. CONCLUSIONS: This work reported for the first time the effect of light quality and supplying strategy on growth and carotenoid production in Chlorococcum humicola. Two-staged lighting with white light following by combination of white light at high intensity and blue light offered new strategy to improve carotenoid productivity.

To fill the research gap, this study examines prevalence and differentials in later-life productive engagement in developing Southeast Asia with a focus on the roles of educational attainment and gender. Based on analyses of recent aging surveys in Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand, we assess three major dimensions of productive engagement among persons aged 60 and above, i.e. their economic activity, assistance to family members, and caregiving. Results suggest that elders in all three countries make important contributions to their families–consistent with Southeast Asia's prevailing norm of reciprocity in intergenerational support. Across the three countries, assistance in household chores is the most common contribution that older persons make, followed by caregiving and economic activity. We find that education is an important factor influencing productive aging. For example, elderly Thais with some educational attainment are more likely than those without any education to participate in the labor force and in turn are able to provide financial assistance to their children. Across the three countries, we find gender differences in later-life productive engagement. While older women tend to provide non-economic contributions to family, older men provide economic contributions more than their female counterparts. Our cross-country comparison additionally indicates that societal contexts such as economic development are likely to have important implications for the extent of productive engagement among older persons with different levels of educational attainment.

These disorders represent not only a clinical health problem but also a socioeconomic problem for this region. Regarding the prevention and control of thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies in the Lao PDR, screening and diagnostic strategies should be strongly considered. The knowledge about the prevalence and molecular genotyping of thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies among the Lao Loum group, which includes the majority of Lao people, is now limited, making the prevention and control of thalassemias difficult. Methods: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of thalassemia among Lao Loum subjects of reproductive age. Multiplex gap PCR and direct sequencing were used to investigate the mutations of α-globin and β-globin genes. Results: Thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies were detected in 154 of 354 (43.50%) patients, and 22 different genotypes were identified in this cohort. Remarkably, high frequencies of hemoglobin E, α0 –thalassemia (--SEA), and α+ –thalassemia (-α3.7) were noted. A variety of hematologic features was observed, including co-inheritance of heterozygous HbE and heterozygous α-thalassemia, which was associated with significantly lower levels of MCV and MCH values than those observed in typical HbE heterozygotes. Female participants who were heterozygous for β0 or co-inheritance of heterozygous βE with heterozygous α-thalassemia exhibited mild anemia. Conclusion: Our data show that thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies have become health problems imposing a serious burden in the Lao PDR. Prevention programs aimed at decreasing the incidence of severe thalassemia diseases should be designed and initiated.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

The heterojunction solar cell incorporating the interdigitated quantum dots realized in this work would find potential applications in high-efficiency single-junction intermediate band solar cells operating under concentrated sunlight.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Inorganic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Bioaugmentation coupled with phytoremediation for the removal of phenolic compounds and color from treated palm oil mill effluent,"Jarujareet P., Nakkanong K., Luepromchai E., Suttinun O.",2019-11-01,"Acinetobacter, Biodegradation, Environmental, Biomass, Color, Palm Oil, Phenols, Plant Oils, Poaceae, Rhizosphere, Soil, Bioaugmentation, Decolorization, Dephenolization, Palm oil mill effluent, Phenol-degrading bacteria, Phytoremediation","The potential for coupling bioaugmentation with phytoremediation to simultaneously treat and utilize treated palm oil mill effluent (TPOME) in animal feed production was determined from a reduction in phenolic compounds and color in soil leachates, as well as from an increased yield of pasture grass. Two phenol-degrading bacteria—Methylobacterium sp. NP3 and Acinetobacter sp. PK1—were inoculated into the Brachiaria humidicola rhizosphere before the application of TPOME. A pot study showed that the soil with both grass and inoculated bacteria had the highest dephenolization and decolorization efficiencies, with a maximum capability of removing 70% from 587 mg total phenolic compounds added and 73% from 4438 color units during ten TPOME application cycles. The results corresponded to increases in the number of phenol-degrading bacteria and the grass yield. In a field study, this treatment was able to remove 46% from 21,453 mg total phenolic compounds added, with a maximum color removal efficiency of 52% from 5105 color units, while the uninoculated plots removed about 24–39% and 29–46% of phenolic compounds and color, respectively. The lower treatment performance was probably due to the increased TPOME concentrations. Based on the amounts of phenolic compounds, protein, and crude fiber in the grass biomass, the inoculated TPOME-treated grass had a satisfactory nutritional quality and digestibility for use as animal feed.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, aqueous electrolytes require a polymeric binder to prevent dissolution of the active material in addition to its binding properties. This study highlights binder-free, centimeter long, single-crystal, V2O5 nanofibers (BCS-VONF) on carbon cloth, as the cathode material for AZBs synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal process. BCS-VONF in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2 exhibit promising electrochemical performance with excellent capacity retention. Even in the absence of a binder, BCS-VONF were found to be very stable in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2. They will not yield to the dissolution and detachment of the active material on the current collector. The novel strategy described in this study is an essential step for the development of BCS-VONF on carbon cloth, as a promising cathode material for AZBs.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, mixing and separation, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Grape Seed extract reduces active gelatinases using an Etch-and-Rinse mode universal adhesive,"Sanon K., Sanchavanakit N., Srisawasdi S.",2019-01-01,"Composite Resins, Dental Bonding, Dental Cements, Dentin, Dentin-Bonding Agents, Gelatinases, Grape Seed Extract, Humans, Materials Testing, Resin Cements, Tensile Strength, Active gelatinases, Confocal microscope, Etch-and-rinse mode universal adhesive, Grape seed extract, In situ zymography","Purpose: To examine the effect of grape seed extract (GSE) pretreatment on the reduction of active gelatinases when using universal adhesives in etch-and-rinse mode. Materials and Methods: Fifty extracted non-carious human teeth were used in this study. Dentin powder was prepared for analysis of active MMP-2 by ELISA. Resin-dentin slices were prepared for in situ zymography in order to localize active gelatinases by quenched fluorescein-conjugated gelatin under a confocal microscope. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed quantitatively. Specimens were allocated into 6 groups: a non-treated control, phosphoric acid etched (PA), PA followed by Single Bond Universal (SBU, 3M Oral Care) or G-Premio Bond (GPB, GC), and PA followed by GSE for 1 min prior to SBU or GPB. The data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's test at a significance level of 0.05. Results: Application of the universal adhesives SBU and GPB in etch-and-rinse mode reduced active MMP-2 in dentin matrices. However, the only further significant reduction was found in GPB pre-treated with GSE, as analyzed by ELISA. In situ zymography demonstrated the location of active gelatinases, and fluorescence intensity analysis confirmed significant reduction of active gelatinases in the hybrid layer of GPB pre-teated with GSE compared to GPB alone. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated the potential advantage of applying GSE to reduce active gelatinases especially at the hybrid layer, with greater benefit achieved for hydrophobic adhesives. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action, analysis of bond strength, and long-term efficacy require further study.",dentistry,"Orthodontics, Oral Surgery, Periodontics"

In Thailand, an unidentified disease associated with runting-stunting syndrome and neoplasia, resembling REV infection, has been continuously observed in several chicken farms. However, REV infection in Thailand has never been reported. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and genetic characteristics of REVs in chickens in Thailand from 2013 to 2016. Of the 130 clinical samples obtained from 29 chicken farms from 9 provinces located in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand, including the central, eastern, northern, and northeastern parts of Thailand, 51 samples (39.23%) and 21 farms (72.41%) were REV-positive. REV-positive samples were detected in all 9 provinces tested. Our results demonstrated that REV was extensively distributed in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that Thai REV was most closely related to Chinese, Taiwanese, and the US REV strains isolated from different avian species and clustered into REV subtype III. This finding indicates that REV subtype III was predominantly circulated in Thai chicken flocks. This study is the first report on REV infection in chickens in Thailand. Our findings raise the awareness of REV as another causative agent of runting and oncogenic disease in chickens in Thailand and highlight the wide distribution of REV infection among chickens worldwide.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

The precursor of Hp-2 is zonulin, a molecule that affects intercellular tight junction integrity. Recently, we reported increased plasma IgA/IgM responses to Gram-negative bacteria in deficit schizophrenia indicating leaky gut and gut dysbiosis. The current study was performed to examine the integrity of the paracellular (tight and adherens junctions) and transcellular (cytoskeletal proteins) pathways in deficit versus non-deficit schizophrenia. We measured IgM responses to zonulin, occludin, E-cadherin, talin, actin, and vinculin in association with IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), immune activation and IgM to malondialdehyde (MDA), and NO-cysteinyl in 78 schizophrenia patients and 40 controls. We found that the ratio of IgM to zonulin + occludin/talin + actin + viculin (PARA/TRANS) was significantly greater in deficit than those in non-deficit schizophrenia and higher in schizophrenia than those in controls and was significantly associated with increased IgA responses to Gram-negative bacteria. IgM responses to zonulin were positively associated with schizophrenia (versus controls), while IgM to occludin was significantly associated with deficit schizophrenia (versus non-deficit schizophrenia and controls). A large part of the variance (90.8%) in negative and PHEM (psychosis, hostility, excitation, and mannerism) symptoms was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, IgM to E-cadherin and MDA, and memory dysfunctions, while 53.3% of the variance in the latter was explained by PARA/TRANS ratio, IgA to Gram-negative bacteria, CCL-11, TRYCATs, and immune activation. The results show an upregulated paracellular pathway with breakdown of the tight and adherens junctions and increased bacterial translocation in deficit schizophrenia. These dysfunctions in the intestinal paracellular route together with lowered natural IgM, immune activation, and production of CCL-11 and TRYCATs contribute to the phenomenology of deficit schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

We estimated and predicted the diabetes burden and mortality due to undiagnosed diabetes together with screening program efficacy and reporting completeness in Thailand, in the context of demographic changes. An age and sex structured dynamic model including demographic and diagnostic processes was constructed. The model was validated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The prevalence of DM was predicted to increase from 6.5% (95% credible interval: 6.3–6.7%) in 2015 to 10.69% (10.4–11.0%) in 2035, with the largest increase (72%) among 60 years or older. Out of the total DM cases in 2015, the percentage of undiagnosed DM cases was 18.2% (17.4–18.9%), with males higher than females (p-value < 0.01). The highest group with undiagnosed DM was those aged less than 39 years old, 74.2% (73.7–74.7%). The mortality of undiagnosed DM was ten-fold greater than the mortality of those with diagnosed DM. The estimated coverage of diabetes positive screening programs was ten-fold greater for elderly compared to young. The positive screening rate among females was estimated to be significantly higher than those in males. Of the diagnoses, 87.4% (87.0–87.8%) were reported.

A total of 122 patients with MS were included; their disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and IM&NO biomarkers were evaluated in peripheral blood samples. Patients with EDSS ≥3 were older and showed higher homocysteine, uric acid, advanced oxidized protein products (AOPP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and higher rate of metabolic syndrome (MetS), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was lower than in patients with EDSS <3; 84.6% of all patients were correctly classified in these EDSS subgroups. We found that 36.3% of the variance in EDSS score was explained by age, Th17/T regulatory (Treg) and LDL/HDL ratios and homocysteine (all positively related) and body mass index (BMI) (inversely related). After adjusting for MS treatment modalities, the effects of the LDL/HDL and zTh17/Treg ratios, homocysteine and age on disability remained, whilst BMI was no longer significant. Moreover, carbonyl proteins were associated with increased disability. In conclusion, the results showed that an inflammatory Th17 profile coupled with age and increased carbonyl proteins were the most important variables associated with high disability followed at a distance by homocysteine, MetS and LDL/HDL ratio. These data underscore that IM&NO pathways play a key role in increased disability in MS patient and may be possible new targets for the treatment of these patients. Moreover, a panel of these laboratory biomarkers may be used to predict the disability in MS.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Mutations in LTBP3 have been associated with various types of skeletal dysplasia. We aimed to characterize clinical and molecular features of more patients with mutations in the gene, which may help suggest genotype–phenotype correlation. The first two East Asian patients with short stature, heart defects, and orodental anomalies having LTBP3 mutations were identified. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing revealed that the one with a novel heterozygous missense (c.2017G>T, p.Gly673Cys) mutation in LTBP3 had clinical features consistent with acromicric dysplasia (ACMICD). The variant was located in the highly conserved EGF-like calcium-binding domain adjacent to the single reported LTBP3 variant associated with ACMICD. This finding supports that LTBP3 is a disease gene for ACMICD. Another patient with a novel homozygous splice site acceptor (c.1721-2A>G) mutation in LTBP3 was affected with dental anomalies and short stature (DASS). Previously undescribed orodental features included multiple unerupted teeth, high-arched palate, and microstomia found in our patient with ACMICD, and extensive dental infection, condensing osteitis, and deviated alveolar bone formation in our patient with DASS. Our results and comprehensive reviews suggest a genotype–phenotype correlation: biallelic loss-of-function mutations cause DASS, monoallelic missense gain-of-function mutations in the EGF-like domain cause ACMICD, and monoallelic missense gain-of-function mutations with more drastic effects on the protein functions cause geleophysic dysplasia (GPHYSD3). In summary, we expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of LTBP3-related disorders, support that LTBP3 is a disease gene for ACMICD, and propose the genotype–phenotype correlation of LTBP3 mutations.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Genetics"

Interfacial adhesion improvement of mTPS favors PLA crystallization, and produces a large δ-crystal (100–150 nm) with isotropic orientation when combining with BO stretching. High draw ratio (5 × 5), and BO stretching rate (75 mm s−1) lead to tight packing of PLA lamellae in both BO-PLA/TPS and BO-PLA/mTPS films, resulting in drastic toughness improvement (i.e., fivefold increases of Young's modulus and tensile strength, and threefold increase of elongation, as compared to those of the films without the BO process) with significantly decreased water absorption. However, the effect of reactive compatibility by mTPS on mechanical and water barrier properties is hindered by the BO process in which the VH-type patterns of TPS and mTPS are unclearly present, overlapped with (203) diffraction plane of PLA crystal, especially applying fast stretching.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The deep learning method is outperformed other methods on classification of short text with normal size of dataset. Some researches classify requirements into functional and nonfunctional requirements. There is no research on multi-classification of functional requirements with a small dataset particularly for an accounting field. This paper presents an approach to classify short text for a small dataset into multiple categories of functional requirements on the accounting domain. The proposed approach uses an ontology to construct bag-of-words and uses Naive Bayes to classify for small dataset.

Modern business processes are composed of disparate services; many of them tend to be delivered based on IoT. Interoperating with such services poses major challenges: 1) time for finality settlement of transactions is unpredictable and usually experiencing delay; 2) several implementations of permissioned Blockchain pose a major concern of trust regarding nodes that perform consensus; and 3) trust of process executions and IoT information is the major factor to the success of modern business processes, which require the composition of distributed IoT services. Traditional business processes are mostly managed by a single entity, which induces the problem of trust of process executions.

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) are designed to manage specific conditions using standardized assessments and measurement-based interventions. This study aims to compare the use of recommended tools to monitor for adverse effects associated with antipsychotics in older patients managed within an ICP and those managed under usual care conditions—i.e., treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: We reviewed and compared the health records of 100 older patients enrolled in an ICP for late-life schizophrenia with those of 100 older patients treated with antipsychotics under TAU conditions. Results: Monitoring rates were significantly higher in the ICP group than in the TAU group for all assessments: extrapyramidal symptoms (94% versus 5%), metabolic disturbances (91% versus 25%), fall risk (82% versus 35%), and cognitive impairment (72% versus 28%). Rates of antipsychotic polypharmacy were also six times higher in the TAU group. Conclusion: Older patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics within an ICP experience higher rates of monitoring and less psychotropic polypharmacy than older patients treated with antipsychotics under TAU conditions. These findings suggest that an ICP can improve the quality of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy in older patients and thus possibly its effectiveness. This needs to be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial.",medical,"Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The synthesized nano composite ALW/CoFe 2 O 4 was characterized by SEM, EDX, BET, XRD, FTIR, TG & DSC and VSM. The results from these analytical techniques confirmed the aggregation of CoFe 2 O 4 nano particles on the surface of ALW and VSM study showed its magnetic behavior. Subsequently, ALW/CoFe 2 O 4 was adopted in batch mode adsorption studies by varying pH, adsorbent dosage, concentration and temperature. The adsorption efficiency was investigated under optimum conditions such as pH(6.5), adsorbent dosage (50 mg), contact time (70 min). The feasibility of adsorption was analyzed by fitting the data with pseudo first order, pseudo second order, Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm. The results showed that pseudo second order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm equation favour the adsorption of RR 141 on ALW/CoFe 2 O 4 . According to the thermodynamic study, it was very effective at higher temperatures and the thermodynamic parameters ∆G o , ∆H o and ∆S o were also evaluated for this adsorption. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of ALW/CoFe 2 O 4 was tested by well diffusion method and compared with standard antibiotic.

In total, 91 sows were randomly assigned to one of three groups: I) treatment with a single or ii) double administration of PGF2α or iii) control group without any treatment. A synthetic analogue of PGF2α was administrated via the intra-vulvo submucosal route on day 114 of gestation, at 0800 hr (single administration) or at 0800 and 1400 hr (double administration). The animals were monitored during the farrowing process. The time interval from the first administration of PGF2α to the onset of parturition was compared between groups. The proportion of sows that farrowed within 32 hr of induced parturition was higher in the double administration group than in the single administration group (100 vs. 84.4%, P=0.046). The duration of farrowing was higher in single administration sows than in control (241.1 vs. 169.5 min, P=0.004) and tended to be higher than in double administration sows (241.1 vs. 190.3 min, P=0.088). Birth interval of piglets born after double administration of PGF2α was shorter than those born after a single administration (14.6 and 20.1 min, P=0.024). In sows, the induction of parturition using a double administration of PGF2α reduces variation in gestation length and significantly increases the proportion of sows with an early response to PGF2α.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which these two flavonoids exerted their effect on adipogenesis. The inhibitory effect of kaempferide and DTMC on adipocyte differentiation and their mechanisms involving mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and apoptosis during the early stage of adipogenesis were investigated. Methods: Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate and exposed to the flavonoids during various phases of differentiation. Intracellular lipid accumulation, cell density and expression of the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins α were assessed using AdipoRed, Oil red O and Western blot assays. Effects of both flavonoids on cell proliferation and apoptosis were also determined by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide-staining assays, respectively. Results: Kaempferide and DTMC showed significant, concentration-dependent anti-adipogenic activity and effect on cell density in the early phase of adipogenesis. The expression of the transcription factors seemed to be reduced when the treatment was prolonged or in the early phase of adipogenesis. These flavonoids interrupted MCE via inhibition of preadipocyte proliferation and induction of apoptosis. DTMC was nearly three times more potent than kaempferide in inducing apoptosis. Conclusion: Kaempferide and DTMC exerted their anti-adipogenic activity through inhibition of MCE, either by suppressing cell proliferation or by inducing apoptosis during the early phase of differentiation.",medical,Medicine (all)

In this study, a concept of a drift-flux model is adopted to develop a predictive method for the oil fraction in the horizontal oil-water flows due to its simplicity and practicality. A new drift-flux correlation for the horizontal oil-water flows is developed based on the least square method using collected experimental data. The distribution parameter is determined to be 1.05 for the data with the ratio of oil density to water density ranging from 0.787 to 1.00, whereas the oil fraction weighted mean drift velocity is set at 0 m/s due to the flow direction perpendicular to the gravity direction. The physical meaning for the order of unity of the distribution parameter is explained by introducing a simple model. The predictive capability of the new drift-flux correlation is examined using the collected database of oil-water flows in horizontal pipes under a variety of test conditions. It is demonstrated that the new drift-flux correlation can predict the existing oil fractions in the horizontal pipe channels with the mean absolute error, standard deviation, mean relative deviation, and mean absolute relative deviation being 0.0124, 0.0338,-3.25%, and 9.57%, respectively.",engineering,Mechanical Engineering

Several biomarkers have been reported. However, the data of validated biomarkers to use as a predictor for lupus flares show variation. This study aimed to identify the biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to predict lupus flares. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four SLE patients enrolled in this study and were prospectively followed up. The evaluation of disease activity achieved by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI-2K) and clinical SLEDAI (modified SLEDAI). Patients with active SLE were categorized into renal or non-renal flares. Serum cytokines were measured by multiplex bead-based flow cytometry. The correlation and logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Levels of IFN-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased in active SLE and correlated with clinical SLEDAI. Complement C3 showed a weakly negative relationship with IFN-α and IL-18. IL-18 showed the highest positive likelihood ratios for active SLE. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for active SLE at baseline while complement C3 and IL-18 increased OR for active SLE at 12 weeks. IL-18 and IL-6 yielded higher sensitivity and specificity than anti-dsDNA and C3 to predict active renal and active non-renal, respectively. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of SLE pathogenesis leads to different signaling mechanisms and mediates through several cytokines. The monitoring of cytokines increases the sensitivity and specificity to determine SLE disease activity. IL-18 predicts the risk of active renal SLE while IL-6 and IL-8 predict the risk of active non-renal. The sensitivity and specificity of these cytokines are higher than the anti-dsDNA or C3. We propose to use the serum level of IL-18, IL-6, and IL-8 to monitor SLE disease activity in clinical practice.","medical, Immunology","Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Although its pathophysiology is largely unknown, immune-inflammatory pathways may be involved. We examined serum interleukin (IL)-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), CXCL-8, and IL-10 in 67 female FM patients and 35 healthy women while adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbid disorders. We scored the Fibromyalgia Severity Score, Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), Hospital Anxiety (HADS-A), and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Clinical rating scales were significantly higher in FM patients than in controls. After adjusting for covariates, IL-6, IL-10, and CXCL-8 were lower in FM than in HC, whereas hs-CRP did not show any difference. Binary regression analyses showed that the diagnosis FM was associated with lowered IL-10, quality of sleep, aerobic activities, and increased HADS-A and comorbidities. Neural networks showed that WPI was best predicted by quality of sleep, PSS-10, HADS-A, and the cytokines, while SSS was best predicted by PSS-10, HADS-A, and IL-10. Lowered levels of cytokines are associated with FM independently from confounders. Lowered IL-6 and IL-10 signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of FM.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

We recruited 176 healthy volunteers and 145 AIS patients, categorized as AIS survivors and non-survivors, and measured interleukin (IL)-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, iron, total serum protein (TSP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cells (WBC), 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], lipid hydroperoxides (CL-LOOH), insulin, glucose and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In patients, these biomarkers were measured within 24 h after AIS onset. We also computed two composite scores reflecting inflammatory indices, namely INFLAM index1 (sum of z scores of hsCRP+IL-6 + ferritin+ESR + WBC) and INFLAM index2 (z INFLAM index1 – z 25(OH)D – z iron + z TSP). Three months after AIS, non-survivors (n = 54) showed higher baseline levels of IL-6, hsCRP, ferritin and glucose and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol and 25(OH)D than survivors (n = 91). Non-survivors showed higher baseline ESR and lowered TSP than controls, while survivors occupied an intermediate position. Death after AIS was best predicted by increased IL-6, glucose, ferritin and CL-LOOH and lowered 25(OH)D levels. The area under the receiver operating curves computed on the INFLAM index1 and 2 scores were 0.851 and 0.870, respectively. In conclusion, activation of peripheral immune-inflammatory, oxidative and biochemical pathways is critically associated with mortality after AIS. Our results may contribute to identify new biomarker sets, which may predict post-stroke death, as well as suggest that IL-6 trans-signaling coupled with redox imbalances may be possible new targets in the prevention of short-term outcome AIS death.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Maintenance scheduling is the most important part of asset management. The scheduling affects the reliability of equipment, the reliability of substation system and life cycle cost (LCC). Since the equipment in substation hardly fails to operate, the information about failure is not yet systematically recorded. This paper focuses on long term maintenance based on available data of historical planning and operation data. In particular, the Weibull distribution model is used to estimate reliability function of equipment. A maintenance planning may lead to different final condition of effective age of equipment. We propose the optimal maintenance planning in conjunction with the specified final condition of equipment and compare the LCC and reliability. By using dynamic programming (DP), the algorithm gives the minimum LCC while satisfying reliability and final condition. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DP approach. Comparing with the results using the genetic algorithm, the DP method provides the maintenance planning with less LCC.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics","Control and Optimization, Computer Science (miscellaneous), Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

The coefficient of friction and wear resistance, storage moduli, and microhardness of the nanosilica-filled poly(BA-a) composites systematically increase with an increase of nanosilica content, while those values of the nanocomposites are improved with decreasing particle sizes at the equivalent nanosilica content. The modulus can be predicted by the Kerner model with the maximum packing fraction, while the microhardness of the nanocomposites is in agreement with the Halpin–Tsai model. The nanocomposites fabricated with untreated nanosilica particles exhibit higher frictional and mechanical properties when compared with the surface-treated nanocomposites at the equivalent particle sizes. The interfacial interactions via covalent bond formation between the nanosilica and the poly(BA-a) are determinative factors for the nanocomposite properties.

Although these active constituents in P. candollei var. mirifica have been known for some time, actual knowledge regarding their biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Results: Miroestrol biosynthesis was reconsidered and the most plausible mechanism starting from the isoflavonoid daidzein was proposed. A de novo transcriptome analysis was conducted using combined P. candollei var. mirifica tissues of young leaves, mature leaves, tuberous cortices, and cortex-excised tubers. A total of 166,923 contigs was assembled for functional annotation using protein databases and as a library for identification of genes that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and miroestrol. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes from four separate libraries were identified as candidates involved in these biosynthetic pathways, and their respective expressions were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Notably, isoflavonoid and miroestrol profiling generated by LC-MS/MS was positively correlated with expression levels of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes across the four types of tissues. Moreover, we identified R2R3 MYB transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in P. candollei var. mirifica. To confirm the function of a key-isoflavone biosynthetic gene, P. candollei var. mirifica isoflavone synthase identified in our library was transiently co-expressed with an Arabidopsis MYB12 transcription factor (AtMYB12) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Remarkably, the combined expression of these proteins led to the production of the isoflavone genistein. Conclusions: Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the integration of transcriptome and metabolome as a powerful tool for identifying biosynthetic genes and transcription factors possibly involved in the isoflavonoid and miroestrol biosyntheses in P. candollei var. mirifica.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science

We evaluated brain perfusion change at 4 h after donepezil administration (4 h DNPZ) to predict cognitive responses after 6 months of medication. CERAD neuropsychological assessment battery was used to define cognitive response at 6 months. We compared 4 h DNPZ to baseline single photon emission tomography (SPECT) by statistical parametric mapping to identify perfusion changes in responders (N = 16) and non-responders (N = 7). In responders, there were significant relatively increase in perfusion in left parietal lobe (BA39, 7, 1), right superior frontal gyrus (BA6) and right middle occipital gyrus (BA39). In the non-responders, perfusion was relatively increase in the left parietal lobe (BA39) only. In an explorative analysis, we found a significant correlation between perfusion changes in right BA6 and CERAD score changes at 6 months. Different SPECT perfusion changes at 4 h after donepezil administration were demonstrated in the group of responders and non-responders with potential correlation with CERAD score change. Thus, 4 h DNPZ brain perfusion SPECT can be used to predict donepezil response at 6 months.","medical, neuroscience","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Neurology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, Psychiatry and Mental Health, Behavioral Neuroscience"
Designed antiviral ankyrin – A computational approach to combat HIV-1 via intracellular pathway by targeting the viral capsid of HIV-1,"Karim H.A.A., Rungrotmongkol T., Zain S.M., Rahman N.A., Tayapiwattana C., Lee V.",2019-03-01,"Ank1D4, Ankyrins, Capsid proteins, HIV-1, Human immunodeficiency virus type-1, Intracellular pathways, Molecular dynamics simulations, Protein-protein interactions, Ank1D4, Ankyrins, Capsid protein, HIV-1, Molecular dynamics (MD)","Scaffold known as designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) have been utilized by scientists extensively in protein binding, as they acquire remarkable binding properties. Trimodular ankyrin repeat protein (Ank1D4) is a potential macromolecular and antiviral intracellular inhibitor that aims the N-terminal domain capsid protein (NTDCA) of viral Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) at the virus assembly and budding machinery process. The protein-protein interaction between Ank1D4 and the viral capsid CA alpha helixes H1 and H7 have been studied in depth and point mutation strategy at the S451D4 key residue position was conducted to further improve the binding interaction and efficacy on the wildtype Ank1D4 structure with NTDCA. A computational approach via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been fully utilized in this study to simulate both the wildtype and potential novel complexes. Free energy contributions on the modified Ank1D4-NTDCA (H1, H7) complexes were acquired by using vigorous scoring functions of implicit solvent models; Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA), respectively. The wildtype structure of Ank1D4-NTDCA H7 has been proven to possess better binding stability than the H1 complex. From there, two mutants of H7 complex were generated and the computed ∆Gbind values based on both models have revealed that S45Y-H7 has the lowest binding free energy compared to both S45W-H7 and S45-H7 (Wildtype). The binding strength predictions given by both MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA in the following ranking order for the three systems in terms of the value of ∆Gbind: S45Y-H7 > S45 W-H7 > S45-H7. These findings provide a good basis in directing us a step further to discover better novel treatment modalities to treat millions of HIV-1 patients.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Surface-immobilized plant-derived osteopontin as an effective platform to promote osteoblast adhesion and differentiation,"Damsongsang P., Chaikiawkeaw D., Phoolcharoen W., Rattanapisit K., Kaewpungsup P., Pavasant P., Hoven V.P.",2019-01-01,"Bone tissue engineering, Cell differentiation, Immobilization efficiency, Osteogenic differentiation, Osteopontin, Poly(acrylic acid ), Polymer brushes, Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, 3T3 Cells, Amides, Animals, Bone and Bones, Cell Adhesion, Cell Differentiation, Culture Media, Gelatin, Glass, Mice, Microscopy, Atomic Force, Osteoblasts, Osteogenesis, Osteopontin, Plants, Polymerization, Silicon Dioxide, Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared, Surface Properties, Tissue Engineering, Osteoblast, Osteopontin, Poly(acrylic acid), Polymer brushes, Surface modification","In this report, recombinant human osteopontin synthesized in tobacco plants (p-rhOPN) is introduced as a potential bioactive molecule that can promote osteoblast adhesion and differentiation. A glass substrate (SiO 2 /Si-OH) grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (SiO 2 /Si-PAA) was prepared by surface-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and used as a carboxyl-rich platform for the chemical conjugation of p-rhOPN. The PAA grafting and subsequent p-rhOPN immobilization were confirmed by water contact angle, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses. Indirect ELISA quantification revealed that the p-rhOPN immobilization efficiency was above 95% and the surface coverage was a function of the p-rhOPN concentration. MC-3T3-E1 cells cultured on the SiO 2 /Si-PAA substrate immobilized with various concentrations (0.6–30 ng/mL) of p-rhOPN (SiO 2 /Si-p-rhOPN) exhibited superior cell spreading compared to those cultured on SiO 2 /Si-OH or gelatin-modified glass substrate (SiO 2 /Si-gelatin). Polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the SiO 2 /Si-p-rhOPN substrates with high level of immobilized p-rhOPN promoted MC-3T3-E1 cell differentiation, as demonstrated by the higher transcript expression levels of the osteogenic differentiation regulatory gene, Runt-related transcription factor 2, compared to cells cultured on SiO 2 /Si-OH or SiO 2 /Si-gelatin. Given that p-rhOPN can be more economically produced than the commercially available OPN derived from human or mammalian sources, then, together with its well-preserved biological function in spite of being chemically conjugated to the substrates, it is likely that p-rhOPN could be more broadly applied for the development of materials for bone tissue engineering with a promising medical and commercial value.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Background: The prevalence of burnout among nurses tends to be high worldwide. A better understanding of relationships between the study variables can help hospital managers apply effective programmes to reduce burnout. However, no studies have identified the structural relationships between these variables in one model, simultaneously. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to complete questionnaires from 444 nurses working in three Chinese general tertiary hospitals. The proposed model was examined by structural equation modelling. Results: The proposed model was partially supported by empirical data. The total effect of work stress on burnout was large. Both work stress and the perceived social support moderately and directly affected burnout. Work stress also indirectly affected burnout through perceived social support. Work stress directly influenced perceived social support and self-efficacy. Perceived social support directly affected self-efficacy. However, self-efficacy did not directly influence burnout. Conclusions: This study validated a model and identified a deep understanding of structural relationships between the selected variables among Chinese nurses. Implications for Nursing Management: Apart from reducing work stressors, hospital managers should utilize more social support strategies when designing intervention programmes to reduce burnout.",Nursing,Leadership and Management

Two catalyst mixtures, Cu(Am)+KOct and Zn(Am)+KOct, were obtained as homogeneous aqueous solutions. In comparison to commercial catalyst system, DMCHA+KOct (DMCHA = N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine), Cu(Am) and Zn(Am) could be miscible with KOct solution and water easier than DMCHA. This miscibility improvement led Cu(Am)+KOct and Zn(Am)+KOct to show faster catalytic reactivity in PIR-PUR foam reactions than DMCHA+KOct. All obtained PIR-PUR foams showed self-extinguishing properties and achieved HF1 materials. However, PIR-PUR foams prepared from Cu(Am)+KOct and Zn(Am)+KOct at NCO:OH ratio of 2:1 had suitable density for industrial applications and showed higher compressive strength than that prepared from DMCHA+KOct.

However, their humidity limitation is a serious drawback, which limits practical application of perovskite-based solar cells. In this study, we investigated the improvement of humidity stability and the influence of halide radicals (I- and Br-) on optical and physical properties of thiocyanic-modified CH3NH3PbX3 or CH3NH3PbX3-x(SCN)x films, prepared by two-step deposition method. The mixtures of CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Br solution with different molar ratios were prepared to control the I-:Br- ratios in perovskite films. The characterization of perovskite films was tested by XRD, UV-Vis spectrophotometer, UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy, FE-SEM, and moisture stability testing under constant relative humidity. The results showed that different molar ratios of I- and Br-could strongly affect the properties of perovskite films. The larger amount of Br- promoted the complete reaction of perovskite, larger energy band gap, and higher moisture stability. However, the prepared films were likely to exhibit phase separation due to the formation of iodide-rich and bromide-rich domains.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Current diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury has limited early detection; however, novel biomarkers of kidney stress and damage have been recently validated for risk prediction and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in the setting of sepsis. Recent evidence shows that microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming are 3 fundamental mechanisms that may play a role in the development of S-AKI.

The cutting force ratio is proposed and normalized to predict the in-process surface roughness and straightness regardless of the cutting conditions. The surface roughness and the straightness are calculated simultaneously by employing the two-layer feed-forward neural networks with sigmoid hidden and linear output neurons.

Aqueous Foam Stabilized by Hydrophobic SiO2 Nanoparticles using Mixed Anionic Surfactant Systems under High-Salinity Brine Condition,"Rattanaudom P., Shiau B.-J., Suriyapraphadilok U., Charoensaeng A.",2019-09-01,"Anionic mixed surfactants, Application of surfactants, Bubble size distributions, Foaming properties, Internal olefin sulfonates, Negative zeta potentials, Oil field applications, Surfactant interaction, Anionic surfactants, Application of surfactants, Foaming properties","A primary concern of surfactant-assisted foams in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the stability of the foams. In recent studies, foam stability has been successfully improved by the use of nanoparticles (NP). The adhesion energy of the NP is larger than the adsorbed surfactant molecules at the air–water interface, leading to a steric barrier to mitigate foam-film ruptures and liquid-foam coalescence. In this study, the partially hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles (SiO2-NP) were introduced to anionic mixed-surfactant systems to investigate their potential for improving the foamability and stability. An appropriate ratio of internal olefin sulfonate (C15-18 IOS) and sodium polyethylene glycol monohexadecyl ether sulfate (C32H66Na2O5S) was selected to avoid the formation of undesirable effects such as precipitation and phase separation under high-salt conditions. The effects of the NP-stabilized foams were investigated through a static foam column experiment. The surface tension, zeta potential, bubble size, and bubble size distribution were observed. The stability of the static foam in a column test was evaluated by co-injecting the NP-surfactant mixture with air gas. The results indicate that the foam stability depends on the dispersion of NP in the bulk phase and at the water–air interface. A correlation was observed in the NP-stabilized foam that stability increased with increasing negative zeta potential values (−54.2 mv). This result also corresponds to the smallest bubble size (214 μm in diameter) and uniform size distribution pattern. The findings from this study provide insights into the viability of creating NP-surfactant interactions in surfactant-stabilized foams for oil field applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Images were obtained using a PaX-i3D Green CBCT (Vatech, Hwaseong, Korea) device, with a large 21 × 19 and a medium 12 × 9 cm field of view (FOV), and high-dose (HD–ranging from 85 to 110 kV) and low-dose (LD–ranging from 75 to 95 kV) protocols, totaling four groups (21 × 19 cm HD, 21 × 19 cm LD, 12 × 9 cm HD, 12 × 9 cm LD). The radiation dose within each group was fixed by adapting the mA according to a predetermined dose-area product. For CL evaluation, three observers assessed images based on overall quality, sharpness, contrast, artefacts, and noise. For QUANT evaluation, mean gray value shift, % increase of standard deviation (SD), % of beam hardening and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. For TECH evaluation, segmentation accuracy, CNR, metal artefact SD, metal object area, and sharpness were measured. Representative parameters were chosen for CL, QUANT, and TECH evaluations to determine the optimal kV based on biplot graphs. kV values of the same protocol were compared by the bootstrapping approach. The ones that had statistical differences with the best kV were considered as worse quality. Results: Overall, kV values within the same group showed similar quality (p > 0.05), except for 110 kV in 21 × 19 cm HD and 85 kV in 12 × 9 cm HD of CL score; also 85, 90 kV in 21 × 19 cm HD and 75, 80 kV in 21 × 19 cm LD of QUANT score which were worse (p < 0.05). conclusion: At a constant dose, low and high kV protocols yield acceptable image quality for a narrow-detector CBCT unit.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

This systematic review and meta-Analysis was conducted with the aims to identify all available studies on the association between smoking and risk of microscopic colitis and to synthesize their results. Methods The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to May 2018 for cohort studies and case-control studies that compared the risk of microscopic colitis among current/former smokers vs individuals who have never smoked. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from the included studies and pooled together using a random-effects model, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q statistic and I 2. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Results Seven studies (2 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) with 262,312 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-Analysis. Relative to never-smokers, current smokers had significantly increased odds of microscopic colitis, with a pooled OR of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.15-4.15; I 2, 64%). Former smokers also had significantly higher odds of microscopic colitis compared with never-smokers, with a pooled OR of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.37-1.94; I 2, 0%).

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are permissive for viral isolation and vaccine manufacture. Nevertheless, the interplay between influenza B viruses and host microRNAs has not been investigated in this cell line. Therefore, the present study aims at high-throughput analysis of canine microRNA profile upon infection of influenza B viruses. Briefly, MDCK cells were infected with Victoria or Yamagata lineage at MOI of 0.01. After being harvested at 6, 12 and 24 h post infection, microRNAs were subjected to high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform (Illumina). The results demonstrated that five microRNAs including cfa-miR-197, cfa-miR-215, cfa-miR361, cfa-miR-1841, and cfa-miR-1842 were overexpressed in both Victoria and Yamagata lineage infections. Interestingly, computational prediction showed that karyopherin alpha 6 (KPNA6) was targeted by cfa-miR-197 and cfa-miR-215. Moreover, the binding sites of both microRNAs were assessed by 30-UTR reporter assay. The results showed that only cfa-miR-197 could bind to the target sites of KPNA6, leading to suppressing luciferase activity. Additionally, silencing of KPNA6 was confirmed by overexpression of cfa-miR-197. This study provides canine microRNA responses to seasonal influenza B viruses, suggesting that virus-mediated microRNAs might play crucial roles in host gene regulation.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Approximately 50% of older adults sought health care but urban dwellers were more likely than rural dwellers to seek health care (54.8% vs. 49.7%). Predisposing factors and health needs narrow the rural-urban gap while enabling factors widened the gap in health visits. The receipt of financial support from children presented a significant moderating effect in the rural-urban divide of health care use. Despite Thailand's universal access to health care, geographic inequity in health care utilization withstands. Findings suggest investments in education, income security, social participation, and healthy lifestyle promotion can improve health care utilization. Furthermore, results suggest a need for continued investigation of the role of family support in bridging the rural-urban divide in the health of older Thais.","genergyal, sociology, biochemistryistry, Nursing, medical","Health (social science), Aging, Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

Despite a number of studies in the past on the stability of this problem, its stability solution under the framework of lower bound limit analysis is very rare in the literature. The present study focuses on the stability analysis of braced circular excavations in non-homogeneous clays using the lower bound finite element limit analysis under axisymmetric conditions. The stability number of the problem is comprehensively investigated, and is affected by depth-radius aspect ratios of excavation, depth ratios of rigid base, and strength gradient factors. The influence of these dimensionless parameters on the predicted failure mechanisms are discussed and compared. The presented new lower bound solutions of braced circular excavations in non-homogeneous clays are useful for an accurate, convenient and reliable stability assessment of the problem in practice.","systems science, fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, computer science","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Computer Science Applications"

Nowadays, installing the rooftop solar PV can help reduce overall electricity bill of the owner throughout the lifetime of the system. However, in some countries including Thailand, selling large amount of power output from the rooftop solar PV to the grid may not be allowed, due to the strict grid code. At present, price of battery is continuously decreasing. Consequently, installation of the rooftop solar PV with battery might solve this problem. Thus, this paper proposes a method to determine the optimal installed capacity of rooftop solar PV generation and the minimum required size of the battery which improve the cost-benefit from installing solar power generation without the battery.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics","Control and Optimization, Computer Science (miscellaneous), Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Methods: A prospective, multi-centre, observational study was conducted among eight hospitals in their ophthalmology outpatient departments. Participants consisted of patients who had previously not received any IVB or IVR treatment between 2013 and 2014. The primary outcome measurement was the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the end of the follow-up period compared to baseline. Results: There were 1629 treatment-naïve patients for the pro re nata (PRN) treatment pattern and 226 treatment-naive patients for the three-injections (3Inj) treatment pattern. BCVA improvements were found in 35% of the PRN group and 47% of the 3Inj group; however, it was not clinically meaningful between the IVB and IVR groups (P-value = 0.568 for PRN, P-value = 0.103 for 3Inj). A multivariable logistic regression (using the propensity score) showed that positive factors associated with vision improvement for the PRN pattern were the number of drug injections, having retinal vein occlusion, and under 60 years of age, while good BCVA at baseline was a negative predictive factor. For the 3Inj pattern, under 60 years of age and baseline BCVA were statistically significant predictors. Nonetheless, diabetes mellitus (DM) without other comorbidities was a statistically significant predictor of low response to vision improvement compared to DM with other comorbidities. Conclusions: This study was the first observational, prospective study to evaluate the real-life effectiveness of IVB and IVR in Thailand. The majority of participants who used IVB or IVR showed improvements in BCVA after treatment. Further evaluation such as long-term follow-ups and subsequent comparison of effectiveness between IVB and IVR should be investigated due to the limited sample of IVR patients.

Degradations of a compound using the same kind of catalyst that was synthesized differently are commonly found in literature. However, the reported degradation intermediates are normally inconsistent. This issue is especially important for the degradation of toxic compounds because intermediates may be more toxic than their parent compounds and understanding the reason is necessary if appropriate catalysts are to be designed. This work systematically compares the photocatalytic degradation of diuron, a toxic recalcitrant herbicide, on two forms of zinc oxide (ZnO), i.e., conventional particles with zinc- and oxygen-terminated polar surfaces as the dominating planes, and nanorods with mixed-terminated nonpolar surfaces. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that both the rate of reaction and the degradation pathway depend on the adsorption configuration of diuron onto the surface. Diuron molecules adsorb in different alignments on the two surfaces, contributing to the formation of different degradation intermediates. Both the aliphatic and aromatic sides of diuron adsorb on the polar surfaces simultaneously, leading to an attack by hydroxyl radicals from both ends. On the other hand, on the mixed-terminated surface, only the aliphatic part adsorbs and is degraded. The exposed surface is therefore the key factor controlling the degradation pathway. For diuron degradation on ZnO, a catalyst confined to mixed-terminated surfaces, i.e., ZnO nanorods, is more desirable, as it avoids the formation of intermediates with potent phytotoxicity and cytogenotoxicity.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

A single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of the inclusion complex β-cyclodextrin–chlorogenic acid–water (2/2/17), 2C42H70O35·2C16H18O9·17H2O, reveals that CGA threads through β-CD and assembles via O—H…O hydrogen bonds and parallel-displaced π–π interactions in the twofold symmetry-related dimer yielding a [4]pseudorotaxane, which is crystallographically observed for the first time in CD inclusion complexes. The encapsulation of the aromatic ring and C=C—C(=O)O chain in the β-CD dimeric cavity indicates that the CFA moiety plays a determinant role in complexation. This is in agreement with the DFT-derived relative thermodynamic stabilities of the trimodal β-CD–CGA inclusion complexes, that is, β-CD complexed with different CGA components: C=C—C(=O)O chain > cyclohexane ring > aromatic ring. The complexation stability is further enhanced in the dimeric β-CD–CGA complex, with the CFA moiety totally enclosed in the β-CD dimeric cavity.","physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

To gain insight into the distribution of McRImecD types in M. caseolyticus from cattle, 33 mecD-containing strains from Switzerland were characterized using molecular techniques, including multilocus sequence typing, antibiotic resistance gene identification, and PCR-based McRImecD typing. In addition, the same genetic features were analyzed in 27 mecD-containing M. caseolyticus strains isolated from bovine bulk milk in England/Wales using publicly available whole-genome sequences. The 60 strains belonged to 24 different sequence types (STs), with strains belonging to ST5, ST6, ST21, and ST26 observed in both Switzerland and England/Wales. McRImecD-1 was found in different STs from Switzerland (n=19) and England/Wales (n=4). McRImecD-2 was only found in 7 strains from Switzerland, all of which belonged to ST6. A novel island, McRImecD-3, which contains a complete mecD operon (mecD-mecR1m-mecIm [where the subscript m indicates Macrococcus]) combined with the left part of McRImecD-2 and the right part of McRImecD-1, was found in heterogeneous STs from both collections (Switzerland, n=7; England/Wales, n=21).

Laccases have enormous potential for the oxidative bioremediation of toxic xenobiotic compounds using only molecular oxygen as the sole cofactor for their reaction, and their application is regarded as environmentally friendly. Due to the low substrate specificity of laccases, they can oxidize a variety of substrates. Moreover, by using appropriate mediators, laccases can degrade a wide range of substrates, including those with structural complexity. Thus, laccases are an attractive alternative for wastewater treatment. Marine environments are rich in microorganisms that are exposed to extreme conditions, such as salinity, temperature, and pressure. Laccases from these microorganisms potentially have suitable properties that might be adaptive to bioremediation processes.

However, infection of wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with E. nuttalli has not been found. In this study, the prevalence of Entamoeba infections in wild long-tailed macaques was examined in seven locations in six provinces of Thailand. The positive rate for E. nuttalli in 214 fecal samples was 43.9% using PCR, but no infection with E. histolytica or Entamoeba dispar was found, demonstrating that long-tailed macaque is one of the natural hosts for E. nuttalli. Twenty-four E. nuttalli isolates were successfully cultured and four of them were axenized. The sequences of the 18S ribosomal RNA genes of E. nuttalli from long-tailed macaques differed from those of E. nuttalli isolates from other species of wild macaques. Eleven types of sequences in serine-rich protein genes were identified in the 24 isolates and these were specific for each location in Thailand. By analysis of six tRNA-linked short tandem repeat loci, these isolates were divided into 14 types, and each type was also location-specific. Phylogenetic analysis revealed correlation between genotypes of the parasite and the geographic distribution of the host macaques. Genetic distance and geographic distance correlated significantly in a Mantel test, with r values of 0.888 based on the tRNA-linked short tandem repeat loci and 0.815 based on the serine-rich protein genes. These results suggest that genetic divergence and co-evolution of the parasite occurred during dispersion and colonization of the host macaque, and that genotypic analysis of the parasite may enable identification of the geographic localization of the host.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Influence of phosphoric acid modification on catalytic properties of Al2O3 catalysts for dehydration of ethanol to diethyl ether,"Limlamthong M., Chitpong N., Jongsomjit B.",2019-04-01,"Catalyst characterization, Catalytic performance, Dehydration of ethanol, Diethyl ethers, Ethanol dehydration, Fixed bed micro-reactor, Heterogeneous catalyst, Inductively coupled plasma (ICP), Diethyl Ether, Ethanol Dehydration, Heterogeneous Catalyst, Phosphoric Acid","In this present work, diethyl ether, which is currently served as promising alternative fuel for diesel engines, was produced via catalytic dehydration of ethanol over H3PO4-modified - Al2O3 catalysts. The impact of H3PO4 addition on catalytic performance and characteristics of catalysts was investigated. While catalytic dehydration of ethanol was performed in a fixed-bed microreactor at the temperature ranging from 200 ºC to 400 ºC under atmospheric pressure, catalyst characterization was conducted by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results showed that although the H3PO4 addition tended to decrease surface area of catalyst resulting in the reduction of ethanol conversion, the Al2O3 containing 5 wt% of phosphorus (5P/Al2O3) was the most suitable catalyst for the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to diethyl ether since it exhibited the highest catalytic ability regarding diethyl ether yield and the quantity of coke formation as well as it had similar long-term stability to conventional Al2O3 catalyst. The NH3-TPD profiles of catalysts revealed that catalysts containing more weak acidity sites were preferred for dehydration of ethanol into diethyl ether and the adequate promotion of H3PO4 would lower the amount of medium surface acidity with increasing catalyst weak surface acidity. Nevertheless, when the excessive amount of H3PO4 was introduced, it caused the destruction of catalysts structure, which resulted in the catalyst incapability due to the decrease in active surface area and pore enlargement.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology"

The activity of the polymorphic antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is altered in diseases where NOS is involved. PON1 activity may be estimated using different sub-strates some of which are influenced by PON1 polymorphisms. Objectives: 1) to review the association between PON1 activities and psychiatric diseases using a standardized PON1 substrate terminology in order to offer a state-of-the-art review; and 2) to review the efficacy of different strategies (nutrition, drugs, lifestyle) to enhance PON1 activities. Methods: The PubMed database was searched using the terms paraoxonase 1 and psychiatric diseases. Moreover, the database was also searched for clinical trials investigating strategies to enhance PON1 activity. Results: The studies support decreased PON1 activity as determined using phenylacetate (i.e., arylesterase or AREase) as a substrate, in depression, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and schizophrenia, especially in antipsychotic-free patients. PON1 activity as determined with paraoxon (i.e., POase activity) yields more controversial results, which can be explained by the lack of adjustment for the Q192R polymorphism. The few clinical trials investigating the influence of nutritional, lifestyle and drugs on PON1 activities in the general population suggest that some polyphenols, oleic acid, Mediterranean diet, no smoking, being physically active and statins may be effective strategies that increase PON1 activity. Conclusion: Lowered PON1 activities appear to be a key component in the ongoing NOS processes that accompany affective disorders, GAD and schizophrenia. Treatments increasing attenuated PON1 activity could possibly be new drug targets for treating these disorders.","pharmacology, neuroscience, medical","Pharmacology, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health, Pharmacology (medical)"

Included publications were those using 3D imaging to quantify soft- and hard-tissue changes after cleft-related treatments in patients with any type of cleft, during growth. Data extraction and qualitative analysis were performed by two reviewers. The methodological quality of each study was reviewed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results: From 4 databases, 2315 articles were found. Full texts of 422 articles were analyzed and finally 12 articles were included for qualitative analysis. CT was performed in the majority of studies for hard-tissue quantification. Stereophotogrammetry, Laser scanner and 3D digitizer were identified as viable methods to quantify both soft- and hard-tissue changes, depending on whether the scan was made of the facial surface or the cast surface. Most studies conducted imaging analysis without registration between multitemporal images, which is the reason why they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. conclusions: Although several imaging modalities have the potential to quantify cleft-related treatment follow-up, there is an urgent need to assess the imaging methods and related analyses allowing to standardise a 3D imaging protocol to quantify hard- and soft-tissue treatment follow-up.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

The samples were injection molded and sintered at 645-800 °C in N2 atmosphere. Thermal analysis showed endothermic reactions around 632-643 °C, related to liquid phase formation. Exothermic reactions about 458-461 °C and weight gains around 471-479 °C were plausibly associated with AlN formation, which facilitated liquid phase sintering. The composite microstructure exhibited close interfaces between SiCp-Al and Al-Al for 5-20 vol.% SiCp addition. Higher SiCp addition however led to SiCp clustering, creating large pores and unreacted SiCp-SiCp interface, which prohibited both liquid flow and rearrangement of the solid grains and pore filling during liquid phase sintering. Optimum SiCp addition was achieved at 15 vol.%, giving the maximum bulk density at 2.68 g.cm-3 or at 94.2 % theoretical density. The maximum macro Vickers hardness values at 138.9 and 166.6 Hv were obtained in the as-sintered and age-hardened conditions respectively.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Methods: To better understand farmers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with brucellosis we interviewed 51 farmers and tested 314 goats for Brucella melitensis. Results: All serological samples tested negative for Brucella infection. Based on previous research and estimates provided from the Thai national brucellosis surveillance system, zero seropositivity was less than expected. Findings from interviews with farmers demonstrate that most respondents were relatively new to goat farming with just over half (53%) reporting owning goats for five or fewer years. The majority of respondents demonstrated important gaps in knowledge on disease transmission in animals and knowledge of human brucellosis was particularly limited with just over half (54%) reporting that humans could become infected. Participants had a very low perceived risk of infection with the majority (91.7%) reporting that they or a member of their household were not at risk of the disease. Conclusion: Overall findings from this study support that brucellosis poses an occupational risk to goat farmers with specific areas of concern including weak awareness of disease transmission to humans and lack of knowledge on specific safe farm practices such as quarantine practices. Findings from this study contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of brucellosis in Thailand by identifying specific occupational risk factors and describing areas where farmer education and training should be strengthened.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

There are no studies which examined the associations between both systems in MDD. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between β-Endorphin (β-EP), Endomorphin-2, and their mu-opioid receptor (MOR) as well as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in MDD patients. Method: The study included 60 depressed drug-free male patients and 30 matched controls. Serum β-EP, Endomorphin-2, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were measured using ELISA techniques. Results: The results revealed a significant increase in serum β-EP, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 in MDD patients versus healthy controls. MOR levels were strongly associated with IL-10 levels. There were no significant correlations between endogenous opioids and IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusion: The results show that MOR levels may function as a possible component of the CIRS whilst there is no evidence that β-EP and EM-2 may modify the IRS. The significant correlation between MOR levels and IL-10 may be explained through central activation of the HPA-axis and increased B-cell numbers expressing MOR as a response to cytokine over-secretion in MDD.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

The LDH-derived MgAl mixed oxide was saturated with an aqueous solution of Ca citrate complexes, followed by calcination at 700 °C, to obtain the Ca-MgAl mixed metal oxide (MMO) catalysts. The effects of the citric acid addition and Ca loading levels on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of the resulting Ca-MgAl MMO were investigated. The Ca-MgAl MMO series were characterized by a high Ca dispersion, high total basicity (236–482 μmol g −1 ), an enhanced amount of strong basic sites and a new mesoporosity. The highest diglycerols selectivity of 78.3 mol% was achieved at a glycerol conversion of 40.4 mol% when the reaction was performed over the Ca-MgAl MMO catalyst synthesized with a 7.5 wt% Ca loading level, at a 3 wt% catalyst loading, 220 °C for 24 h. The formation of ternary mixed oxides improved the structural stability of the pristine MgAl mixed oxide. The catalytic performance of Ca-MgAl MMO was compared with that of commercial MgAl mixed oxides and homogeneous base (Na 2 CO 3 ). The presence of strong basicity in the MMO catalysts was a key part in the selective synthesis of diglycerols.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, earth sciences","Geology, Geochemistry and Petrology"

In addition to a set of well-known determinants, the patient’s health insurance status could also influence the prescription practice. Purpose: Although many guidelines suggest using anti-osteoporosis medications in patients who suffered from fragility hip fractures, low rate of prescription was encountered all over the world. In this study, we aimed to explore potential determinants affecting the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medications by orthopedic surgeons. Materials and methods: Online questionnaire survey was conducted among randomly selected orthopedic surgeons in Thailand. We inquired the factors associated with anti-osteoporosis medication prescription (likely to prescribe, unlikely to prescribe, or not influential). The reasons for not prescribing were also inquired. Results: Two hundred and ninety-four participants responded to the questionnaires. Age, gender, previous fragility fracture, and BMD results seemed to influence the medication prescription. Interestingly, the type of reimbursement was responded as an important factor. The leading reason for not prescribing the medication was due to the high cost of the treatment. Conclusions: Knowing the factors affecting the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medication is beneficial for strategic planning in order to increase the rate of prescription. The gap of treatment may be reduced, and the morbidity and mortality of the patients can be decreased.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

We aimed to evaluate the association between inherited thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, and antithrombin deficiency) and risk of arterial ischemic stroke in adults. Methods and Results: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Databases from inception to December 31, 2018. We included case-control or cohort studies of adults reporting the prevalence of inherited thrombophilias in those with arterial ischemic stroke and subjects without arterial ischemic stroke. Two reviewers (T.C., E.D.) independently searched the literature and extracted data. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects model. We identified 68 eligible studies, which collectively enrolled 11 916 stroke patients and 96 057 controls.

Among SYSADOAs, evidence is greatest for the patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) formulation (Mylan). Glucosamine is widely available as glucosamine sulfate (GS) and glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) preparations that vary substantially in molecular form, pharmaceutical formulation and dose regimen. Only pCGS is given as a highly bioavailable once-daily dose (1500 mg), which consistently delivers the plasma levels of around 10 μmol/L required to inhibit interleukin-1-induced expression of genes involved in the pathophysiology of joint inflammation and tissue destruction. Careful consideration of the evidence base reveals that only pCGS reliably provides a moderate effect size on pain that is higher than paracetamol and equivalent to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while non-crystalline GS and GH fail to reach statistical significance for pain reduction. Chronic administration of pCGS has disease-modifying effects, with a reduction in need for total joint replacement lasting for 5 years after treatment cessation. Pharmacoeconomic studies of pCGS demonstrate long-term reduction in additional pain analgesia and NSAIDs, with a 50% reduction in costs of other OA medication and healthcare consultations. Consequently, pCGS is the logical choice, with demonstrated medium-term control of pain and lasting impact on disease progression. Physician and patient education on the differentiation of pCGS from other glucosamine formulations will help to improve treatment selection, increase treatment adherence, and optimize clinical benefit in OA.",medical,Rheumatology

Carotenoid-based pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are examples of high-value nutrients that can be accumulated abundantly in microalgae. Here, the effects of potassium chloride-induced stress on the productions of lipids and carotenoids in the green microalga of the Chlorococcaceae family were investigated. Under normal BG11 medium, this green microalga strain TISTR 9500 accumulated high levels of PUFA and primary carotenoid lutein. Stress tests revealed that KCl enhanced and modulated lipid and carotenoid accumulation levels. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that secondary carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin were robustly produced under KCl stress with the similar content of lutein. Further, this stress led to a significant increase in the total FA amount with the higher proportion of unsaturated FA than saturated FA. Thus, this green microalga could be an attractive and alternative natural biosource for canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, as well as for functional lipids.","biotechnology, Immunology",Microbiology

Sergentomyia gemmea has been suspected several times to transmit Leishmania martiniquensis. Some captures carried out in Thailand and Lao People's Democratic Republic have emphasized the scarcity of Se. gemmea, comprising only 1% of the collected females. The sequencing of cytochrome B mtDNA of our specimens showed that our specimens are not grouped with other Se. gemmea previously deposited in GenBank. The latter are grouped with some Se. khawi and Se. hivernus that we processed in the present study. We suspect misidentifications and propose focusing on the most useful characters for identification of Se. gemmea based on the examination of type-specimens. The examination of the ascoids exhibiting anterior spurs is the most important one. However, we also describe Se. raynali n. sp. exhibiting comparable spurs but differing from Se. gemmea by its original cibarium. Finally, the vectorial role of Se. gemmea appears very questionable in the absence of new evidence.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, diseases, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Parasitology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Veterinary (all), Insect Science"
Towards Asynchronous Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces: A joint training scheme using deep learning,"Cheng P., Autthasan P., Pijarana B., Chuangsuwanich E., Wilaiprasitporn T.",2019-02-22,"asynchronous BCI, Common spatial patterns, Conventional approach, Convolutional neural network, Fully connected neural network, Motor imagery, Real-world scenario, Transitional period, asynchronous BCI, deep learning-based BCI, EEG-based BCI, joint training, motor-imagery BCI","In this paper, the deep learning (DL) approach is applied to a joint training scheme for asynchronous motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The proposed DL approach is a cascade of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and fully-connected neural networks (CNN-FC). The focus is mainly on three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (background EEG), (pure imagery) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between background EEG and pure imagery (transitional imagery). The study of transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high and low power EEG imagery, respectively. Moreover, the results from the CNN-FC are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure and transitional imagery signals from background EEG. Using sparse of just a few electrode channels (Cz, C3 and C4), mean accuracy reaches 71.52% and 70.27% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively. On the other hand, mean accuracy without the joint training scheme achieve only 62.68% and 52.41% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

With limited resources and capability for HbA1c testing in most primary-care providers, this study explored patterns of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) tests for proper timing of HbA1c test would increase value of the money spent. Methods: A retrospective review of laboratory findings of 4906 type-2 diabetic outpatients in two university hospitals in Thailand was conducted. Percentages of discordant results between the indexed FPG and HbA1c tests were compared between the patient groups with different FPG patterns before HbA1c testing and the control group of randomly selected cases. Results: Having HbA1c tested after two and three consecutively normal FPG tests (OO and OOO patterns) were found to have significantly less discordance than the control group (−9.6% and −15.7%). HbA1c testing after two abnormal and one normal consecutive FPG tests (XXO pattern) gained the discordant results by 24.8%. Conclusions: Some FPG patterns were more predictive of HbA1c findings than focusing on one-time FPG results. Reviewing and recognizing certain patterns of FPGs prior to taking HbA1c tests can lead to better HbA1c testing decision than randomly prescribing the tests.",medical,"Internal Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism"
Chemical state and coordination structure of La cations doped in KTaO3 photocatalysts,"Sudrajat H., Thushari I., Babel S.",2019-04-01,"Conduction band edge, Coordination structures, EXAFS, Extended X-ray absorption fine structures, Photocatalytic activities, Potassium tantalate, X ray absorption near edge structure, XANES, EXAFS, Lanthanum, Photocatalyst, Potassium tantalate, XANES","We here dope KTaO3 with La through a solid-state route, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity for the mineralization of p-nitrophenol under UV light. We suggest simultaneous substitution of K and Ta by La, leading to lattice expansion and surface nanosteps. With increasing the La concentration, the conduction band edge is raised, while the valence band remains unchanged. As a result, the band gap increases. The raised conduction band edge is proposed to be the key behind the enhanced photocatalytic activity since it results in an increased reduction power of photoproduced electrons. The raised conduction band edge is also an indication of the substitution of Ta, which mainly makes up the conduction band, by La. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure confirm the oxidation state of La residing on the surface and in the bulk to be +3, as anticipated. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure then confirms that increasing the La concentration slightly increases the length and the coordination number of La-–O bond in the here prepared La-doped KTaO3. The increased bond length is due to the expanded lattice, while the increased coordination number is due to the increased numbers, and hence the contributions, of La-–O pairs.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, physics","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Here, an alternative molecular neurobiological model is proposed. It is shown that the presence of the APOE ε4 allele, altered miRNA expression and epigenetic dysregulation in the promoter region and exon 1 of TREM2, as well as ANK1 hypermethylation and altered levels of histone post-translational methylation leading to increased transcription of TNFA, could variously explain increased levels of peripheral and central inflammation found in AD. In particular, as a result of increased activity of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2), the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) isoform, and changes in ANK1 expression, with subsequent changes in miR-486 leading to altered levels of protein kinase B (Akt), mechanistic (previously mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), all of which play major roles in microglial activation, proliferation and survival, there is activation of microglia, leading to the subsequent (further) production of cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, and other mediators of inflammation and neurotoxicity. These changes are associated with the development of amyloid and tau pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction (including impaired activity of the electron transport chain, depleted basal mitochondrial potential and oxidative damage to key tricarboxylic acid enzymes), synaptic dysfunction, altered glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, mTOR activation, impairment of autophagy, compromised ubiquitin-proteasome system, iron dyshomeostasis, changes in APP translation, amyloid plaque formation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

MES drastically improved the kinetics of methane hydrate formation and methane consumption. The increase in the MES concentration dramatically decreased the induction time as well. In addition, the morphology of methane hydrate formation observed with the different MES concentrations was presented. Hydrate nucleation was observed at the gas/liquid interface followed by the hydrate growth in the upward direction into the gas phase and then downward direction into the liquid phase, respectively.

Thermodynamic analysis of the novel chemical looping process for two-grade hydrogen production with CO2 capture,"Saithong N., Authayanun S., Patcharavorachot Y., Arpornwichanop A.",2019-01-15,"Aspen Plus Simulators, Chemical-looping process, Chemical-looping reforming, Process performance, Sorption enhanced reforming, Thermo dynamic analysis, Thermodynamic approaches, Water splitting, Chemical looping process, Hydrogen, Sorption enhanced reforming, Water splitting","The integrated sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming and water splitting (SECLR-WS) process was proposed for hydrogen (H2) production from biogas using iron oxide as an oxygen carrier and calcium oxide (CaO) as a carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorbent. In the SECLR-WS process, the biogas feed is partially oxidized using iron oxide and CO2 is captured by CaO in the fuel reactor (FR) to produce H2-rich syngas. The iron oxide is re-oxidized in the steam reactor (SR) to generate a high-purity H2 stream and CaO is regenerated in the calcinator. The simulation of the SECLR-WS process was based on a thermodynamic approach and was performed using an Aspen Plus simulator. The effects of key parameters such as the steam feed to the FR to methane (SFR/CH4) and iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) to CH4 (Fe3O4/CH4) molar ratios on the process performance in terms of H2 yield and purity, and CH4 conversion were investigated. The results showed that the H2 yield, H2 purity in the FR, and CH4 conversion could be improved by increasing the SFR/CH4 and CaO/CH4 molar ratios. A total H2 yield of 3.8 and a H2 purity in the FR of 97.01 mol% can be obtained at the FR and SR temperatures of 610 and 500 °C, and SFR/CH4, CaO/CH4, Fe3O4/CH4, and SSR/CH4 molar ratios of 2.2, 1.66, 1, and 2.87, respectively. The molar concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the high-purity H2 stream could be reduced by increasing the pressure in the SR and the amount of CO2 in the biogas feed stream negatively affected the performance of the system. In addition, increasing the Fe3O4/CH4 molar ratio can improve the heat demand in the FR.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The traditional mechanisms for QoS measurements rely on the centralized trusted third parties who use specialized agents to collect data and measure the performances of services. However, these mechanisms are ineffective to deal with highly dynamic and distributed nature of IoT-based services. Moreover, the dynamism of QoS needs to collect, update, and access reliable quality relevant data frequently, while lacking trust becomes a major hurdle for data utilization. It is our argument that the QoS measurement of IoT-based services would be decentralized and the trusts be built from collectively trusted subnetworks. In this paper, we propose to integrate the blockchain technologies (BCT) with a multi-agent approach to warrantee the trustiness of real-time data for the measurement of QoS in the IoT environment. The proposed approach is verified by some demonstrative examples in addressing QoS specification patterns commonly found in service-based applications (SBAs), where qualitative analyses are conducted for the evaluation of the patterns.","Mathematics, sociology, computer science","Modeling and Simulation, Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Human-Computer Interaction"

This study proposes a method for predicting a user's special feelings toward photos based on the user's behaviors of taking and editing photos. From our assumption, users spend considerable time taking and editing their photos when they have a special interest in an object that they are shooting.

Nonetheless, this disease is still a common sight in sheep and goats in Malaysia, probably due to the unpopular usage of pasteurellosis vaccine or inappropriate vaccination practices. The aim of this study was designed to classify the severity of pneumonia via the establishment of auscultation scoring method and to quantify the acute phase proteins and heat shock proteins responses from vaccinated and non-vaccinated goats. Goat farms, consist of vaccinated and non-vaccinated farms, were selected in this study: where 15 clinically normal healthy goats and 9 pneumonic goats were selected from vaccinated farms whereas 15 clinically normal healthy goats and 31 pneumonic goats from non-vaccinated farms were selected for this study. Crackle lung sounds were not detected in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated normal goats. However, vaccinated pneumonic goats showed mild crackle lung sound while non-vaccinated pneumonic goats exhibited moderate crackle lung sound. There were significant increases (p < 0.05) in acute phase proteins and heat shock proteins concentrations for the non-vaccinated pneumonic goats group. In this study, conclusion can be made that the vaccinated goats exhibited very mild clinical responses of pneumonia and non-significant biomarker responses compared to the non-vaccinated goats. Thus, vaccination is an effective preventive measure to control pneumonic pasteurellosis and acute phase proteins and heat shock proteins can be considered as future biomarkers in screening and rapid diagnostic method for this particular disease.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology; host defence - animal studies, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors of new-onset DM among PLHIV in Asian settings. Methods: PLHIV from a regional observational cohort without DM prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation were included in the analysis. DM was defined as having a fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, glycated haemoglobin ≥6.5%, a two-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL, or a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL. A Cox regression model, stratified by site, was used to identify risk factors associated with DM. Results and discussion: Of the 1927 participants included, 127 were diagnosed with DM after ART initiation. Median follow-up time from ART initiation to DM diagnosis was 5.9 years (interquartile range (IQR): 2.8 to 8.9 years). The crude incidence rate of DM was 1.08 per 100 person-years (100 PYS), 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9 to 1.3).

However, it has not been elucidated how LLLT promotes hair growth in vivo. Objectives: To investigate the change in protein expression from dermal papilla (DP) tissues in male AGA patients after LLLT treatment using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Methods: This is an open-label, prospective, single-arm study obtained punch scalp biopsy specimens from patients with AGA before and after LLLT treatment. Each subject was self-treated with helmet type of LLLT (655 nm, 5 mW) device at home for 25 minutes per treatment every other day for 24 weeks. LC-MS/MS analysis based on the dimethyl labeling strategy for protein quantification was used to identify proteins expressed in DP tissues from AGA patients. Results: Proteomic analysis revealed 11 statistically significant up-regulated and 2 down-regulated proteins in LLLT treated DP compared with baseline (P < 0.05). A bioinformatic analysis signifies that these proteins are involved in several biological processes such as regulation of cellular transcription, protein biosynthesis, cell energy, lipid homeostasis, extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM structural constituent, cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion as well as angiogenesis. ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member, a transporter involved in cellular lipid homeostasis, was the most up-regulated protein. Additionally, LLLT increased the main ECM proteins in DP which results in a bigger volume of DP and a clinical improvement of hair diameter in AGA patients. Conclusion: We identified the proteome set of DP proteins of male patients with AGA treated with LLLT which implicates the role of LLLT in promoting hair growth and reversing of miniaturization process of AGA by enhancing DP cell function. Our results strongly support the benefit of LLLT in the treatment of AGA. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",medical,"Surgery, Dermatology"

Our semantic computing method realizes the semantic interpretation of natural phenomena and analyzes the changes of various environmental situations. It is important to realize global environmental computing methodology for analyzing difference and diversity of nature and livings in a context dependent way with a large amount of information resources in global environments. Semantic computations contribute to make ""appropriate and urgent solutions"" to the changes of environmental situations. It is also significant to memorize those situations and compute environment changes in various aspects and contexts, in order to discover what are happening in the nature of our planet. We have various (almost infinite) aspects and contexts in environmental changes, and it is essential to realize a new analyzer for computing the meanings of those situations and making solutions for discovering actual aspects and contexts. We propose a new method for semantic computing in our Multi-dimensional World map. We utilize a multi-dimensional computing model, the Mathematical Model of Meaning (MMM) [1-3], and a multi-dimensional space with an adaptive axis adjustment mechanism. In semantic computing for environmental changes in multi-aspects and contexts, we present important functional pillars for analyzing natural environment situations. We also present a method to analyze and visualize the highlighted pillars using our Multi-dimensional World Map (5-Dimensional World Map) System. We introduce the concept of ""SPA (Sensing, Processing and Analytical Actuation Functions)"" for realizing a global environmental system, to apply it to Multi-dimensional World Map System. This concept is essential to design environmental systems with Physical-Cyber integration to detect environmental phenomena in a physical-space (real space), map them to cyber-space to make analytical and semantic computing, and actuate the analytically computed results to the real space with visualization for expressing environmental phenomena, causalities and influences. This system currently realizes the integration and semantic-analysis for KEIO-MDBL-UN-ESCAP Joint system for global oceanwater analysis with image databases.

"The effect of a club in making differences in knowledge, attitude, and practices on family planning among married adolescent girls in urban slums in Bangladesh","Huda F.A., Mahmood H.R., Ahmmed F., Ahmed A., Hassan A.T., Panza A., Somrongthong R.",2019-10-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Bangladesh, Contraception, Contraception Behavior, Family Planning Services, Female, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Marriage, Poverty Areas, Pregnancy, Pregnancy in Adolescence, Sex Education, Urban Population, Young Adult, Attitude and practices, Bangladesh, Family planning, Knowledge, Married adolescent girls, Urban slums","Early marriage and childbearing have led to Bangladesh having the highest adolescent fertility rate in the Asia Pacific region. Adolescent pregnancy is correlated with pregnancy-related complications, preterm delivery, delivery of low-birth weight babies, and spousal violence. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in four urban slums (two intervention and two control areas) of Dhaka from July 2014 to August 2016 to assess the effectiveness of a married adolescent girls club (MAG club) in reducing the unmet need for family planning (FP) among married girls between the ages of 14 and 19 (n = 1601, 799 in intervention and 802 in control areas). The percentages of the targeted population using any modern method of contraception were significantly higher among respondents in the intervention areas than those in the control areas (72.6% versus 63.5%). The unmet need for FP was significantly lower among respondents in the intervention areas than that of the control areas (16.2% versus 20.7%). The MAG club was a well-received strategy to provide comprehensive information on FP, which in turn helped improve contraceptive method practices and reduced the unmet need for FP among married adolescent girls in urban slums in Bangladesh. The government could leverage its existing resources to expand the MAG Club model in rural parts of the country to achieve the targets outlined in its Adolescent Reproductive Health Strategy.","genergyal, public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Controlling the degradation of an oxidized dextran-based hydrogel independent of the mechanical properties,"Nonsuwan P., Matsugami A., Hayashi F., Hyon S.-H., Matsumura K.",2019-01-15,"Aldehyde-dextran, Clinical application, Drug delivery system, Glycidyl methacrylate, Low cytotoxicities, Molecular degradation, Molecular mechanism, Polysaccharide hydrogels, Aldehyde dextran, Biodegradation, Biomaterials, Drug delivery, Hydrogel","The objective of this study is to control and elucidate the mechanism of molecular degradation in a polysaccharide hydrogel. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) immobilized dextran (Dex-GMA) was oxidized by periodate to introduce aldehyde groups (oxidized Dex-GMA). The hydrogel was formed by the addition of dithiothreitol to the oxidized Dex-GMA solution through thiol Michael addition with the preservation of the aldehyde group for degradation points. It was experimentally determined that the degradation of this hydrogel can be controlled by the addition of amino groups and the speed of degradation can be controlled independently of mechanical properties because crosslinking and degradation points are different. In addition, the molecular mechanism of the crosslinking between the thiol and aldehyde groups was found to control the degradation of dextran derivatives. It is expected that these results will be beneficial in the design of polymer materials in which the speed of degradation can be precisely controlled. In addition, the cytotoxicity of oxidized Dex-GMA was approximately 3000 times lower than that of glutaraldehyde. The low cytotoxicity of the aldehyde in oxidized Dex-GMA was the likely reason for the harmless functionalized polysaccharide material. Possible future clinical applications include cell scaffolds in regenerative medicine and carriers for drug delivery systems.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Enhancing ecological-economic efficiency of intensive shrimp farm through in-out nutrient budget and feed conversion ratio,"Chaikaew P., Rugkarn N., Pongpipatwattana V., Kanokkantapong V.",2019-01-01,"Aquaculture systems, Ecological economics, Feed conversion ratios, Intensive farming, Litopenaeus vannamei, Nutrient budget model, Nutrient concentrations, Whiteleg shrimp, Feed conversion ratio, Intensive farming, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Whiteleg shrimp","In aquaculture systems, insufficient nutrients impede shrimp growth while excessive amounts of nutrient inputs lead to environmental degradation and unnecessary high investment. A study of in-out nutrient budgets in an intensive Litopenaeus vannamei farm was conducted in this work to measure the amount of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) input and output from the system. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was obtained to determine the level of nutrient input performance. Between September and December 2017, monthly water and sediment samples were taken within one crop cycle. Nutrient concentrations in sediment and water increased over 90 days. The total nitrogen concentration in the pond water and effluents were in accordance with wastewater quality control for aquaculture; however, the total phosphorus concentration failed to meet the water quality control from the water input through the end of the crop cycle. The nutrient budget model showed that the input/output contained 107.8 kg N and 178.4 kg P. Most of the N input came from shrimp diets (80%) while most of the P came from fertilizer (57%). Both N (46%) and P (54%) mainly deposited in the sediment as an output process. The FCR of this farm is 2.0. Based on the 1.8 FCR scenario, this farm could reduce 147 kg of feed in total, which accounts for 9.04 kg N and 2.21 kg P reduction. The farmer could save $1027 USD crop− 1 ($1 USD = 32.7 baht), as well as reducing uneaten food at the bottom of the pond. This study offers a simple and straightforward model that can practically reduce environmental impacts and increase the profitability of farms.","wastewater and other effluent/liquid waste engineeringn., environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

This technique is capable to control the organization of thin layer on a substrate as a result of the evaporation-driven flow or the viscous-driven flow of colloids towards the edge of meniscus when the solution is dragged across the substrate. Then, capillary-driven forces bring particles into contact with each other and the substrate. In this approach, a variety of morphologies and structures of CZTS thin films could be obtained depending mainly on the controlled deposition conditions. This work aimed to incorporate the simple yet efficient technique with detailed investigation of effects of operating parameters, including velocity of the substrate (500–1250 µm/s), annealing temperature (340–550 °C) and substrate type (glass slide and molybdenum-coated soda lime glass, Mo-coated SLG), on the properties of resulting CZTS thin films. Different morphologies of CZTS films were derived due to the effect of velocity. Furthermore, higher velocity resulted in thicker films, implying that the mechanism of convective flow in the meniscus of colloidal solution and the subsequent film formation was predominantly driven by the viscous drag. Annealing temperature strongly influenced grain growth, composition variation and enhancement of crystallinity. A unique porous structure of CZTS thin film could be obtained by deposition at a controlled velocity using Mo-coated SLG as a substrate. The key advantage of this work is the control of morphology and structure of CZTS films for various desired applications including solar cells and photoelectrochemical devices.","Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"
Interleukin-34 as a promising clinical biomarker and therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis,"Udomsinprasert W., Jittikoon J., Honsawek S.",2019-06-01,"Animals, Arthritis, Biomarkers, Humans, Interleukins, Inflammatory arthritis, Interleukin-34, Knee osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis","Interleukin-34 (IL-34), recently identified as a novel inflammatory cytokine and the second ligand for colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, is known to play regulatory roles in the development, maintenance, and function of mononuclear phagocyte lineage cells – especially osteoclasts. Regarding its primary effect on osteoclasts, IL-34 has been shown to stimulate formation and activation of osteoclasts, which in turn magnifies osteoclasts-resorbing activity. In addition to its role in osteoclastogenesis, IL-34 has been implicated in inflammation of synovium via augmenting production of inflammatory mediators, in which altered IL-34 expression is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for cartilage degradation. Indeed, IL-34 has been documented to be highly expressed in inflamed synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients, which are recognized as inflammatory arthritis. Furthermore, a number of clinical studies demonstrated that IL-34 levels were significantly increased in the circulation and synovial fluid of patients with RA and knee OA. Its levels were also found to be positively associated with disease severity – especially radiographic severity of both RA and knee OA patients. Interestingly, emerging evidence has accumulated that functional blockage of IL-34 with specific antibody can alleviate the severity of inflammatory arthritis. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that IL-34 may be developed as a potential biomarker and a new therapeutic candidate for inflammatory arthritis. To date, there are numerous studies showing IL-34 involvement and association with many aspects of inflammatory arthritis. Herein, this review aimed to summarize the recent findings regarding regulatory role of IL-34 in synovial inflammation-mediated cartilage destruction and update the current comprehensive knowledge on usefulness of IL-34-based treatment in inflammatory arthritis – particularly RA and knee OA.","genergyal, medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

The SO3H-MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized by co-condensation in the presence of tetraethyl orthosilicate, 3-mercaptopropyl (methyl) dimethoxysilane (MPMDS) and cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide. In the last step, the solid catalyst (SH-MCM41) was oxidized by H2O2 to SO3H-MCM-41. The acid capacity of the obtained SO3H-MCM-41 catalyst was quantified by back titration with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. The physical and chemical properties of the SO3H-MCM-41 were characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of varying the catalyst loading (wt.%), reaction time (h) and temperature (°C) and molar composition of MPMDS on the biodiesel yield were investigated using a 2k factorial design. The optimal conditions to maximize the biodiesel yield, obtained from the response surface analysis using a Box–Behnken design, was a 14.5 wt.% catalyst loading, and a reaction time and temperature of 48 h and 129.6 °C. Under these conditions a fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) yield of 84% was predicted, and an 83.10 ± 0.39% yield experimentally obtained.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Optimizing system performance is becoming a great challenge for an ever-increasing large-scale distributed application system in the digital economy on the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application. Currently, the potentials of using BCT have been explored although still at an early stage.

Management of the cancer has been shown to frequently fail due to the ability of the cancer cells to resist therapy as well as metastasis. Recent evidence has suggested that the poor response to the current treatment drugs and the ability to undergo metastasis are driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs) within the tumor. The discovery of novel compounds able to suppress CSCs and sensitize the chemotherapeutic response could be beneficial to the improvement of clinical outcomes. Herein, we report for the first time that 5-O-acetyl-renieramycin T isolated from the blue sponge Xestospongia sp. mediated lung cancer cell death via the induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, 5-O-acetyl-renieramycin T induced the death of CSCs as represented by the CSC markers CD44 and CD133, while the stem cell transcription factor Nanog was also found to be dramatically decreased in 5-O-acetyl-renieramycin T-treated cells. We also found that such a CSC suppression was due to the ability of the compound to deplete the protein kinase B (AKT) signal. Furthermore, 5-O-acetyl-renieramycin T was able to significantly sensitize cisplatin-mediated apoptosis in the lung cancer cells. Together, the present research findings indicate that this promising compound from the marine sponge is a potential candidate for anti-cancer approaches.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

Typically, raw biogas consists of 50–70% methane (CH4), 30–50% carbon dioxide (CO2), and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water vapour. Purifying biogas by removing CO2 and other trace impurities is required in order to achieve higher calorific value, safe operation and to meet fuel standards. As CO2 is the second largest component of biogas, this study focused on its removal from CH4. RESULTS: Composite membranes of blended PEG 400/Pebax 1657 polymer and graphene oxide (GO) were developed for CO2/CH4 gas separation. The effects of GO loading and PEG 400 addition on CO2/CH4 separation performance were investigated. Optimal loadings of 0.25 wt% GO and 50 wt% PEG 400 obtained the best membrane performance with 12.4 GPU of CO2 permeance and 14 of CO2/CH4 separation factor. CONCLUSION: Incorporating GO to the polymer membrane enhanced CO2/CH4 separation, whereas PEG 400 addition increased CO2 permeance. The advantages from each component led to an enhancement of CO2 permeance and CO2/CH4 separation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, energy, environmental, chemistry","Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In this study, SDS-PAGE, 2-DE coupled with NanoLC-MS, and bioinformatics were used to analyze the female salivary gland proteins of pyrethroid-susceptible (PMD) and pyrethroid-resistant (PMD-R and UPK-R) strains of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes for the first time. Results: SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that among the three strains at least nine major proteins were detected but one protein band (20 kDa) was found only in the PMD strain. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed 19 similarly expressed proteins in the salivary glands of the three strains involved in blood-feeding process, stress response, immunogenic response, and metabolic process and five additional major protein spots differentially expressed in the susceptible and resistant strains. Comparative analysis of the expression volume of each protein spot between the PMD and the PMD-R strains showed three downregulated proteins of the PMD-R mosquitoes. For UPK-R strains, six major proteins were downregulated when compared to the PMD strain. Additionally, four downregulated proteins were found in the UPK-R when compared to the PMD-R strain. These results suggest that pyrethroids might induce alteration of salivary gland proteins in resistant mosquitoes. Network analysis by STITCH database 5.0 showed that SRPN23 interacted with sodium and calcium ions, suggesting that SRPN23 might be involved in insecticide resistance. Conclusions: Information obtained from this study will be useful for further studies on the roles of differentially expressed salivary gland proteins in resistance to insecticides and viral transmission.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Small incident angle X-ray diffraction applied on the surface and subjected to repetitive polishing elucidate a formation sequence of iron aluminides. The overall thickness of the aluminized layers is proportional to the processing time squared. The samples are composed of 4 zones, identified by elemental concentration profiles. Only iron aluminides are observed which is in agreement with thermodynamic- and atomic diffusion.

The BC-AC obtained at a carbonization temperature of 500 °C had a mesoporous structure with surface area and total pore volume of ~1730 m2/g and 1.0 cm3/g, respectively. An increase in the H3PO4 loading from 5% to 40% increased the number of weak acid sites on the catalyst surface, which consequently enhanced ethanol conversion. At the reaction temperature of 400 °C, the modified BC-AC with 30-40 wt% H3PO4 loading (P/BC-AC) gave an ethanol conversion at 100% and an ethylene selectivity of 100%. A high selectivity for diethyl ether (DEE) at ~ 67% at ethanol conversion of ~ 50% was obtained at 200 °C. Stability tests with a time-on-stream of 12 h, at reaction temperatures of 200 and 400 °C, showed that the P/BC-AC catalyst had high thermal stability and stable catalytic activity. Therefore, P/BC-AC was found to be very effective as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalyst for ethylene production via ethanol dehydration.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this study, the performance of a novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM) is studied regarding its ability to stabilise soil slopes. Physical model tests are performed on sandy soil slopes under seepage conditions both with and without GCCM stabilisation. Particle image velocimetry is used to measure the soil displacement, and standpipe piezometers are used to monitor the pore water pressure of the slope. The results show that the slope displacement with GCCM stabilisation is much smaller than that without it. The presence of the GCCM constrains the displacement near the slope surface to being along the slope, whereas without the GCCM the slope can deform freely especially in the middle to upper zone of slope area. The results indicate that the GCCM performs well at slope stabilisation.","water engineeringneering, reinforced earth sciencesh and geosynthetics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

The device consists of a control unit for the saw frame, a speed control for the saw blade, a control to set blade depth, and an electrical control box that uses pulse width modulation (PWM). The results showed that this machine can minimize bone dust contamination, reduce heavy noise and increase human safety, mostly due to the use of a remote control unit.

Combined response (CR) at week 96 was defined by HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL and HBsAg < 1000 IU/mL. Pre-treatment viral mutations were characterized by Sanger sequencing and NGS (Miseq Illumina platform). Among 47 patients (32 male, mean age 32.4 years), CR was achieved in 12 (25.5%) individuals. Overall, NGS was superior to Sanger sequencing in detecting mutations (61.7% vs. 38.3%, P < 0.001). Based on NGS, the prevalence of T1753V (T1753C/A/G) and A1762T/G1764A variants were significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders (8.3% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.009 and 33.3% vs. 68.6%, P = 0.032, respectively). No significant difference between groups was found regarding C1653T and G1896A mutants. The absence of T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations were factors associated with CR (OR 11.65, 95%CI 1.36–100.16, P = 0.025, and OR 4.36, 95%CI 1.08–17.63, P = 0.039, respectively). The existence of pre-treatment T1753V, A1762T/G1764A mutations and their combination yielded negative predictive values of 94.7%, 85.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The presence of HBV mutants in the BCP region determined by NGS at baseline was associated with poor treatment outcome in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB receiving PEG-IFN.","biochemistryistry, Immunology","Molecular Biology, Genetics, Virology"
Wheeling charge considering line flow differentiation based on power flow calculation,"Larbwisuthisaroj S., Chaitusaney S.",2019-01-18,"Cost allocation, Line flows, Line Usage, Power transactions, Wheeling charge, Cost Allocation, Line Flow Analysis, Line Usage, Power Transaction, Wheeling Charge","Industrial estates in Thailand, which are usually connected to distribution systems, allow power producers to directly negotiate with their own customers. Therefore, distribution utilities have to calculate wheeling charges with fairness and transparency. This paper proposes a concept of wheeling charge calculation based on ""power flow based MW-Mile method"" with the consideration of differentiation of line flow magnitude before and after the power transaction. The results show that the proposed concept computes the different wheeling charge against existing power flow based MW-Mile method and can reflect an increase or decrease of line flow due to power transaction.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics","Control and Optimization, Computer Science (miscellaneous), Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

That is because it has direct impacts on the physical and mechanical properties. Porosity and compressibility affect properties like brake vibration. This then affects brake noise. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the effects of hot molding conditions on the porosity and compressibility of friction materials. The crucial parameters; molding pressure, temperature and holding time were varied in the hot molding process. Porosity and compressibility were investigated and analyzed in relation to the manufacturing parameters using statistical analysis. The results and the correlation coefficients (R2 ) show that molding pressure and holding time are the most significant effects on porosity and compressibility. They indicate that the hot molding parameters can adequately explain porosity and compressibility.","lubrication, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

A large number of expanded CD4+ T cells and confirmation of functional-related phenotypes are required for ensuring the successful outcomes of treatment. Freshly isolated CD4+ T cells from healthy donors were activated with anti-CD3/28-coated magnetic beads at different bead-to-cell ratios and cultured in the absence and presence of IL-2 supplementation for 3 weeks. Fold expansion, cell viability, growth kinetic and lymphocyte subset identities were determined. Data demonstrated that a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio rendered the highest expansion of 1044-fold with 88% viability and 99.5% purity followed by the 2:1 and 0.5:1 ratios. No significant difference in proliferation and phenotypes was found between non–IL-2 and IL-2 supplementation groups. Several specific surface molecule expressions of the expanded cells including chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, co-stimulatory molecules, activation molecules, maturation markers, cytokine receptors and other molecules were altered when compared to the unexpanded cells. This optimized expansion protocol using the 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio of anti-CD3/28-coated magnetic beads and culture condition without IL-2 supplementation provided the satisfactory yield with good reproducibility. Specific surface molecule expressions of the expanded cells presented potential roles in proliferation, differentiation, homeostasis, apoptosis and organ homing.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; cells of the Immunologyne system; t lymphocytes, Immunology",Immunology

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated 200 consecutive implant patients using clinical and radiographic examinations during periodontal maintenance visits. The demographic data and treatment history were obtained from history taking and chart record review. The association between periodontal status and peri-implant diseases was analyzed using chi-square and logistic regression analysis. Results: Patients with a history of chronic periodontitis had a significantly higher prevalence of peri-implantitis compared with those without a history of periodontal disease (25% vs. 10.9%). The highest prevalence of peri-implantitis was observed in patients with a history of severe chronic periodontitis. Data analysis revealed that peri-implant health status was significantly associated with past periodontal status, maintenance status, and present periodontal status. However, multivariate analysis indicated that only a history of chronic periodontitis was significantly associated with peri-implantitis (adjusted OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.14–5.70, p = 0.02).

New fossil and isotope evidence for the Pleistocene zoogeographic transition and hypothesized savanna corridor in peninsular Thailand,"Suraprasit K., Jongautchariyakul S., Yamee C., Pothichaiya C., Bocherens H.",2019-10-01,"Biochronology, Indochinese-Sundaic boundary, Krabi, Large mammals, Paleoclimatology, Pleistocene, Southeastern Asia, Spotted hyaena, Stable isotopes, Sundaland, Biochronology, Indochinese-Sundaic boundary, Krabi, Large mammal fauna, Paleoclimatology, Pleistocene, Southeastern Asia, Spotted hyaena, Stable isotopes, Sundaland","Despite the explanation that the present-day biogeographic boundary between the Indochinese and Sundaic subregions at the Kra Isthmus, the narrowest part of Peninsular Thailand, in relation to differences in faunal and floral composition is almost conventionally valid for many groups of organisms, the distribution limits of modern and Pleistocene mammals in this region remain unclear. Moreover, environmental factors driving the past distribution patterns in a Southeast Asian mammal community and vegetation types contributing to the controversial hypothesis of an equatorial savanna corridor in the Thai-Malay Peninsula have rarely been demonstrated due to the scarcity of data. Since the discovery of a new Pleistocene fossil site, Yai Ruak Cave in Krabi Province, mammal fossils have been recovered from infilling sediments within the Permian karsts. On the basis of our first excavation, four mammal taxa: Hystrix cf. brachyura, Crocuta crocuta ultima, Rhinoceros sondaicus, and Rusa unicolor are taxonomically identified. A preliminary biochronological age ranging from the late Middle to early Late Pleistocene for the fauna based on the presence of C. c. ultima is proposed. The occurrence of C. c. ultima in this cave also represents the southernmost record of its known distribution, thus suggesting a non-concordant southern range limit of the Indochinese species at the Isthmus of Kra, but somewhere south of Krabi, during the Pleistocene. A bulk analysis of stable carbon isotopes investigated from tooth enamel of these mammals exhibits a variety of habitats ranging from pure C3 to C4 ecosystems, implying the existence of an open grassland landscape. The serial δ18O data collected along the tooth crown heights of R. sondaicus possibly reflect no or little seasonal variation with high annual precipitation due to a major influence of both Southwest and Northeast monsoons in the region, similar to the modern climate. Unlike today, more open vegetation/forest-grassland mosaic was however dominant in Peninsular Thailand at that time. The southward distribution range of the spotted hyaena was likely limited by the discontinuous north-south savanna corridor, latitudinally separated by a transequatorial rainforest belt, starting around the northern part of Sundaland. The ecological distinction between closed and open canopy habitats in the Thai-Malay Peninsula remarkably played a major role in confining the southward distribution of some Indochinese species and in obstructing the migration of grassland-inhabiting taxa across the Sundaic subregion during the Pleistocene glacials.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; environmentalronments, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

Methods: Six hundred and forty-eight rectal and carcass swab samples from border provinces of Thailand (n = 359) and Lao PDR (n = 289) were collected and examined from September 2013 to October 2014. Results: The overall prevalence of Enterococcus species was 483 of 648 (75%), comprising E. faecium (359 of 483, 74.3%) and E. faecalis (124 of 483, 25.7%). The occurrence of E. faecium in pigs, pig carcasses, retail pork, and humans in Thailand was 80.6%, 73.8%, 77.6%, and 67%, respectively. The prevalence of E. faecium was higher in Laos (65.7%) than Thailand (47.1%) (P < 0.001). Conversely, E. faecalis was more common in Thailand (24.2%) than Laos (12.8%) (P < 0.001). The E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates were resistant to all antimicrobials except vancomycin. High resistance was first observed to tetracycline, erythromycin and streptomycin, followed by gentamicin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Both E. faecium (7%) and E. faecalis (0.8%) carried empty Class 1 integrons: E. faecium carried gel (6.4%) and esp (0.8%), while E. faecalis carried agg (41.9%), cylA (36.3%), gel (60.5%), and esp (42.7%). Conclusions: This study revealed a variable distribution of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes among E. faecium and E. faecalis from pigs, pig products and humans in Thai-Laos border provinces.

These controversies have arisen partly because there have been significant misunderstandings of some of the proposed mechanisms, and some misinterpretation of experimental observations. There has also been a lack of consideration of all the evidence, with some researchers ignoring observations that do not fit their favoured hypothesis. Some recent reviews and papers illustrating the above points are discussed in the present paper, although a comprehensive coverage is not attempted. It is concluded that the adsorption-induced dislocation-emission/void-coalescence mechanism predominates for cleavage-like and intergranular fracture modes that exhibit microscale or nanoscale dimples. Hydrogen-enhanced decohesion, hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity, and vacancy-based mechanisms may play secondary roles for such fracture modes and could be more important in other cases.","corrosion, chemistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

Objective: Allergen-specific B-cell responses during 2 years of house dust mite AIT were compared between responder and nonresponder patients. Methods: B cells specific for Der p 1 were detected by using the fluorochrome-labeled allergen method. The frequency of IgA-, IgG 1 - and IgG 4 -switched Der p 1–specific B cells, plasmablasts, and IL-10– and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)–producing Breg cells were investigated and correlated to clinical response to AIT. Results: Sixteen of 25 patients completed the 2-year study. Eleven responder patients showed a successful response to AIT, as measured by a decrease in symptom-medication scores from 13.23 ± 0.28 to 2.45 ± 0.24 (P =.001) and a decrease in skin prick test reactivity to house dust mite from 7.0 ± 1.3 to 2.7 ± 0.5 mm (P =.001). IgG 4 + and IgA + Der p 1–specific B cells showed a significant increase after AIT, with a significantly greater frequency in responders compared with nonresponders in the IgG 4 + but not the IgA + fraction. The frequency of plasmablasts and IL-10– and/or IL-1RA–producing Breg cells was greater among responders compared with nonresponders after 2 years. The increased frequency of Der p 1–specific IgG4 + B cells, plasmablasts, and IL-10 + and dual-positive IL-10 + IL-1RA + Breg cells significantly correlated with improved clinical symptoms over the course of AIT.

However, the HEVC delivers a highly increased computation complexity, which is mainly due to the exhaustive rate distortion optimization search of quadtree-based coding unit partitioning. In this paper, a coding unit partitioning pattern optimization method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to save the computational complexity of hierarchical quadtree-based coding unit partitioning. The required coding unit partitioning pattern for exhaustive partitioning and the rate distortion cost are efficiently considered as the chromosome and the fitness function of the genetic algorithm, respectively. To reduce the computational time, coding unit partitioning patterns of the key frame are searched and shared to other consecutive frames by taking into account the highly temporal correlation. Our evaluation results show that the proposed method can achieve 62.5% and 16.7% computational complexity reduction on average with a negligible average quality degradation compared with HM16.5 and state-of-the-art support vector machine-based fast algorithm, respectively, under low-delay P configuration with rate control while 64.1% and 15.1% under low-delay configuration with rate control.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

At each sampling time, the control design of NMPC is formulated as a two-point boundary-value (TPBV) problem. When the optimal control law is calculated, only the first control input is applied to the controlled system. We employ an iterative steepest descent algorithm to solve the TPBV problem.

This study explored cryptococcosis in lupus mouse models of pristane-induction (normal genetic-background) and FcGRIIb deficiency (genetic defect). Because the severity of lupus nephritis, as determined by proteinuria and serum creatinine, between pristane and FcGRIIb-/- mice were similar at 6-month-old, Cryptococcus neoformans was intravenously administered in 6-month-old mice and were age-matched with wild-type. Indeed, the cryptococcosis disease severity, as evaluated by mortality rate, internal-organ fungal burdens and serum cytokines, between pristane and FcGRIIb-/- mice was not different. However, the severity of cryptococcosis in wild-type was less severe than the lupus mice. On the other hand, phagocytosis activity of peritoneal macrophages from lupus mice (pristane and FcGRIIb-/-) was more predominant than the wild-type without the difference in macrophage killing-activity among these groups. In addition, the number of active T helper cells (Th-cell) in the spleen, including Th-cells with intracellular IFN-γ, from lupus mice (pristane and FcGRIIb-/-) was higher than wildtype. Moreover, these active Th-cells were even higher after 2 weeks of cryptococcal infection. These data support enhanced macrophage activation through prominent Th-cells in both lupus models. In conclusion, an increased susceptibility of cryptococcosis in both lupus models was independent to genetic background. This might due to Th-cell enhanced macrophage phagocytosis with the interference of macrophage killing activity from Cryptococcal immune-evasion properties.",Immunology,"Microbiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Participants interviewed in this study included the managers and auxiliary staff and in health facilities. Results: Availability of caesarean section (23, 95% C.I. 14.0-35.0) and blood transfusion services (57, 95% CI. 44.0-68.0), the two components of comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care, was poor in our study. However, assessment of the seven components of basic emergency obstetric and newborn services showed that 92% of the health facilities (95% C.I. 88.0-96.0) had parenteral antibiotics, 90%, (95% C.I. 80.0-95.0) had oxytocin, 92% (95% CI 88.0-96.0) had manual removal of the placenta service, 87% (95%, C.I. 76.0-93.0) of the facilities had staff who could remove retained products of conception, 82% (95% C.I. 71.0-89.0) had facilities for normal birth and 80% (95% C.I. 69.0-88.0) reported presence of neonatal resuscitation service. Conclusion: Though the basic obstetric and newborn services were reasonably available, comprehensive obstetric and newborn services were not available as per the World Health Organization's standards in the surveyed public health facilities. Ensuring the availability of caesarean section and blood transfusion services within these facilities may improve population's access to these essential services around birth.",medical,Health Policy

"Efficacy of synbiotic Jerusalem artichoke and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-supplemented diets on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, intestinal morphology, immune parameters and protection against Aeromonas veronii in juvenile red tilapia (Oreochromis spp.)","Sewaka M., Trullas C., Chotiko A., Rodkhum C., Chansue N., Boonanuntanasarn S., Pirarat N.",2019-03-01,"Aeromonas veronii, Animal Feed, Animals, Aquaculture, Diet, Fish Diseases, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Helianthus, Intestines, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Synbiotics, Tilapia, Aeromonas veronii, Jerusalem artichoke, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Red tilapia, Synbiotic","Synbiotics, a synergistic combination of probiotics and prebiotics, are currently regarded as one of the most practical nutritional supplements in tilapia farms. In this study, the effect of supplementing the diet of red tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) with Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was evaluated. Growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, intestinal morphology, goblet cell counts, immune parameters and protection against Aeromonas veronii challenge were determined. The results showed that fish fed with synbiotic-supplemented diets had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), and average daily gain (ADG) than fish fed with a control diet. The synbiotic-supplemented diet increased glucose, total protein and the total cholesterol levels. The absorptive area of the proximal and distal intestine of fish fed on the synbiotic diet was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in those fed with probiotics (LGG), prebiotic-supplemented diets (JA), and the control diet. Goblet cell counts revealed that the numbers of acid mucous cells, neutral mucous cells and double-staining mucous cells of fish fed the synbiotic-supplemented diet (JA + LGG) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the proximal and distal intestine. Fish fed the synbiotic-supplemented diets also exhibited significantly higher (P < 0.05) lysozyme activity. The cumulative mortalities of fish fed with a synbiotic-supplemented diet were significantly lower than those of fish fed other diets. The results suggested the beneficial effect of JA and LGG synbiotic diet on growth performance and health status of red tilapia. Direct administration of JA and LGG in fish feed can be used as a practical nutritional supplement in red tilapia.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Cyclic tensile force-upregulated IL6 increases MMP3 expression by human periodontal ligament cells,"Tantilertanant Y., Niyompanich J., Everts V., Supaphol P., Pavasant P., Sanchavanakit N.",2019-11-01,"Cells, Cultured, Humans, Interleukin-6, Matrix Metalloproteinase 3, Periodontal Ligament, Signal Transduction, Stress, Mechanical, Up-Regulation, Cyclic tensile force, Human periodontal ligament cells, IL6, MMP3","Objective: Cyclic tensile force (CTF) modulates physiological responses of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. PDL cells are mechanosensitive and are able to maintain tissue homeostasis; a process mediated by the expression of particular cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL6). It is unknown whether CTF-induced IL6 regulates the expression of MMPs, enzymes needed for tissue remodeling. Design: Human PDL cells were subjected to 10% elongation strain of CTF at a frequency of 60 rpm continuously for 6 h. RNA and proteins were extracted and analyzed for IL6 and MMP expression by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Using a neutralizing anti-IL6 antibody and addition of recombinant human IL6 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 ng.mL−1 were performed to clarify whether CTF-upregulated IL6 increased MMP expression. Inhibitors of intracellular signaling molecules were employed to reveal possible pathway(s) of IL6-induced MMP expression. Results: CTF-induced IL6 expression coincided with an increased MMP3 expression. A neutralizing anti-IL6 antibody attenuated the CTF-increased MMP3 expression, whereas stimulating the cells with recombinant human IL6 increased MMP3 expression. Both PI3K and MAPK pathways were essential in the IL6 induced expression of MMP3. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a role of CTF in the modulation of expression of IL6 and MMP3 and thus in the regulation of homeostasis and remodeling of the periodontal ligament.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; humoral medicalators of Immunologyne response; interleukin, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

Coating corrosion behavior was observed in a 3.5% NaCl solution at 25 °C using Potentiodynamic Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). EIS circuit models for corrosion kinetics were proposed and the surface area and porosity of the coatings were recorded. Corrosion resistance was found to be higher for the coatings grown at 190 °C. This could be attributed to high density as well as low porosity. The EIS circuit model suggests the penetration of corrosive electrolytes into pores reaching the steel substrate for the coatings grown at RT. Finite length diffusion inside pores was also observed. The slow infiltration of corrosive electrolytes into the steel substrate could be seen in coatings grown at 130 °C with diffusion inside the pore similar to that in the coatings grown at RT. However, the EIS circuit model did not exhibit a finite length diffusion of the coatings grown at 190 °C. Owing to high coating density and smaller pore size, corrosive electrolytes could hardly penetrate through and reach the steel substrate.","corrosion, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Several studies of the disorder have been conducted worldwide but there are few publications in Thailand. Here, we describe the clinical manifestations, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors in children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Methods: Between January 2007 and September 2017, we conducted a retrospective/prospective cohort study of children diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis from three tertiary care hospitals in Thailand: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chonburi Hospital, and Prapokklao Hospital. We assessed the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) score for each participant to measure severity of disease and treatment outcome at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Results: We recruited 14 participants (1–13 years with median age 8.4 years). Participants were followed up for a median of 20.5 months. Clinical manifestations included behavioral dysfunction (100%), movement disorder (93%), speech disorder (79%), sleep disorder (79%), and seizures (79%). All patients received first-line immunotherapy (corticosteroids: 100%, intravenous immunoglobulin: 79%, plasma exchange: 21%). Second-line immunotherapy (cyclophosphamide) was administered to 57% of patients. During the first 12 months, 8 patients (62%) achieved a good outcome (mRS ≤ 2). At 24 months, 9 patients (81%) had achieved a good outcome. Altered consciousness and central hypoventilation were predictors of poor outcome. (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We observed similar clinical manifestation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in Thai children to those reported in other countries. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with good outcomes in our study was comparable with previous studies. Further studies are required to investigate other populations in other regions of Thailand.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; autoImmunologyne diseases, medical, neuroscience","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Developmental Neuroscience, Neurology (clinical)"

Method: Retrospective and prospective descriptive analysis of infants 1 month to 1 year diagnosed with epilepsy between January 1, 2012, and April 30, 2018. Results: Total 57 infants. Average age of seizure onset was 4.7 months. Follow-up period averaged 34.2 months. Prenatal risk factors were found in 28.1 percent (16/57). Of these, 50 percent (8/16) had seizure in neonatal period. An additional 6 infants without any prenatal risk factor had seizure in the neonatal period, bringing the total newborn with seizure to 24.6 percent (14/57). Family history of seizure was positive in only 15.8 percent (9/57). Neuroimaging was done 68.4 percent (39/57) and electroencephalogram 50.9 percent (29/57). The etiology was mostly structural 38.6 percent (22/57), followed by unknown 35.1 percent (20/57), genetics 14 percent (8/57), infection 10.5 percent (6/57) and metabolic 1.8 percent (1/57). Status epilepticus was found 21.1 percent of the times (12/57). Antiepileptic drugs were discontinued 19.3 percent (11/57). Intractable seizure was found 29.8 percent (17/57) and developmental delay 56.1 percent (32/57). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, status epilepticus and developmental delay predicted intractable seizure, whereas, abnormal neurological examination and abnormal neuroimaging predicted developmental delay. Mortality rate was 3.5 percent. Conclusion: The study shows that early onset of epilepsy in children under a year is similar to that found in children less than 2–3 years as found in prior studies. High percentages of intractable seizure and developmental delay were found.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; epilepsy, medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

They belonged to the genus Leuconostoc (Ln), Lactobacillus (Lb), Enterococcus (E), Lactococcus (Lc), and Weissella (W), based on their phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. The strains were identified as Ln. pseudomesenteroides (group 1, two strains), Ln. citreum (group 2, three strains), Ln. lactis (group 3, three strains), Lb. paracasei subsp. tolerans (group 4, two strains), E. faecium (group 5, three strains), Lc. lactis subsp. lactis (group 6, one strain), W. confusa (group 7, six strains), Lb. fermentum (group 8, seven strains), and Lb. plantarum subsp. plantarum and Lb. pentosus (group 9, five strains). Fifteen strains exhibited the inhibitory activity against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates by spot-on-lawn method. Lb. fermentum P43-01 resisted to bile acids showed the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against H. pylori strains MS83 and BK364. These antagonistic effects were associated with proteinaceous compounds which are sensitive to α-chymotrypsin and pepsin. Results indicated that production of bacteriocin-like substances of selected strain might be the significant mechanism that exerted the inhibition on H. pylori. A potential strain could be used as probiotics in alternative or adjunctive therapy for a patient suffering from H. pylori infection.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology"

Herein, the findings of the Task Force are presented after a detailed review of the literature. As long as a TGNC individual is on standard gender-affirming hormone treatment, BMD should remain stable to increasing, so there is no indication to monitor for bone loss or osteoporosis strictly on the basis of TGNC status. TGNC individuals who experience substantial periods of hypogonadism (>1 yr) might experience bone loss or failure of bone accrual during that time, and should be considered for baseline measurement of BMD. To the extent that this hypogonadism continues over time, follow-up measurements can be appropriate. TGNC individuals who have adequate levels of endogenous or exogenous sex steroids can, of course, suffer from other illnesses that can cause osteoporosis and bone loss, such as hyperparathyroidism and steroid use; they should have measurement of BMD as would be done in the cisgender population. There are no data that TGNC individuals have a fracture risk different from that of cisgender individuals, nor any data to suggest that BMD predicts their fracture risk less well than in the cisgender population. The Z-score in transgender individuals should be calculated using the reference data (mean and standard deviation) of the gender conforming with the individual's gender identity. In gender nonconforming individuals, the reference data for the sex recorded at birth should be used. If the referring provider or the individual requests, a set of “male” and “female” Z-scores can be provided, calculating the Z-score against male and female reference data, respectively.",medical,"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

However, information about the crystalline form is not known when considering the development of a form for oral dosage. Cocrystal engineering offers drug molecular understanding and drug solubility improvements. Thus, we attempted cocrystallization of ORV using 10 carboxylic acids as a coformer at a 1:1 M ratio. Each combination was processed with liquid-assisted grinding, solvent evaporation and a slurry method, then characterized by powder X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD), conventional and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The solubility, dissolution and permeation studies across Caco-2 cell monolayers were conducted to evaluate the ORV samples. A screening study revealed that an ORV and citric acid (CTA) cocrystal formed by ethyl acetate-assisted grinding had characteristic PXRD peaks (14.0 and 16.5°) compared to those of ORV dihydrate used as a starting material. Low-frequency Raman measurements, with peaks at 100 cm-1, distinguished potential cocrystals among three processing methods while conventional Raman could not. An endothermic melt (142.2°C) confirmed the formation of the novel crystalline complex. The solubility of the cocrystal in the dissolution media of pH 1.2 and 6.8 was approximately 1000 μg/mL, a 1.3-fold increase compared to ORV alone. In vitro cytotoxicity studies showed that the cocrystal and physical blend were not toxic at concentrations of 25 and 12.5 μM ORV, respectively. The ORV-CTA cocrystal enhanced the cellular transport of ORV across Caco-2 monolayers. Therefore, cocrystallization could be used to improve aqueous solubility and permeability, leading to better oral bioavailability of ORV.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science"

To prevent biofilm formation, herein, a universal coating of an antifouling polymer that inhibits the initial adhesion of bacteria is developed. This copolymer is made of methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and a methacrylate-substituted dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) (poly(MPC-DHLA)). The MPC units provide the antifouling property, while the DHLA units offer cross-linkable sites via thiol-ene reactions to form the stable coated copolymer film. Without the requirement for covalent surface grafting, the poly(MPC-DHLA) coating on various biomedically relevant substrates is investigated, where X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, water contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy, and ellipsometry are used to confirm the success of the surface coating. Moreover, to mimic an actual clinical use, the copolymer coating is applied on a titanium dental substrate and the ability to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus is quantified and visualized by crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. As compared with the bare substrate, an effective reduction in bacterial adhesion and suppression of the subsequent biofilm formation is observed on the copolymer-modified substrate. These features are maintained for up to 7 d indicating the durability as well as universal applicability of this coating approach.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

In the present study, the dynamics behavior and the stability of inclusion complexes of two flavonoids LL and PB with βCDs were studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PB(GB)SA free energy calculations. The obtained results showed that the van der Waals driven encapsulation of LL and PB could adapt the structure of the βCDs to become more stable conformers via an enhanced intramolecular hydrogen bond formation on the secondary rim. The structural data and free energy results demonstrated that the phenyl orientation was the preferred binding mode for LL and PB inclusion complexations. In addition, βCD derivatives, especially HPβCDs, could significantly enhance the stability of both flavonoids better than natural βCD.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This study proposed to investigate the location of SN regarding its relationship to the piriformis (PM) by the line joining the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), ischial tuberosity (IT) and greater trochanter (GT). Materials and methods: SN-PM relationship was examined in 204 specimens from 102 embalmed cadavers (55 males, 47 females). Distances between PSIS, IT and GT were measured. Midpoints of SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) and IT-GT line (S2) were marked. Perpendicular line from S1 to PSIS-GT (S1-R) and to PSIS-IT (S1-Q), were created and measured. Distances of PSIS-R, PSIS-Q (S1) and IT-S2 were measured and calculated into percentage of PSIS-GT, PSIS-IT and IT-GT lengths, respectively. Results: Regarding the classification of Beaton and Anson, three types of SN-PM relationship (a, b and c) were obtained. The percentage of type a, b and c was 74.02, 22.55 and 3.43, respectively. Symmetrical SN-PM relationship was found in 75.49%. The mean length of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT in all types was 129.63 ± 11.89 mm, 151.34 ± 14.78 mm and 73.02 ± 10.20 mm, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between types a and b (p = 0.013) in PSIS-IT length, whereas mean length of IT-GT and PSIS-GT showed no statistically significant difference between SN-PM types. PSIS-IT line passed SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) in 112 specimens (54.90%). In these cases, S1 and Q were the same point. A statistically significant difference was also found between types a and b (p = 0.023) in PSIS-Q (S1) length. The mean lengths of PSIS-Q (S1), PSIS-R and IT-S2 in term of percentage of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT line in all types were 60.06 ± 5.90%, 54.19 ± 6.10%, and 37.87 ± 8.27%, respectively. The mean lengths of S1-R and S1-Q were 30.07 ± ± 8.30 mm and 6.54 ± 7.99 mm. Therefore, SN at S1 could be located at the point of 54.19 ± 6.10% of PSIS-GT length (R) with a distance of 30.07 ± 8.30 mm perpendicular to PSIS-GT line (S1-R). Since the PSIS-IT line did not pass SN at S1 in every case, it might not be suitable for localizing SN at S1. SN at S2 could be located at the point of 37.87 ± 8.27% of IT-GT line. No significant difference was found between types. Conclusions: Sciatic nerve can be localised by PSIS-GT and IT-GT lines without statistically significant difference between types (a, b, and c) of SN-PM relationship.","genergyal, medical","Anatomy, Histology"

At the lateral dose profile, the ratios of the dose in the areas with and without shielding (valley-to-peak ratios) were evaluated. Results: The dmax values with the 1, 2 and 3 mm TCR grid collimators were 1.2, 1.1 and 0.7 cm, respectively, while the valley-to-peak ratios at each dmax were 0.566, 0.412 and 0.293, respectively. Conclusion: Only the 2 mm TCR grid collimator had adequate dosimetric features compared to the conventional grid collimator and could be substituted.","genergyal, medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

(Moraceae) has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several illnesses. Recent research also revealed several pharmacological activities from many groups of secondary metabolites, including the stilbenoids mulberroside A, oxyresveratrol, and resveratrol, which are promising compounds for cosmetic and herbal supplement products. In our previous study, cell cultures of M. alba showed high productivity of these compounds. In this study, we attempted to develop immobilized cell cultures of M. alba and to test the effect of elicitors and precursors on the production of stilbenoids. The immobilization of the M. alba cells significantly promoted the secretion of mulberroside A into the extracellular matrix and culture media to 60%, while enhancing the level of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol by 12- and 27-fold, respectively. The elicitation of immobilized cells with a combination of 50 µM methyl jasmonate and 0.5 mg/mL yeast extract for 24 h promoted a twofold increase in the production of all three stilbenoids. Furthermore, the addition of 0.05 mM l-phenylalanine, 0.03 mM l-tyrosine, or a combination resulted in the enhancement of mulberroside A production for up to twofold. The addition of l-tyrosine significantly enhanced the production of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol. This is the first report of stilbenoid production using immobilized cell cultures of M. alba. The cultures have benefits over normal cell suspension cultures by promoting the secretion of mulberroside A and enhancing the levels of oxyresveratrol and resveratrol. Thus, it could be a candidate method for the production of these stilbenoids.","biochemistryistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering"

Therefore, the productivity of shale gas is closely related to the reservoir parameters making it very important to understand the characteristics of shale reservoirs. In this study, the production data of Montney shale was analyzed and the impact of the reservoir characteristics on the productivity was quantified. The reservoir characteristics can be divided into the reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ) parameters. The productivity of shale gas, which is defined as the production decline variables, such as the peak monthly rate (PMR), the initial decline rate, and the decline exponent, was compared with the RQ and CQ. Among the CQ parameters, the brittleness index (BI) was found to affect the overall decline trend in production and had a qualitative correlation with the initial decline rate and decline exponent. Moreover, among the RQ, the total organic carbon (TOC) is closely related to the PMR and the amount of organic carbon (S1) already generated as hydrocarbon is strongly correlated with the initial decline rate and the decline exponent, especially in the transient linear flow regime. Therefore, it is possible to quantify the effects of the organic carbon contents on the productivity of shale gas and estimate the production in the transient linear flow regime.","fluidex; related topics, hydrocarbons, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

The poor knowledge about impact and aging of micro-inverter PV system affects the comprehension and accuracy of PV design and simulation tools. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach based on the mixed-effect model to compare and evaluate the electrical energy yield of micro-inverter PV systems. The analyzed results using a 5-year period data of PV stations located at Concord, Massachusetts, USA showed that there is no significant difference in yearly electrical energy yield of micro-inverter PV systems under shading and non-shading condition. This finding has confirmed the advantage of micro-inverter PV system over the other PV types. In addition, our work is the first study that identified the average degradation rate of micro-inverter PV of 3% per year (95% confidence intervals: 2%-4.3%). Our findings in this study have extended substantially the comprehensive understanding of micro-inverter PV system.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The separation was carried out using a reverse phase C18 column with gradient elution of appropriate proportion between methanol and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 1.0 min mL −1 . The following electrochemical detection (ECD) was accomplished by amperometric method with a detection potential of 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl. The modified BDD electrode, unlike other carbon-based electrodes used for β-agonists detection, typically showed the superior anti-fouling ability and provided excellent long-term stability, resulting in no complicated cleaning steps needed during each determination. The measurement of β-agonists using the PdNPs modified BDD electrode integrated with UHPLC showed a linear relationship in the range of 0.2 to 200 μg mL −1 with detection limits of 0.04, 0.02, and 0.03 μg mL −1 for TER, SAL, and RAC, respectively. Meanwhile, CLB displayed linearly in the range of 0.5 to 200 μg mL −1 with a detection limit of 0.19 μg mL −1 . Moreover, this method was successfully applied to detect β-agonists in diverse samples, including swine feed, swine meat, and human urine with satisfied recoveries in the range from 80.5% to 110.0%. Reliability of this developed method was also validated with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultra-violet detection (UHPLC-UV), and the results showed highly quantitative agreement between the two methods. Therefore, the PdNPs modified BDD could be productively utilized as effective electrodes, with good electrocatalytic activity of PdNPs towards β-agonists oxidation and favorable anti-fouling performance of BDD. The simultaneous detection of four β-agonists by UHPLC-ECD exhibited good stability, acceptable reusability, high sensitivity and rapid analysis.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

To determine DDI between FHT and PrEP, we measured the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of blood plasma estradiol (E2) and tenofovir (TFV) in Thai TGW. Methods: Twenty TGW who never underwent orchiectomy and had not received injectable FHT within six months were enrolled between January and March 2018. FHT (E2 valerate and cyproterone acetate) were prescribed to participants at baseline until week 5, and then from week 8 until the end of study. Daily PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) was initiated at week 3 and continued without interruption. Intensive E2 PK parameters and testosterone concentration at 24 hours (C24) were measured at weeks 3 (without PrEP) and 5 (with PrEP), and intensive TFV PK parameters were measured at weeks 5 (with FHT) and 8 (without FHT). Results: Median (interquartile range) age, body mass index, and creatinine clearance were 21.5 (21–26) years, 20.6 (19.0-22.4) kg/m2, and 116 (101-126.5) mL/min, respectively. The geometric mean (%CV) of area under curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24), maximum concentration (Cmax), and C24 of E2 at weeks 3 and 5 were 775.13 (26.2) pg h/mL, 51.47 (26.9) pg/mL, and 15.15 (42.0) pg/mL; and 782.84 (39.6), 55.76 (32.9), and 14.32 (67.4), respectively. The geometric mean (%CV) of TFV AUC0-24, Cmax, and C24 at weeks 5 and 8 were 2242.1 (26.5) ng h/mL, 353.9 (34.0) ng/mL, and 40.9 (31.4) ng/mL; and 2530.2 (31.3), 311.4 (30.0), and 49.8 (29.6), respectively. The geometric mean of TFV AUC0-24 and C24 at week 5 were significantly less than that at week 8 by 12% (p = 0.03) and 18% (p < 0.001), respectively. There were no significant changes in E2 PK parameters and median C24 of bioavailable testosterone between week 3 and week 5. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated lower blood plasma TFV exposure in the presence of FHT, suggesting that FHT may potentially affect PrEP efficacy among TGW; but E2 exposure was not affected by PrEP. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these reductions in TFV are clinically significant.

Recent studies have shown that significant tricuspid regurgitation is potentially associated with increased mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, data remained sparse and inconclusive. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess the association between significant tricuspid regurgitation and mortality in post TAVR patients. Hypothesis Significant tricuspid regurgitation is predictive for higher mortality in patients undergoing TAVR. Methods We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to October 2018. Included studies were published observational studies that reported multivariate analysis of the effects of significant tricuspid regurgitation on all-cause mortality among patients undergoing TAVR. Data from each study were combined utilizing the random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Nine cohort studies from August 2011 to May 2018 consisting of 27 614 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR (6255 with and 21 359 without significant tricuspid regurgitation) were included in this meta-analysis. The presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation was associated with higher all-cause mortality (pooled OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.45 – 3.52, P < 0.001). We found that all-cause mortality remained statistically substantial in all subgroups (30-day all-cause mortality: OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.20 – 3.49, P = 0.009; midterm all-cause mortality: OR = 9.67, 95% CI: 2.44 – 38.31, P = 0.001; and long-term all-cause mortality: OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.19 – 1.85, P < 0.001). Funnel plots and Egger’s regression asymmetry test were performed and showed no publication bias. Conclusion Significant tricuspid regurgitation increased risk of mortality by up to two-fold among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. Our study suggests that significant tricuspid regurgitation should be considered a component of risk stratification tools.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical",Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

The present study aimed to evaluate mRNA expression profiling of Jagged1-treated hPDLs using microarray technique. Methods: Notch ligands, Jagged1, were indirectly immobilized on tissue culture surface. Subsequently, hPDLs were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surface and maintained in growth medium for 48 hr. Total RNA was collected and processed. Gene expression profiling was examined using microarray technique. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Cell proliferation and colony-forming unit assay were performed. Cell cycle was evaluated using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Results: The isolated cells demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology and exhibited the co-expression of CD44, CD90, and CD105 surface markers. After stimulated with Jagged1, the total of 411 genes was differentially expressed, consisting both coding and non-coding genes. For coding genes, 165 and 160 coding genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in cellular interactions, signal transduction, and collagen formation and degradation while the downregulated genes were in the events and phases in cell cycle. Jagged1 significantly decreased cell proliferation, reduced colony-forming unit ability, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in hPDLs. Conclusion: Jagged1 regulates various biological pathways in hPDLs. This gene expression profiling could help to understand the mechanisms potentially involved in the Notch signaling regulation in periodontal homeostasis.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

Cognitive impairment has been identified as a risk factor for rehospitalization in patients with heart failure. However, previous studies reported mixed results. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between cognitive impairment and 30-day rehospitalization in patients with HF. Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018 in the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Included studies were cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies or randomized controlled trials that compared the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in HF patients with cognitive impairment and those without.

Subgroup analysis was performed on the studies that excluded patients with dementia. The results also showed that cognitive impairment significantly increased the risk of 30-day rehospitalization in participants with HF (pooled RR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.05–1.59, I 2 =0.0%, p=0.016), which was consistent with our overall analysis. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the presence of cognitive impairment is associated with 30-day rehospitalization in patients with HF.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Effect of plating bath composition on chemical composition and oxygen reduction reaction activity of electrodeposited Pt–Co catalysts,"Puangsombut P., Tantavichet N.",2019-02-12,"Chemical compositions, Co alloys, CO concentrations, Electro-activity, Electrodeposition conditions, Orr activities, Oxygen reduction reaction, Supporting electrolyte, Electrocatalyst, Electrodeposition, Oxygen reduction reaction, Proton exchange membrane fuel cell, Pt–Co alloy","Platinum–cobalt (Pt–Co) alloy electrocatalysts were prepared on pretreated carbon cloth by electrodeposition from different plating baths with the aim of finding suitable plating bath conditions that could control the chemical composition of the Pt–Co alloy electrodeposits over a wide range (from 0 to 100 at% Pt) and then to study the relationship of the deposit composition on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electroactivity. The type of supporting electrolyte, the solution pH, Pt and Co concentrations of the plating bath and the current density used for electrodeposition all play a crucial role in the composition of the electrodeposited Pt–Co alloy. Pt contents in all the Pt–Co alloys deposited in H 2 SO 4 are at a relatively high and narrow level (83 at%–97 at% Pt), regardless of the electrodeposition conditions used. While the Pt contents in the Pt–Co alloys deposited in Na 2 SO 4 could reach a very low and broad level (5 at%–97 at% Pt), evidence of Co oxide formation is observed. Of the three supporting electrolytes studied, only NaCl effectively produces Pt–Co deposits over a wide range of compositions (8–90 at% Pt) by controlling the Pt and Co concentrations of the plating bath and using the high enough current density. The results show a qualitative correlation between Pt–Co deposit composition and ORR activity, where Pt–Co alloy catalysts with ≥ 45 at% Pt tend to yield higher ORR activities than the pure Pt catalyst, with the best ORR performance obtained from the Pt–Co alloy catalyst with 78 at% Pt.","physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The discovery of compounds attenuating CSCs’ properties is crucial for enabling advances in novel therapeutics to limit recurrence. CSCs’ features in lung cancer are regulated through a reduction in Src-STAT3-c-Myc, which drives cancer progression, drug resistance, and metastasis. Methods: The effect of lusianthridin suppresses CSC-like phenotypes was determined by 3D culture and anchorage independent growth. The expression of CSC markers and associated proteins were determined by Western blot analyses. Protein ubiquitination and degradation were assessed using immunoprecipitation. Results: Herein, we report that lusianthridin, a pure compound from Dendrobium venustum, dramatically suppressed CSCs in lung cancer cells as verified by several CSC phenotype assessments and CSC markers. The CSC phenotypes in lusianthridin-treated cells were suppressed through downregulation of Src-STAT3-c-Myc pathways. Ectopic Src introduced by the transfection augmented CSC phenotypes in lung cancer cells through STAT3 (increased active p-STAT3Tyr705) and c-Myc signals, while the ShRNA-Src transfection or Src inhibitor dasatinib exhibited opposite results. Treatment of the Src-overexpressing cells with lusianthridin resulted in the reversal of active STAT3 (p-STAT3Tyr705) and c-Myc as well as the CSC marker CD133. Importantly, we confirmed the CSC-targeted activity of lusianthridin in CSC-rich primary lung cancer cells. The compound dramatically inhibited the formation of tumor spheres of primary lung cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that after CSC-attenuation by lusianthridin, the lung cancer cells exhibited significantly higher susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs. Such a sensitizing effect caused by pro-survival suppression and pro-apoptotic induction together with the abolishment of stemness indicated by the decrease in CSC markers CD133, ABCG2, and ALDH1A1. Conclusion: These findings revealed a novel pharmacological action and the underlying mechanism of lusianthridin in negatively regulating CSC-like phenotypes and sensitizing resistant cancer cells to cemetery.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

Until now, no antiviral drug against ZIKV is commercially available. The recent studies reported that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was found as a potential agent inhibiting the ZIKV entry process in Vero E6 cell. A pH-induced conformational change of the viral envelope (E) protein is a key step in such process. Herein, we focused on how EGCG could inhibit the dimeric E protein at the three possible binding sites at acidic pH condition by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 500 ns. The three EGCG binding sites on dimeric E protein are (i) the hinge region between domains I and III; (ii) the conserved region among flaviviruses; and (iii) the dimer interface. As a result, the binding pattern of EGCG in each pocket was presented in the mode of action of inhibition. The ligand-protein binding interactions, protein motions and binding free energies indicated that EGCG favorably interacted with the conserved region greater than the hinge region and the dimer interface, respectively. The obtained results via 4 different end-point free energy calculation methods suggested how this compound binds and prevents the rearrangement in the E protein at low pH.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The racial and sociodemographic factors associated with its incidence and survival are poorly defined. We aimed to investigate population-based gallbladder cancer incidence and survival trends on the basis of clinical characteristics and sociodemographic factors in the USA. Gallbladder cancer incidence and survival data from 2001 to 2012 were obtained from 18 registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Incidence rates and Joinpoint trends were calculated by demographic subgroup. Survival trends were assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 7769 patients were identified. The overall gallbladder cancer incidence rates did not significantly change during the 2001-2012 period. Incidence rates were three times higher in Hispanics and 1.6 times higher in Blacks compared with Whites. Over the time period, incidence rates significantly increased among Blacks and decreased among Hispanics. Male sex [hazard ratio (HR): 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.17], older age (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.53-1.96), and single and divorced statuses (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09-1.30 and 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24) were independently associated with shorter overall survival, whereas higher education (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.97) and higher income (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96) were associated with longer survival. Furthermore, overall survival has improved in all races/ethnicities except for Hispanics and Blacks. The overall incidence rates for gallbladder cancer were stable during 2001-2012.

However, it is unknown whether this holds true for cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) within the cerebellum. We tested the hypothesis that cerebellar CMBs restricted to the cortex and vermis (defined as superficial regions) are associated with clinically diagnosed and pathology-verified CAA. Methods-Three hundred and seven consecutive spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients with a baseline magnetic resonance imaging that included susceptibility-weighted imaging or angiography were enrolled. Using a topographical template, cerebellar CMB patterns were defined as strictly superficial versus deep (cerebellar gray nuclei and white matter) or mixed (both regions involved). Thirty-six ICH patients with cerebellar CMBs and neuropathology data available were evaluated for the presence of CAA. Results-One hundred and thirty-five (44%) ICH patients had CMBs in the cerebellum. In the patient group with cerebellar CMBs, 85 (63%) showed a superficial pattern, and 50 (37%) had a deep/mixed pattern. Strictly superficial cerebellar CMBs were independently associated with a supratentorial pattern of probable CAA-ICH according to the Boston criteria (odds ratio, 1.6; CI, 1.03-2.5) and deep/mixed cerebellar CMBs with a pattern of deep/mixed ICH (odds ratio, 1.8; CI, 1.2-2.7). Pathologically verified CAA was present in 23 of 24 (96%) patients with superficial cerebellar CMBs versus 3 of 12 (25%) patients with deep/mixed cerebellar CMBs (P<0.001). Conclusions-In ICH patients, cerebellar CMBs are relatively common and often restricted to superficial regions. A strictly superficial distribution of cerebellar CMBs is associated with clinically diagnosed and pathologically verified CAA.","medical, Nursing","Neurology (clinical), Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Advanced and Specialized Nursing"

The objective of this study is to find out the factors that significantly affect the CBHI enrollment incentive. The study applied cross-sectional study design to perform situation analysis, in which the Andersen behavioral model was used as a guideline to identify preliminary characteristics that involved with enrolling incentive. Findings: The model found that existence of both outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient department (IPD) health service utilization had significant impact on the CBHI enrollment, this statement is strongly related to adverse selection issues. Households resides in Kaysone Phomvihane district had higher probability of joining the scheme in comparison with relatively less-developed Champhone district. Households with no CBHI knowledge were also more likely to enroll the scheme. Occupation was also found to be a significant factors; of which farmers and laborers had lower possibility enrollment. Conclusions: Economic condition of the district has a significant impact on enrolment. However, the increase in personal income does not directly enhance the desire for enrolment. Most of the high-income households prefer to use a local, private clinic, and foreign hospitals in Thailand or Vietnam. Households with unemployed heads had the highest possibility of enrolling. The reason is the unemployed respondents include the elderly who stay at home without performing major tasks in exchange for their living.

However, only a handful of studies have directly compared alterations in O&NS pathways among patients with MDD and BD types I (BPI) and BPII. Thus, the current study compared superoxide dismutase (SOD1), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), catalase, nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) between mood disorder patients in a clinically remitted state. To this end 45, 23, and 37 participants with BPI, BPII, and MDD, respectively, as well as 54 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Z-unit weighted composite scores were computed as indices of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nitro-oxidative stress driving lipid or protein oxidation. SOD1, NOx, and MDA were significantly higher in MDD than in the other three groups. AOPP was significantly higher in BPI than in HCs and BPII patients. BPII patients showed lower SOD1 compared to all other groups. Furthermore, MDD was characterized by increased indices of ROS and lipid hydroperoxide production compared to BPI and BPII groups. Indices of nitro-oxidative stress coupled with aldehyde production or protein oxidation were significantly different among the three patient groups (BDII > BDI > MDD). Finally, depressive symptom scores were significantly associated with higher LOOH and AOPP levels. In conclusion, depression is accompanied by increased ROS production, which is insufficiently dampened by catalase activity, thereby increasing nitro-oxidative damage to lipids and aldehyde production. Increased protein oxidation with formation of AOPP appeared to be hallmark of MDD and BPI. In addition, patients with BPII may have protection against the damaging effects of ROS including lipid peroxidation and aldehyde formation. This study suggests that biomarkers related to O&NS could aid in the differentiation of MDD, BPI, and BPII.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

This is the first report of the presence of swine MRSA ST398 and multidrug resistance gene cfr in MRSA ST9 in Thailand. With identical molecular characteristics, pigs could be a source of MRSA ST398 spread to humans. A minor variation of genetic features and resistance gene carriage in both lineages represented a heterogeneous population and evolution of the endemic clones.

Genes linked to intragenic LINE-1 methylation show a strong association with immune-associated disorders including psychosis. The aim of this study was to examine LINE-1 methylation patterns in paranoid schizophrenia and methamphetamine-induced paranoia, a model for schizophrenia. Methods: This study recruited 31 patients with paranoid schizophrenia, 94 with methamphetamine-induced paranoia (MIP)and 163 normal controls. LINE-1 methylation patterns were assayed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a combined bisulphite restriction analysis and COBRA were used to estimate LINE1 methylation (mC)and CpG dinucleotide methylation patterns, namely 2 methylated (mCmC)and 2 unmethylated (uCuC)CpGs and the partially methylated loci mCuC (5′m with 3′u)and uCmC (5′u with 3′m). Results: Patients with paranoid schizophrenia show highly significant changes in LINE-1 partial methylation patterns, namely a higher percentage of mCuC and lower percentage of uCmC as compared with controls and MIP patients, while the latter show a higher percentage of mCuC but lower percentage of uCmC as compared with controls. Higher mCuC significantly predicts paranoid schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 97.5% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.895. Conclusions: The results indicate that a common dysfunction in LINE-1 partial methylation may underpin both paranoid schizophrenia and MIP and that this methylation pattern is significantly more expressed in paranoid schizophrenia than MIP. Reciprocal links between impairments in LINE-1 methylation and neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways may underpin the pathophysiology of both MIP and paranoid schizophrenia.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

An understanding of how the brain, pituitary, and gonad axis (BPG) from the neuroendocrine system are involved in the reproductive activity of wild and captive R. brachysoma should help clarify the situation. In this study, we investigated changes in the sea bream gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sbGnRH)–gonadotropin (GTH) system in the female short mackerel, Rastrelliger brachysoma (Bleeker, 1851), during breeding season. sbGnRH-immunoreactive (ir) cell bodies were detected in the nucleus preopticus-periventricularis including nucleus periventricularis (NPT), nucleus preopticus (Np), and nucleus lateralis tuberis (NLT). Additionally, the sbGnRH-ir fibers protruded into the proximal par distalis (PPD) where GTH (FSH and LH) cells were detected. The number of sbGnRH-ir cell bodies and GTH cells and level of LH mRNA were significantly higher in the breeding season than those in the non-breeding season. Moreover, the number of sbGnRH-ir cell bodies and GTH cells and levels of sbGnRH and GTH (FSH and LH) mRNA were significantly higher in the wild fish than those in the cultured broodstock. It is suggested that the wild fish tended to have better reproductive system than hatchery fishes. This could be related to the endocrinological dysfunction and the reproductive failure in the hatchery condition. Moreover, the changes of all of the hormonal level could potentially be applied to R. brachysoma aquaculture.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science"
Non-functional requirement patterns for agile software development,"Amorndettawin M., Senivongse T.",2019-12-09,"Agile software development, Fault tolerance designs, Non-functional requirements, Requirement Patterns, Requirements elicitation, Scrum, Security patterns, Software developing organizations, Fault Tolerance Patterns, Non-functional Requirements, Requirement Patterns, Scrum, Security Patterns","Following the agile principles, agile software development is popular among software developing organizations. The attractive characteristics of agile development are that it embraces frequent changes and that it gives high priority to users. Due to such characteristics, non-functional requirements are usually not identified in the requirements elicitation process. They are often neglected in an early phase, and even overlooked in the later stages of software development. This results in poor quality software. To enhance non-functional requirements identification in agile development, this paper proposes a development of a set of non-functional requirement patterns in the form of requirement templates for agile development. The set is composed of 10 security requirement patterns and 13 fault tolerance requirement patterns, which are derived from an analysis of security and fault tolerance design patterns. The proposed non-functional requirement patterns can facilitate non-functional requirements gathering and help agile team members in writing the requirements. In an experiment on a Scrum team, the team members took less time to write security and fault tolerance requirements for a number of given problems when using the proposed patterns, compared with the case of not using the patterns. In addition, the non-functional requirement patterns helped the team members to write more complete security and fault tolerance requirements. Despite the effort they had to spend in learning the proposed requirement patterns, the team also agreed that the patterns are useful in practice.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Orthologous group analysis of those genomes showed presence–absence patterns of orthologs that were consistent with the genus classifications. Many shared unique orthologs were identified in the well-supported lineages (genera Apiotrichum and Trichosporon), supporting the definitions of the genera Apiotrichum and Trichosporon from a genomic perspective. Specifically, we obtained 24 and 285 genus-specific genes from eight Apiotrichum and five Trichosporon species, respectively, and propose that these genus-specific genes can be used for delineation of those genera. On the other hand, the genus Cutaneotrichosporon shared only one genus-specific gene among eight genomes, indicating that this genus definition might require re-examination based on genomic data. In addition, taxonomic revisions are presented in this study, including the proposal of two genera, Pascua and Prillingera. Because genomic data can be systematically obtained and analyzed to compare species from a comprehensive viewpoint, they can be used not only to reconstruct reliable phylogenetic trees, but also to re-examine the definitions of taxonomic classifications. To our knowledge, this is the first report to discuss the ‘natural system’ of genus level classification in fungi based on genomic data.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Genetics"
Solvent extraction based reclaiming technique for the removal of heat stable salts (HSS) and neutral degradation products from amines used during the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial flue gases,"Karnwiboon K., Krajangpit W., Supap T., Muchan P., Saiwan C., Idem R., Koiwanit J.",2019-12-01,"2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, Chemical affinities, CO2 capture, Degradation products, Heat stable salts, N-methyldiethanolamine, Simultaneous extractions, Sodium hydroxide solutions, Amine degradation, Amine reclaiming, CO2 capture, Heat stable salts (HSS), Solvent extraction","This work used a modified OH-aliquat mixed with a new diluent, namely, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol to separate heat stable salts (HSS), namely, formate, glycolate and oxalate as well as neutral degradation products (i.e. imidazole, N-acethylethanolamine, 2-oxazolidone, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-succinimide) from monoethanolamine (MEA), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and their blends which are amines/amine blends typically used for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from industrial flue gases. The new diluent, which has a branched-chain structure, increased the extraction performance of the OH-aliquat up to 50% HSS removal from MEA solution compared to our previous straight-chained 1-octanol diluent. The extractant also performed very well in removing HSS from MDEA and AMP with the ease of HSS extraction increasing in the order of AMP < MEA < MDEA for which the oxalate was removed by nearly 100% regardless of the type of amine and concentration. In blended MEA, AMP and MDEA, the extractant had a higher chemical affinity in removing all HSS when compared with single MEA. The extractant could also remove major neutral degradation products found in MEA solution. High temperature and low CO2 loading conditions were found to be favorable in maximizing the ability of the extractant to remove both product types. This finding revealed that the exact location where the amine slipstream should be taken for simultaneous extraction of all degradation products is at the exit point of the lean-rich amine heat exchanger. The regeneration of extractant using sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) also indicated the reusability of the extractant as long as its reactive molecules remained. The results obtained from this study are being used for further development of the extraction process that can be used as a permanent replacement for conventional reclaiming techniques.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"
High anatase purity of nitrogen-doped TiO 2 nanorice particles for the photocatalytic treatment activity of pharmaceutical wastewater,"Suwannaruang T., Kidkhunthod P., Chanlek N., Soontaranon S., Wantala K.",2019-06-01,"Anatase crystallinity, Ciprofloxacin, Hydrothermal methods, Nitrogen-doping, OH radical, Pharmaceutical wastewater, Photo catalytic degradation, Photocatalytic treatment, Ciprofloxacin, High anatase crystallinity, Mesoporous material, Nitrogen doping concentration, OH radical, Urea","The titanium dioxide photocatalysts modified with nitrogen (N–TiO 2 ) were synthesized via hydrothermal method by using urea (NH 2 CONH 2 ) as a nitrogen source with various concentrations of dopant. The characterizations of cooperated N–TiO 2 were examined by many techniques. The performance of the synthesized N–TiO 2 catalysts was evaluated by using the decomposition of ciprofloxacin under UV light irradiation. Additionally, the OH radical production was also estimated. The results revealed that the influence of different concentrations of nitrogen dopant was significant on the physicochemical and structural properties. The surface morphology exhibited the nanorice grain particles in all samples. The trend of particles size and pore diameter decreased, whereas BET surface area slightly increased with increasing of nitrogen contents. The WAXS profiles demonstrated that the photocatalysts displayed the high purity of the anatase crystalline phase and delayed the phase transformation from anatase to rutile. The bandgap energies showed lower than pure anatase crystalline phase. The types of Ti–N–O (substitutional N) and/or Ti–O–N (interstitial N) bonding were formed into TiO 2 lattice investigated by XPS technique. The photodegradation of ciprofloxacin increased with increasing of nitrogen contents. The N–TiO 2 catalysts can generate OH radical and in-situ OH radical thought the direct photocatalytic degradation of coumarin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Since, increasing of nitrogen content can increasingly produce OH radical to more react with organic pollutants. The de-mineralization by using the highest nitrogen content sample showed approximately 66% removal at 4 h of reaction time.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

We sought to evaluate overweight as the additional risk factor that can increase the prediction of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) detection in Thais apart from the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score. Methods: We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic 338 subjects who underwent screening colonoscopy between November 2016 and September 2017. All risk factors according to APCS, BMI and the presence of metabolic syndrome were collected. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥ 23 kg/m2. By APCS score, subjects were categorized into 1) high-risk and 2) average-risk. Using the combination of APCS score and overweight, subjects were stratified into 4 groups; high-risk with overweight (G1), average-risk with overweight (G2), high-risk with normal weight (G3) average-risk and with normal weight (G4). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of detecting CRN. Results: The prevalence of CRN in the high-risk subjects was higher than that of in the average-risk subjects (49%vs.32%; OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.17-3.41). After adjustment for APCS risk factors and metabolic syndrome, overweight significantly increased the risk of detecting CRN (OR, 2.52; 95%CI, 1.57-4.05). Among the 4 groups, the detection rates of CRN were significantly different (G1=64%, G2=40%, G3=32% and G4=21%, p < 0.01). The relative risk of detecting CRN increased when G1 (OR 6.49; 95%CI, 2.87-14.67), and G2 (2.42; 1.39-4.21) were compared with G4. Conclusions: In addition to the APCS score, overweight is an independent risk factor for detecting CRN. In Thai population, combining overweight and APCS score may be useful to improve the prediction for CRN.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

We assessed liver stiffness in HBV-HIV coinfected youths. Methods: A cross-sectional study in HBV-HIV coinfected youths aged 18 to 25 years who received a tenofovir (TDF)-containing antiretroviral therapy regimen for >96 weeks. Measurements included HBV DNA level, HBV serology profiles, and transient elastography (TE). The cutoff for TE results included ≥5.9 kPa for F2-moderate fibrosis, ≥7.4 kPa for F3-severe fibrosis, and ≥9.6 kPa for F4-cirrhosis. Results: From March to December 2016, 15 HBV-HIV coinfected youths with a median duration on TDF-containing regimens of 3.3 years were enrolled. Five (33%) youths had significant liver fibrosis, 3 with F2-moderate, 1 with F3-advanced fibrosis, and 1 with F4-cirrhosis. Other 5 without liver fibrosis had hepatitis B surface e antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface e antigen (HBeAg) loss. Higher mean alanine transaminase (ALT) was observed among the group with F2-F4 when compared to those with F0. Conclusion: Liver fibrosis was evidenced in HBV-HIV coinfected youths in Thailand. Transient elastography might be considered for those who do not achieve HBsAg loss or have persistent ALT elevation while on treatment.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Dermatology, Infectious Diseases"
Comparison between the transcriptomes of ‘KDML105' rice and a salt-tolerant chromosome segment substitution line,"Khrueasan N., Chutimanukul P., Plaimas K., Buaboocha T., Siangliw M., Toojinda T., Comai L., Chadchawan S.",2019-10-01,"Chromosomes, Plant, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Oryza, Phototropins, Plant Proteins, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Acetyl-Transferring) Kinase, Salt Tolerance, Transcriptome, Phototropin, Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, Two-component signaling system","‘KDML105' rice, known as jasmine rice, is grown in northeast Thailand. The soil there has high salinity, which leads to low productivity. Chromosome substitution lines (CSSLs) with the ‘KDML105' rice genetic background were evaluated for salt tolerance. CSSL18 showed the highest salt tolerance among the four lines tested. Based on a comparison between the CSSL18 and ‘KDML105' transcriptomes, more than 27,000 genes were mapped onto the rice genome. Gene ontology enrichment of the significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that different mechanisms were involved in the salt stress responses between these lines. Biological process and molecular function enrichment analysis of the DEGs from both lines revealed differences in the two-component signal transduction system, involving LOC_Os04g23890, which encodes phototropin 2 (PHOT2), and LOC_Os07g44330, which encodes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), the enzyme that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase in respiration. OsPHOT2 expression was maintained in CSSL18 under salt stress, whereas it was significantly decreased in ‘KDML105', suggesting OsPHOT2 signaling may be involved in salt tolerance in CSSL18. PDK expression was induced only in ‘KDML105'. These results suggested respiration was more inhibited in ‘KDML105' than in CSSL18, and this may contribute to the higher salt susceptibility of ‘KDML105' rice. Moreover, the DEGs between ‘KDML105' and CSSL18 revealed the enrichment in transcription factors and signaling proteins located on salt-tolerant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosome 1. Two of them, OsIRO2 and OsMSR2, showed the potential to be involved in salt stress response, especially, OsMSR2, whose orthologous genes in Arabidopsis had the potential role in photosynthesis adaptation under salt stress.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

These errors are originated at satellites, propagation path and receivers. This study focuses on the GNSS receiver internal delay determination resulting from the receiver's electronics circuit. The characterisation of the delay in the GNSS geodetic receivers is essential to enhance the accuracy for the time transfer and time comparisons as part of GNSS integrity chain determinations. The purpose of GNSS receiver internal delay at the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand), NIMT, is to estimate the characteristics and performances of the GNSS geodetic receiver used for international time comparisons. The experiments are simultaneously observed GNSS satellites by a GPS and a GNSS receivers and two separate antennas with short baseline (around 6 metres), where both receivers are connected to the identical external caesium frequency standard maintained as time and frequency standard of Thailand. The GPS receiver is well-defined for its receiver internal delay on the pseudo-range observation of C1, through comparisons using an internationally recognised method, while the geodetic GNSS receiver is to be defined on its receiver internal delay. These experiment observations started from 26 December 2017 to 17 January 2018 at NIMT, Pathumthani, Thailand. The determined unknowns are receiver position, receiver clock offset, tropospheric delay through the geodetic technique of static Precise Point Positioning observations with Bernese GNSS software version 5.2. Later the receiver internal delay of NIMT is computed and analysed. The receiver internal delay on GPS C1 code is successfully characterised, resulted as 346.0 nanoseconds as of this experiment.","remote sensing; geodesy, Mathematics, engineering, earth sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ) is a mitochondrial targeted antioxidant with high bioavailability. This study aimed to examine the impact of maternal cigarette smoke exposure (SE) on offspring’s metabolic profile and hepatic damage, and whether maternal MitoQ supplementation during gestation can affect these changes. Female Balb/c mice (eight weeks) were either exposed to air or SE for six weeks prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. A subset of the SE dams were supplied with MitoQ in the drinking water (500 μmol/L) during gestation and lactation. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed in the male offspring at 12 weeks and the livers and plasma were collected at 13 weeks. Maternal SE induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress and related damage in the adult offspring. Maternal MitoQ supplementation reduced hepatic mitochondrial oxidative stress and improved markers of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. This may restore hepatic mitochondrial health and was associated with an amelioration of glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and pathological changes induced by maternal SE.

Methods and materials: Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥2 RILT was scored. The Lyman NTCP models predicting the probability of CTCAE grade ≥2 RILT as a function of the fraction-size adjusted mean liver dose (MLD), using reference fraction size = 2 Gy/fraction and α/β ratio = 2 Gy, were fitted using the maximum likelihood method. At certain combinations of MLDs, ΔNTCP with a CI was evaluated by the delta method. Results: Of the 239 patients, the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥2 RILT was 55% (46% in the Child–Pugh (CP)-A vs. 81% in the CP-B/C, p < 0.001). Among 180 CP-A patients, 40% who had viral hepatitis infections experienced toxicity vs. 32% in the nonhepatitis subgroup. The MLD was 18 Gy in the toxicity group vs. 16.1 Gy in the nontoxicity group (p = 0.002). The estimated NTCP model parameters specific to the patient subgroups and the ΔNTCP with CI assuming a particular CP classification and viral hepatitis infection status were considerably different which possible changed treatment decision.

The average concentration of PM2.5–10 was 441 ± 496 μg m− 3 (N = 33), and for PM2.5, the average concentration was 2774 ± 4713 μg m− 3 (N = 33). Additionally, the concentrations of PM10, which were the summation of PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 concentrations, had an average concentration of 3215 ± 4858 μg m− 3 (N = 33). The average PM2.5 mass concentrations accounted for 75 ± 18% from those of PM10, suggesting that PM2.5 was the main component of particulate matter that the workers were exposed to during the burning activity. The study also found that increased amounts of burnt e-waste significantly influenced the concentrations of coarse and fine particles emitted. Moreover, the Pearson’s correlation showed a positive relationship between each type of PM mass concentrations and their own total weighted scores of activity patterns. The results indicated that the activity that most increased the exposure concentration of PM2.5 was mixing e-waste on fire. In contrast, the activities that influenced the exposure of PM2.5–10 are mechanical activities, such as compiling and sweeping of e-waste, which are processes that emit and spread larger sizes of particulate matter into the air around the working environment.","Materials Sciencerials science, fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The SPE sensor was used for label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were first electrodeposited on the SPCE, followed by the self-assembly of PMPC-SH on gold. The electrochemical response of the modified SPE to CRP was measured by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). If the CRP on the paper device is contacted with Ca (II) ions, the current (measured by using hexacyanoferrate as the electrochemical probe) decreases. The signal drops in the 5 to 5000 ng·mL−1 CRP concentration range, and the lower detection limit (at 3 SD/slope) is 1.6 ng·mL−1. The use of a PMPC-modified surface also reduces the nonspecific adsorption of proteins. The sensor is not interfered by bilirubin, myoglobin and albumin. It was successfully applied to CRP detection in certified human serum.

The AC@CuO-NWs nanocomposite is synthesized via simple precipitation method and characterized by using various techniques which includes scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-rays diffraction analysis (XRD). XRD results confirmed the monoclinic structure of CuO-NWs with the average crystalline size ~ 17.48 nm. The SEM images indicated the wire-like structure and EDX analysis confirms the CuO nanomaterial. The SEM image shows that nanowires are agglomerated to form like flower shape. The batch adsorption experiments were optimized using various parameters such as pH, contact time, initial dye concentration, kinetic and isotherm studies. The results showed that the adsorption processes were well fitted with the PSO model. The adsorption equilibrium experimental data fitted to the Langmuir models with a maximum adsorption capacity of 141.73 mg/g at 328 K. The thermodynamics results reveal that the adsorption processes are spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The high negative value of ΔG° and a low value of ΔH° show the feasibility with physisorption and endothermic nature of the adsorption process.

Growth impairment is prevalent in pediatric CKD, and children with PUVs are at high risk for growth retardation. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe growth profiles in PUVs and to identify risk factors for stunting, defined as age-specific height standard deviation score (SDS) below −2. Patients and methods: Medical records of 65 patients with PUVs and a minimum follow-up of two years were retrospectively reviewed. Chronic kidney disease stage 1–3 was considered mild CKD, whereas CKD stage 4–5 was considered advanced CKD. Age-specific height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) SDS were determined. Seven potential risk factors for stunting, namely timing of diagnosis, renal dysplasia, timing of surgery, requirement of urinary diversion, nadir serum creatinine after surgery, recurrent febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), and severity of CKD, were analyzed. Results: Median age at diagnosis, at surgery, and at last follow-up was 0.51, 0.75, and 7.53 years, respectively. All patients underwent valve ablation, and 33.8% required urinary diversion. Median nadir serum creatinine after surgery was 0.40 mg/dL and was higher in patients who underwent urinary diversion (P < 0.001). Growth profiles by CKD stage are displayed in Fig. 1. Median height SDS was −0.40 and was lower in patients with advanced CKD (P = 0.03). Stunting was diagnosed in 15.4%. Advanced CKD was an independent risk factor for stunting, with the odds ratio of 12.7. Urinary diversion and nadir creatinine more than 0.80 mg/dL were weakly associated with stunting but not significant. Timing of diagnosis and surgery, unilateral renal dysplasia, and recurrent febrile UTI were not associated with stunting. Median SDS of weight and BMI was −0.64 and −0.19, respectively. Patients who were thin, of normal weight, overweight, and obese comprised 26.2%, 58.5%, 10.8%, and 4.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference of SDS of weight and BMI across CKD stages (Fig. 1). Discussion: Deterioration in height began early in the course of disease and was worsening in relation to the decline of renal function. The impact of timing of diagnosis or surgery on height was controversial. Patients who underwent urinary diversion had high nadir creatinine and were likely to have severe PUVs. Although patients with severe baseline renal dysfunction may require urinary diversion, nadir serum creatinine and urinary diversion are not associated with stunting. Delaying progression of CKD could maximize linear growth potential in PUVs. A substantial proportion of patients were overweight or obese. Sufficient caloric intakes may be maintained in patients with PUVs.[Figure presented]",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Urology"

In this study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect and the underlying mechanisms of CEP on both chemosensitive CaOV-3 and chemoresistant OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell lines. The present study demonstrated that CEP significantly inhibited the growth of CaOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. CEP arrested CaOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells in the G1 phase and S phase of cell cycle, respectively. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CEP markedly increased the expression of p21 Waf1 protein and decreased the expression of cyclins A and D proteins in both CaOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Additionally, CEP triggered apoptotic cell death in OVCAR-3 cells. Taken together, the above results suggest that CEP is a promising anticancer drug for ovarian cancer.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

There is evidence for the association of osteitis with revision surgeries and CRS severity, in terms of higher Lund-Mackay scores. This is a narrative review on the osteitis in CRS patients. Recent Findings: Evidence to date is inconclusive with regard to the etiology and pathogenesis of this bony thickening. Histopathology of osteitis in primary CRS is likely a process of neo-osteogenesis and bone remodeling. For better understanding, various associating factors have been studied including an inflammatory pattern of rhinosinusitis. Recent studies have associated osteitis with nasal polyps and tissue eosinophilia with the increase in periostin expression and P-glycoprotein mucosal expression. There is no association of osteitis to symptoms or quality of life. Osteitis is an outcome of neo-osteogenesis rather than inflammatory processes in CRS patients without a prior history of surgery. While CT has become a staple in osteitis assessment, the standards for grading osteitic severity remain in an experimental stage.

S100 proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in inflammatory processes and bone remodeling. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mechanical stress on S100A7 expression by human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) and the effect of S100A7 proteins on osteoclast differentiation. Materials and Methods: Isolated HDPCs were stimulated with compressive loading (2 and 6 hr), or shear loading (2, 6, and 16 hr). S100 mRNA expression and S100A7 protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Osteoclast differentiation was analyzed using primary human monocytes. The differentiation and activity of osteoclasts were examined by TRAcP staining and dentine resorption. In addition, the expression of S100A7 was analyzed in pulp tissues obtained from orthodontically treated teeth. Results: Compressive and shear mechanical stress significantly upregulated both mRNA and protein level of S100A7. Dental pulp tissues from orthodontically treated teeth exhibited higher S100A7mRNA levels compared to non-treated control teeth. S100A7 promoted osteoclast differentiation by primary human monocytes. Moreover, S100A7 significantly enhanced dentine resorption by these cells. Conclusions: Mechanical stress induced expression of S100A7 by human dental pulp cells and this may promote root resorption by inducing osteoclast differentiation and activity.","cell and developmental biology; cell types and biology; differentiation, medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

However, both the quantity and quality of colostrum are highly variable among sows. The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of sow parity number and housing conditions on concentration of immunoglobulin G in sow colostrum. A total of 358 colostrum samples were collected from two commercial swine herds in Thailand. The colostrum samples were collected from all teats at 1 and 6 h after the onset of farrowing and kept at − 20 °C until analysis. The concentration of IgG was determined using ELISA. The concentration of IgG in colostrum at 1 h after the onset of farrowing was greater than the concentration of IgG at 6 h after the onset of farrowing (P < 0.001). Moreover, herd A had a greater colostral IgG concentration than herd B (P < 0.001). The concentration of IgG in primiparous sows (64.0 mg/ml) was lower than that in sow parity numbers 3 (75.1 mg/ml, P = 0.05) and 6 (79.2 mg/ml, P = 0.04). In conclusion, the variation in colostral immunoglobulin concentration in the sow colostrum was influenced by their parity number and housing conditions. The concentration of IgG declined significantly within 6 h after the onset of farrowing (P < 0.001).","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

Software companies provide customer care service or customer support to handle such issues or problems which sometimes can be resolved right away and sometimes have to be forwarded to responsible persons. Efficiency of problem handling is very important to software companies to maintain customer satisfaction. This paper reports a case of a software company in Thailand whose derivatives trading software is used by a large number of broker companies and their customers. The software company has experienced problems where the reported software problems are classified incorrectly and hence are directed to the wrong persons and have to be reclassified. Assigning the problem reports to the responsible persons in a timely and correct manner is crucial especially for the nature of the trading software. This paper presents a multiclass classification method to classify 11 problem report types that are found in this trading software. Machine learning algorithms that are applied include Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Linear SVC, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and consider both lexical features and metadata of the problem reports. In an experiment, Linear SVC performed best, having the F1 score of 91.69% and accuracy of 91.79% when using unigram and trigram features of the problem report text which is written in Thai and English. The paper presents a support tool for classifying new problem reports and providing a dashboard of the problems found in this derivatives trading software for the software team to manage its maintenance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients in need of a single implant were randomly assigned to two CAIS groups (Static n = 30, Dynamic n = 30) and implants were placed by one surgeon. Preoperative CBCT was transferred to implant planning software to plan the optimal implant position. Implants were placed using either stereolithographic guide template (Static CAIS) or implant navigation system (Dynamic CAIS). Postoperative CBCT was imported to implant planning software, and deviation analysis with the planned position was performed. Primary outcomes were the deviation measurements at implant platform, apex, and angle of placement. Secondary outcome was the distribution of the implant deviation into each 3D direction. Results: The mean deviation at implant platform and implant apex in the static CAIS group was 0.97 ± 0.44 mm and 1.28 ± 0.46 mm, while that in the dynamic CAIS group was 1.05 ± 0.44 mm and 1.29 ± 0.50 mm, respectively. The angular deviation in static and dynamic CAIS group was 2.84 ± 1.71 degrees and 3.06 ± 1.37 degrees. None of the above differences between the two groups reached statistical significance. The deviation of implants toward the mesial direction in dynamic CAIS group was significantly higher than that of the static CAIS (p = 0.032). Conclusions: Implant placement accuracy in single tooth space using dynamic CAIS appear to be the same to that of static CAIS. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20180826001).",dentistry,Oral Surgery

This study employs economic analysis of chemical-free processing of lemon basil seed to evaluate the viability of production. Lemon basil seed was cracked before extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide. The uniformed mucilage powder was obtained by milling and sieving. Three products, ∼75% defatted fiber, ∼15% basil seed (Omega-3 rich)oil, and ∼10% of high protein powder, were obtained from this process. Mass and energy balances were obtained from the experiments in the 25-L extractor, and these results were used to apply analysis to 50- and 100-L extractors. The results indicated that 50- and 100-L plants were both profitable. Sensitivity analysis was employed to indicate that the 25-L plant could be practical if the selling price of defatted fiber increased from $22,850 to $27,477/ton. The project feasibility was also found to be partially dictated by the price of basil seed as well. For example, the 50-L plant fell below profitability when the price of basil seed increased from $5150 to $6,517/ton.","genergyal, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

We detect continuum emission for 19/20 quasars. After subtracting an AGN contribution, we measure the total far-IR luminosity for 18 quasars, assuming a modified blackbody model, and attribute the emission as indicative of the star formation rate (SFR). Our sample can be characterized with a lognormal SFR distribution having a mean of 140 M yr−1 and a dispersion of 0.5 dex. Based on an inference of their stellar masses, the SFRs are similar, in both the mean and dispersion, with star-forming main-sequence galaxies at the equivalent epoch. Thus, there is no evidence for a systematic enhancement or suppression (i.e. regulation or quenching) of star formation in the hosts of the most luminous quasars at z ∼ 2. These results are consistent with the Magneticum cosmological simulation, while in disagreement with a widely recognized phenomenological model that predicts higher SFRs than observed here based on the high bolometric luminosities of this sample. Furthermore, there is only a weak relation between SFR and accretion rate on to their supermassive black holes both for average and individual measurements. We interpret these results as indicative of star formation and quasar accretion being fed from the available gas reservoir(s) in their host with a disconnect due to their different physical sizes, temporal scales, and means of gas processing.","petroleum engineeringneering, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

The effect of boron concentration in the plating bath on the surface morphology, the overall boron content in the deposited layers and the hardness of the resulting coating layer were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface morphology of the Ni-W-B coating layer was largely modified by the boron particle loading in the electroplating suspension. Distinct nodular structures were observed in these samples. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra suggested that the overall boron content in the coating layer increased with increasing boron particle loading from 1 to 3 g/L. Too high boron particle loading of 10 g/L resulted in lower overall boron content. The highest hardness of 680.86 ± 17.67 Hv was obtained from Ni-W-B/B coating layer fabricated using the boron particle loading of 5 g/L.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Since YOLOv3 composes of two network components: backbone and pyramid networks, we propose a robust pruning mechanism to prune filters of each network separately. This can help to avoid over-pruning the network in some part of the model making our model more robust. There are two main pruning criteria investigated: Average Percentage of Zero (APoZ) and Sum Magnitude Weight. The experiment was conducted on UA-DETRAC.

This study investigated the effect of iloprost (an exogenous prostacyclin [PGI2]) on enhancing human dental pulp cell (HDPC) migration and its underlying mechanism. Methods: HDPC migration was analyzed using a wound scratch assay. HDPCs were obtained from extracted teeth and cultured in the presence of iloprost for 24 and 72 hours. Immunofluorescent staining for matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis, gelatin zymography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of MMP-9 expression were performed. A PGI2 (IP) antagonist, protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, and MMP-9 inhibitor were used to inhibit the IP receptor, PKA signaling pathway, and MMP-9 activity, respectively. Results: A mechanically applied scratch in HDPC cultures closed more rapidly in the presence of iloprost. This result coincided with increased MMP-9 messenger RNA and protein expression and higher gelatinase activity. These iloprost-enhanced effects were inhibited by an IP receptor antagonist or a PKA inhibitor. Forskolin, a PKA activator, increased MMP-9 expression concomitant with increased migration. The application of a selective MMP-9 inhibitor resulted in decreased iloprost-induced migration. Conclusions: MMPs play an important role in cell migration by degrading components of the extracellular matrix. In this study, iloprost accelerated HDPC migration in a wound scratch assay. MMP-9 expression was increased concomitantly by iloprost and appeared to be mediated by the IP-PKA pathway. These observations suggest that iloprost may enhance dental pulp tissue healing by up-regulating MMP-9. The PGI2 analog might be a promising biomolecule in dental pulp regenerative treatment.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Methods: A retrospective search of radiology reports from 2000 to 2016 was performed to identify patients < 18 years old with an imaging exam identifying at least one renal cyst and a ≥ 1-year follow-up renal imaging exam for cyst evaluation and/or diagnosis of ADPKD. Cysts with clear solid mass components were excluded. Results: 84 pediatric patients with renal cysts were identified (mean age, 9.5 years), including 76 patients with incidentally discovered cysts and 8 patients with cysts identified from screening for ADPKD family history. Among the incidentally discovered cyst group, 7.9% were found to have ADPKD compared with 100% of patients with cysts and ADPKD family history. Maximum cyst diameter was significantly increased in patients with ADPKD compared to patients without ADPKD (22.0 mm vs 12.7 mm; P < 0.001, Fisher’s Exact test). Multiple cysts or bilateral cysts were imaging features associated with a significantly higher (P < 0.01) incidence of ADPKD, both for the entire study population and the incidentally discovered cyst group. An increase in cyst size on the follow-up study was associated with higher incidence of ADPKD (P < 0.05). No malignancies were identified. Conclusions: Incidentally discovered renal cysts in pediatric patients are associated with a small but non-zero risk of ADPKD. Among cyst characteristics, bilaterality, multiplicity, large size, and increased size on follow-up imaging were associated with a statistically significant elevation of ADPKD risk, and should prompt diagnostic evaluation.","Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Gastroenterology, Urology"

These 3 animals were all captive-bred at Oasis Sea World (Chanthaburi, Thailand), and displayed similar macroscopic progressive cutaneous lesions diagnosed as squamous cell carcinomas. In 2 of the 3 animals, necropsy revealed a severe fibrinosuppurative tracheitis and pneumonia secondary to metastasis of a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma which extended from the head throughout the trunk and flippers. The tumors were characterized by coalescing botryoid masses with severe areas of cutaneous erosion, ulceration and necrohemorrhagic dermatitis. There was evidence of metastasis to the lungs and hilar lymph nodes. Necropsy of the third animal revealed similar progressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas but without evidence of metastasis. DNA molecular analysis of homogenized neoplastic tissue was conducted using polymerase chain reaction for both herpesvirus and papillomavirus in 2 of the 3 cases. In the first case, the tissues were positive for a herpesvirus alone, and this was phylogenetically classified as an alphaherpesvirus. This new herpesvirus has been tentatively named Sousa chinensis alphaherpesvirus. The second animal was negative for this novel herpesvirus and the third was not analyzed.

A Study of Influences of Social Network Awareness on MOOC Learner Behaviors: Case of Chulalongkorn University Free MOOC,"Cooharojananone N., Moolpun O., Pawong P., DIlokpabhapbhat J., Rimnong-Ang T., Choosuwan M., Bunram P., Pongnumkul S.",2019-10-01,"Amount of activities, Chulalongkorn University, Dropout awareness, Interaction activities, Learner behavior, MOOC, Network awareness, Online learning, Dropout awareness, Learner behavior, MOOC","In 2017, Chulalongkorn University has started an online learning platform providing many interesting courses by Chulalongkorn University lecturers that allows anyone to learn for free (Chula MOOC). However, each course is opened for certain period of time. If any courses are popular, they will be re-opened for the next batch. For each batch, a Facebook group is created to connect between learners and the instructor. However, we noticed that even in some popular courses, there are some learners who completed the course and some who did not complete the course. From this problem, we think that the data from each course Facebook group might give us some useful information related to the motivation behavior to finish the course. Therefore, in this work, we analyzed data from Facebook graph API from a popular course in three batches using statistics. Data consists of the amount of activities, instructor activities, learners' activities and instructor and learners' interaction activities. We also used some information from Chula MOOC platform. The result shows that the Facebook group is an area where students participate in the interaction, which has helped to motivate other learners in the group or who may not be interested to continue their learning or complete their learning. We also introduce that the chatbot could help to motivate the students to complete their course. For example, sending the messages to encourage others or asking students in the time that seem to be more dropout. Currently, we are developing the chatbot for checking the hypothesis further.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications"

Hematite (Fe2O3) is one of the most important iron ore used in steelmaking industries. Thus, we proposed this work for the development of algal biorefinery concept at commercial scale. This work contains two phases; in the first phase, the alga was successfully cultivated on the domestic wastewater at large scale using a low-cost photobioreactor, which provided significant biomass and lipid yield. To reduce the cost involved in biomass harvesting, an auto-flocculation technique was implemented and harvested 94.8% of biomass without adding any flocculants. The biodiesel extraction was performed in an ultrasonic bath with a frequency of 25 kHz using a tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous acid catalyst, which produced 94.1 wt% of biodiesel yield. The kinetic studies were investigated at various reaction temperature and confirmed that the reaction followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor for the transesterification reaction were found to be 45.3861 kJ mol−1 and 2.6956 min−1, respectively. In the second phase, the lipid extracted residue was converted to biochar through pyrolysis process, and the yield obtained was 41 wt%. The obtained biochar was utilized for metallic iron synthesis, and this reaction was carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the reduction behaviors was occurred in a stepwise manner rendering to the temperature and the metallic iron synthesis was found at 990 °C.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
A Modified Graph Representation for Room Layout Matching using Spectral Embedding,"Sa-Ngawong T., Cooharojananone N.",2019-10-01,"Computational time, Conventional methods, Floorplans, Graph matchings, Graph representation, Matching process, Spectral embedding, Topology graphs, floor plan, graph representation, spectral embedding","Graph matching is efficient to retrieve similar layout from the huge size of architectural layout. Since floor plan matching using spectral embedding is popular and its computational time is only in seconds. However, the weakness of this method is the isomorphism of each floor plan that reduces accuracy in the matching process. In this paper, we propose a modified graph representation for room layout matching using spectral embedding. General graph representations of the floor plan assume the node as rooms and the edge as the connection between rooms. In addition, the spectral embedding aims to find the descriptor of each floor plan by ignoring the semantic of rooms. We also consider both room semantic that is the connection between the area outside and inside the room, and the structure of each layout. Moreover, we mathematically proved that adding an extra node can handle the isomorphism of a graph by eigenvalue testing. Our proposed method consists of three processes: i) floor plan extracting, ii) appended topology graph and iii) floor plan matching. The performance from our experiment shows that our proposed method can increase the matched accuracy from the conventional method for about 35.44 percent.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Human-Computer Interaction, Information Systems and Management, Media Technology, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

Methods: We aimed to investigate the association between the genetic variants in the vitamin D metabolic pathway and the response to pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) therapy in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. One hundred seven patients treated with Peg-IFN for 48 weeks were selected from 13 specialty hospitals. Eight genotypes of vitamin D cascade genes, including CYP27B1 (rs10877012), DHCR7 (rs12785878), CYP2R1 (rs2060793, rs12794714) and GC (rs4588, rs7041, rs222020, rs2282679), were found. Results: Eighty-two patients (83.7%) were infected with HBV genotype C. Eight patients had compensated liver cirrhosis (8.7%). At 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation, 41 patients (42.3%) achieved sustained treatment response, 53 (55.2%) obtained HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/ml, 6 (5.6%) gained HBsAg seroclearance, 2 (1.9%) had HBsAg seroconversion and 69 (64.5%) exhibited alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization. Multivariate analysis revealed that baseline HBsAg level (OR =0.06, 95% CI: 0.08-0.49, p=0.008) and the GC rs222020 TT genotype (OR=17.72, 95% CI: 1.07-294.38, p=0.04) independently predicted sustained HBsAg seroclearance. In addition, this genotype was a predictor for normalization of ALT (OR=4.61, 95%CI: 1.59-13.40, p=0.005) after therapy. The HBsAg levels at baseline and during and post-treatment tended to be reduced with the GC rs222020 TT compared with the non-TT genotypes. The other studied polymorphisms were not associated with treatment response. Conclusions: The GC rs222020 TT genotype, which is a variant in the vitamin D-binding protein gene, could identify HBeAg-negative patients who have a high probability to achieve HBsAg clearance and ALT normalization after treatment with Peg-IFN.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Calcination and solvent extraction were employed to remove templates and compared. Through physical, chemical and functional characterization interesting results have been observed. Microstructures of the two MCFs were very different. Pore structure of the calcined MCF was found to be more ordered than that of the solvent extracted MCF. However, pores of the solvent extracted MCF seemed more defined and spongy under SEM observations. Surface functional groups and their concentrations characterized by ToF-SIMS were also found to be different. Surface silanol groups were found to be more concentrated in the calcined MCF. Each type of MCFs was subsequently grafted by an amine functional group, adsorbed by Au ion precursors, and reduced to form Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the MCF surfaces. These decorated MCF surfaces were immobilized with enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), modified on screen-printed carbon electrodes and tested for electrochemical responses with acetylthiocholine. AuNPs were successfully distributed within the pores for both types of MCFs. Before the functional biosensor electrochemical tests, calcination seemed more promising than solvent extraction due to periodic structure of pores, high surface area, less contamination and higher concentration of surface silanol groups available for grafting of the amine functional group. However, after immobilization of the AuNPs for electron transport improvement and enzyme immobilization, a few observations of biosensing performances were noteworthy. Firstly, having AuNPs distributed throughout the MCF structure did not help the electron transport. Results of reduced response currents from both types of MCFs compared to MCFs without AuNPs indicated that MCF walls were too thick to allow electron transport. Secondly, the higher concentration of surface silanol groups in calcined MCFs resulted in Ostwald’s ripening of small AuNPs giving bigger AuNPs than the case of solvent extraction. Therefore, although the AuNPs in enzyme biosensors are expected to help electron transport and enzyme immobilization, this study showed that although the former did not occur, the latter was well demonstrated. The smaller AuNPs in the solvent extraction case resulted in higher surface area than the bigger AuNPs in the calcination case. This was the reason why the response current was higher for the solvent extracted MCFs compared to the calcined MCFs.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

This leads to impossibility for victims and rescuers to communicate through the Internet. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and Moveable and Deployable Resource Unit (MDRU) are two popular solutions for recovery of the communication system. Based on the concept of wireless mesh network, the NerveNet is a disaster-resilient mesh-topology network which is strong against failures in disaster. Moreover, vehicles are considered as a key component in which MDRU can be deployed. In this paper, we propose a disaster-resilient communication framework for heterogeneous vehicular network (HetVNet). The proposed framework integrates NerveNet with the traditional network. We also show our implementation of the network switching algorithm for selecting either NerveNet or LTE for the HetVNet. The real experiments were conducted using the campus shuttle buses in Chulalongkorn University. The results show that the proposed framework can operate well in normal scenario, HetVNet scenario, and disaster scenario. Specifically, in the disaster situation where LTE network is not available, all of the data traffic is transferred via NerveNet. In the normal situation where NerveNet and LTE networks are available, the data traffic can be transferred over both of them.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

Firstly, the reactant mixtures were pre-heated by microwave radiation under five different microwave powers in the range of 400–1200 W for 1 min. Then, the pre-heated mixtures were further crystallized under hydrothermal condition at 160 °C for 24 h. HZSM-5 zeolites treated by microwave power at 800 and 1000 W had high crystallinity and surface area (407–412 m2/g) and were used to evaluate the catalytic performance. Non- and catalytic fast pyrolysis of Jatropha residues using HZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by microwave heating were investigated using an analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS at 500 °C with different biomass to catalyst ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. After catalytic process, HZSM-5 catalysts remarkably promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbon, especially BTX compounds. HZSM-5 treated by microwave at 800 W revealed high catalytic performance on upgrading of pyrolytic vapors resulting in the highest selectivity of aromatics, 94%, which are usually considered to be valuable products because of their high heating values. In addition, it decreased unfavorable oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds to 1.3% and 2.8%, respectively at moderate biomass to catalyst ratio of 1:5. HZSM-5 treated by microwave energy also exhibited superior performance in terms of aromatic selectivity (94%) compared to conventionally processed HZSM-5 (72%).

Under our assumption, it is not practical to train each video with all the extracted frames as input because it can cause building a huge model. Hence, we created a median filter layer for reducing the number of frames before training. In the experiment, we extracted 500 frame images from each video. In the reduction process with a median filter layer, we were able to reduce the number of frames from 500 frame images to 50 median images.

This study aims to explore proteomic profiles and discover potential biomarkers that can predict malignant transformation of hydatidiform mole. Methods: Retrospective analysis was done in 14 cases of remission hydatidiform mole and 14 cases of hydatidiform mole who later developed malignancy (GTN group). Molar tissues were retrieved from −70 °C frozen tissue. Subsequently, a large-scale proteomic analysis was performed to identify proteins and compare their abundance levels in the preserved molar tissues from these two groups using a dimethyl-labeling technique coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: A total of 2,153 proteins were identified from all samples. 22 and 10 proteins were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in the GTN group compared with the mole group. These altered proteins were found in several biological groups such as cell-cell adhesion, secreted proteins, and ribonucleoproteins. Several hormone-related proteins were among the most up-regulated proteins in the GTN group including choriogonadotropin subunit beta (β-hCG) and alpha (α-hCG), growth/differentiation factor 15, as well as both pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoproteins 2 and 3. In contrast, protein S100-A11 and L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain, were down-regulated in molar tissue from most patients in the GTN group.

Influence of the spatial variability of the root cohesion on a slope-scale stability model: a case study of residual soil slope in Thailand,"Nguyen T.S., Likitlersuang S., Jotisankasa A.",2019-07-01,"Bioengineering methods, Ecological approaches, Probabilistic analysis, Probabilistic framework, Random fields, Root cohesion, Seepage and stabilities, Slope stability analysis, Probabilistic analysis, Random field, Root cohesion, Slope stability, Vegetation","The bioengineering method using vegetation is an ecological approach for slope stabilisation. However, due to a large variability of vegetation root patterns, a precise quantification of root reinforcement is relatively difficult, leading to a reluctance to use such a technique in practice. This paper presents a probabilistic framework for slope stability analysis considering the spatial variability of root reinforcement. A residual soil slope under a heavy rainfall event was used to model the seepage and stability analysis. The effect of root reinforcement was considered through an additional soil shear strength or root cohesion. Typical characteristics of the root reinforcement of vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides) in Thailand were assumed in the analysis. A probabilistic analysis was performed considering both stationary and non-stationary random fields of root cohesion. The results indicated that the failure of the vegetated slope could occur when the variance coefficient of the root cohesion was more than a critical value (a critical cov = 0.45 for the uniformly distributed root cohesion case and a critical cov = 0.32 for the case of linear decrease of root cohesion in this particular slope). In practice, the efficiency of the bioengineering method can be improved by controlling the variation of root cohesion within such limits.",earth sciences,"Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"
Opioid-Sparing Analgesia and Enhanced Recovery After Total Knee Arthroplasty Using Combined Triple Nerve Blocks With Local Infiltration Analgesia,"Kampitak W., Tanavalee A., Ngarmukos S., Amarase C.",2019-02-01,"Aged, Analgesia, Analgesics, Opioid, Anesthesia, Spinal, Anesthetics, Local, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Humans, Length of Stay, Male, Middle Aged, Morphine, Muscle Strength, Nerve Block, Pain Management, Pain, Postoperative, Postural Balance, Prospective Studies, Range of Motion, Articular, Recovery of Function, Time and Motion Studies, continuous adductor canal block, local infiltration analgesia, obturator nerve block, tibial nerve block, total knee arthroplasty, ultrasound guidance","Background: Peripheral nerve block and local infiltration analgesia (LIA) have an increasing role as part of multimodal analgesia for enhanced recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesized that the combination of obturator nerve block (ONB) and tibial nerve block (TNB) would reduce pain and opioid consumption more than ONB or TNB alone when combined with continuous adductor canal block and LIA. Methods: Ninety patients were recruited into the study and received spinal anesthesia, LIA, and continuous adductor canal block. They were further randomized to receive either an ONB (group 1), a TNB (group 2), or both (group 3). The primary outcome was total morphine consumption over the postoperative 24 hours. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale scores, time to first and total dosage of rescue analgesia, Timed Up and Go test, range of motion, muscle strength test, hospital stay, and patient satisfaction. Results: Eighty-nine patients completed analysis. The median total morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours was 2 mg (interquartile range [IQR] 0-4) in group 3, 4 mg (IQR 2-8) in group 2, and 6 mg (IQR 6-14) in group 1 (P <.001). Posterior knee pain during the first 24 hours postoperatively was significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1 (P =.006). The ability to ambulate and quadriceps strength were significantly better in group 3 than in the other groups. Conclusion: The combination of triple nerve block was superior to double nerve block in improving analgesia and functional outcomes in the immediate postoperative period after total knee arthroplasty, when combined with LIA.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine
Development and characterization of graphitic carbon nitride as nonblack filler in natural rubber composites,"Bansod N.D., Roy K., Das C., Vidyasagar D., Potiyaraj P.",2019-11-10,"Elastomeric composite, Filler interaction, Graphitic carbon nitrides, Hydrogen bonding interactions, Natural rubber composites, Reinforcing effects, Rubber composite, Swelling studies, graphitic carbon nitride, mechanical properties, rubber composites, rubber–filler interaction","A new type of elastomeric composite containing natural rubber (NR) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been successfully prepared with the reinforced property. The reinforcing effect of g-C3N4 in NR composites was examined by cure, mechanical, morphological, and swelling studies. Besides, epoxidized NR with 50-mol % epoxy level (ENR-50) was used as a compatibilizer to enhance the hydrophilic g-C3N4 filler capacity for hydrophobic NR composites. At the same filler load level, the mechanical properties of NR/g-C3N4 composites, such as tensile strength and tensile modulus, were consistently increased with increased ENR-50 content. To note, the ENR compatibilized composites have shown better-reinforced performance, which has been attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions between the uncondensed amine groups in g-C3N4 and the polar groups in ENR. We believe that these newly prepared NR composites based on g-C3N4 as nonblack filler and ENR-50 as compatibilizer can find potential applications in modern day rubber research. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Potential P-glycoprotein-mediated herb-drug interaction of phyllanthin at the intestinal absorptive barrier,"Dunkoksung W., Vardhanabhuti N., Jianmongkol S.",2019-02-01,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1, Biological Transport, Caco-2 Cells, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Herb-Drug Interactions, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intestinal Absorption, Isoquinolines, Lignans, Permeability, Rhodamine 123, Solubility, Caco-2 cells, drug-herb interaction, P-glycoprotein, permeability, phyllanthin","Objectives: This study investigated the absorptive potential of phyllanthin across the polarized Caco-2 monolayers and the potential role of phyllanthin in P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug interaction. Methods: The absorptive potential of phyllanthin was predicted from its apparent permeability (P app ) across the Caco-2 monolayers under the pH gradient condition (pH 6.5 AP –7.4 BL ) at 37°C. Integrity of paracellular transport was assessed by monitoring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow (LY) leakage. P-gp-mediated interaction was evaluated by transport studies of phyllanthin and rhodamine-123. Key findings: The absorptive P app of phyllanthin (34.90 ± 1.18 × 10 −6 cm/s) was in the same rank order as the high permeable theophylline and antipyrine. Phyllanthin transport in the absorptive and secretive directions was comparable (the efflux ratio (ER) of 1.19 ± 0.01). Phyllanthin caused no changes in TEER nor LY leakage in the monolayers. However, phyllanthin increased rhodamine-123 ER in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting its inhibition on P-gp function. In addition, phyllanthin aqueous solubility was <5 μg/ml at 37°C. Conclusions: Phyllanthin is a highly permeable compound that could passively diffuse through the absorptive barrier via transcellular pathway with little hindrance from P-gp. Phyllanthin could interfere with transport of P-gp drug substrates, when concomitantly administered. In addition, aqueous solubility could be a limiting factor in phyllanthin absorption.","genergyal, pharmacology","Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science"

Methods: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled trial study included 48 patients who underwent SBTKA and received PMDI mixture, either before prosthetic implantation (late PMDI), or just after knee arthrotomy (early PMDI). Each subject's knees were randomly selected to different PMDI administration time points. The outcome parameters were postoperative pain assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS), the maximal angle of knee flexion, and quadriceps function from day 1 to 6 weeks after surgery. Results: Late PMDI revealed slightly higher VAS at 6 and 12 h after the operation than early PMDI administration. Afterward, the VAS tended to be lower in the late than early PMDI administration until the end of the study, but without statistical significance. The time difference between early and late PMDI had no effect on postoperative VAS, while older age resulted in significantly less pain. No statistical differences between the two groups in all other outcome parameters were observed. Conclusions: Postoperative pain reduction and functional recovery of SBTKA with early and late PMDI administration were not significantly different. The time interval of PMDI between knees did not confound the comparison of postoperative pain and functional recovery in SBTKA.

From soil moisture field monitored at four depths, Hydrus-1D was applied to simulate water movement with soil hydraulic parameter estimates using field data for calibration. To understand deep percolation characteristics, rainfall, irrigation water and evaporation (called effective infiltration) inputs were monitored and used to simulate the effect of the pronounced climatic gradient (precipitation) and soil depths variability on percolation fluxes and applied the calibrated model. The effective infiltration and percolation at 2m depth is applied to detect the deep percolation changes and are described in the wetting and drying stages of soil. The study found that the effect of evaporation makes different percolation characteristics at shallower (1 m) and deeper (2 m) of soil layers. The daily maximum deep percolation (at 2 m) is 4.43 cm/ day when the soil moisture is saturated at 39%. The average rate of percolation (at 2 m) in the study period is 0.52 cm/day from the total input of effective infiltration. The percolation rate increased in soil with higher effective infiltration rate, deeper water table, soil moisture value in the subsoil (between saturation and field capacity). The ratio of total deep percolation and effective infiltration is 0.19 and the total deep percolation is 0.42 of rainfall plus irrigation in the rainy season. This study provided the understandings of deep percolation characteristics, its percolation rate and overall water balance of deep percolation system by using Hydrus-1D model with calibrated data from soil moisture sensors in the field.","water engineeringneering, soil water, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

In real-life practice, cholecystectomy is frequently deferred due to various reasons and delayed cholecystectomy (DC) is performed instead. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is an alternative to prevent recurrent pancreatitis, however other gallstone-related complications (GCs) may still develop. We aimed to determine the impact of ES on future GCs in patients with non-severe acute biliary pancreatitis whose cholecystectomy was deferred or not performed. Methods: During 2006–2016, we included patients with non-severe ABP while those with severe pancreatitis and concurrent cholangitis were excluded. GC events were compared between those who had DC with ES and those who had DC without ES. A similar comparison was made in patients with and without ES who did not receive cholecystectomy. Results: Of 266 patients with ABP, non-severe ABP was identified in 146. Only 16 (11%) had EC. Of patients with non-severe ABP who underwent DC (n = 88), recurrent ABP in the ES group was lower than those from the non-ES group (2% vs. 17%; p = 0.01). Acute cholecystitis was found in 0%, 6% and 10% of patients with EC, DC and those without cholecystectomy (p = 0.39). Of those who did not undergo cholecystectomy (n = 42), recurrent ABP in the ES group was still lower than the non-ES group (4% vs. 36%; p = 0.006).

There are two general categories of disease-associated antibodies that can be tested for: neuronal surface and intracellular. However, testing both groups of autoantibodies are costly. This study aims to identify differences between groups by comparing clinical presentations, radiological findings and CSF profile of patients, and determine if any parameters are indicative of one group of autoantibodies over another. Additionally, we aim to report the local incidence of less common groups of disease-associated antibodies as well. Methods: Seventy-seven records of autoimmune encephalitis/encephalomyelitis patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 2010 and February 2017 were reviewed. Patients with infections or those with classic central nervous system demyelinating features were excluded. Results: Of 77 patients, 40% presented with neuronal surface antibodies and 33% had intracellular antibodies. The most common autoantibody detected in each group was anti-NMDAr antibody (25/31, 81%) and anti-Ri antibody (7/25, 28%) respectively. In the neuronal surface antibody group, behavioral change was the most common complaint (45%), followed by seizures (39%) and abnormal movements (29%). In the latter group, seizure was the most common presenting symptom (32%), followed by motor weakness (20%), behavioural change (16%) and abnormal movements (16%). Patients with neuronal surface antibodies were younger (35 vs 48 years old, p = 0.04) and more likely to present with behavioral change (45% vs 16%, p = 0.02). Mortality rate was higher in the intracellular group (16% vs 3.2%, p = 0.09). No differences were detected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF profile. Conclusions: In the early stages of the disease, both groups have comparable clinical outcomes. Although there were significant differences in age and percentage of patients with behavioral change, both groups of autoimmune encephalitis still shared many clinical features and could not be distinguished based on MRI and CSF profiles. Therefore, we recommend that patients with features of autoimmune encephalitis should be screened for both the neuronal surface and intracellular antibodies regardless of clinical presentation.",medical,Neurology (clinical)

Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin is associated with stem-like phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process which confers resistance to endocrine therapy. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) can be a vital source of proangiogenic factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) which drives angiogenesis and leads to tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, targeting Wnt and FGF2 may provide effective treatment for endocrine resistant breast cancer. Our previous in vitro study reported that plumbagin (PLB) was a potent anticancer agent and was able to inhibit EMT in endocrine-resistant cells. This study aimed to further investigate the inhibitory effects of PLB on cancer stem-like phenotypes, tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. The results demonstrated Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated and was able to form mammospheres with increased cancer stem cell markers (ALDH1, NANOG, and OCT4) in endocrine-resistant cells. PLB significantly inhibited colony-forming, mammosphere formation and decreased cancer stem cell markers. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation and invasion were mediated by Wnt signaling pathway. PLB also significantly reduced Wnt responsive genes and β-catenin. Moreover, PLB treatment at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis without any adverse effects on body weight and blood coagulation in orthotopic xenograft nude mice. In conclusion, PLB exerted anti-cancer activity and eliminated stem-like properties by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and FGF2 expression. These findings suggest that PLB could be a promising agent to treat endocrine resistant breast cancer.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Importantly, rabies is one of the few pathogens for which there is no treatment following the onset of clinical disease with the outcome of infection being death in almost 100% of cases. Whilst vaccination, and the combination of vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin treatment for post-exposure administration are available, no tools have been identified that can reduce or prevent rabies virus replication once clinical disease has initiated. The search for effective antiviral molecules to treat those that have already developed clinical disease associated with rabies virus infection is considered one of the most important goals in rabies research. The current study assesses a single chain antibody molecule (ScFv) based on a monoclonal antibody that potently neutralises rabies in vitro as a potential therapeutic candidate. The recombinant ScFv was generated in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression, and was chemically conjugated (ScFv/RVG) to a 29 amino acid peptide, specific for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) binding in the CNS. This conjugated molecule was able to bind nAchR in vitro and enter neuronal cells more efficiently than ScFv. The ability of the ScFv/RVG to neutralise virus in vivo was assessed using a staggered administration where the molecule was inoculated either four hours before, two days after or four days after infection. The ScFv/RVG conjugate was evaluated in direct comparison with HRIG and a potential antiviral molecule, Favipiravir (also known as T-705) to indicate whether there was greater bioavailability of the ScFv in the brains of treated mice. The study indicated that the approach taken with the ScFv/RVG conjugate may have utility in the design and implementation of novel tools targetting rabies virus infection in the brain.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Since the initial epidemic of predominantly EV-A71 in California in 1969, the high prevalence of HFMD in the Asia-pacific region and elsewhere around the world represents a significant morbidity in this age group. With the advent of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed EV-A71 infection over the past two decades. The population, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity among countries in the Asia-Pacific region all influence the transmission and morbidity associated with HFMD. This review summarizes the current state of epidemiology of EV-A71 in Asia-Pacific countries based on the most recent epidemiological data and available information on the prevalence and disease burden. This knowledge is important in guiding the prevention, control and future research on vaccine development of this highly contagious disease of significant socioeconomic implications in public health.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Molecular Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

Among battery components, separators play a crucial role in the commercial realization of rechargeable zinc–air batteries, especially from the viewpoint of preventing zincate (Zn(OH)4 2−) ion crossover from the zinc anode to the air cathode. In this study, a new hydroxide exchange membrane for zinc–air batteries was synthesized using poly (2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) as the base polymer. PPO was quaternized using three tertiary amines, including trimethylamine (TMA), 1-methylpyrolidine (MPY), and 1-methylimidazole (MIM), and casted into separator films. The successful synthesis process was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, while their thermal stability was examined using thermogravimetric analysis. Besides, their water/electrolyte absorption capacity and dimensional change, induced by the electrolyte uptake, were studied. Ionic conductivity of PPO–TMA, PPO–MPY, and PPO–MIM was determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to be 0.17, 0.16, and 0.003 mS/cm, respectively. Zincate crossover evaluation tests revealed very low zincate diffusion coefficient of 1.13 × 10−8, and 0.28 × 10−8 cm2/min for PPO–TMA, and PPO–MPY, respectively. Moreover, galvanostatic discharge performance of the primary batteries assembled using PPO–TMA and PPO–MPY as initial battery tests showed a high specific discharge capacity and specific power of ~800 mAh/gZn and 1000 mWh/gZn, respectively. Low zincate crossover and high discharge capacity of these separator membranes makes them potential materials to be used in zinc–air batteries.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Amperometric Detection of the Urinary Disease Biomarker p-HPA by Allosteric Modulation of a Redox Polymer-Embedded Bacterial Reductase,"Teanphonkrang S., Ernst A., Janke S., Chaiyen P., Sucharitakul J., Suginta W., Khunkaewla P., Schuhmann W., Schulte A., Ruff A.",2019-05-24,"Allosteric modulation, Biosensing, Disease biomarker, Mediated electron transfer, NADH oxidation, para-hydroxyphenylacetate, Redox polymers, Allosteric Regulation, Bacteria, Biomarkers, Biosensing Techniques, Electrochemistry, Enzymes, Immobilized, Humans, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidoreductases, Phenylacetates, allosteric modulation, amperometric biosensing, enzyme electrodes, mediated electron transfer, NADH oxidation, para-hydroxyphenylacetate, redox polymers, urinary disease biomarker","We report an amperometric biosensor for the urinary disease biomarker para-hydroxyphenylacetate (p-HPA) in which the allosteric reductase component of a bacterial hydroxylase, C1-hpah, is electrically wired to glassy carbon electrodes through incorporation into a low-potential Os-complex modified redox polymer. The proposed biosensing strategy depends on allosteric modulation of C1-hpah by the binding of the enzyme activator and analyte p-HPA, stimulating oxidation of the cofactor NADH. The pronounced concentration-dependence of allosteric C1-hpah modulation in the presence of a constant concentration of NADH allowed sensitive quantification of the target, p-HPA. The specific design of the immobilizing redox polymer with suitably low working potential allowed biosensor operation without the risk of co-oxidation of potentially interfering substances, such as uric acid or ascorbic acid. Optimized sensors were successfully applied for p-HPA determination in artificial urine, with good recovery rates and reproducibility and sub-micromolar detection limits. The proposed application of the allosteric enzyme C1-hpah for p-HPA trace electroanalysis is the first successful example of simple amperometric redox enzyme/redox polymer biosensing in which the analyte acts as an effector, modulating the activity of an immobilized biocatalyst. A general adVantage of the concept of allosterically modulated biosensing is its ability to broaden the range of approachable analytes, through the move from substrate to effector detection.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, physics","Bioengineering, Instrumentation, Process Chemistry and Technology, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

Nearest Neighbor (NN) with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is regarded as one of the most effective and popular method used for a time series classification problem. Being a non-linear-alignment distance measure, DTW is known to function harmoniously with NN classifier as an effective tool in matching two time series sequences. However, despite the fact that DTW is specifically designed to discover an optimal alignment, it may not be able to achieve sensible local alignment. In this work, the shapeDTW framework was adopted in order to classify time series data based on the state-of-the-art HOG1D shape descriptor. Point-wise local structures were utilized in the alignment process; similarly-shaped structures are matched based on their levels of similarity. A generic alignment framework was provided by shapeDTW, which allows users to design the shape descriptors based on the data characteristics and domains. An enhanced shape descriptor representation called HOG1D-L was proposed based on two key concepts of the state-of-the-art HOG1D descriptor and linear regression. The proposed work on 84 UCR time series datasets was extensively tested and the results demonstrate that our approach can maintain or achieve better classification accuracy in most of the datasets.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of preemptive progestin treatment on the quality of ovarian responses after exogenous gonadotropin stimulation in cheetahs. Adult females received either 1) 200 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) followed with 3,000 IU porcine luteinizing hormone (pLH) (intramuscular route) (n = 5; control group) or 2) similar eCG/pLH administration preceded by a 7-day treatment with oral progestin (0.1 mg/kg altrenogest; ALT group; n = 7). At 42 h post-pLH administration, a series of metrics was assessed via laparoscopy (number of follicles ≥ 2 mm, number of corpora lutea, oviduct and uterine cornua diameter and overall vascularization). Concentrations of fecal estradiol, progesterone and glucocorticoid metabolites (FEM, FPM, and FGM, respectively) were measured by enzyme immunoassay for 3 wk before ALT treatment (Period 1), 7 d during ovarian suppression period (Period 2), throughout eCG/LH treatment and laparoscopy (Period 3), and 6 wk following laparoscopy (Period 4). Overall, nine out of 12 cheetahs (4/5 in control and 5/7 ALT group) had freshly-formed corpora lutea at the time of laparoscopy. Mean follicle and corpora lutea numbers in the control versus ALT group were not different (P > 0.05). Overall measurements and vascularization scores also did not differ (P > 0.05) among groups. FEM average concentrations increased (P ≤ 0.05) in response to eCG for the ALT-treated females between Periods 2 and 3 and were sustained during Period 4. However, FEM average concentrations did not vary (P > 0.05) for control females throughout Periods 1–4. Post-ovulatory FPM average concentrations (Period 4) did not differ (P > 0.05) between the ALT-treated females and controls. FPM average concentration from both groups increased in Period 4 compared to Periods 1–3 (P ≤ 0.05). Females receiving the ALT treatment also had lower (P ≤ 0.05) FGM metabolite average concentrations than control females during ovarian suppression (suggesting adrenal suppression). Collective results suggest that ovarian response to gonadotropin treatment in the cheetah was improved following oral progestin administration due to the normative increase in estradiol following stimulation for these females compared with control. This treatment should lead to more effective timed assisted reproduction procedures for this species.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

The present work reports a simple but efficient approach to tune the mesostructure and hydrophobicity of natural rubber (NR)/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) nanocomposites synthesized via the in situ sol-gel technique in the presence of different primary amines (CnH2n+1NH2, n = 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16) as structural templating agents. The change in the mesostructure ordering and textural properties of the NR/HMS nanocomposites with different template sizes was similar to that for the pure silica HMS series. Powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed an expansion of the hexagonal unit cell and channel wall thickness of the nanocomposites due to the incorporated rubber molecules. Using amine templates with longer alkyl chains provided NR/HMS materials with a higher NR content at 13.7–15.6 wt% but decreased the rubber phase dispersion and hydrophobic properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the amount of NR exposed at the composite's surface was 7.99–9.48 wt%, while the remaining NR was incorporated into the mesostructured silicate framework and/or entrapped in the mesopores. The hydrophobic interaction between the NR molecules and the alkyl chains of primary amine template was probably a crucial factor that determined the rubber phase dispersion, and so the hydrophobic character, in the NR/HMS nanocomposites.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cell proliferation was quantified by ATP and DNA content analysis and Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays. Cell migration assay was determined using the scratch wound healing test. Spheroid formation was evaluated and the expression level of stem cell markers was investigated by western blot analysis. The results showed that AC 1 at the concentration of 100 µg/mL could stimulate HaCaT cell proliferation, migration, spheroid formation, and the expression level of stem cell markers (keratin 19, β-catenin, ALDH1A1) compared to the control. In conclusion, a smaller molecular weight of abalone collagen extract exhibits a better effect on keratinocytes proliferation, migration, and stemness, which could be a potential active ingredient in cosmeceutical products.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

Life-cycle cost (LCC) is an effective economic evaluation tool that provides a detailed account for all costs related to constructing, operating, maintaining, and disposing a construction project over a defined period of time. Awareness of better value of money throughout the LCC is beyond the initial price. Governments and Contracting authorities add the LCC as a key provision in the context of National Codes and Council Directives to promote the growth of sustainability concept. Current LCC analytical methods are costly, laborious, and time-consuming due to the difficulties of obtaining information and implementing many single LCC analyses for all building elements, which may be attributed to the inaccuracy of results. Building information modeling (BIM) is a modern technology that can potentially overcome the asperities that obstruct practical LCC implementation. This paper develops a new automated system for performing LCC analyses for new building projects by integrating BIM authoring programming with visual programming. The proposed system consists of two main modules. The BIM module is designed to retrieve 3D geometric and physical parameters of building element types. The life-cycle cost calculation module can perform automatic estimating and report results. This system provides an economic evaluation tool for the owner to manage the total life-cycle budget of their projects.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction"

A conventional precipitation is compared to an ultrasonic-assisted precipitation at each precipitating temperature. Methanol is directly synthesized from CO2 and H2 (1:3 mol ratio) through an alcohol-assisted reaction (423 K, 5 MPa, 24 h) by using different alcohols (ethanol, propanol and butanol) as a medium. There are two parts for the challenge of this research, including the preparation of CuO/ZnO catalysts using an ultrasonic-assisted precipitation and, methanol synthesis through an alcohol-assisted method. It is found that the precipitation temperature and pH value significantly affect the catalyst properties and the reaction activity. An ultrasonic irradiation helps facilitate the crystalline phase formation and decrease precipitation temperature. The highest yield of methanol is obtained when CuO/ZnO is precipitated at 333 K from the conventional precipitation (31%) while it is at 313 K from the ultrasonic-assisted precipitation (32%). In addition, the different type of alcohol strongly affects methanol yield and CO2 conversion. The use of larger alcohol molecules offers higher CO2 conversion but lower methanol yield.","energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This study assessed the occurrence of, risk factors for, and outcomes of hematological and nonhematological malignancies in PLHIV in Asia.Methods:Incidence of malignancy after cohort enrollment was evaluated. Factors associated with development of hematological and nonhematological malignancy were analyzed using competing risk regression and survival time using Kaplan-Meier.Results:Of 7455 patients, 107 patients (1%) developed a malignancy: 34 (0.5%) hematological [0.08 per 100 person-years (/100PY)] and 73 (1%) nonhematological (0.17/100PY). Of the hematological malignancies, non-Hodgkin lymphoma was predominant (n = 26, 76%): immunoblastic (n = 6, 18%), Burkitt (n = 5, 15%), diffuse large B-cell (n = 5, 15%), and unspecified (n = 10, 30%). Others include central nervous system lymphoma (n = 7, 21%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1, 3%). Nonhematological malignancies were mostly Kaposi sarcoma (n = 12, 16%) and cervical cancer (n = 10, 14%). Risk factors for hematological malignancy included age >50 vs. ≤30 years [subhazard ratio (SHR) = 6.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.79 to 23.43] and being from a high-income vs. a lower-middle-income country (SHR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.45 to 10.84). Risk was reduced with CD4 351-500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.74) and CD4 >500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.78), compared to CD4 ≤200 cells/μL. Similar risk factors were seen for nonhematological malignancy, with prior AIDS diagnosis showing a weak association. Patients diagnosed with a hematological malignancy had shorter survival time compared to patients diagnosed with a nonhematological malignancy.Conclusions:Nonhematological malignancies were common but non-Hodgkin lymphoma was more predominant in our cohort. PLHIV from high-income countries were more likely to be diagnosed, indicating a potential underdiagnosis of cancer in low-income settings.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

The modified poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) flat sheet membrane was coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2). The chemical and physical changes of membranes were characterized by contact angle, scanning electron microscopy and porosity. The results found that TiO2 successfully modified the PVDF membrane by decreasing the contact angle from 127.1 to 114.3 on increasing the TiO2 concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 g/L. The contact angles were decreased with the increase of coating time. The water permeation after PVDF membrane modification decreased compared with the original membrane, whereas water fluxes increased with the increase of TiO2 concentration. TiO2 particles were observed on the membrane surface while the porosity of the membrane coated with TiO2 decreased. The optimum condition of membrane coating was obtained at 1.0 g/L of TiO2 and 60 min of coating time. The decolorization of RB 19 by photolysis and photolysis followed by filtration was less than 10%; in contrast, the decolorization of RB 19 by photocatalytic oxidation was as good as a photocatalytic membrane for 60 min. The TiO2 photocatalytic membrane is a feasible technology for RB 19 decolorization in wastewater.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; chemistryical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology"

The treatment efficacy using the Cu electrode was compared with that of the tungsten (W) electrode. The high erosion-resistant W electrode provided no W nanoparticles, while the low erosion-resistant Cu electrode yielded incidental nanoparticles (10-20 nm), hypothesized to catalyze the MB degradation during the SPP. The percentage of MB degradation and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation were determined by an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The results showed that, after the SPP by the Cu electrode for 60 minutes, the MB was degraded up to 96%. Using the Cu electrode at a high plasma frequency strongly accelerated the Cu nanoparticle generation and MB treatment, although the amount of H2O2 generated during the SPP using the Cu electrode was less than that of the W electrode.

The mechanisms by which these associations take place are detailed. The two sets of consequences are themselves strongly associated, with the first set likely contributing to the second. Mechanisms enabling bidirectional communication between the immune system and the brain are described, including complex signalling pathways facilitated by factors at the level of immune cells. Also detailed are mechanisms underpinning the association between SED, ACE and the genesis of peripheral inflammation, including epigenetic changes to immune system-related gene expression. The duration and magnitude of inflammatory responses can be influenced by genetic factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, and by epigenetic factors, whereby pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species and nuclear factor-κB affect gene DNA methylation and histone acetylation and also induce several microRNAs including miR-155, miR-181b-1 and miR-146a. Adult HPA axis activity is regulated by (i) genetic factors, such as glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms; (ii) epigenetic factors affecting glucocorticoid receptor function or expression, including the methylation status of alternative promoter regions of NR3C1 and the methylation of FKBP5 and HSD11β2; (iii) chronic inflammation and chronic nitrosative and oxidative stress.

Prosumers are electricity consumers who produce electricity for their own consumption, using distributed energy technologies including distributed solar photovoltaics (DPVs). Many jurisdictions around the world are adjusting to this changing energy landscape by reforming their policies to support self-production and self-consumption of electricity. This paper analyzes the economics of electricity self-consumption of DPV electricity in Thailand. Based on our study, we assess the feasibility of DPV self-consumption schemes for four customer groups. Among the three schemes assessed, (no compensation for excess electricity, net metering, and net billing), all customer classes are profitable and net metering offers the most customer benefits. However, we recommend net billing for policy adoption, not only because of its sufficient level of economic viability but also its flexibility in addressing broad stakeholders’ concerns. Our analytical approach captures in detail how DPV sizing relative to the load may be impacted by those compensation mechanisms. Our methodology can be replicated by countries that would like to develop or reform their national-level DPV self-consumption policies during an energy transition.","solar power, petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; solar, fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

However, single cell analysis (SCA) has been used as a practical means to overcome this drawback. Many contemporary methodologies are available for single cell analysis; among these, microfluidics is the most attractive and effective technology, due to its advantages of low-volume specimen consumption, label-free evaluation, and real-time monitoring, among others. In this paper, a conceptual application for microfluidic single cell analysis for veterinary research is presented. A microfluidic device is fabricated with an elastomer substrate, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), under standard soft lithography. The performance of the microdevice is high-throughput, sensitive, and user-friendly. A total of 53.1% of the triangular microwells were able to trap single canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (MCT) cells. Of these, 38.82% were single cell entrapments, while 14.34% were multiple cell entrapments. The ratio of single-to-multiple cell trapping was high, at 2.7:1. In addition, 80.5% of the trapped cells were viable, indicating that the system was non-lethal. OCT4A-immunofluorescence combined with the proposed system can assess OCT4A expression in trapped single cells more precisely than OCT4A-immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the results suggest that microfluidic single cell analysis could potentially reduce the impact of cellular heterogeneity.","process equipment, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

A semi-continuous process, with four extraction column reactors and peristaltic pumps, was used for extracting antioxidants from wet SCGs with methanol as solvent. Subsequently, potassium methoxide was fed into the reactors containing SCGs residue remaining after antioxidant extraction to produce biodiesel via in-situ transesterification. The defatted SCGs obtained after biodiesel production was further transformed to bio-char via slow pyrolysis. Antioxidant compounds with phenolic content of 10.3 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dried SCGs and antioxidant activity of 48.8 mg butylated hydroxyanisole equivalents/g dried SCGs could be extracted. Moreover, free fatty acid and moisture contents were reduced to levels suitable for in-situ transesterification. A biodiesel yield of 131.1 mg biodiesel/g dried SCGs was achieved, which was exceeded the maximum yield based on calculation. The bio-char produced from defatted SCGs had a heating value of 26.0 kJ/g and was smokeless, which satisfies the Thai community product standard (Per 238/2547).

The system is designed using an STM32 microcontroller and humidity sensor to check soil moisture. STM 32 microcontroller will process the information that is delivered by sensor by giving a limitation range on a certain value between <3000 and >3000. If the sensor reads is <3000 then STM 32 sends the signal to the servomotor which then servomotor will move to 0° position and if the result is >3000 then STM 32 will send a signal to the servomotor to move to 180 ° position. From the test results it is proven that the system can work well automatically with a success rate of around 90%.","fluidex; related topics, physics, computer science, energy, engineering","Instrumentation, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The power saving system is done by using motion detection and illuminance sensor to measure the traffic congestion and illumination level. Every street light has been equipped with LoRaWAN communication modules that sends and receives data with the main server to control LED street light which has illuminance level calculated by DIALux. When autonomously controlling street lighting system, the server system decides which street light should be dimmed according to motion sensors. If no vehicle passes the area for adjusted amount of time, the street light will dim. If any of the vehicle passes the area, the closest street to that area will raise the illumination level to normal level.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization"

One factor that causes uncertainties in diagnostic is the inexperience of physicians. The diagnosis errors lead to incorrect and delay in treatment, waste of time and money. To solve the problem, a differential diagnosis is a critical tool. It is powerful and does not introduce additional work to physician. Our method applied a deep learning tool together with word embedding from existing diagnosis texts in medical system. The model takes the clinical notes from a physician. The note is then used to analyze the possibilities of diseases. The output is sorted by model confidence. We validate our model with True Positive Rate (Recall), False Positive Rate (Precision) and accuracy. Our model achieves a new record of accuracy at 99.95% The highest recall rate is at 86.64% in top first prediction.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Materials and methods: Sites with single edentulous spaces and neighbouring natural teeth were randomized into static CAIS or freehand implant surgery groups. In both groups, digital implant planning was performed using data from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and surface scans. In the static CAIS group, a surgical guide was produced and used for fully guided implant surgery, while in the freehand group, the implants were placed in a freehand manner. Postoperative CBCT was used for nine measurements representing the deviations in angles, implant shoulders and apexes between planned and actual implant positions. Results: Fifty-two patients received 60 single implants. The median (IQR) deviations in angles, shoulders and apexes were 2.8 (2.6)°, 0.9 (0.8) mm and 1.2 (0.9) mm, respectively, in the static CAIS group, and 7.0 (7.0)°, 1.3 (0.7) mm and 2.2 (1.2) mm, respectively, in the freehand group. Statistically significant differences were found in 6 out of nine measured parameters using Mann–Whitney U test (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Static CAIS provided more accuracy in implant positions than freehand placement in a single edentulous space.",dentistry,Periodontics

During this period, massive transfusion might be required for ongoing bleeding and coagulopathy. This research aimed to identify predictors of massive blood transfusion in the surgical intensive care units (SICUs). Methods: This is an analysis of the THAI-SICU study which was a prospective cohort that was done in the 9-university-based SICUs in Thailand. The study included only patients admitted due to trauma mechanisms. Massive transfusion was defined as received ≥10 units of packed red blood cells on the first day of admission. Patient characteristics and physiologic data were analyzed to identify the potential factors. A multivariable regression was then performed to identify the significant model. Results: Three hundred and seventy patients were enrolled. Sixteen patients (5%) received massive transfusion in the SICUs. The factors that significantly predicted massive transfusion were an initial sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) ≥9 (risk difference (RD) 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03–0.22, p = 0.01); intra-operative blood loss ≥ 4900 mL (RD 0.33, 95% CI: 0.04–0.62, p = 0.02) and intra-operative blood transfusion ≥ 10 units (RD 0.45, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.84, p = 0.02). The probability to have massive transfusion was 0.976 in patients who had these 3 factors. Conclusion: Massive blood transfusion in the SICUs occurred in 5%.

However, customers also need a comprehensive understanding of system design configuration and the related energy return from the system in order to support their PV investment. In this study, the rooftop PV systems from many high-volume installed PV systems countries and regions were collected to evaluate the lifetime energy yield of these systems based on machine learning techniques. Then, we obtained an association between the lifetime energy yield and technical configuration details of PV such as rated solar panel power, number of panels, rated inverter power, and number of inverters. Our findings reveal that the variability of PV lifetime energy is partly explained by the difference in PV system configuration. Indeed, our machine learning model can explain approximately 31% (95% confidence interval: 29-38%) of the variant energy efficiency of the PV system, given the configuration and components of the PV system. Our study has contributed useful knowledge to support the planning and design of a rooftop PV system such as PV financial modeling and PV investment decision.","petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; solar, fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The aims of this study were to use clinical and biomarker data to construct statistically derived staging models, which are associated with early lifetime traumata (ELTs), affective phenomenology, and biomarkers. In the current study, 172 subjects participated, 105 with affective disorders (both bipolar and unipolar) and 67 controls. Staging scores were computed by extracting latent vectors (LVs) from clinical data including ELTs, recurring flare ups and suicidal behaviors, outcome data such as disabilities and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and paraoxonase (PON)1 actvities and nitro-oxidative stress biomarkers. Recurrence of episodes and suicidal behaviors could reliably be combined into a LV with adequate composite reliability (the “recurrence LV”), which was associated with female sex, the combined effects of multiple ELTs, disabilities, HR-QoL, and impairments in cognitive tests. All those factors could be combined into a reliable “ELT-staging LV” which was significantly associated with nitro-oxidative stress biomarkers. A reliable LV could be extracted from serum PON1 activities, recurrent flare ups, disabilities, and HR-QoL. Our ELT-staging index scores the severity of a relevant affective dimension, shared by both major depression and bipolar disorder, namely the trajectory from ELTs, a relapsing course, and suicidal behaviors to progressive disabilities. Patients were classified into three stages, namely an early stage, a relapse-regression stage, and a suicidal-regression stage.

A two-step pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide followed by NaOH at 121 °C for 20 min, was used prior to enzymatic treatment. Enzymatic treatment was carried out using a commercial cellulase. Enzymatic hydrolysis for 72 h resulted in a hydrolysate containing xylose (5.1 g L−1), glucose (75.3 g L−1) and cellobiose (1.4 g L−1). This hydrolysate was used to produce ethanol by a 72-h fermentation with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5606 at 30 °C. This separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) method was compared with a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) method. The SSF process used the pretreated SSB and was carried out in two different ways: (1) In the first method, the enzyme, the substrate and the yeast inoculum were mixed and SSF fermentation took place at 37 °C for 72-h, to produce a final ethanol concentration of 22.3 g L−1; (2) in the second method, termed the ‘delayed simultaneous-saccharification fermentation’ or DSSF, the pretreated SSB was enzymatically hydrolyzed at 50 °C for 6-h, cooled to 37 °C, and then inoculated with the yeast to commence a 66-h fermentation. This gave a final ethanol concentration of 28.3 g L−1. The ethanol productivity was 0.31 g L−1 h−1 for the SHF and SSF processes, but the DSSF had a ∼26% higher productivity.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering, Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering"

Twenty-seven healthy cats underwent pre- and post-iodinated contrast-enhanced CT. Most cat (59%) kidneys were located at the same level. The average pre-contrast dimensions of the left kidney included a width of 2.46 ± 0.28 cm, a length of 3.52 ± 0.44 cm and a height 2.19 ± 0.31 cm, whereas those of the right kidneys were 2.45 ± 0.27 cm, 3.54 ± 0.46 cm and 2.05 ± 0.23 cm, respectively. After contrast enhancement, kidneys were slightly enlarged though not significantly. Additionally, renal length (LK or RK) was compared with second lumbar vertebra (L2) length and abdominal aorta diameter (AO). AO was significantly larger in male cats whereas L2 length appeared longer in male cats, but was not statistically different from the female cats.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis confirms the morphology of CeO2 with distinctive (110), (100) and (111) planes, in agreement with interplanar spacings of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.31, respectively. However, the morphology of CeO2-8 h and CeO2-48 h is mainly a truncated octahedral with crystal planes (111) and (100) accompanied by an interplanar spacing of 0.31 and 0.27 nm, respectively. The CeO2-X h supports and those with a 3 wt% Au loading (Au/CeO2-X h) were investigated in the oxidative steam reforming of methanol at temperatures between 200 and 400 °C. The Au/CeO2-2 h gave the highest methanol conversion level and hydrogen yield at a low temperature of 250 °C. This superior catalytic performance results from the good interaction between the metal and support and the well-distributed Au species on the CeO2 support.","chemistry, earth sciences","Chemistry (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

The dispersion relations of elementary excitations such as phonons and plasmons can be tuned in layered vdW systems via stacking using functional substrates. In this work, infrared nanoimaging and nanospectroscopy of hyperbolic phonon polaritons are demonstrated in a novel vdW heterostructure combining hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ). It is observed that the insulator-to-metal transition in VO 2 has a profound impact on the polaritons in the proximal hBN layer. In effect, the real-space propagation of hyperbolic polaritons and their spectroscopic resonances can be actively controlled by temperature. This tunability originates from the effective change in local dielectric properties of the VO 2 sublayer in the course of the temperature-tuned insulator-to-metal phase transition. The high susceptibility of polaritons to electronic phase transitions opens new possibilities for applications of vdW materials in combination with strongly correlated quantum materials.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

We aimed to compare cure percentage at 12 months among 3 treatment doses of I-131 with or without lithium carbonate (LiCO3) in rapid turnover Graves’ disease patients. Methods: Sixty Graves’ disease patients referred for radioactive iodine treatment were randomised into three arms of treatment: Group A, 3.7 MBq I-131/g thyroid plus 600 mg/day LiCO3, Group B, 5.55 MBq I-131/g plus 600 mg/day LiCO3, and Group C, 7.4 MBq I-131/g without LiCO3. Data were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The primary endpoint were cure rates (percentage of euthyroid or hypothyroid) at 12 months. Pairwise comparisons were made across 3 groups using an equality of proportions test. The secondary endpoint, the odds of cure over the total follow-up for group B and C versus group A, was analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Side effects of I-131 and LiCO3 treatment were evaluated at 1 to 2 weeks after treatment. Results: The cure rate at 12 months was 45% (9/20) for group A, 60% (12/20) for group B and 80% (16/20) for group C. The mean difference in proportion cured at 12 months between group C and group A was 35 (7.0 to 66.8)%; P-value = .02. There was a statistically significant difference between cure rates over all follow-up of group C and A after adjustment for sex (adjusted OR = 3.09; 95%CI = 1.32–7.20; P-value = .009), but no significant difference was found between group B and A or C and B in the primary and/or secondary efficacy endpoints. Side effects from the treatment were found in 12% (7/60); 2 in group A, 4 in group B, and 1 in group C. Four of these were likely due to LiCO3 side effects. Conclusions: Treatment of rapid turnover Graves’ disease patients with high dose I-131 (7.4 MBq/g) provides significantly higher cure rates at 12 months, and 3 times odds of cure than 3.7 MBq/g I-131 plus LiCO3 with lesser side effects. We thus recommend 7.4 MBq I-131/g for treatment in these patients.

The ground-source heat pump has been proven a reliable, cost-effective, safe, and environmentally-friendly alternative for cooling and heating spaces in various countries. In tropical countries, the presumption that the ground-source heat pump may not provide better thermal performance than the normal air-source heat pump arises because the difference between ground and atmospheric temperatures is essentially low. This paper reports the potential use of a ground-source heat pump with horizontal heat exchangers in a tropical country-Thailand. Daily operational data of two ground-source heat pumps and an air-source heat pump during a two-month operation are analyzed and compared. Life cycle cost analysis and CO2 emission estimation are adopted to evaluate the economic value of ground-source heat pump investment and potential CO2 reduction through the use of ground-source heat pumps, in comparison with the case for air-source heat pumps. It was found that the ground-source heat pumps consume 17.1% and 18.4% less electricity than the air-source heat pump during this period. Local production of heat pumps and heat exchangers, as well as rapid regional economic growth, can be positive factors for future ground-source heat pump application, not only in Thailand but also southeast Asian countries.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, process equipment, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
The prevalence of normoalbuminuria and renal impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Pichaiwong W., Homsuwan W., Leelahavanichkul A.",2019-01-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Albuminuria, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Diabetic Nephropathies, Female, Glomerular Filtration Rate, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prevalence, Renal Insufficiency, Retrospective Studies, Diabetic kidney, Disease, Normoalbuminuria, Renal impairment","Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Clinical manifestations of DKD consist of a progressive increase in albuminuria and a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Hence, the diagnosis of DKD in patients with declining renal function without albuminuria is more difficult. Although there are several reports of such patients in other geographic regions, the data in this regard are limited. Objective: To determine the prevalence of normoalbuminuria with renal impairment and the decline in eGFR relative to their albuminuric status in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among Thai patients. Materials and methods: Retrospective review was conducted on medical records of T2DM patients at a tertiary referral hospital dated from January 1, 2013, until June 30, 2016. Based on study inclusion criteria, T2DM patients with renal impairment identified by an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were eligible. Albumin excretion rate was determined by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from a single random urine collection. Results: Of the 4,597 patients with T2DM, 16.5% had an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2. The overall prevalence rates of normoalbuminuria, moderate proteinuria, and severe proteinuria were 45.4, 30.9, and 23.7%, respectively. In the normoalbuminuria group, the incidences of chronic kidney disease at stage 3a, 3b, and 4 were 67.5, 27, and 5.5%, respectively. None of the patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease had normoalbuminuria. The decline in eGFR with normoalbuminuria was less significant than in positive albuminuria. Conclusion: The association of normoalbuminuria is common in DKD. The decline of renal function is slower in normoalbuminuria; however, the risk factors, clinical progression, and renal pathology in these patients need to be further explored.",medical,Nephrology

The crude extract of its culture broth exhibited antimicrobial and anticancer against diverse human pathogens and cancer cells. The chemical investigation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two new metabolites named nonomuric acid (1) and 3-hydroxy deoxydaunorubicinol aglycone (2), along with two known bioactive compounds [ε-rhodomycinone (3) and 7-deoxy-13-dihydrocarminomycinone (4)]. Compounds 1 and 3 showed antimalarial activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8.00 and 8.88 μg mL−1, respectively. Compound 4 inhibited growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bacillus cereus at the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50.0 and 12.50 μg mL−1, respectively. Every compound exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cells tested at IC50 ≥ 6.34 μg mL−1. These finding are the first report of bioactive metabolites produced by strain NR4-ASC07T, suggesting that rare actinomycetes are yet promising sources for novel drug discovery.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; culture selection and improvement; discovery and characterization, chemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Plant Science, Organic Chemistry"

Up to now, the pathogenesis of FM is unknown although a peripheral and central sensitization involving an imbalance on immune biomarkers appears to have a relevant role in its aetiology. The aim of this study was to extend previous clinical findings of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to both its impact on clinical symptomatology and immune biomarkers (IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10 and hs-CRP), and also to explore the role of biomarkers as predictors of efficacy. Methods: A total of 70 female patients with FM were randomly assigned to two treatment modalities, namely Treatment as Usual (TAU) plus MBSR (n = 35) or TAU alone (n = 35). This study is embedded within a larger RCT (n = 225) that includes three study arms (TAU; TAU plus MBSR; and TAU plus the psychoeducative intervention FibroQoL), and a 12-month follow-up (clinical trial registration: NCT02561416). Blood cytokine assays and clinical assessment were conducted at baseline and post-treatment. Treatment effects were analysed using linear mixed models with intention to treat and per protocol analyses. In order to evaluate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, ratios of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL8 and hs-CRP with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were calculated (i.e. IL-6/IL-10, CXCL8/IL10 and hs-CRP/IL-10). Results: The results show that MBSR is an efficacious intervention to reduce clinical severity of patients with FM. MBSR also prevents the tendency of IL-10 to decrease as observed in the TAU group. Higher levels of baseline CXCL8 levels attenuate the beneficial effect of MBSR practice on clinical symptomatology, including pain, energy, stiffness or quality of sleep. Furthermore, higher baseline IL-6/IL-10 and CXCL8/IL-10 ratios were associated with less improvement in psychological inflexibility following MBSR treatment. Discussion: Our results show that mindfulness training has clinical efficacy in patients with FM. The results suggest that MBSR has significant immune regulatory effects in FM patients, while immune-inflammatory pathways may in part predict the clinical efficacy of MBSR. These cytokines and chemokines may be adequate biomarkers to monitor responsivity to MBSR.","Immunology, neuroscience","Immunology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Behavioral Neuroscience"

A periodic-review base-stock policy with an echelon stock concept was applied at all locations. Seasonal demand with a short cycle was considered at the level of the retailers. A two-phase heuristic method was then proposed to reduce the computational time required to determine a proper policy compared to the mixed-integer programming models. The first-phase algorithm was used to determine the initial ordering policy for each location, while the second-phase algorithm was used to determine the safety stock. Both algorithms could find solutions that are as good as the solutions from the mixed-integer programming models in testing instances but they substantially reduced the computational time. The solutions were tested with other instances having a 10,000-period horizon, where the average loss was within the expected service level and the number of periods with an unsatisfied expected service level was less than 1% of the planning horizon.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Patient food delivery error in the hospital: A case study in Thailand,"Tonjang S., Thawesaengskulthai N.",2019-05-24,"Case study analysis, Confidence levels, Hospital management, Medical center, Medication errors, Prescription errors, Process Innovation, Quantitative data, Food provider, Health care, Hospital management, Medical center, Nutrition, Service error","Food service provided in hospitals has considerable significance, as it is part of the medical treatment. In a sample hospital, food delivery error occupied 37.4% which was the highest complaint among all problems in 2017. This problem has never been investigated for its root causes and there has been no measures established against it. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate for the causes of the discrepancies in the food service provided for the inpatients. Root causes of the inpatient food delivery error are identified by triangulation of quantitative data by survey & complaint analysis and qualitative data by focus group. The first set consists of questionnaire responded by nutrition unit staff, experts in food service and hospital directors, in total of 71 respondents. The questionnaire was modelled after the four types of medication errors[1], [2]. The second set was the review of the food service error from inpatient complaint files recorded during January-December 2017. The third set was focus group interview among 71 hospital staff. The service blueprint was used in search of the pain points. The three methods showed consensus results. Both survey and complaint results revealed that the error were caused by 1)transcribing (61.3%, 54.3%) 2) administration error (25.8%,32.6%) 3) dispensing error (10.1%, 10.9%) 4) prescription error(2.7%, 2.2%). Furthermore, the survey of the relation between themeans of importance and the actual performance in each processrevealed that transcribing error and administration error were theroot causes at 95% confidence level. In addition, focus groupinterview with the 71 hospital staff confirms the finding.Transcribing error included miscommunication and datatransference across the departments. Administration error arisesduring the delivery process. Dispensing error occurred in the foodpreparation and food trays, for example, wrong delivery. Lastly,prescription error was caused by the doctors who were in charge ofordering the patient's dietary requirements. Next, the authorsconducted in-depth case study analysis by using service blueprintwith 217 food delivery case studies. We found that the root causewas the operation of data transference across the departments.Results from this paper urge the need for process innovation in assuring quality of patient food delivery.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Image quality and diagnostic accuracy of complex-averaged high b value images in diffusion-weighted MRI of prostate cancer,"Kordbacheh H., Seethamraju R.T., Weiland E., Kiefer B., Nickel M.D., Chulroek T., Cecconi M., Baliyan V., Harisinghani M.G.",2019-06-15,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Biopsy, Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Humans, Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted, Male, Middle Aged, Prostatectomy, Prostatic Neoplasms, Retrospective Studies, Image quality, Multiparametric MRI, Prostate cancer","Purpose: To evaluate the impact of complex-averaging on image quality (IQ) and diagnostic accuracy of acquired and calculated high b value (aHBV, cHBV) images in diffusion-weighted prostate MRI. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 84 patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI at 3 Tesla without endorectal coil. DWIs were acquired at three different b values which included two lower b values (b = 50,900 s/mm2) and one higher b value (aHBV at 2000 s/mm2). The acquired data were postprocessed to generate two different types of trace-weighted images—using conventional magnitude-averaging and complex-averaging. Using lower b values (b = 50,900 s/mm2) from both conventional and complex-averaged image sets, cHBV images (b = 2000 s/mm2) and ADC maps were derived. All image sets were reviewed by two radiologists in different reading sessions to assess image quality and PIRADS. The diagnostic accuracy of different image sets for the detection of prostate lesions was performed by correlating PIRADS and Gleason scores. Results: Complex-averaging did not impact ADC values of the prostate lesions compared to magnitude-averaging (P = 0.08). Complex-averaging improved image quality of acquired high b value and calculated high b value images (P < 0.0001). Complex-averaging also improved the level of confidence (LOC) of the acquired high b value for both readers (P < 0.0001, P < 0.05), but only for reader A in calculated high b value (P < 0.0001). The image quality of calculated high b value images was not significantly different than acquired high b value images. The dataset combining complex-averaging and calculated high b value provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (but not statistically significant) for detection of the significant prostate lesion compared to the magnitude-averaged acquired high b value (79.55% vs. 72.73%; P = 0.317). The mean acquisition time for b = 2000 s/mm2 sequence (aHBV) was 6 min 30 s (± 1 min 16 s) out of a total of 28 min 31 s (± 4 min 26 s) for the entire mp-MRI protocol (approximately 25% of total scan time). Conclusion: Complex-averaging provides better image quality and level of confidence without significant impact on ADC values and diagnostic accuracy for detection of the significant prostate lesions. The calculated high b value images are also comparable to (and can substitute) the acquired high b value images which can help in reducing the imaging time.","Health Professions, medical","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Gastroenterology, Urology"

Because of their similar density, they cannot be easily separated from each other in the recycling stream. Blending of PP/ polyethylenes (PEs) in different ratios possibly eliminate the sorting process used in the regular recycling process. PP has fascinating properties such as excellent processability and chemical resistance. However, insufficient flexibility limits its use for specific applications. Blending of PP with relative flexible PEs might improve its flexibility. This is a unique approach for recycling or upcycling, which aims to maintain or improve the properties of recycled materials. The effects of the branched-chain structures of PEs on the crystallization behavior and the related mechanical properties of such blends were investigated. The overall kinetics of crystallization of PP was significantly influenced by the presence of PEs with different branched-chain structures. The presence of LDPE was found to decrease the overall crystallization rate while the addition of HDPE accelerated the crystallization process of the blends. No negative effect on the mechanical performance and the related crystallinity was observed within the studied parameter range.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Toward the improvement of safety planning for construction activities performed at high elevation by using augmented reality,"Limsupreeyarat P., Yabuki N., Tongthong T.",2019-01-01,"Construction activities, Construction engineers, Construction environment, Construction personnel, Construction safety, Head mounted displays, High elevation, Innovative approaches, Augmented reality, Construction safety, High elevation, Planning","Many of the activities in construction tend to lead to accident occurrences. The major causation of the accidents in this industry is fall from height. In developing countries such as Thailand, there are too many unsafe conditions in construction activities performed at high elevation. Although, the government enforces safety rules and regulations, safety facilities are still provided inadequately. The involved parties such as construction engineers and supervisors do not pay much attention to unsafe conditions, which may be caused by ignorance and unawareness of those personnel regarding hazards and risks. To eliminate unsafe conditions and to reduce a number of accidents, in-charge personnel should definitely have knowledge related with the requirements of safety procedures and safety facilities of construction activities performed at high elevation. It is more effective to enable those personnel gain experiences and perceive inherent hazards and risks of those activities in the actual construction environment. Thus, an innovative approach is needed to provide the personnel with visualized information of those activities as they occur in real construction site. This study aims to develop a visualized approach for simulating the construction activities operated at high elevation using Augmented Reality to educate construction personnel. The improvement of construction personnel considerations in safety planning is investigated. The proposed system consists of the following: (1) hardware components, including a laptop computer, a video camera, and a head-mounted display (HMD), (2) three databases, i.e., database of virtual model of construction objects, database of hazards, risks, and consequences, and database of safe and unsafe scenarios, and (3) a computer program for generating and superimposing the simulations into the real world scene. This research is on-going and the prototype systems are under development. The prototype will be tested at a real construction site. In this stage, we propose the approach and system architecture.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Engineering (all)"

However, there is the existence of socioeconomic-related inequalities in dental service utilization, especially denture service. The aim of this study was to assess the determinants associated with inequalities in denture service utilization among older Thai people using the Andersen Behavioural model. Method: This cross-sectional study involved secondary data analysis of the 2014 survey of older Thai people (N = 38,695). The dependent variable was a public denture service utilization over the past 5 years. Determinants were classified as predisposing and enabling factors. Predisposing variables included age, sex, education, economic condition and dependency status. Enabling variables included working status, health behaviours, health care utilization experience and social/community support. Data were analysed by using bivariate and multivariable analyses at α = 0.05. For bivariate analysis, chi-square test was used to determine the association between dependent and each independent variable. Then, all variables were incorporated into a multivariable binary logistic regression. Results: The odds of denture service utilization were significantly higher for individuals who were older, female, and had a higher educational level and health-promoting behaviors. A positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated between denture service utilization and increased quartile of household assets. Conclusions: Predisposing variables had a greater impact than enabling variables in denture service utilization among older Thai people. Despite free public denture service, socioeconomic-related inequalities persist.

The surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was utilized as the mesoporous template while the tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as the silica source. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized through different analyses, namely XRD, XPS, TEM, FT-IR, VSM, BET, and acid-base titration. Various factors like the effects of the initial concentration, contact time, influence of the pH and the coexistence of other antibiotics on the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) uptake, were investigated. Adsorption results exhibited that the mGO-Si adsorbed the SMX molecules more effectively than the pristine magnetic graphene oxide (mGO). Kinetic data showed good correlation on the basis of the pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the Langmuir model, and a maximum SMX adsorption capacity of 15.46 mg/g was obtained. At high pH, the solution had significantly impaired then declined capacity of SMX adsorption. Electrostatic repulsion occurred between the dissociated SMX and the more negatively charged mGO-Si at basic pH. Adsorption mechanisms between SMX and mGO-Si were plausibly activated by hydrogen bonding, π–π EDA interactions, and solution pH-based electrostatic interactions dependent upon the status of SMX and the pH,PZC of mGO-Si. Moreover, the CIP and OTC competitors in the mixed solute system managed to improve the SMX adsorption by acting as a bridge to form CIP−SMX−mGO-Si/ OTC−SMX−mGO-Si surface complex. At low aqueous phase concentration of SMX, CIP was likely to form a stronger electrostatic interaction system with the adsorbent, thereby resulting in an adsorption level which was more competitive in the process opposing CIP to SMX than in that opposing OTC to SMX.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, mixing and separation, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Novel ractopamine–protein carrier conjugation and its application to the lateral flow strip test for ractopamine detection in animal feed 一种新型莱克多巴胺-蛋白质载体结合技术在侧向流试纸条检测动物饲料中莱克多巴胺含量中的应用,"Preechakasedkit P., Ngamrojanavanich N., Khongchareonporn N., Chailapakul O.",2019-02-01,"Animal Feed, Animals, Cross Reactions, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Limit of Detection, Phenethylamines, Reagent Strips, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Swine, Conjugate of ractopamine and bovine serum albumin (RAC–BSA), Feed additive, Lateral flow strip test, Mannich reaction, Q81, Ractopamine","In this work, a novel conjugate of ractopamine and bovine serum albumin (RAC–BSA) has been developed via the Mannich reaction, with a mole coupling ratio for RAC–BSA of 9:1. The proposed conjugation method provides a simple and one-step method with the use of fewer reagents compared with other conjugation methods for competitive immunoassays. RAC–BSA conjugation was used to fabricate a competitive lateral flow strip test for RAC detection in animal feed. For sample preparation, RAC was spiked in swine feed purchased from the local markets in Thailand, and methanol and running buffer at a volume ratio of 10:90 was used as extraction buffer. The procedures for sample preparation were completed within 25 min. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD), assessed by the naked eye within 5 min, was found to be 1 ng/g. A semi-quantitative analysis was also conducted using a smart phone and computer software, with a linearity of 0.075–0.750 ng/g, calculated LOD of 0.10 ng/g, calculated limit of quantitation of 0.33 ng/g, and good correlation of 0.992. The recoveries were found in the range of 96.4%–103.7% with a relative standard deviation of 2.5%–3.6% for intra- and inter-assays. Comparison of the results obtained by the strip test with those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay had a good agreement in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, this strip test exhibited highly specific RAC detection without cross reactivity with related compounds. Therefore, the RAC–BSA conjugation via the Mannich reaction can be accepted as a one-step and easy conjugation method and applied to the competitive lateral flow strip test.","biochemistryistry, Veterinary Science, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Veterinary (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The incorporation of 1.25% and 2.5% (w/v)CTE caused a reduction in the starch digestibility of cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In addition, there was significant alteration on the starch digestibility of cooked rice incorporated with 2.5% CTE using a microwave oven. Moreover, CTE significantly reduced the level of rapidly digestible starch and increased the level of undigested starch in cooked rice using an electric rice cooker. In the textural characteristics, the hardness of cooked rice with CTE remained unchanged, whereas a reduction in stickiness of cooked rice with CTE was observed. The sensory evaluation of cooked rice with CTE given by panelists demonstrated a good overall acceptability. Overall, the results show that CTE is a useful ingredient to incorporate with cooked rice for reduction of starch digestibility.","organic computer scienceounds, drug literature index, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"

Structural, electronic, and optical properties are analyzed, and it is found that non-isotropic distribution of In−N (type C) possesses the minimum free energy for the InGaAsN conventional cell system. An increasing indium content reduces the formation enthalpy of InGaAsN. The formation enthalpy, conduction band minimum, strength of covalent bonds, and electron density differences in free space of InGaAsN are decreased under high-pressure conditions. The dielectric performance and static permittivity of InGaAsN are lower than that of GaAs, for which the dielectric performance transforms to conductor performance at high frequency.

In this study, we conducted a survey of CaKoV at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018. Results: Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms (n = 252). Of 307 swab samples tested by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs (25.45%). Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in domestic dogs. In this study, we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole genomes of Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99.5% amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand. CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs. The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs. Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs.

Clinical expression and antigenic profiles of a Plasmodium vivax vaccine candidate: Merozoite surface protein 7 (PvMSP-7),"Cheng C.W., Jongwutiwes S., Putaporntip C., Jackson A.P.",2019-06-13,"Adolescent, Adult, Africa, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Alleles, Antibodies, Protozoan, Antigens, Protozoan, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Malaria Vaccines, Malaria, Vivax, Male, Membrane Proteins, Microarray Analysis, Middle Aged, Plasmodium vivax, Protozoan Proteins, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Young Adult, Antigen, Clinical isolates, Epitope, Malaria, Plasmodium vivax, PvMSP-7, Transcriptomics, Vaccine","Background: Vivax malaria is the predominant form of malaria outside Africa, affecting about 14 million people worldwide, with about 2.5 billion people exposed. Development of a Plasmodium vivax vaccine is a priority, and merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) has been proposed as a plausible candidate. The P. vivax genome contains 12 MSP-7 genes, which contribute to erythrocyte invasion during blood-stage infection. Previous analysis of MSP-7 sequence diversity suggested that not all paralogs are functionally equivalent. To explore MSP-7 functional diversity, and to identify the best vaccine candidate within the family, MSP-7 expression and antigenicity during bloodstream infections were examined directly from clinical isolates. Methods: Merozoite surface protein 7 gene expression was profiled using RNA-seq data from blood samples isolated from ten human patients with vivax malaria. Differential expression analysis and co-expression cluster analysis were used to relate PvMSP-7 expression to genetic markers of life cycle stage. Plasma from vivax malaria patients was also assayed using a custom peptide microarray to measure antibody responses against the coding regions of 12 MSP-7 paralogs. Results: Ten patients presented diverse transcriptional profiles that comprised four patient groups. Two MSP-7 paralogs, 7A and 7F, were expressed abundantly in all patients, while other MSP-7 genes were uniformly rare (e.g. 7J). MSP-7H and 7I were significantly more abundant in patient group 4 only, (two patients having experienced longer patency), and were co-expressed with a schizont-stage marker, while negatively associated with liver-stage and gametocyte-stage markers. Screening infections with a PvMSP-7 peptide array identified 13 linear B-cell epitopes in five MSP-7 paralogs that were recognized by plasma from all patients. Conclusions: These results show that MSP-7 family members vary in expression profile during blood infections; MSP-7A and 7F are expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic development cycle, while expression of other paralogs is focused on the schizont. This may reflect developmental regulation, and potentially functional differentiation, within the gene family. The frequency of B-cell epitopes among paralogs also varies, with MSP-7A and 7L consistently the most immunogenic. Thus, MSP-7 paralogs cannot be assumed to have equal potential as vaccines. This analysis of clinical infections indicates that the most abundant and immunogenic paralog is MSP-7A.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

The androgens are involved in acne pathogenesis by modulating sebaceous glands to enhance sebum production. However, the molecular mechanisms of abnormal keratinization of the hair infundibulum are not fully elucidated. Objective: We hypothesized that the androgens affect the dermal fibroblasts, another androgen receptor-positive cells in the skin, resulting in abnormal keratinization through keratinocyte-fibroblast interaction. Methods: We investigated effects of androgens and estrogens on growth factors expressions by RT-PCR and western blot analysis in human fibroblast (hFB), human keratinocyte (hKC), and fibroblast-keratinocyte co-culture. In vivo, we examined the growth factor expression in acne lesions compared to normal hair follicles by laser-assisted confocal microscope. Results: In vitro, androgens but not estrogens significantly increased amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 10, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 5 mRNA and protein expressions in human fibroblasts but not in keratinocytes. In vivo, AREG, EREG, FGF10, and IGFBP5 were more abundant in acne lesion compared to normal facial skin. FGF10 suppressed cytokeratin 1 and cytokeratin 10 expression in hKC, which was along with the decreased ratio of cytokeratin 10 against cytokeratin 14 in acne lesions compared to normal facial skin. Also, DHT suppressed cytokeratin 1 and cytokeratin 10, in fibroblast-keratinocyte co-culture similarly to the effect of FGF10 to hKC. Conclusion: These observations suggested that androgens enhance growth factors production from dermal fibroblasts, and growth factors from fibroblasts alter keratinocyte differentiation in acne lesion.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"

Methods: Patients with high risk neuroblastoma undergoing ThaiPOG high risk neuroblastoma protocol from 2016 to 2017 were studied. All patients received 6 cycles of induction regimen consisting of 2 cycles topotecan (1.2 mg/m2/day) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m2/day) for 5 days followed by cisplatin (50 mg/m2/day) for 4 days combined with etoposide (200 mg/m2/day) for 3 days on the third and fifth cycles and cyclophosphamide (2100 mg/m2/day) for 2 days combined with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2/day) and vincristine (0.67 mg/m2/day) for 3 days on the fourth and sixth cycles. Treatment response after the 5th cycle before surgery and treatment-related toxicities after each topotecan containing induction cycle were evaluated. Relevant prognostic factors were analyzed to measure the treatment response among those patients. Results: In all, 107 high risk neuroblastoma patients were enrolled in the study. After the 5th cycle of induction regimen, the patients achieved complete response (N = 2), very good partial response (N = 40), partial response (N = 46) and mixed response (N = 19). None of the patients experienced stable disease or disease progression. The most significant prognostic factor was type of healthcare system. The most common adverse effect was febrile neutropenia followed by mucositis, diarrhea and elevated renal function. Conclusion: The topotecan and cyclophosphamide containing induction regimen effectively provides favorable treatment response.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition that features inflammation and immune responses of innate and adaptive immunity. The role of T cells in knee OA pathogenesis is still unclear. Our aim was to characterize T cell functions and their clonality in patients with knee OA in peripheral blood (PB) and infrapatellar fat pads (IPFP). Methods. We isolated T cells from PB and IPFP of patients with knee OA and PB of healthy individuals and determined soluble mediators produced from these cells. In addition, we performed a clonal analysis of activated CD8+ T cells and compared the T cell receptor β-variable gene chain (TRBV) usages between T cells in PB and IPFP of patients with knee OA. Results. Our results suggest that in patients with knee OA, circulating T cells possess a more ""cytotoxic"" profile or rather impaired cytokine production, but the knee microenvironment allows for these T cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor], IL-17, and interferon-γ within IPFP. Activated CD8+ IPFP T cells carry different repertoire distribution from those present in PB of patients with knee OA. Shared TRBV usage of activated CD8+ IPFP T cells among the 3 patients with knee OA was also observed. Conclusion. Our study describes the nature of T cells in knee OA that may be due to ""unhealthy"" aging or other factors that drive healthy aging T cells into a state of imbalance, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of knee OA.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; cells of the Immunologyne system; t lymphocytes, medical, Immunology","Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Hence, we propose a combination of deep learning method architectures which consist of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze spatial and temporal features and predict traffic speed in multiple steps. An accident has a major impact on local traffic congestion. We employ an autoencoder with a monotonic attention mechanism to learn accident embedding input to detect unexpected accidents and their effects. An experiment was conducted on two datasets of Highways England and Thai Expressways. Results showed that spatial and temporal features can solve problems at different locations in the traffic network using the deep learning method to improve traffic prediction performance.

In a previous study in rice, the expression of the ICL-encoding gene (OsICL) was highly induced by salt stress and its expression was enhanced in transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsCam1-1, a calmodulin (CaM)-encoding gene. CaM has been implicated in salt tolerance mechanisms in plants; however, the cellular mechanisms mediated by CaM are not clearly understood. In this study, the role of OsICL in plant salt tolerance mechanisms and the possible involvement of CaM were investigated using transgenic plants expressing OsICL or OsCam1-1. Results: OsICL was highly expressed in senesced leaf and significantly induced by salt stress in three OsCam1-1 overexpressing transgenic rice lines as well as in wild type (WT). In WT young leaf, although OsICL expression was not affected by salt stress, all three transgenic lines exhibited highly induced expression levels. In Arabidopsis, salt stress had negative effects on germination and seedling growth of the AtICL knockout mutant (Aticl mutant). To examine the roles of OsICL we generated the following transgenic Arabidopsis lines: the Aticl mutant expressing OsICL driven by the native AtICL promoter, the Aticl mutant overexpressing OsICL driven by the 35SCaMV promoter, and WT overexpressing OsICL driven by the 35SCaMV promoter. Under salt stress, the germination rate and seedling fresh and dry weights of the OsICL-expressing lines were higher than those of the Aticl mutant, and the two lines with the icl mutant background were similar to the WT. The F v/F m and temperature of rosette leaves in the OsICL-expressing lines were less affected by salt stress than they were in the Aticl mutant. Finally, glucose and fructose contents of the Aticl mutant under salt stress were highest, whereas those of OsICL-expressing lines were similar to or lower than those of the WT. Conclusions: OsICL, a salt-responsive gene, was characterized in the transgenic Arabidopsis lines, revealing that OsICL expression could revert the salt sensitivity phenotypes of the Aticl knockout mutant. This work provides novel evidence that supports the role of ICL in plant salt tolerance through the glyoxylate cycle and the possible involvement of OsCam1-1 in regulating its transcription.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science

SOC makes possible to aggregate distributed resources at the phases of decision-making support and system operations. When myriads of resources with similar functionalities are available, effective methodologies are demanded to select services and compose them as service workflows for the specified goals. The computation for workflow composition is very complex since it depends on the numbers of services and their dynamic characteristics. Therefore, composing optimized workflows in a timely manner poses a great challenge. We are highly motivated to reduce the complexity of service selection and composition. The formalized semantics in SWSpec is extended so that unqualified or inferior services can be eliminated directly from the scope of the design solution space.

A review on the electrolyte imbalance in vanadium redox flow batteries,"Jirabovornwisut T., Arpornwichanop A.",2019-09-20,"Battery capacity, Capacity loss, Commercial systems, Electrolyte imbalance, Operational problems, Renewable Power, Stationary applications, Vanadium redox flow batteries, Capacity loss, Electrolyte imbalance, Power management, Vanadium redox flow batteries","Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are widely used in various stationary applications to enhance power management, improve peak shaving and load leveling, and support a renewable power grid. Although a VRFB has several advantages such as flexibility, long shelf life, and relatively high efficiency, there are very few commercially available VRFB systems because of high operating and structure costs. Therefore, considerable efforts are being made to reduce the fixed and variable costs of a VRFB system. For effective handling of the VRFB system, it is essential to understand the operational problems that could occur during a long-term VRFB operation. Electrolyte imbalance is often a major obstacle affecting the battery capacity loss. This paper presents a comprehensive reviews on causes, effects, measurement, and regeneration of the imbalanced electrolyte leading to an understanding for better operation and to manufacture a VRFB commercial system.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
"Seroprevalence of an antibody against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis among the elderly in Khon Kaen, Thailand","Chinchai T., Posuwan N., Vuthitanachot V., Wanlapakorn N., Poovorawan Y.",2019-10-18,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Antibodies, Bacterial, Diphtheria, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Humans, Immunization, Secondary, Male, Seroepidemiologic Studies, Tetanus, Thailand, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Elderly, Pertussis, Seroprevalence, Tetanus","BACKGROUND: Owing to a declining birth rate and longer lifespan, the number of elderly people (≥ 60 years) in Thailand has grown rapidly. However, the elderly are at significant risk of infectious diseases because they have never been immunized, because they have not been completely immunized, or because their immunity has waned. Immunity against infectious diseases in the elderly is an important means of controlling diseases in the community. Our objective was to evaluate the seroprotective rate against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in the elderly Thai population. METHODS: In total, 430 healthy individuals from the northeastern region of Thailand were enrolled in this study and stratified into five age groups: 60-65, 66-70, 71-75, 76-80, and > 80 years. Serum samples were collected and quantitatively analyzed for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis IgG antibody by using commercial ELISA kits. For anti-diphtheria toxoid and anti-tetanus toxoid ELISA, values < 0.01 IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative, and for anti-Bordetella pertussis toxin ELISA, values < 5 IU/ml were interpreted as seronegative; these definitions were in accord with previous studies. RESULTS: For diphtheria toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels > 0.01 IU/ml. For tetanus anti-toxoid Ab, the majority of the population had antibody levels of > 0.01 IU/ml, of which approximately 34% had durable antibody protection levels (DAPL) of ≥ 1 IU/ml. Meanwhile, nearly 45% of the population had an Ab level against pertussis lower than the protectivity level. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 97.2%, 83.5%, and 55.8% of the population had a higher antibody level than the minimal protective level for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, respectively. In order to prevent an outbreak of these diseases in the future, the elderly should be administered with Tdap revaccination to provide diphtheria herd immunity in the population; this will increase cocoon phenomenon for pertussis and protect the population from tetanus-prone injury.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical, environmental","Food Science, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, several non-Candida yeast are non-susceptible to echinocandins (echinocandin non-susceptible yeast, ENSY), including Cryptococcus, Geotrichum, Malassezia, Pseudozyma, Rhodotorula, Saprochaete, Sporobolomyces and Trichosporon. In laboratories that are not equipped with rapid diagnostic tools, it often takes several days to identify yeast, and this may lead to inappropriate presumptive use of echinocandins in patients with ENSY fungemia. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of ENSY species during a 1-year, laboratory surveillance programme in Asia. Methods: Non-duplicate yeast isolated from blood or bone marrow cultures at 25 hospitals in China, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand were analysed. Isolates were considered to be duplicative if they were obtained within 7 days from the same patient. Results: Of 2155 yeast isolates evaluated, 175 (8.1%) were non-Candida yeast. The majority of non-Candida yeast were ENSY (146/175, 83.4%). These included Cryptococcus (109 isolates), Trichosporon (23), Rhodotorula (10) and Malassezia (4). The proportion of ENSY isolates (146/2155, 6.7%) differed between tropical (India, Thailand and Singapore; 51/593, 8.6%) and non-tropical countries/regions (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; 95/1562, 6.1%, P = 0.038). ENSY was common in outpatient clinics (25.0%) and emergency departments (17.8%) but rare in intensive care units (4.7%) and in haematology-oncology units (2.9%). Cryptococcus accounted for the majority of the non-Candida species in emergency departments (21/24, 87.5%) and outpatient clinics (4/5, 80.0%). Conclusions: Isolation of non-Candida yeast from blood cultures was not rare, and the frequency varied among medical units and countries.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary mycology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, medical","Dermatology, Infectious Diseases"

This holistic study has investigated the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS), anti-infection, antioxidant and anti-photoaging properties of neglected plant Diplocyclos palmatus. The results showed that D. palmatus methanolic leaf extract (DPME) effectively inhibited the quorum sensing (QS) regulated virulence factor production as well as biofilm formation in Serratia marcescens. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that DPME significantly downed the expression of QS-regulated genes such as fimA, fimC, flhC, bsmB, pigP and shlA in S. marcescens, which supports the outcome of in vitro bioassays. Further, the docking study revealed that the presence of active compounds, namely tocopherols and phytol, DPME exhibited its anti-QS activity against S. marcescens. In addition, DPME treatment extended the lifespan of S. marcescens infected C. elegans by the action of dropping the internal accumulation. Further, qPCR analysis clearly revealed that DPME treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of the lifespan-related gene (daf-16) and immune-related genes (clec-60, clec-87, lys-7 and bec-1) in S. marcescens infected C.elegans. On the other hand, DPME extensively reduced the UV-A induced ROS stress, thereby, extended the lifespan in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further, the qPCR analysis also confirmed the up-regulation of daf-16, clec-60, clec-87 and col-19 genes which advocated the improvement of the lifespan, healthspan and collagen production in UV-A photoaged C. elegans. Further bioassays evidenced that that the lifespan extension of photoaged C. elegans was accomplished by the actions of antioxidants such as tocopherols and phytol in DPME.","physics, Health Professions, biochemistryistry, medical","Radiation, Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

People can create content while others can share, react to, or express opinions about the content. Since communication can take place more freely and more anonymously, social network users are more vulnerable to cyberbullying. The problem is a threat to the victim's several mental and physical health conditions such as low self-esteem, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and suicidal thoughts. In Thailand, cyberbullying is a widespread problem as the number of incidents is among the top lists in the world. To increase awareness and try to prevent the problem, this paper presents a method to identify risk of cyberbullying to an individual via an analysis of social network messages in Thai. The presented method collected training data from Twitter and used several machine learning algorithms to classify textual tweets into four cyberbullying categories, i.e. sexual harassment, insult and threat, race and religion, and intelligence, appearance, and social status. An experiment showed that Logistic Regression performed best when the problem of imbalanced data set was handled with the F1 score of 73.89 and accuracy of 73.61. In addition, a tool to visualize cyberbullying incidents of any individual has been implemented. The method and accompanying tool can help to monitor potential risk of cyberbullying to an individual so that appropriate care can be sent in a timely manner.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (miscellaneous)

A new schizophrenia model: Immune activation is associated with the induction of different neurotoxic products which together determine memory impairments and schizophrenia symptom dimensions,"Sirivichayakul S., Kanchanatawan B., Thika S., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2019-01-01,"Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders, Humans, Memory Disorders, Neuropsychological Tests, Schizophrenia, Tryptophan, Xanthurenates, Cytokines, Deficit schizophrenia, Immune, Inflammation, Kynurenine, Oxidative stress","Objective: Recently, we reported that stable-phase schizophrenia is characterized by two interrelated symptom dimensions: PHEMN (psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative symp-toms); and DAPS (depressive, anxiety and physio-somatic symptoms) and that Major Neuro-Cognitive psychosis (MNP) is the full-blown phenotype of schizophrenia (largely overlapping with deficit schizo-phrenia). Herein we examined the effects of immune activation in association with tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) patterning and memory disorders on PHEMN/DAPS dimensions and MNP. Methods: Serum levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), soluble interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), IL-10, eotaxin, IgA/IgM responses to TRYCATs, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) tests were assessed in 40 controls and 80 schizophrenia patients. Results: Schizophrenia and MNP were predicted by significantly increased levels of IL-10, eotaxin and TRYCATs. A large part of variance in both PHEMN/DAPS symptom dimensions (42.8%) was explained by cytokine levels and TRYCATs combined. The MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 composite score and eotaxin explained each around on the basis of 19% of the variance in symptom dimensions, and approximately 18% of memory deficits. Moreover, MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 was significantly associated with elevations in picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-OH-kynurenine. Partial Least Squares path modeling shows that highly significant effects of MIP+sIL-1RA+IL-10 on symptomatology are mediated by the effects of noxious TRYCATs on memory deficits. Conclusion: Current findings indicate that in schizophrenia, immune activation may underpin activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase and kynurenine monooxygenase, while impairments in episodic and semantic memory may be caused by the neurotoxic effects of TRYCATs and eotaxin. The combined effects of immune activation, eotaxin and memory defects determine to a large extent, PHEMN/DAPS symptoms and the MNP phenotype. These findings indicate that schizophrenia phe-nomenology is largely mediated by multiple neuro-immune pathways and that immune activation, increased production of eotaxin and neurotoxic TRYCATs (picolinic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-HO-kynurenine) are new drug targets in schizophrenia and MNP.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"

As one of the key blocks, Indochina was constrained only by sedimentary-rocks-derived palaeomagnetic data. To evaluate whether the palaeomagnetic data used to restore the Late Triassic position of Indochina suffered inclination shallowing effects, we conducted a palaeomagnetic and geochronologic study on a coeval volcanic clastic rocks sequence in the western margin of the Khorat Basin, Thailand. The U-Pb SIMS dating on zircons indicates the age of the sampling section is between 205.1 ± 1.5 and 204.7 ± 1.4Ma. Site mean directions are Dg/Ig = 217.2°/-39.4° (κg = 45.1, α95g = 10.1°) before and Ds/Is = 209.2°/-44.5° (κ s = 43.8, α95s = 10.2°) after tilt correction. The new data set indicates a positive reversal test result at ?Category C? level. The characteristic remanent magnetization recorded by the coexistent magnetite and hematite is interpreted to be primary remanence acquired during the initial cooling of the volcanic clastic rocks. The consistence of the corresponding palaeolatitudes derived from the volcanic clastic rocks and the former reported sedimentary rocks suggests that there is probably no significant inclination shallowing bias in the sedimentary-rocks-derived palaeomagnetic data. Therefore, the estimates of the Late Triassic position of Indochina are confirmed to be reliable. The Indochina Block had collided to the southern margin of Eurasia by the Late Triassic and played an important role in the Mesozoic convergence of the Eastern Asia blocks.","fluidex; related topics, palaeomagnetism, earth sciences","Geophysics, Geochemistry and Petrology"
An immune gate of depression – Early neuroimmune development in the formation of the underlying depressive disorder,"Kowalczyk M., Szemraj J., Blizniewska K., Maes M., Berk M., Su K.-P., Galecki P.",2019-12-01,"Animals, Autoimmune Diseases, Cytokines, Depression, Depressive Disorder, Humans, Immune System, Allostasis, Interleukin 17, Pro-inflammatory cytokines, Regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells","The prevalence of depression worldwide is increasing from year to year and constitutes a serious medical, economic and social problem. Currently, despite multifactorial risk factors and pathways contributing to depression development, a significant aspect is attributed to the inflammatory process. Cytokines are considered a factor activating the kynurenine pathway, which leads to the exhaustion of tryptophan in the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway. This results in the activation of potentially neuroprogressive processes and also affects the metabolism of many neurotransmitters. The immune system plays a coordinating role in mediating inflammatory process. Beginning from foetal life, dendritic cells have the ability to react to bacterial and viral antigens, stimulating T lymphocytes in a similar way to adult cells. Cytotoxicity in the prenatal period shapes the predisposition to the development of depression in adult life. Allostasis, i.e. the ability to maintain the body's balance in the face of environmental adversity through changes in its behaviour or physiology, allows the organism to survive but its consequences may be unfavourable if it lasts too long. As a result, Th lymphocytes, in particular T helper 17 cells, which play a central role in the immunity of the whole body, contribute to the development of both autoimmune diseases and psychiatric disorders including depression, as well as have an impact on the differentiation of T CD4+ cells into Th17 cells in the later development of the child's organism, which confirms the importance of the foetal period for the progression of depressive disorders.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

To investigate whether algae could be used to remove ammonium from brackish shrimp aquaculture wastewater, marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. VDW was cultured in BG11 medium supplemented with Turks Island salt solution and different concentrations of NH4Cl (1.0–40.0 mg L−1) for 18 days. The cell density of the Synechococcus sp. VDW cultures increased in medium containing between 1 and 10 mg L−1 of NH4Cl, while ammonium concentrations greater than 20.0 mg L−1 had a negative effect on growth. Glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase activities were also examined, and were found to increase with cell density. Meanwhile, glutamate dehydrogenase activity increased in response to high NH4Cl concentrations (20.0–40.0 mg L−1). The cellular response to ammonium excess was confirmed by measuring gene expression levels using quantitative PCR. Expression of both glnA and gltB was down-regulated compared with the control, while that of gdhA was up-regulated. At an initial concentration of 1–10 mg L−1, 98–100% of the ammonium was removed by day 6 of cultivation. Therefore, these findings suggest that Synechococcus sp.

Nevertheless, the possible involvement of activated microglia in this comorbidity has remained unclear. This paper aims to review microglial disturbances in major depression, CFS and their comorbidity. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed / MEDLINE database to identify studies, which are relevant to this current review. Depressed patients present neuroinflammatory alterations, probably related to microglial activation, while animal models show that a microglial response to immune challenges including lipopolysaccharides is accompanied by depressive-like behaviors. Recent evidence from preclinical studies indicates that activated microglia have a key role in the onset of fatigue. In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as infections and senescence, microglia orchestrate an inflammatory microenvironment thereby causing fatigue. In conclusion, based on our review we may posit that shared immune-inflammatory pathways and especially activated microglia underpin comorbid depression and CFS. As such, microglial activation and neuro-inflammation may be promising targets to treat the overlapping manifestations of both depression and CFS.",neuroscience,Behavioral Neuroscience

The investigated parameters are treatment time, solvent concentration, applied pulsed frequency, and CSW concentration. The %yield of total reducing sugar (TRS) and glucose were calculated by DNS method and glucose assay kit, respectively. The chemical structure, morphology, and crystal structure of plasma-treated CSW were investigated. The results showed that the %yield of TRS was greatly enhanced by SPP treatment compared to that of acid hydrolysis. The CSW powder completely broke down into pieces after SPP treatment was applied. The amorphous and crystalline regions of CSW were destroyed during SPP treatment. SPP treatment of CSW with light sulfuric acid concentration of 0.08 M, applied pulsed frequency of 30 kHz, and CSW concentration of 0.5%w/v provided 99.0% TRS and 47.9% glucose.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Bayesian flexible mixture model (BFMM) is a model-based RS which extends FMM from single-criterion to MC. However, results of BFMM have a preference on different rating pattern problem. In single-criterion, FMM with decoupled normalization and W’s transposed function try to solve this problem. However, these techniques are applied to each criterion separately. Then, the relationship among criteria will be lost. This paper aims to solve different rating pattern problems and loss of the relationship between criteria. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method is combining between BFMM and rating conversion. First, mean and variance normalization is applied to make MC ratings of an active user and a neighbor lying on the same plane. After that, a pattern of each user is extracted using principal component analysis (PCA). Next, the pattern is used to convert neighbors’ MC ratings to the active user aspect. After that, converted MC ratings of neighbors are aggregated to be overall ratings using multiple linear regression (MLR). Finally, overall rating of the active user toward the target item is predicted using weighted average on the derived neighbors’ overall ratings where the similarity from BFMM acts as a weight. Findings: The experimental results show that the proposed method where all criteria ratings are converted simultaneously can improve the performance of recommendation. Originality/value: The proposed method predicts overall rating of the active user by converting MC ratings of each neighbor to the active user aspect at the same time, which can reduce the loss of the relationship between criteria.","mixing and separation, computer science","Information Systems, Computer Networks and Communications"

Simple and effective technology for sustainable biodiesel production using high-power household fruit blender,"Wongsawaeng D., Ngaosuwan K., Kiatkittipong W., Laosuttiwong T., Chanthon N., Kanjanapaparkul K., Assabumrungrat S.",2019-11-10,"Biodiesel production, External heating, FAME, Heat and mass transfer, High rotational speed, Household fruit blender, Refined palm oil, Synergistic effect, Biodiesel, FAME, Household fruit blender, Yield efficiency","A commercial household fruit blender is proposed as a simple, less time-consuming, and effective biodiesel production technique in this research work. Biodiesel was successfully produced in a 1200 W commercial household fruit blender. Due to the synergistic effect derived from the very high rotational speed of the blender blades integrated with micro-mixing level from cavitation phenomena, heat and mass transfer became greatly enhanced. The vigorous stirring inherently increased the temperature of the methanol-oil mixture to greater than 60 °C in less than 3 min, thus, a provision of external heating was not required. With a methanol to fresh refined palm oil molar ratio of 6:1 and 1 wt% sodium hydroxide catalyst, the FAME yield of 94.5% can be achieved in less than 3 min with the yield efficiency of 33.8 × 10−4 g/J for 500 mL of reaction volume. For 1000 mL of reaction volume at 1 min of reaction time, the FAME yield of 79.9% can be achieved with the yield efficiency of 122.3 × 10−4 g/J. Properties of the produced FAME comply with the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. In conclusion, these results indicate that a high-power commercial household fruit blender can be utilized to produce biodiesel economically and effectively.","mixing and separation, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Prolonged release of iloprost enhances pulpal blood flow and dentin bridge formation in a rat model of mechanical tooth pulp exposure,"Limjeerajarus C.N., Sonntana S., Pajaree L., Kansurang C., Pitt S., Saowapa T., Prasit P.",2019-01-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Animals, Cells, Cultured, Delayed-Action Preparations, Dental Pulp, Dentin, Humans, Iloprost, Middle Aged, Models, Animal, Rats, Regional Blood Flow, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, Young Adult, Angiogenesis, Dental pulp, Direct pulp capping, Iloprost, PLGA","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of prolonged release of iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, on angiogenesis and dental pulp healing in a rat model of mechanical pulp exposure. The profile of iloprost release from poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres was evaluated, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA was determined. The molars of rats were subjected to mechanical pulp exposure and 5 different forms of treatment: Ca(OH) 2 , PLGA (blank), iloprost, and iloprost/PLGA. Blood flow was determined at 0, 3, and 7 days using laser Doppler flowmetry. After 30 days, the tooth specimens were collected, and subjected to micro-CT and immunohistological analysis. The results showed that iloprost release from the microspheres was prolonged for 4 days, and that the treatment increased tooth blood flow for up to 7 days. At 30 days, an increase of mineralized tissue formation and dentin bridge formation was observed in the iloprost and iloprost/PLGA microsphere groups. VEGF expression was significantly increased in the iloprost/PLGA microsphere group relative to the other groups. In conclusion, this PLGA microsphere iloprost delivery system significantly increased dental pulp blood flow in a prolonged manner and increased tertiary dentin formation in this rat pulp injury model. Prolonged prostacyclin release could be a potentially useful approach for regeneration of dental pulp.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
Viral Capsid Trafficking along Treadmilling Tubulin Filaments in Bacteria,"Chaikeeratisak V., Khanna K., Nguyen K.T., Sugie J., Egan M.E., Erb M.L., Vavilina A., Nonejuie P., Nieweglowska E., Pogliano K., Agard D.A., Villa E., Pogliano J.",2019-06-13,"Bacterial Proteins, Capsid Proteins, Cytoskeleton, DNA, Viral, Pseudomonas, Pseudomonas Phages, Tubulin, Virion, capsid distribution, capsid trafficking, giant phage, nuclear rotation, phage nucleus, PhuZ, Pseudomonas phage, treadmilling","Bacteriophage-encoded tubulin-like proteins form treadmilling filaments in their bacterial host to transport viral capsids to the subcellular compartment where phage DNA is replicated and transcribed. Cargo trafficking along microtubules is exploited by eukaryotic viruses, but no such examples have been reported in bacteria. Several large Pseudomonas phages assemble a dynamic, tubulin-based (PhuZ) spindle that centers replicating phage DNA sequestered within a nucleus-like structure. Here, we show that capsids assemble on the membrane and then move rapidly along PhuZ filaments toward the phage nucleus for DNA packaging. The spindle rotates the phage nucleus, distributing capsids around its surface. PhuZ filaments treadmill toward the nucleus at a constant rate similar to the rate of capsid movement and the linear velocity of nucleus rotation. Capsids become trapped along mutant static PhuZ filaments that are defective in GTP hydrolysis. Our results suggest a transport and distribution mechanism in which capsids attached to the sides of filaments are trafficked to the nucleus by PhuZ polymerization at the poles, demonstrating that the phage cytoskeleton evolved cargo-trafficking capabilities in bacteria.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"
2019 Thai General Election: A Twitter Analysis,"Prasertdum C., Wichadakul D.",2019-01-01,"Correlation coefficient, Election, General Elections, Message distribution, Political parties, Social media minings, Twitter, Twitter Analysis, Election, Social media mining, Twitter","Elections are the most important part in the democracy. The general election in Thailand was held on 24 March 2019. It was the first vote in the last five years since the seizure of power by the military coup leaded by General Prayut Chan-o-cha. A social media has become a part of daily life with a real time message distribution including sharing an opinion in politics. Twitter becomes the most widely used tool for creating trends by political parties and politicians. In this paper, we propose an analysis of election result according to data analysis from Twitter and Election Commission of Thailand (ECT). We used Twitter Advanced Search to collect data within three months from January 1 to March 31, 2019. We found the top keywords and hashtags trended on Twitter as the Future Forward Party (FFP). Meanwhile, the winner of the popular vote was the Palang Pracharat Party. We found no correlation between the number of retweets and votes as only one party got the outstanding number of retweets. From the analysis of retweeters’ accounts, the characteristics of retweeters of the Future Forward Party differed from the retweeters of other parties. We then refined the analysis based on the sentiment of messages mentioning the political parties tweeted by the retweeters. The correlation coefficient between the number of positive mentions and votes became 0.615 with the removal of the FFP from the analysis. In addition, we found that the number of messages with a specific political party mentioned might reflect the election results. Finally, the TF-IDF analysis of words from the tweet messages during the campaign showed that words delivered by each party had different contextual meanings such as paying attention to people, party’s policy, complaint, and blame.","computer scienceuter software, data handling and applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)"
Translation-based embedding model for rating conversion in recommender systems,"Tengkiattrakul P., Maneeroj S., Takasu A.",2019-10-14,"Accuracy prediction, Conversion methods, Explicit feedback, Movielens, Rating pattern, Collaborative Filtering, Rating Conversion, Recommender Systems","Ratings, which are explicit feedback, are the most popular form that is often used in Recommender System (RSs). However, using the actual ratings from neighbors to predict ratings of target user toward target item often leads to low accuracy prediction due to the improper rating range problem. Rating conversion methods are proposed to solve this problem over the past few years. To propose rating conversion method, each user’s preference or rating pattern is needed. Some studies adopt the idea from translation-based embedding model and represent user’s preference in graph form. Although some studies represent users, items, and relations in embedding vector form, their representation may be improper and inaccurate if the rating pattern of each user is not in the same range. These vectors still suffer from the improper rating range as well. In this work, we propose a translation-based embedding model with rating conversion in RSs. We aim to solve the improper rating range problem in translation-based embedding model. Our challenges are 1) representing the relation (rating) between a pair of user and item in vector form, instead of scalar form and 2) dealing with rating conversion of user’s rating in vector form. The FilmTrust and MovieLens dataset are used in experiments comparing the proposed method with the existing methods. The evaluation showed that the proposed rating conversion method provides better accuracy results in term of both rating prediction and ranking recommendation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications"
