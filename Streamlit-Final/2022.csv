Multilocus Sequence Typing and Virulence Potential of Vibrio parahaemolyticus Strains Isolated from Aquatic Bird Feces,"Muangnapoh C., Tamboon E., Supha N., Toyting J., Chitrak A., Kitkumthorn N., Ekchariyawat P., Iida T., Suthienkul O.",2022-06-01,"Animals, Birds, Feces, Humans, Multilocus Sequence Typing, Thailand, Vibrio Infections, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Virulence, Virulence Factors, aquatic bird feces, multilocus sequence typing, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, virulence genes, whole-genome analysis","Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative, foodborne pathogenic bacterium that causes human gastroenteritis. This organism is ubiquitously present in the marine environment. Detection of V. parahaemolyticus in aquatic birds has been previously reported; however, the characterization of isolates of this bacterium recovered from these birds remains limited. The present study isolated and characterized V. parahaemolyticus from aquatic bird feces at the Bangpu Recreation Center (Samut Prakan province, Thailand) from 2016 to 2017, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and genome analysis. The results showed that V. parahaemolyticus was present in 34.9% (76/218) of the collected bird fecal samples. Among the ldh-positive V. parahaemolyticus isolates (n = 308), 1% (3/308) were positive for tdh, 1.3% (4/308) were positive for trh, and 0.3% (1/308) were positive for both tdh and trh. In turn, the MLST analysis revealed that 49 selected V. parahaemolyticus isolates resolved to 36 STs, 26 of which were novel (72.2%). Moreover, a total of 10 identified STs were identical to globally reported pathogenic strains (ST1309, ST1919, ST491, ST799, and ST2516) and environmental strains (ST1879, ST985, ST288, ST1925, and ST260). The genome analysis of isolates possessing tdh and/or trh (ST985, ST1923, ST1924, ST1929 and ST2516) demonstrated that the organization of the T3SS2a and T3SS2b genes in bird fecal isolates were almost identical to those of human clinical strains posing public health concerns of pathogen dissemination in the recreational area. The results of this study suggest that aquatic birds are natural reservoirs of new strains with high genetic diversity and are alternative sources of potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in the marine environment. IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, infection of foodborne bacterium V. parahamolyticus occurs via the consumption of undercooked seafood contaminated with pathogenic strains. Aquatic bird is a neglectable source that can transmit V. parahaemolyticus along coastal areas. This study reported the detection of potentially pathogenic V. parahamolyticus harboring virulence genes from aquatic bird feces at the recreational center situated near the Gulf of Thailand. These strains shared identical genetic profile to the clinical isolates that previously reported in many countries. Furthermore, the strains from aquatic birds showed extremely high genetic diversity. Our research pointed out that the aquatic bird is possibly involved in the evolution of novel strains of V. parahaemolyticus and play a role in dissimilation of the potentially pathogenic strains across geographical distance.","biochemistryistry, environmental, Immunology, medical","Physiology, Ecology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Cell Biology, Infectious Diseases"
Third Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations on colorectal cancer screening and postpolypectomy surveillance,"Sung J.J.Y., Chiu H.-M., Lieberman D., Kuipers E.J., Rutter M.D., MacRae F., Yeoh K.-G., Ang T.L., Chong V.H., John S., Li J., Wu K., Ng S.S.M., Makharia G.K., Abdullah M., Kobayashi N., Sekiguchi M., Byeon J.-S., Kim H.-S., Parry S., Cabral-Prodigalidad P.A.I., Wu D.-C., Khomvilai S., Lui R.N., Wong S., Lin Y.-M., Dekker E.",2022-08-24,"Adenoma, Asia, Colonic Polyps, Colonoscopy, Colorectal Neoplasms, Consensus, Early Detection of Cancer, Humans, Unknown","The Asia-Pacific region has the largest number of cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and one of the highest levels of mortality due to this condition in the world.

Complications related to orthognathic surgery: A 10-year experience in oral and maxillofacial training center,"Damrongsirirat N., Kaboosaya B., Siriwatana K., Subbalekha K., Jansisyanont P., Pimkhaokham A.",2022-03-01,"Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Operative Time, Orthognathic Surgery, Orthognathic Surgical Procedures, Postoperative Complications, Postoperative Period, Retrospective Studies, Young Adult, Complication, Dentofacial deformity, Orthognathic surgery","This article aimed to review adverse events and complications to orthognathic surgery based upon 10 years. This study was a retrospective investigation between 2009 and 2018. Independent variables such as sex, age, pre-operative conditions, diagnosis, type of surgery, bleeding volume, surgery duration, and hospitalization were recorded. The data regarding orthognathic surgery adverse events and complications were evaluated and statistically analyzed with a significance level of p < 0.05. A total of 891 patients were included in this study (male 39.1%, female 60.9%) with a mean age of 26.4 ± 6.09 years. A neurosensory disturbance was found as immediate post-operative sequelae as 93.5%. The four most frequent complications had a relapse (6.4%), post-operative TMD (5.7%), unfavorable osteotomy (5.5%), and infection (4.9%), which seem to be more common in males. An average blood loss was 497 ± 371 ml and the average operative time was 401 ± 109.3 min. Complication rates were statistically affected by bleeding volume (p-value = 0.01), operative time (p-value = 0.03), and type of skeletal deformity (p-value = 0.01). Although numerous complications were recorded, no fatal complications were experienced. Bleeding time, operative time, and skeletal classification have significant influence on orthognathic surgery complications. However, a multitude of factors could be modified to reduce the complication rate and improve the result of the treatment. One of the most significant factors was the operative time.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"
Responsiveness of the UW Concerns about Pain Scale and UW Pain-Related Self-Efficacy Scale in Individuals with Chronic Low Back Pain,"Akkarakittichoke N., Janwantanakul P., Kanlayanaphotporn R., Jensen M.P.",2022-07-25,"Chronic Pain, Disability Evaluation, Humans, Low Back Pain, Pain Measurement, Self Efficacy, Surveys and Questionnaires, catastrophizing, chronic low back pain, minimal clinically important difference, pain-related self-efficacy, responsiveness","Objectives: The aim was to examine the responsiveness, presence of floor or ceiling effects, and minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for 2 new measures of pain-related catastrophizing and self-efficacy in individuals with chronic low back pain. Methods: A total of 183 individuals with chronic low back pain recruited from physical therapy clinics in Thailand completed the Thai versions of the 6-item University of Washington Concerns About Pain scale (T-UW-CAP6) and 6-item University of Washington Pain-Related Self-Efficacy scale (T-UW-PRSE6) at baseline and at 4 weeks follow-up. Perceived change in low back symptom was assessed at 4 weeks using a 7-point measure of Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Responsiveness of the T-UW-CAP6 and the T-UW-PRSE6 scale scores were evaluated by computing the effect sizes and standardized response means for change over time, and examining these as a function of the GPE ratings. Floor and ceiling effects were examined by evaluating the score distributions. Scale core MCIDs were estimated by computing a half a SD and SE of measurement statistics for each scale. Results: Responsiveness of the scales to pain treatment was supported by differences found in the mean change scores as a function of the treatment response categories. No significant floor or ceiling effects were found for either measure. Changes of 4.38 and 3.68 appeared to be the smallest change score perceived as clinical meaningful for the T-UW-CAP6 and T-UW-PRSE 6 scale scores, respectively. Discussion: The T-UW-CAP6 and T-UW-PRSE6 demonstrated good ability to detect perceived changes over time in patients with chronic low back pain. The MCIDs values provide a benchmark for assessing individual improvement in this clinical context.","orthopedic surgery, medical","Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"
Did variants in inborn errors of immunity genes contribute to the extinction of Neanderthals?,"Zhou Z., Swagemakers S.M.A., Lourens M.S., Suratannon N., Der Spek P.J.V., Dalm V.A.S.H., Dik W.A., Ijspeert H., Hagen P.M.V.",2022-01-01,"Animals, Genome, Genome, Human, Humans, Membrane Proteins, Neanderthals, Cytotoxicity, Denisovan, Glycosylation, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocystosis (HLH), HLA, Inborn errors of immunity (IEI), Innate immunity, MHC I presentation, MOGS, Neanderthals, SARS-Cov2, UNC13D, Viral infection","Background: Neanderthals were a species of archaic humans that became extinct around 40,000 years ago. Modern humans have inherited 1-6% of Neanderthal DNA as a result of interbreeding. These inherited Neanderthal genes have paradoxical influences, while some can provide protection to viral infections, some others are associated with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory diseases. Objective: We aim to investigate whether genetic variants with strong detrimental effects on the function of the immune system could have potentially contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthal population. Methods: We used the publically available genome information from an Altai Neanderthal and filtered for potentially damaging variants present in genes associated with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and checked whether these variants were present in the genomes of the Denisovan, Vindija and Chagyrskaya Neanderthals. Results: We identified 24 homozygous variants and 15 heterozygous variants in IEI-related genes in the Altai. Neanderthal. Two homozygous variants in the UNC13D gene and one variant in the MOGS gene were present in all archaic genomes. Defects in the UNC13D gene are known to cause a severe and often fatal disease called. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis (HLH). One of these variants p.(N943S) has been reported in patients with HLH. Variants in MOGS are associated with glycosylation defects in the immune system affecting the susceptibility for infections. Conclusion: Although the exact functional impact of these three variants needs further elucidation, we speculate that they could have resulted in an increased susceptibility to severe diseases and may have contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals after exposure to specific infections.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Single-step fabrication of highly stable amorphous TiO2 nanotubes arrays (am-TNTA) for stimulating gas-phase photoreduction of CO2 to methane,"Santos J.S., Fereidooni M., Marquez V., Arumugam M., Tahir M., Praserthdam S., Praserthdam P.",2022-02-01,"Amorphous TiO, Amorphous TiO2, CH 4, CH4 production, CO 2 reduction, CO2 photoreduction, Gas-phases, Nanotube arrays, Photo reduction, TiO 2 nanotube, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nanotubes, Titanium, Amorphous TiO2, CH4 production, CO2 photoreduction, Surface defects, TiO2 nanotubes","This study investigates the facile fabrication of interfacial defects assisted amorphous TiO2 nanotubes arrays (am-TNTA) for promoting gas-phase CO2 photoreduction to methane. The am-TNTA catalyst was fabricated via a one-step synthesis, without heat treatment, by anodization of Titanium in Ethylene glycol-based electrolyte in a shorter anodizing time. The samples presented a TiO2 nanostructured array with a nanotubular diameter of 100 ± 10 nm, a wall thickness of 26 ± 5 nm, and length of 3.7 ± 0.3 μm, resulting in a specific surface of 0.75 m2 g. The am-TNTA presented prolonged chemical stability, a high exposed surface area, and a large number of surface traps that can reduce the recombination of the charge carriers. The am-TNTA showed promising photoactivity when tested in the CO2 reduction reaction with water under UV irradiation with a methane production rate of 14.0 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for a pure TiO2 material without any modification procedure. This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be explained in terms of surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups that can act as electron traps for increasing the electron lifetime. The CO2 interacts directly with those traps, forming carbonate species, which favors the catalytic conversion to methane. The am-TNTA also exhibited a high stability during six reaction cycles. The photocatalytic activity, the significantly reduced time for synthesis, and high stability for continuous CH4 production make this nanomaterial a potential candidate for a sustainable CO2 reduction process and can be employed for other energy applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Spectrophotometric studies of complex formation, chemical structures and purity of the hydrogel sensor were carried out using TGA, NMR, TEM, and IR. The complexation study results indicated that this probe can selectively detect Au3+ via a metal ion chelation-induced ring-opening reaction, and then caused a remarkable colour change from colourless to pink and a strong fluorescence enhancement. Theoretical DFT calculation results suggested that the hydrogel sensor Arg-Rhoen formed stable complexes with Au3+ through a large number of cation–dipole interactions. Reusability has been established by repeatedly dipping and rinsing the hydrogel in aqueous Au3+ and EDTA in basic solutions. We believe that this approach may provide an easily measurable and inherently sensitive method for Au3+ detection in environmental and biological applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

In comparison to boiling, saturated steam under pressure in an autoclave caused more potential bioactive substances in beans to be released. Potential bioactive compound content and antioxidant activities of cooked beans and cooking water from autoclaving for 60 min and 10 min (A60 and A10) were higher than boiling for 60 min (B60). In vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion revealed that the digestible fractions from A10 and A60 had higher antioxidant, ACE-I inhibitory, and DPP-IV inhibitory activities than B60 in the digestible fraction of adzuki beans paste. Cooking conditions and digestive enzyme cleavage influenced the exposure of specific antioxidant functional groups and hydrophobic groups. Catechin and vitexin were found to be the most abundant phenolics in all digestible fractions, whereas p-courmaric acid, sinapic acid, and syringic acid were found in digestible fractions from A10 but not B60 or A60. According to these findings, A10 could be recommended for cooking adzuki bean since it not only provides health-promoting actions of bean paste after in vitro digestion but it also reduces cooking time.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

When monotherapy of either primary treatment fails to control symptoms, combined medical therapy is an option. In this meta-analysis we assessed the additional effects of different medical combinations compared with primary treatments. Methods: Systematic searches on PubMed and EMBASE were updated on November 4, 2021. Randomized, controlled trials comparing the effects of combinations with monotherapy were included. There were 7 comparisons: (1) ATH-decongestant vs ATH; (2) ATH-leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) vs ATH; (3) INCS-ATH vs INCS; (4) INCS-LTRA vs INCS; (5) INCS-decongestion vs INCS; (6) INCS-saline irrigation vs INCS; and (7) ATH-saline irrigation vs ATH. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Outcomes were composite nasal symptom score, composite ocular symptom score, quality of life (QoL), and adverse events. Results: Fifty-three studies were included. Compared with ATH alone, the ATH-decongestant combination improved composite nasal symptoms; ATH-LTRA improved nasal symptoms in patients with perennial AR; and ATH-nasal saline improved both symptoms and QoL. Compared with INCS alone, the INCS-intranasal ATH combination improved nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms, and QoL; INCS-LTRA improved ocular symptoms but not nasal symptoms; and INCS-nasal saline improved QoL but not symptoms. There were no additional effects observed from adding oral ATH or topical decongestant to INCS. Conclusion: After ATH monotherapy fails to control symptoms, addition of decongestant, saline, or LTRA can improve the outcomes. When INCS monotherapy is ineffective, addition of intranasal ATH can improve nasal symptoms; LTRA can improve ocular symptoms, and saline irrigation can improve QoL.",medical,"Immunology and Allergy, Otorhinolaryngology"

Nowadays, only direct per-oral cholangioscopy (DPOC) and digital single-operator cholangioscopy (DS) are performed in daily practice. With better image resolution, POC is increasingly used as diagnostic tools in patients with suspected malignant biliary stricture (MBS). We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of digital/video cholangioscopes for the diagnosis of MBS. Methods: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases until April 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective studies using digital or video POC. The meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy study was performed to calculate summary estimates of the primary outcomes, including pooled sensitivity, and specificity of POC to diagnose MBS using bivariate random-effects models. Tissue histopathology was used as the reference standard for MBS diagnosis. For benign stricture, negative tissue histopathology and at least 6 months clinical follow-up were required. Results: Thirteen original articles with 876 patients were identified. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity were 88 (95% CI 83–91) and 95 (95% CI 89–98), respectively. The area under the curve (AUROC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.96). Subgroup analysis showed that cholangioscopic image impression provided significantly higher sensitivity (93% (95% CI 88–96) vs 82% (95% CI 76–87); p = 0.007), but lower specificity 86% (95% CI 75–92) vs 98 (95% CI 95–99); p < 0.001) than the tissue diagnosis from cholangioscopic-guided biopsy. In addition, biopsy obtained from DPOC had significantly higher sensitivity than that of DS (92% (95% CI 81–97) vs 79% (95% CI 72–84); p = 0.004). Diagnostic performance under image-enhanced endoscopy was not significantly better from white light endoscopy. Conclusions: Digital/video POC has very high diagnostic performance to diagnose MBS. While image diagnosis provides higher sensitivity than biopsy, its specificity drops as a trade-off.",medical,Surgery

Furthermore, after adjustment for fasting blood glucose concentration, RTL was negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with (Formula presented.) O2max (mL/kg FFM/min). We found that normal weight women had longer RTL than obese women (p < 0.001). We suggest that RTL is negatively correlated with RMRAB and positively correlated with aerobic capacity, possibly via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Furthermore, age and obesity influenced the associations. We provide useful information for the management of promotion strategies for health-related physical fitness in women.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

It has been speculated that the presence of a high number of reticulocytes in newborns interferes with the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency since reticulocytes contain higher amounts of G6PD enzyme than mature erythrocytes. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of reticulocytosis in the determination of blood G6PD activity in Thai newborns by using a novel automated UV-based enzymatic assay and to validate the performance of this assay for the detection of G6PD deficiency in newborn samples. Methods: The levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity were measured in blood samples collected from 1,015 newborns. G6PD mutations were identified using TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay, PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP), and direct sequencing. The correlation between the levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity was examined. The performance of the automated method was compared with that of the fluorescent spot test (FST) and the standard quantitative assay. Results: The automated assay detected G6PD deficiency in 6.5% of the total newborn subjects compared to 5.3% and 6.1% by the FST and the standard method, respectively. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of G6PD ViangchanG871A, G6PD MahidolG487A, and G6PD UnionC1360T were 0.066, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively. The reticulocyte counts in newborns with G6PD deficiency were significantly higher than those in normal male newborns (p < 0.001). Compared with normal newborns after controlling for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, G6PD-deficient patients with the G6PD ViangchanG871A mutation exhibited elevated reticulocyte counts (5.82 ± 1.73%, p < 0.001). In a group of G6PD normal newborns, the percentage of reticulocytes was positively correlated with G6PD activity (r = 0.327, p < 0.001). However, there was no correlation between G6PD activity and the levels of reticulocytes in subjects with G6PD deficiency (r = -0.019, p = 0.881). The level of agreement in the detection of G6PD deficiency was 0.999, while the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve demonstrated that the automated method had 98.4% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, 92.4% positive predictive value (PPV), 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 99.4% accuracy. Conclusions: We report that reticulocytosis does not have a statistically significant effect on the detection of G6PD deficiency in newborns by both qualitative and quantitative methods.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Regulating solvation structure to stabilize zinc anode by fastening the free water molecules with an inorganic colloidal electrolyte,"Cao J., Zhang D., Yue Y., Chanajaree R., Wang S., Han J., Zhang X., Qin J., Huang Y.",2022-03-01,"Dendrite, Inorganic colloidal electrolyte, Inorganics, Ion batteries, Solvation structure, Water molecule, Zinc anodes, Zinc ions, Zinc-ion battery, Zn 2+, Dendrites, Inorganic colloidal electrolyte, Solvation structure, Zinc anode, Zinc-ion battery","The main obstacle for developing aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with long-term stability lies in the suppression of side reactions and zinc dendrites, which are derived from decomposition of active water molecules belonging to Zn2+ solvation layer in the electrolyte. Herein, an inorganic colloidal electrolyte composed of lithium magnesium silicate and zinc sulfate (LMS+ZSO) is utilized to improve the reversibility of Zn plating/stripping behavior for high-performance ZIBs. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical results, LMS's superior adsorption capacity for water molecules modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure via converting the free water molecules into adsorbed water of LMS and weakening the electrostatic coupling of anions and cations, thus restraining the corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and by-products. Concomitantly, the LMS lowers the energy barrier of de-solvation process to promote the Zn2+ ions transfer kinetics and induce the homogeneous deposition, thus inhibiting the dendrites formation. Consequently, the cycling stability of symmetric battery and zinc-based full battery are significantly boosted with LMS+ZSO electrolyte. This reasonable and effective strategy offers a promising prospect for developing long life ZIBs.","corrosion, energy, Materials Science, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Extreme adaptive optics systems, such as the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch facility (SPHERE), push forward the limits in high contrast and high resolution in direct imaging. The main objectives of these instruments are exoplanet detection and characterisation. Aims. We aim to increase the contrast limits to detect new satellites orbiting known asteroids. We use cutting-edge data reduction techniques and data processing algorithms that are essential to best analyse the raw data provided by the instruments and increase their performances. Doing so, the unequalled performances of SPHERE also make it a unique tool to resolve and study asteroids in the solar system, expanding the domain of its main science targets. Methods. We applied a newly developed data reduction pipeline for integral field spectrographs on archival SPHERE data of a resolved asteroid, (130) Elektra. It was coupled with a dedicated point spread function reconstruction algorithm to model the asteroid halo. Following the halo removal, the moon signal could be extracted more accurately. The moon positions were fitted at three epochs and were used to derive the orbital parameters via a genetic-based algorithm. Results. We announce the discovery of S/2014 (130) 2, a third moon orbiting (130) Elektra, making it the first quadruple asteroid ever found. It is identified in three different epochs, 9, 30, and 31 Dec. 2014, at a respective angular separation of 258 mas (333 km), 229 mas (327 km), and 319 mas (457 km). We estimate that this moon has a period of 0.679 ± 0.001 day and a semi-major axis of 344 ± 5 km, with an eccentricity of 0.33 ± 0.05 and an inclination of 38° ±19° compared to the primary rotation axis.

The orbital parameters of S/2014 (130) 2 are poorly constrained due to the unfavourable configurations of the available fragmentary data. Additional observations are needed to better estimate its orbit and to suggest a formation model. This new detection nonetheless shows that dedicated data reduction and processing algorithms modelling the physics of the instruments can push their contrast limits further.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Participants resistant to lopinavir (LPV) and/or multiple nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors started on third-line regimens that included raltegravir (RAL), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) and/or etravirine (ETR) according to their resistance profiles. At 48 weeks, 87% of these participants achieved HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/ml. We report here long-term outcomes over 144 weeks. Methods: Study participants were enrolled from 2013 to 2015, prior to the availability of dolutegravir in LMICs. “Extended Follow-up” of the study started after the last participant enrolled had reached 48 weeks and included participants still on antiretroviral (ARV) regimens containing RAL, DRV/r and/or ETR at that time. RAL, DRV/r and ETR were provided for an additional 96 weeks (giving total follow-up of ≥144 weeks), with HIV-1 RNA measured at 48 and 96 weeks and CD4 count at 96 weeks after entry into Extended Follow-up. Proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/ml was estimated every 24 weeks, using imputation if necessary to handle the different measurement schedule in Extended Follow-up; mean CD4 count changes were estimated using loess regression. Results and Discussion: Of 257 participants (38% females), at study entry, median CD4 count was 179 cells/mm3, and HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies/ml. Median follow-up was 168 weeks (IQR: 156–204); 15 (6%) participants were lost to follow-up and 9 (4%) died. 27/246 (11%), 26/246 (11%) and 13/92 (14%) of participants who started RAL, DRV/r and ETR, respectively, discontinued these drugs; only three due to adverse events. 87%, 86%, 83% and 80% of the participants had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96, 144 and 168 (95% CI at week 168: 74–85%), respectively. Mean increase from study entry in CD4 count at week 168 was 265 cells/mm3 (95% CI 247–283).

Methods: Content analysis was used to evaluate drug information attached to 3 drug categories of 30 drug samples, and simulated patient studies at 247 pharmacies of selected townships in Yangon region were performed. Descriptive statistics and independent t-test were used for data analysis. Key findings: Among 30 proxy drug products, more than 80% provided information in English language both on the carton boxes and on leaflets. About 86.7% of leaflets were intended only for healthcare professional uses and not understandable for lay consumers. The simulated patient study found that overall drug information provided by dispensers was limited as confirmed by information providing mean score of 4.25 ± 2.06 out of a total of 18 points. Many other important information items such as drug name, concomitant drugs use, common side effects and when to stop taking medicine were rarely provided. None of the simulated patients received carton box or leaflet. Conclusions: This study proved that Myanmar consumers did not receive enough drug information from both the products and dispensers, and thus the provision of understandable drug information for patients is required to improve patients' safe use of medications.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, Health Professions, pharmacology, medical","Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Science, Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In this retrospective study, the secondary outcomes of those public health measures on containing other respiratory infections among the Thai population were investigated. Hospitalization data spanning from 2016 to 2021 of six respiratory infectious diseases, namely influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis (TB), were examined. First, the expected respiratory infectious cases where no public health measures are in place are estimated using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Then the expected number of cases and the observed cases were compared. The results showed a significant drop in the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases by an average of 61%. The reduction in hospitalization is significant for influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, and scarlet fever (p < 0.05), while insignificant for TB (p = 0.54). The notable decrease in the incidence of cases is ascribed to the implementation of public health measures that minimized the opportunity for spread of disease. This decline in cases following relaxation of pandemic countermeasure is contingent on its scope and nature, and it is proof that selective physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public places is a viable route for mitigating respiratory morbidities.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

cGAS deficiency enhances inflammasome activation in macrophages and inflammatory pathology in pristane-induced lupus,"Kumpunya S., Thim-uam A., Thumarat C., Leelahavanichkul A., Kalpongnukul N., Chantaravisoot N., Pisitkun T., Pisitkun P.",2022-12-16,"Animals, Autoantibodies, DNA, Inflammasomes, Macrophages, Mice, Nucleotidyltransferases, autoimmune, cGAS, dsDNA, inflammasomes, lupus, macrophages, non-canonical, STING","Introduction: Type I interferon (IFN) plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes dsDNA and creates cGAMP to activate STING-mediated type I IFN production. The activation of STING induces lupus disease in Fcgr2b deficient mice through the differentiation of dendritic cells. In contrast, Cgas-deficient mice could be generated more autoantibody production and proteinuria in pristane-induced lupus (PIL). These data suggested that the other dsDNA sensors could be involved in lupus development mechanisms. Methods: This study aimed to identify the cGAS-mediated mechanisms contributing to lupus pathogenesis in PIL. The Cgas-deficient and WT mice were induced lupus disease with pristane and subsequently analyzed autoantibody, histopathology, and immunophenotypes. The lung tissues were analyzed with the expression profiles by RT-PCR and western blot. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with inflammasome activators and observed pyroptosis. Results: The Cgas-/- mice developed more severe pulmonary hemorrhage and autoantibody production than WT mice. The activated dendritic cells, IFN-g-, and IL-17a-producing T helper cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung were detected in Cgas-/- mice higher than in WT mice. We observed an increase in expression of Aim2, Casp11, and Ifi16 in the lung and serum IL-1a but IL-1b in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice. The rise of Caspase-11 in the lung of pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggested noncanonical inflammasome activation. The activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the number of dead cells in Cgas-/- mice compared with WT mice. Activation of the inflammasome significantly induced pyroptosis in Cgas-/- BMDMs. The dsDNA level, but not mitochondrial DNA, increased dramatically in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggesting the dsDNA could be a ligand activating inflammasomes. The cGAS agonist-induced BMDM activation in the Cgas-/- mice indicated that the activation of DNA sensors other than cGAS enhanced activated macrophages. Conclusion: These findings suggested that cGAS hampers the unusual noncanonical inflammasome activation through other DNA sensors.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Arcuate proopiomelanocortin is part of a novel neural connection for short-term low-degree of high ambient temperature effects on food intake.,"Suwannapaporn P., Chaiyabutr N., Wanasuntronwong A., Thammacharoen S.",2022-03-01,"Animals, Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus, Eating, Hypothalamus, Pro-Opiomelanocortin, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos, Rats, Temperature, Ambient temperature, Anorexia, Arcuate nucleus, POMC, Rat","High ambient temperature (HTa) is an important environmental factor influencing food intake (FI). We previously demonstrated that low-degree HTa exposure decreased FI earlier than activated physiological responses, and this effect was related to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and arcuate nucleus (Arc) connection. The present study refines the condition of low-degree HTa exposure and focuses on the mechanism of Arc neural activation. We demonstrated in the first experiment that with the usual ambient temperature (Ta) at 23 °C, the low degree HTa condition is at a 7 °C temperature difference and with 90 min exposure. Rats exposed to this short-term low-degree HTa had significantly lower 1-h FI than those exposed to control Ta (CTa) without differences in rectal temperature and hematocrit. Under nonfeeding conditions, HTa could enhance c-Fos at the Arc without the activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Under feeding conditions, HTa could enhance both c-Fos and POMC at Arc. In addition, the number of c-Fos and POMC colocalizations in the HTa group was higher than that in the CTa group. Finally, intracerebral preinfusion with a subthreshold dose of the melanocortin antagonist SHU9119 reversed the effect of low-degree HTa exposure on FI. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of short-term low-degree HTa exposure on FI in rats is mediated in part by activation of POMC neurons at the Arc. The results partially support the hypothesis that Arc is a crucial hypothalamic nucleus for the effect of low-degree HTa exposure on FI.","psychology, neuroscience","Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience"
Evaluation of modified biofloc system with filtration unit in controlling suspended solids and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in a recirculating aquaculture system,"Kunwong S., Satanwat P., Powtongsook S., Pungrasmi W., Nootong K.",2022-04-01,"Bio-flocs technologies, Bioflocs, Bioprocesses, Filtration unit, In-phase, Oxygen consumption rate, Suspended solids, Technology system, Waste minimization, Waste treatment and waste minimization, aquaculture, bioprocesses, environmental technology, filtration, nitrification, waste treatment and waste minimization","BACKGROUND: Biofloc technology systems (BFT) often encounter difficulties in controlling suspended solid levels in tanks. The oxygen consumption rates and ammonia removal rates of bioflocs as the BFT system shifts from assimilation towards nitrification have rarely been reported. Thus, the performance of the BFT system with a filtration unit was evaluated. RESULTS: Preliminary work found that the optimal screen pore size and recirculating flow rate were 100 μm and 3000 L day−1, respectively. The BFT system with the filtration unit could maintain suspended solids in the fish tank below 50 mg-SS L−1 while retaining significantly higher suspended solids in the biofloc reactor (509 ± 44.6 mg-SS L−1). The daily starch addition at a C:N mass ratio of 10:1 in phase I (day 1–38) induced the biofloc formation that kept TAN and nitrite levels below 1.0 mg-N L−1. The fraction of inorganic nitrogen compounds increased from 2.5% in phase I to 27.6% in phase III (day 56–70). TAN removal rates increased from 3.0 mg-N g-SS−1 day−1 during phase I to 10.34 ± 0.392 mg-N g-SS−1 day−1 after complete nitrification occurred. Relatively constant oxygen consumption rates of the bioflocs (149.1 ± 9.53 mg- O2 g-SS−1 day−1) were observed for the entire experiment. CONCLUSION: The BFT system with a filtration unit was effective in controlling suspended solid and inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Nitrogen treatment pathway of BFT system was assimilation during startup period but gradually shifted to nitrification. Oxygen consumption rates of the bioflocs are relatively constant regardless of the pathways responsible for nitrogen treatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, energy, environmental, chemistry","Biotechnology, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

An important feature is that there is no need for a mesh since the method works on arbitrary local groups within a set of particles. A major drawback of shape matching is the fact that it is geometrically motivated and not derived from physical principles which makes calibration difficult. The fact that the method does not conserve volume can yield visual artifacts, e.g. when a tire is compressed but does not bulge. In this paper we present a new meshless simulation method that is related to shape matching but derived from continuous constitutive models. Volume conservation and stiffness can be specified with physical parameters. Further, if the elements of a tetrahedral mesh are used as groups, our method perfectly reproduces FEM based simulations.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design
The ‘knee’ pattern in spirometry flow-volume curves in children: Does it relate to tracheomalacia?,"Boonjindasup W., Marchant J.M., McElrea M.S., Yerkovich S.T., Thomas R.J., Masters I.B., Chang A.B.",2022-11-01,"Bronchoscopy, Child, Forced Expiratory Volume, Humans, Prospective Studies, Spirometry, Tracheomalacia, Child, Diagnosis, Respiratory, Spirometry, Tracheomalacia","Background: There is little data on patterns of spirometry curves in children with tracheomalacia but convex inflection on flow-volume curves (identified as the ‘knee’) is thought to represent tracheomalacia. Objectives: To determine (a) the prevalence of tracheomalacia in children with the ‘knee’ pattern on spirometry, and (b) whether spirometry parameters and visual characteristics of the ‘knee’ can identify presence/absence or severity of tracheomalacia. Patients/methods: We reviewed the spirometry undertaken at Queensland Children's Hospital between 2016 and 2019 and retrieved spirometry with the ‘knee’ pattern in the flow-volume curves. Flexible bronchoscopy videos of these children were reviewed for tracheomalacia diagnosis and severity in a blinded manner. We also evaluated several ‘knee’ characteristics (onset of inflection, angle of inflection, a scoop before plateau, plateau progression), spirometry parameters and tracheomalacia severity. Results: Of the 78 children with the ‘knee’, 51 (65.4%) had tracheomalacia. Spirometry values were significantly lower in those with tracheomalacia, compared to those without (predicted FEV1 = 86.1% vs 99.9%, FVC = 95.1% vs 104%, FEF25–75% = 68.6% vs 89.6%, all p < 0.02).

There was no significant difference in spirometry parameters or the ‘knee’ characteristics between children with mild versus moderate-to-severe tracheomalacia. Conclusion: Most but not all children with the ‘knee’ pattern have flexible bronchoscopy-defined tracheomalacia.

The studies on the CuAl2O4 nanoparticles reveal that their formation and particle size depend upon the mole ratio of Cu to Al, and they possess a structure analogous to that of the bulk material. The X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) data along with X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the formation of a CuAl2O4–CuO–Al2O3 mixed phases. The characteristic CuAl2O4 species was dominant during the flame process when a low content of Cu to Al, such as a 1:5 mol ratio, was supplied. It was observed that the CuAl2O4 combined with the CuO and Al2O3 phases exerts a strong positive effect on the catalytic activity.

Four Mitragyna species, M. speciosa (Roxb.) Korth. (MS), M. rotundifolia (Roxb.) Kuntze (MR), M. diversifolia (Wall. ex G. Don) Havil. (MD), and M. hirsuta Havil. (MH), occur in Thailand. M. speciosa, commonly known as ‘Kratom’ in Thai, is the only narcotic species for which buying, selling, importing or possessing has been prohibited by law in Thailand and some other countries. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, the major psychoactive compounds, are important in the treatment of opioid withdrawal. However, this species is used in traditional medicine to relieve pain and inflammation. Consequently, a rapid and easy technique for differentiating M. speciosa from closely related species is needed for routine forensic analysis. In this study, polymerase chain reaction coupled with lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (PCR-LFA) based on matK was developed for the detection of M. speciosa in forensic specimens. Duplex primers (MS-F-FAM, Ctrl-F-DIG and Ctrl-R-Biotin) were designed based on species-specific nucleotide indels observed exclusively in the matK sequences of M. speciosa. Positive results for M. speciosa are indicated by the clear presence of three black lines on the lateral flow cassette. Forensic samples were investigated, and the three black test lines indicating M. speciosa were observed for seven of eight specimens. PCR-LFA has been proven to be fast, easy and efficient for detecting the narcotic M. speciosa and could be developed as a rapid forensic diagnostic technique for other plants.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine
Early development of a shaftless horizontal axis wind turbine for generating electricity from air discharged from ventilation systems,"Puttichaem W., Putivisutisak S., Boonyongmaneerat Y., Vadhanasindhud P.",2022-01-01,"Alternative source, Generate electricity, Horizontal axis wind turbines, Maximum power output, Sustainable energy development, Turbine efficiency, Turbine performance, Ventilation systems, renewable energy, shaftless wind turbine, ventilation system, waste wind energy recovery","The air discharged from ventilation systems is a high potential wind resource for generating electricity in countries where wind speed is unreliable or weak, such as in Thailand. The air discharged from ventilation systems produces consistent and high-speed wind when benchmarked against natural wind. However, the limitations of conventional wind turbines are that they have negative impacts on the ventilation system and are inconvenient to install in many areas. The innovative shaftless horizontal axis wind turbine (SHWT) introduced in this article has been designed to close the gap between the wind source and the conventional wind turbines in this process. The concept design shows how it could be mounted next to sources of waste wind, requiring only a small space for installation. An open hole is provided to enable airflow to be discharged into the environment. This SHWT has high market potential for utilizing man-made wind to generate electricity from an alternative source which supports sustainable energy development. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the concept design of a prototype SHWT used for energy recovery from the discharged air of a ventilation system. How the rotor and stator design of the SHWT optimize wind turbine performance and minimize the negative effects on the ventilation system efficiency are also addressed in this study. The performance of the SHWT is demonstrated in a lab-scale test using the type of propeller fan that is generally applied in many sectors in Thailand. The results showed that the SHWT was successful in generating electricity and produced minimal negative effects on the ventilation system's performance. The maximum power output of the prototype SHWT is 7.4 W at a rotational speed of 1644 rpm using eight sets of magnets and 5.1 m/s wind speed. The maximum wind turbine efficiency is 51%. However, it still requires further optimization to enhance the SHWT performance.","the atmosphere, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Eiken TB-LAMP among children with presumed tuberculosis disease. Methods: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens were collected from children under 18 years with presumed TB. Each specimen was tested by using TB-LAMP, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, and one of the two molecular assays (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or Xpert MTB/RIF). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated compared to mycobacterial culture as reference standard. Results: From January 2020 to January 2021, 75 participants with presumed TB were enrolled with median age of 7 years (IQR 2-12). Seventeen specimens from 16 (21.3%) children had bacteriologically confirmed TB: 10 pulmonary and 7 extrapulmonary specimens. Overall sensitivity and specificity of TB-LAMP was 76.5% (95% CI 50.1%-93.2%) and 100% (95% CI 94.3%-100%), respectively. It had significantly higher sensitivity than AFB (52.9%, 95% CI 27.8%-77.0%) and similar to other molecular assays; PCR 82.4% (95% CI 56.6%-96.2%), Xpert MTB/RIF 70.0% (95% CI 34.8%-93.3%). Sensitivity of TB-LAMP for pulmonary, lymph node tissue, and extrapulmonary fluid was 80% (95% CI 44.4%-97.5%), 100% (95% CI 39.8-100), and 33.3% (95% CI 0.8-90.6), respectively. TB-LAMP detected all smear-positive (N = 9) and 50% of smear-negative (N = 8) specimens. Conclusions: TB-LAMP had higher sensitivity than AFB microscopy and accuracy similar to other molecular assays in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens. These findings support using TB-LAMP as a point-of-care test in children.",medical,Medicine (all)

The interaction between PMMA carbonyl group and CTAB headgroup is the key mechanism inducing color transition of the nanocomposites. The sensitivity can be tuned by adjusting experimental parameters including CTAB concentration, photopolymerization time, and PDA alkyl chain length. Solid-state sensors are fabricated by embedding into filter papers. Our finding extends the utilization of PDA-based materials in polymer sensing applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)

We examined the electroporation efficiency with pulse conditions and correlated the results from the impedance measurement to the membrane openings. Dielectrophoretic force was applied to position the cell at a desired location. Temporary and permanent electroporation cells was discriminated by using a combination of Yo-Pro-1 and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent dyes. From the experiment, we determined the appropriate condition for the reversible electroporation of the canine MCT cells to be 15 sets of 2.5 \mathrm{V}_{p}, 20kHz frequency, and 50-cycle pulses. The condition yielded 50% efficiency for the reversible electroporation. In addition, the area of the cell-membrane pores could be quantitatively examined from the conductance measured without a cell and those with a cell before and after applying electroporation pulses.","process equipment, computer science, engineering, Materials Science, Mathematics, physics","Computer Science Applications, Biomedical Engineering, Biomaterials, Modeling and Simulation, Instrumentation"

Biochemical characterization shows that optimal pH and temperature for catalysis are 6.0 and 50 °C, respectively. Man26HM7 displayed excellent surfactant stability by retaining 70% of initial activity in 1%(w/v) SDS, and more than 90% of initial activity in 1%(w/v) Triton X-100 and Tween 80. Results from amino acid sequence alignment and molecular modeling suggest residue 238 of β-mannanase as a hotspot of SDS-tolerance. Mutagenesis at the equivalent residue of another homolog, β-mannanase from Bacillus subtilis CAe24 (Man26CAe24), significantly enhanced the SDS stability of this enzyme. Comparative computational analysis, including molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, were then performed to compute the binding free energy of SDS to Man26HM7, Man26CAe24, and variant enzymes. The results suggest that residue 238 of Man26HM7 is involved in SDS binding to the hydrophobic surface of β-mannanase.

As for supercapacitor electrodes, molybdenum nitrides show promising potential. Molybdenum nitrides, however, are mainly prepared as nanopowders via a chemical route and require binders for the manufacture of electrodes. Such electrodes can impair the performance of supercapacitors. Herein, binder-free chromium (Cr)-doped molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) TFEs having different Cr concentrations are prepared via a reactive co-sputtering technique. The Cr-doped Mo2N films prepared have a cubic phase structure of γ-Mo2N with a minor shift in the (111) plane. While un-doped Mo2N films exhibit a spherical morphology, Cr-doped Mo2N films demonstrate a clear pyramid-like surface morphology. The developed Cr-doped Mo2N films contain 0–7.9 at.% of Cr in Mo2N lattice. A supercapacitor using a Cr-doped Mo2N electrode having the highest concentration of Cr reveals maximum areal capacity of 2780 mC/cm2, which is much higher than that of an un-doped Mo2N electrode (110 mC/cm2). Furthermore, the Cr-doped Mo2N electrode demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving ~ 94.6% capacity retention for about 2000 cycles. The reactive co-sputtering proves to be a suitable technique for fabrication of binder-free TFEs for high-performance energy storage device applications.

Over the past decades, numerous antineoplastic compounds have been discovered from natural resources such as medicinal plants and marine species as part of multiple drug discovery initiatives. Notably, several marine flora (e.g. Ascophyllum nodosum, Sargassum thunbergii) have been identified as a rich source for novel cytotoxic compounds of different chemical forms. Despite the availability of enormous chemically enhanced new resources, the anticancer potential of marine flora and fauna has received little attention. Interestingly, numerous marine-derived secondary metabolites (e.g., Cytarabine, Trabectedin) have exhibited anticancer effects in preclinical cancer models. Most of the anticancer drugs obtained from marine sources stimulated apoptotic signal transduction pathways in cancer cells, such as the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. This review highlights the sources of different cytotoxic secondary metabolites obtained from marine bacteria, algae, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Furthermore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the utilisation of numerous marine-derived cytotoxic compounds as anticancer drugs, as well as their modes of action (e.g., molecular target).

This study aims to propose a new strategy to improve levan-type fructooligosaccharide (L-FOS) production. The effect of ISC/ LSC -mixed reaction was elucidated on L-FOS production. The presence of ISC in the LSC reaction significantly leads to the higher production of L-FOSs as the main products. Furthermore, the different ratios between ISC and LSC affected the distribution of L-FOSs. A greater amount of ISC compared to LSC promoted the synthesis of short-chain L-FOSs. Conversely, when LSC was increased, the synthesis of longer-chain L-FOSs was enhanced. The addition of trisaccharide mixtures obtained from either a single ISC or LSC reaction could enhance L-FOSs synthesis in the LSC reaction. Analysis of these trisaccharides revealed that most species of the oligosaccharides were similar, with 1-kestose being the major one. The supplement of only 1-kestose in the LSC reaction showed similar results to those of the reaction in the presence of trisaccharide mixtures. Moreover, the results were supported by molecular dynamics simulations. This work not only provides an improvement in L-FOS production but also revealed and supported some insights into the mechanism of fructansucrases.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

In the present study, a CaO modified HZSM-5 zeolite was prepared by an impregnation method and used for the conversion of glycerol to methanol. We found that the 10%CaO/HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 38 exhibited highest selectivity to methanol of 70%, with a glycerol conversion of 100% under 340 ℃ and atmospheric pressure. The characterization results showed that the introduction of a small amount of CaO into the HZSM-5 did not affect the structure of zeolite. The incorporation of HZSM-5 as an acidic catalyst and CaO as a basic catalyst in a synergistic catalysis system led to higher conversion of glycerol and selectivity of methanol.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

However, the molecular mechanisms of C3R on Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion remains unknown. This study aimed to identify C3R's mechanisms of action in pancreatic β-cells. Rat INS-1 cells were used to elucidate the effects of C3R on insulin secretion, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and gene expression. The results showed that C3R at 60, 100, and 300 µM concentrations significantly increased insulin secretion via intracellular Ca2+ signaling. The exposure of cells with C3R concentrations up to 100 μM did not affect cell viability. Pretreatment of cells with nimodipine (voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) blocker), U73122 (PLC inhibitor), and 2-APB (IP3 receptor blocker) inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ signals by C3R. Interestingly, C3R increased intracellular Ca2+ signals and insulin secretion after depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin. However, insulin secretion was abolished under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions. Moreover, C3R upregulated mRNA expression for Glut2 and Kir6.2 genes. These findings indicate that C3R stimulated insulin secretion by promoting Ca2+ influx via VDCCs and activating the PLC-IP3 pathway. C3R also upregulates the expression of genes necessary for glucose-induced insulin secretion.

Bricks being a major constituent in the construction industry, also hold a significant proportion of the construction waste generated annually. The reuse of this brick waste in new constructions is an optimal solution considering cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the problems related to the substandard peak stress and ultimate strain of concrete constructed with recycled brick aggregates (CRAs) limit its use in non-structural applications. The present study intends to improve the unsatisfactory mechanical characteristics of CRAs by utilizing low-cost glass fiber chopped strand mat (FCSM) sheets. The efficacy of FCSM sheets was assessed by wrapping them around CRA specimens constructed with different concrete strengths. A remarkable increase in the peak compressive stress and the ultimate strain of the CRA specimens were observed. For low, medium, and high strength CRAs, the ultimate strain improved by up to 320%, 308%, and 294%, respectively, as compared to the respective control specimens. Several existing analytical models were utilized to predict the peak compressive stress and ultimate strain of the CRAs strengthened using FCSM sheets. None of the considered models reproduced experimental results accurately. Therefore, equations were formulated using regression predicting the peak stress and ultimate strain of the CRAs confined with FCSM sheets. The predicted values were found to correlate well with the experimental values.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Herein, we synthesized CdS with hollow sphere (CdS-HS) structure and combined it with CoN to form CoN/CdS-HS photocatalytic system. The particular hollow sphere structure and cocatalyst CoN in the CoN/CdS-HS system increase the utilization of visible light and promote the separation and transfer of photo-generated carriers for photocatalysts, which greatly improves photocatalytic performance of materials. The time‐resolved photoluminescence spectra shows that the carrier lifetime of 15%CoN/CdS-HS is 7.52 ns, which is much larger than that of CdS (4.26 ns). In addition, the hydrogen output of the optimized 15%CoN/CdS-HS is 4.57 times superior to that of pristine CdS-HS under the same conditions. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 15%CoN/CdS-HS reaches 58.80 mmol/g.h under visible light with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 23.53% at 405 nm monochromatic light.

Detergents that are composed of surfactants and appropriate additives can decrease the natural attraction forces between particles and surface, leading to effective particle removal. This work aims to investigate the influences of detergent pH and additives on the effectiveness in removing inorganic particles from Al2O3 and AlTiC substrates, which are commonly used materials in the electronics industry. In this study, we chose a model detergent comprised of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, and two additives, namely sodium acid pyrophosphate and ethanolamine. Talc particles were employed as a model inorganic contaminant. The effects of pH and ethanolamine concentration on the cleaning effectiveness of the model detergent were examined using optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stability of talc suspension in detergent solution, which is related to the possibility of particle recontamination, was determined by zeta potential. Our results indicate that the pH of the detergent directly affects its cleaning efficiency, likely by increasing the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and the talc particles. Similarly, the increasing ethanolamine concentration elevates the pH of the detergent, leading to better cleaning performances on both Al2O3 and AlTiC substrates.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Hypothetically, a greater QRS area denotes higher dyssynchrony and indicates potential benefits from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Previous studies suggest a positive correlation between QRS area and the degree of response to CRT, but its clinical use remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of the relationship between QRS area and survival benefit following CRT. Methods: We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from inception to August 2021. We included studies with prospective and retrospective cohort designs that reported QRS area before CRT and total mortality. Data from each study were analyzed using a random-effects model. The results were reported as a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Five observational studies including 4931 patients were identified. The cut-off values between large and small QRS areas ranged from 102 to 116 μVs. Our analysis showed a larger QRS area was statistically associated with increased 5-year survival in patients implanted with CRT (HR pooled 0.48, 95% CI 0.46–0.51, I2 = 54%, p <.0001). Greater QRS area reduction (pre- and post-implantation) were associated with a lower total mortality rate (HR pooled 0.45, 95% CI 0.38–0.52, I2 = 0%, p <.0001). Conclusion: Larger pre-implantation QRS area was associated with increased survival after CRT. QRS area reduction following CRT implantation was also associated with lower mortality. QRS area may potentially become an additional selection criterion for CRT implantations.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

The oxygen evolution reaction is one of way to achieve unlimited energy from water but the low stability, high energy required to drive the reaction (overpotential), complicated and unscalable synthesis method of expensive catalysis restricts its real time implementation into modern society. Herein this report, we suggested Ru-tailored hydrous cobalt phosphate and its concentration effect as a dopant to improve the catalytic properties. Electrocatalytic properties were studied via linear sweep voltammetry, chrono-potentiometric studies at a 10 mA/cm2 for 20 h, electrochemical active surface area, turnover frequency, and Tafel slope. Cobalt phosphate showed the connected-nanorods morphology, which is further tunned by increasing Ru-doping concentration, achieving various features from agglomerated nanorods sensitized with uniform nanoparticles on the micro-flower shapes consisting of interconnected nanorods sensitized with nanoparticles. The good electrocatalytic OER performance of 5% Ru-doped hydrous cobalt phosphate was achieved, exhibiting low overpotential up to 310 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm2 besides a small Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. As well, stable O2 evolution for a period of 20 h was shown. DFT calculation reveals that the Ru can increase electrical conductivity and promote OER activity, observed from Bader charge analysis, electron density difference, and OER Gibbs free energy. The EIS plot, ECSA, and TOF estimation disclose that the increased electrical conductivity, the improved ECSA, and the high intrinsic activity are together responsible for the good OER activity for 5%Ru–CoPO.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Scheduled second look endoscopy after endoscopic hemostasis to patients with high risk bleeding peptic ulcers: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Pittayanon R., Suen B.-Y., Kongtub N., Tse Y.-K., Rerknimitr R., Lau J.Y.W.",2022-09-01,"Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal, Hemostasis, Endoscopic, Humans, Male, Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage, Recurrence, Stomach Ulcer, Treatment Outcome, High risk ulcer, Rebleeding, Second look endoscopy","Background: The recommendation of second look endoscopy (SLOGD) in selected patients at high risk for rebleeding has been inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of SLOGD in selected patients predicted at high risk of recurrent bleeding. Methods: From a cohort of 939 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who underwent endoscopic hemostasis, we derived a 9-point risk score (age > 60, Male, ulcer ≥ 2 cm in size, posterior bulbar or lesser curve gastric ulcer, Forrest I bleeding, haemoglobin < 8 g/dl) to predict recurrent bleeding. We then validated the score in another cohort of 1334 patients (AUROC 0.77). To test the hypothesis that SLOGD in high-risk patients would improve outcomes, we did a randomized controlled trial to compare scheduled SLOGD with observation alone in those predicted at high risk of rebleeding (a score of ≥ 5). The primary outcome was clinical bleeding within 30 days of the index bleed. Results: Of 314 required, we enrolled 157 (50%) patients (SLOGD n = 78, observation n = 79). Nine (11.8%) in SLOGD group and 14 (18.2%) in observation group reached primary outcome (absolute difference 6.4%, 95% CI − 5.0% to 17.8%). Twenty-one of 69 (30.4%) patients who underwent SLOGD needed further endoscopic treatment. No surgery for bleeding control was needed. There were 6 vs. 3 of 30-day deaths in either group (p = 0.285, log rank). No difference was observed regarding blood transfusion and hospitalization. Conclusions: In this aborted trial that enrolled patients with bleeding peptic ulcers at high-risk of recurrent bleeding, scheduled SLOGD did not significantly improve outcomes.

We have previously shown that endotoxemia, presumably from the gut, may complicate COVID-19. However, the role of endotoxin adsorbent (EA) therapy to mitigate organ dysfunction in COVID-19 has not been explored. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who received EA therapy at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between March 13 and April 17, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected by inpatient chart review. Results: Among 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients received EA therapy. All of the 6 patients had severe COVID-19 infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among these, 5 of them were mechanically ventilated and 4 had complications of secondary bacterial infection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results of pre-EA therapy ranged from 0.47 to 2.79. The choices of EA therapy were at the discretion of attending physicians. One patient was treated with oXiris® along with continuous renal replacement therapy, and the others received polymyxin B hemoperfusion sessions. All patients have survived and were finally free from the mechanical ventilation as well as had improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased EAA level after EA therapy. Conclusions: We demonstrated the clinical improvement of severe COVID-19 patients with elevated EAA level upon receiving EA therapy. However, the benefit of EA therapy in COVID-19 ARDS is still unclear and needs to be elucidated with randomized controlled study.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"

The hydrogel was prepared by γ-irradiation crosslinking of PAA solution incorporated with graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF). With high water-sorption capacity and transparency, the hydrogel was suitable to accommodate coloring reagents and enzymes for colorimetric sensing of urea in sweat. The colorimetric sensor exhibited vivid color change towards the increase of urea concentration in a linear range of 40–80 mM covering a cut-off value (60 mM) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) indication. Furthermore, the hydrogel could be directly applied as a substrate for direct quantitation of urea in sweat by laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (LDI-MS). While CNF improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, GO played a key role in enhancing laser desorption ionization of urea in LDI-MS and increased the hydrogel functionalities. LDI-MS verified that GO/CNF/PAA hydrogel could act as a direct matrix for promoting urea ionization and these results corresponded well with the colorimetric sensor. Hence, this hydrogel patch might be a potential material to be applied in non-invasive and dual-detection of CKD in medical diagnosis.",biochemistryistry,"Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

The four-month-old male rats were sham-operated or orchidectomized (ODX). The ODX rats were divided into four groups, and orally treated for 2 months with either 1 mL/d of distilled water or 100 mg/kg/d of PME; or subcutaneously injected with 1 mg/kg/d of DHT or 80 μg/kg/d of E2. The impairment of spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in the ODX rats was prevented by DHT, E2, and PME. Recovery of the orchidectomy-induced deterioration of the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of rats was ranked as E2 ≥ PME > DHT. Both DHT and PME mitigated the increased Tau3 and Tau4 mRNA levels, and Tau-5 and P-Tau Ser396 protein levels more than E2 (DHT ≥ PME > E2). Only DHT tended to decrease App mRNA expression level. In conclusion, DHT showed a stronger efficacy for mitigation of the impaired spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in androgen-deficient male rats compared to E2 and PME, and their mechanisms of action are slightly different.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience","Endocrinology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Behavioral Neuroscience"

Previous reports showed that global DNA hypomethylation was correlated with various types of cancer including cervical cancer. Methods: Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) pyrosequencing and Enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were used for detection of global DNA methylation. The ELISA results were compared to bisulfite LINE1 pyrosequencing assay. Results: Different cervical cancer cell lines (CaSki, SiHa, HeLa, ME180, MS751, C33A) showed low global methylation percentage when compared to normal white blood cells by ELISA assay (1.47%-5.09% vs 8.20%, respectively) and by LINE1 pyrosequencing (20%-45% vs 62%, respectively). Global DNA methylation levels in cervical cancer samples were lower than precancerous lesions (Normal-CIN3) by LINE1 pyrosequencing (mean, 48.8% vs 56.9%, respectively, p<0.05) and ELISA assay (mean, 3.03% vs 3.85%, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion: Global DNA hypomethylation was predominantly found in cervical cancer samples detected by ELISA and LINE1 pyrosequencing assays and could be used as triage tests in cervical cancer screening. ELISA assay is a suitable method for detection of global DNA methylation in large population; however, it should be further evaluated in a large clinical samples in order to be used as screening method.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited the healthy subjects age ≥18 years, having spherical refraction within ±6 diopters and cylindrical refraction ±3 diopters, from a hospital's personnel and the people visiting the ophthalmology department. Only 1 eye of each subject was randomly selected for an analysis. Macular images were obtained using posterior pole thickness scan protocol over a 24° × 24° area at the center of the fovea. The automated retinal thickness segmentation values of total retina and three inner retinal layers were calculated for the mean and the mean intraocular thickness difference between superior and inferior retinal hemispheres. The influence of age, gender, and axial length on thickness and thickness asymmetry of individualized retinal layer was evaluated. Results: 252 subjects were included in study with a mean (SD) age of 46.7 (15.8) years, and 120 (47.6%) were males. According to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study map, the inner ring area was the thickest location of the total retina (range; 326.0-341.5 μm), GCL (range; 47.7-52.7 μm), and IPL (range; 39.9-42.1 μm), whereas the thickest location of RNFL was at the outer ring area (range; 18.8-47.5 μm). For posterior pole intraocular thickness asymmetry, the greatest mean ± SD difference was observed for total retina (9.0 ± 2.2 μm), followed by RNFL (9.9 ± 3.2 μm) and GCL (2.7 ± 0.6 μm), and the lowest mean difference was noted for IPL (2.4 ± 0.5 μm). The thickness and thickness asymmetry of each retinal layer were variably influenced by age, gender, and axial length; however, these factors had a minimal influence on the thickness asymmetry maps of GCL and RNFL. Conclusion: The reference database of the macular thickness and thickness asymmetry from this study would be beneficial in determining physiologic variations of the OCT parameters in the healthy Thai population.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Lactoferrin is a crucial local immunity protein in the oral cavity with important antimicrobial activity. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate salivary lactoferrin secretion levels and Candida colonization in oral lichen planus patients treated with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. Methods: Saliva samples were collected from 15 oral lichen planus subjects who had never received topical steroid treatment prior to this study and 15 healthy volunteers to determine their salivary lactoferrin levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and to investigate the presence of oral Candida species at baseline and 3 months after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. Statistical analysis was performed to compare lactoferrin secretion and Candida colonization levels between the groups using the Mann–Whitney U test for independent data or the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for paired data. Results: The salivary lactoferrin secretion level was not significantly different between the control group and oral lichen planus patients or between before and after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase (P > 0.05). Candida was detected in 11 (73.33%) healthy volunteers, 8 (53.33%) oral lichen planus patients before treatment, and 9 (60%) oral lichen planus patients after treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase. There was no significant difference in Candida counts between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study indicates that using fluocinolone acetonide 0.1% in orabase to treat oral lichen planus for 3 months did not affect salivary lactoferrin protein secretion or Candida carriage.

The prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global priority. Previously, we showed that a protein subunit vaccine that was developed based on the fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc), produced in Nicotiana benthamiana, and adjuvanted with alum, namely, Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 1, induced potent immunological responses in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Hence, this study evaluated the protective efficacy, safety, and toxicity of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 1 in K18-hACE2 mice, monkeys and Wistar rats. Two doses of vaccine were administered three weeks apart on Days 0 and 21. The administration of the vaccine to K18-hACE2 mice reduced viral loads in the lungs and brains of the vaccinated animals and protected the mice against challenge with SARS-CoV-2. In monkeys, the results of safety pharmacology tests, general clinical observations, and a core battery of studies of three vital systems, namely, the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, did not reveal any safety concerns. The toxicology study of the vaccine in rats showed no vaccine-related pathological changes, and all the animals remained healthy under the conditions of this study. Furthermore, the vaccine did not cause any abnormal toxicity in rats and was clinically tolerated even at the highest tested concentration. In addition, general health status, body temperature, local toxicity at the administration site, hematology, and blood chemistry parameters were also monitored. Overall, this work presents the results of the first systematic study of the safety profile of a plant-derived vaccine, Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 1; this approach can be considered a viable strategy for the development of vaccines against COVID-19.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Methods: As part of the multinational PD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS), PD patients from 22 PD centres from different geographic regions, sizes and affiliations, representing Thailand PD facilities, have been enrolled starting in May 2016. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data and patients’ outcomes were prospectively collected and analysed. Results: The pilot and implementation phases demonstrated excellent concordance between study data and validation data collected at enrolment. In the implementation phase, 848 PD patients (including 262 (31%) incident PD patients) were randomly sampled from 5090 patients in participating centres. Almost all participants (95%) performed continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), and a high proportion had hypoalbuminemia (67%, serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL), anaemia (42%, haemoglobin <10 g/dL) and hypokalaemia (37%, serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L). The peritonitis rate was 0.40 episodes/year, but the culture-negative rate was high (0.13 episodes/year, 28% of total episodes). The patients from PD clinics located in Bangkok metropolitan region had higher socio-economic status, more optimal nutritional markers, blood chemistries, haemoglobin level and lower peritonitis rates compared to the provincial regions, emphasizing the centre effect on key success factors in PD. Conclusions: Participation in the PDOPPS helps unveil the critical barriers to improving outcomes of PD patients in Thailand, including a high prevalence of hypokalaemia, anaemia, poor nutritional status and culture-negative peritonitis.

The high-order governing equations of motion and consistent boundary conditions were simultaneously obtained through a variational formulation based on Hamilton's principle. The established microshell model contains five strain-gradient material constants and one length parameter resulting from micro-inertia effects in addition to two classical Lamé constants, thereby capturing microstructure-induced size-dependent phenomena in both static and dynamic analyses. The constructed model within the general SGT can be flexibly reduced to those based on the modified strain-gradient, modified couple stress, and simplified strain-gradient theories. Moreover, by enforcing geometric restrictions, the general formulation for free-form microshells can be specialized for doubly curved microshells. Finally, the forced vibration results of a simply supported closed cylindrical microshell confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the proposed model and strain-gradient and high-order inertia effects on the size-dependent dynamic characteristics of microshells. Altogether, the presented mathematical formulations can provide a foundation for the in-depth understanding of microscale shell structures.","Mathematics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Modeling and Simulation, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

A clonal outbreak multidrug-resistant triggering strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in Kanchanaburi Province, labelled “MKR superspreader,” which was found to subsequently spread to other regions, as revealed by prior epidemiological reports in Thailand. Herein, we showed that the MKR displayed a higher growth rate upon infection into host macrophages in comparison with the H37Rv reference strain. To further elucidate MKR’s biology, we utilized RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analyses to identify host factors involved in the intracellular viability of the MKR. A set of host genes function in the cellular response to lipid pathway was found to be uniquely up-regulated in host macrophages infected with the MKR, but not those infected with H37Rv. Within this set of genes, the IL-36 cytokines which regulate host cell cholesterol metabolism and resistance against mycobacteria attracted our interest, as our previous study revealed that the MKR elevated genes associated with cholesterol breakdown during its growth inside host macrophages. Indeed, when comparing macrophages infected with the MKR to H37Rv-infected cells, our RNA-Seq data showed that the expression ratio of IL-36RN, the negative regulator of the IL-36 pathway, to that of IL-36G was greater in macrophages infected with the MKR. Furthermore, the MKR’s intracellular survival and increased intracellular cholesterol level in the MKR-infected macrophages were diminished with decreased IL-36RN expression. Overall, our results indicated that IL-36RN could serve as a new target against this emerging multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strain.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Breakthroughs in HLA peptidomics have considerably expanded the databases of natural HLA ligands and enabled detailed characterizations of HLA-peptide binding specificity. However, cautions must be made when analyzing HLA peptidomics data because identified peptides may be contaminants in mass spectrometry or may weakly bind to the HLA molecules. Here, a hybrid de novo peptide sequencing approach was applied to large-scale mono-allelic HLA peptidomics datasets to uncover new ligands and refine current knowledge of HLA binding motifs. Up to 12-40% of the peptidomics data were low-binding affinity peptides with an arginine or a lysine at the C-terminus and likely to be tryptic peptide contaminants. Thousands of these peptides have been reported in a community database as legitimate ligands and might be erroneously used for training prediction models. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering of identified ligands revealed additional binding motifs for several HLA class I alleles and effectively isolated outliers that were experimentally confirmed to be false positives. Overall, our findings expanded the knowledge of HLA binding specificity and advocated for more rigorous interpretation of HLA peptidomics data that will ensure the high validity of community HLA ligandome databases.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Therefore, this paper aims at three objectives to provide a proper solution for balancing mixed-model parallel assembly lines. However, multiple objectives, known as NP-hard, may struggle in providing optimal solutions in a limited timeframe. As a result, a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, the so-called ""metaheuristic"", will be conducted to develop the quintessential result for each objective.

PPK models were developed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach, and the final model was subsequently used for Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal dosage regimens. A total of 247 concentrations from 52 patients were available for analysis. The two-compartment model with linear elimination adequately described the data. The mean PPK parameters were clearance (CL) of 4.8 L/h, central volume of distribution (VC) of 11.4 L, peripheral volume of distribution (VP) of 14.6 L, and intercompartment clearance of 10.5 L/h. Creatinine clearance was a significant covariate affecting CL, while serum albumin level and shock status were factors influencing VC and VP, respectively. Although 75% of the drug-resistant infection patients had fT.MIC values of .40%, approximately 83% of them did not survive the infection. Therefore, 40% fT.MIC might not be sufficient for critically ill patients, and a higher target, such as 75 to 100% fT.MIC, should be considered for optimizing therapy. A 75% fT.MIC could be reached using approved doses administered via a 3-h infusion.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Auricularia polytricha (AP) is an edible mushroom with several medicinal properties. Herein, the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of AP extracts against BPA-induced inflammation of BV2 microglial cells were investigated. Hexane (APH) and ethanol (APE) extracts of AP inhibited BPA-induced neuroinflammation in BV2 microglia by reducing microglial activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These anti-inflammatory effects were regulated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, APH and APE exhibited antioxidative effects by increasing the activity of the SOD-1 enzyme and restoring the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in BPA-induced BV2 cells. Moreover, the conditioned medium prepared using BPA-induced BV2 cells demonstrated that the presence of APH or APE could attenuate ROS production in HT-22 cells. Further, ergosterol was isolated from APE and also showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. In conclusion, AP extracts and ergosterol attenuated neuroinflammation against BPA induction in BV2 microglial cells through the NF-κB signaling pathway.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

The peak detection efficiency of the high-energy gamma-ray radiation was about two- to three-fold higher when using a BGO than a NaI(Tl) detector. This would increase the potential operation safety by allowing the use of a lower radioactivity level or a shorter measurement time. To analyze the coal-ash content using DEGT, the relationship between the transmittance ratios and the coal-ash content was successfully achieved as a linear equation, while the coal-ash contents determined by DEGT were in a very good agreement with those determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and standard chemical ASTM3174 methods, showing a highly linear relationship. In brief, the DEGT at 59.6 and 661.7 keV using a BGO detector could be developed to be a new promising approach to determine the coal-ash content as a real-time and on-belt analysis or a portable device in further investigation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, earth sciences, engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Mechanical Engineering"

It showed 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) degradation, pesticide tolerance, and self-nutrient integration via nitrogen (N)-fixation and phosphate (P)-solubilization. The rate constant (k) and half-life period (t1/2) of 4-NA degradation in the aqueous medium inoculated with strain AVPP64 were observed to be 0.445 d−1 and 1.55 d, respectively. Nevertheless, in the presence of chlorpyrifos, profenofos, atrazine and diuron pesticides, strain AVPP64 degraded 4-NA with t1/2 values of 2.55 d, 2.26 d, 2.31 d and 3.54 d, respectively. The strain AVPP64 fixed 140 μg mL−1 of N and solubilized 103 μg mL−1 of P during the presence of 4-NA. In addition, strain AVPP64 produced significant amounts of plant growth-promoting metabolites like indole 3-acetic acid, siderophores, exo-polysaccharides and ammonia. In the presence of 4-NA and various pesticides, strain AVPP64 greatly increased the growth and biomass of Vigna radiata and Crotalaria juncea plants. These results revealed that Bacillus sp. strain AVPP64 can be used as an inoculum for bioremediation of 4-NA contaminated soil and sustainable crop production even when pesticides are present.","fluidex; related topics, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Anticancer Effects and Molecular Action of 7-α-Hydroxyfrullanolide in G2/M-Phase Arrest and Apoptosis in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells,"Chimplee S., Roytrakul S., Sukrong S., Srisawat T., Graidist P., Kanokwiroon K.",2022-01-01,"Unknown, 7-α-hydroxyfrullanolide, Anticancer activity, Apoptosis, G2/M-phase arrest, Grangea maderaspatana, Proteomics, Sesquiterpene lactone, Triple-negative breast cancer","Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. TNBC cells respond poorly to targeted chemotherapies currently in use and the mortality rate of TNBC remains high. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new chemotherapeutic agents for TNBC. In this study, the anti-cancer effects of 7-α-hydroxyfrullanolide (7HF), derived from Grangea maderaspatana, on MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were assessed using MTT assay. The mode of action of 7HF in TNBC cells treated with 6, 12 and 24 µM of 7HF was determined by flow cytometry and propidium iodide (PI) staining for cell cycle analysis and annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate + PI staining for detecting apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of action of 7HF in TNBC cells was investigated by evaluating protein expression using proteomic techniques and western blotting. Subsequently, 7HF exhibited the strongest anti-TNBC activity toward MDA-MB-468 cells and a concomitantly weak toxicity toward normal breast cells. The molecular mechanism of action of low-dose 7HF in TNBC cells primarily involved G2/M-phase arrest through upregulation of the expression of Bub3, cyclin B1, phosphorylated Cdk1 (Tyr 15) and p53-independent p21. Contrastingly, the upregulation of PP2A-A subunit expression may have modulated the suppression of various cell survival proteins such as p-Akt (Ser 473), FoxO3a and β-catenin. The concurrent apoptotic effect of 7HF on the treated cells was mediated via both intrinsic and extrinsic modes through the upregulation of Bax and active cleaved caspase-7–9 expression and downregulation of Bcl-2 and full-length caspase-7–9 expression. Notably, the proteomic approach revealed the upregulation of the expression of pivotal protein clusters associated with G1/S-phase arrest, G2/M-phase transition and apoptosis. Thus, 7HF exhibits promising anti-TNBC activity and at a low dose, it modulates signal transduction associated with G2/M-phase arrest and apoptosis.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

For the materialization of real-life SSBs, gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are among promising candidates. However, development of GPEs with satisfying ionic conductivity and mechanical endurance is challenging. Herein, we report on the development of polyacrylamide (PAM)/phosphonated graphene oxide (PGO) nanocomposite hydrogel electrolytes for zinc-ion batteries; PGO acts as the filler through in-situ polymerization of acrylamide in an aqueous suspension of PGO. The synthesized PAM/PGO hydrogel exhibits high ionic conductivity of 31.0 mS/cm at 30 °C compared to that of PAM (13.8 mS/cm) and PAM-GO (20.8 mS/cm). The higher ionic conductivity of PAM-PGO can be attributed to its higher hydrophilicity and electrolyte storage capacity along with its lower activation energy for ionic conduction (7.2 KJ/mol K) in comparison with that of PAM (10.1 KJ/mol K) and PAM-GO (10.2 KJ/mol K). The interaction between water against PAM, PAM-GO and PAM-PGO is investigated via density-functional theory (DFT). The MnO2-based zinc-ion battery assembled using PAM-PGO as electrolyte shows high initial capacity of 240 mAh/g, losing only 4 and 15% of its capacity after 100 and 145 cycles, respectively. Results demonstrate promising potential of PAM-PGO as a solid-state electrolyte for flexible battery applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

UTC time scale is maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measurements (BIPM) adjusted to be close to a time scale based on the Earth's rotation. In Thailand, the official atomic time clocks are maintained by the National Institute of Metrology Thailand (NIMT) to produce UTC(NIMT) and Thailand standard time which is always 7 hours ahead of UTC(NIMT) because of the time zone differences between Greenwich and Bangkok. National Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) infrastructure comprises of GNSS geodetic receivers uniformly distributed to continually observe GNSS signals, mainly for geodetic survey applications both real-time and post-processing services. NIMT is involved in order to provide time link to UTC and to determine the characteristics of GNSS receiver internal clocks; namely, fractional frequency offset and frequency stabilities by applying the GNSS time transfer techniques of common-view algorithms. Monitored time differences with respect to UTC(NIMT) are achieved from selected 4 ground stations in different parts of the country with observations of 21 days in order to determine the frequency stability at 1-day and 7-day modes.

To formulate nitrifying cultures for RASs, impacts of ammonia and salinity (NaCl) on culturing nitrifying microorganisms were comprehensively investigated by including currently known groups of nitrifying microorganisms (ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), comammox, Nitrospira, and Nitrobacter). By varying ammonia loading rate (ALRs of 1.6, 8, 20, 40, 60 and 150 mgN/L/d) of continuous-flow bioreactors fed with inorganic medium experimented for culture preparation, cultures containing distinct patterns of nitrifying communities were produced. Operating the reactors at the ALRs of ≤40 mgN/L/d, resulting in the effluent total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite concentrations of ≤2.64 and ≤0.53 mgN/L, respectively, delivered the consortia consisting of a broad spectrum of substrate affinity nitrifying microorganisms. At the lower ranges of these ALRs (≤8 mgN/L/d), the most desirable consortia comprising comparable numbers of AOB, AOA, and comammox could be produced (the effluent TAN concentrations of ≤0.20 mgN/L), which would be resilient for applying in various RAS types. Enriching the cultures at the ALRs of ≥60 mgN/L/d allowed only the nitrifying microorganisms with low substrate affinity to dominate, incongruent with the consortia found in actual RASs. AOB were adaptable at all salinity studied (2, 15, and 30 g/L), while AOA and comammox were sensitive to elevated salinity (15 and 30 g/L, respectively). The ammonia removal rate of a culture prepared at 2 g/L salinity decreased largely when applied at 15 and 30 g/L. In contrast, those prepared at 15 and 30 g/L were more robust to different salinity. Separately preparing the cultures at different salinity for uses in freshwater-low salinity and brackish-marine RASs is recommended. The findings of this work enhance our understanding on how to formulate nitrifying culture augmentation for used in different RAS types.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The rise of prosumers has led to a more decentralized and open local green energy market through the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, where consumers and prosumers can buy or sell electricity through an online trading platform. P2P energy trading has the potential to make green energy more accessible at the local level, provide a customer choice that aligns with community values, and promote the use of renewable energy (RE) for local consumption. Although P2P energy trading has already been adopted in some countries, its implementation remains challenging in other countries, including Thailand. In this work, we investigated the drivers and challenges of implementing P2P energy trading in Thailand based on the perspectives of P2P energy trading pilot project developers participating in the regulatory sandbox program. A strategic framework was used to identify the respondents’ standpoints on the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) factors that can influence the implementation of P2P energy trading. This can help businesses, policymakers, and regulators better understand drivers and barriers of P2P energy trading, which is a potential local energy market.

Methods: Sixty custom made MIs with a 0.4-, 0.6-, 0.8-, 1.0-, or 1.2-mm thread pitch,12 for each pitch, were randomly placed into the palates of 10 embalmed human maxillae. The MIT was measured with a hand-operated digital torque reader screwdriver with a holding guide, and the IS test was performed using Anycheck. Conebeam computerized tomography was used to measure the cortical bone thickness(CBT) at each MI site. One-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test, Pearson's correlation,and multiple linear regression models were performed using the SPSS program. Results: The MIT and IS tests demonstrated a pitch-dependent decrease. The pitch had a strong negative correlation with MIT and IS, while the CBT had a strong positive correlation with those outcomes. The association between pitch and CBT significantly influenced MI primary stability. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between MIT and IS. Conclusions: The MI primary stability, MIT, and IS are strongly influenced by theassociation between MI thread pitch and CBT.","otorhinolaryngology, dentistry",Orthodontics

Among those hazardous metals, lead is one of the most dangerous elements because it significantly affects human-body organs. In the present study, biochar prepared from pomelo fruit peel using a green synthesized method was utilized to remove Pb(II) from aqueous solution. The effects of pH, adsorption time, ion strength, and Pb(II) initial concentration on the Pb(II) adsorption of this material were investigated. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Sip, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-diffusion models were used to study the isotherm and kinetic properties of the material. Results showed that the uptake followed the intra-diffusion kinetic model and the maximum Pb(II) mono-adsorption capacity determined from the Langmuir equation was 92.13 mg/g at 303 K. Furthermore, by combining conventional characterization methods as SEM-EDX, BET-BJH and FT-IR with advanced nuclear analytical techniques as positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) and electron momentum distribution (EMD), we found that the Pb(II) adsorption should be occurred via three stages, namely (i) electrostatic attractions that affect the external diffusion; (ii) ion-exchanges that control the internal diffusion; and (iii) chemical interactions. In particular, the PAL and EMD analyses provided, for the first time, an in-depth study on the adsorption mechanism that the ion-exchanges and/or electrostatic interactions occurred due to the diffusion of Pb(II) ions into the defects, vacancies, and/or vacancy clusters and/or the filling of Pb(II) ions into the micropores of biochar.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

By applying data integration, raw BEMS data can be employed for multiple purposes. For example, power consumption data can be matched with motion sensor data and electric appliance details in any staff room to calculate wasted energy and continually predict an individual electric appliance status. Therefore, disclosing these data severely violates local electricity users' privacy. To resolve data privacy concerns using differential privacy, the traditional Laplacian mechanism cannot be used to detect overloads and the standard coin-flipping algorithm gives a high percentage error of wasted energy calculation. Thus, this paper proposes a modified truncated Laplacian noise addition and random motion state processes to hide the actual electrical use and movement patterns. Based on a 30-day sample period of actual BEMS, both privacy and usability of the proposed processes have been compared with the traditional methods in terms of the privacy loss parameter, the reported error of energy consumption, the correctness of overload detection, and the error of the wasted energy calculation. Based on the obtainable effectiveness, these proposed processes are recommended for further extension to implement at BEMS data gateways in real-time.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Hepatotropic viruses can cause liver inflammation that can develop into liver graft fibrosis and cirrhosis over the long term. Immunological reactions due to viral hepatitis infections are associated with or can mimic graft rejection, rendering the condition difficult to manage. Prevention strategies using vaccinations are agreeable to patients, safe, cost-effective and practical. Hence, strategies to eliminate viral hepatitis A and B focus mainly on immunization programmes for children who have received a liver transplant. Although a vaccine has been developed to prevent hepatitis C and E viruses, its use is not licensed worldwide. Consequently, eliminating hepatitis C and E viruses mainly involves early detection in children with suspected cases and effective treatment with antiviral therapy. Good hygiene and sanitation are also important to prevent hepatitis A and E infections. Donor blood products and liver grafts should be screened for hepatitis B, C and E in children who are undergoing liver transplantation. Future research on early detection of viral hepatitis infections should include molecular techniques for detecting hepatitis B and E. Moreover, novel antiviral drugs for eradicating viral hepatitis that are highly effective and safe are needed for children who have undergone liver transplantation.",medical,Gastroenterology

Methods: This study included 185 MA-abuse, 118 MA-dependent, and 67 MIP patients, diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. The Semi-structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA) questionnaire was employed to collect MA-related data. MIP was confirmed using the Methamphetamine Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). The leukocyte telomere length was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction measuring the Telomere/Single gene ratio (T/S ratio). Data were analysed using multivariate statistical analyses. Results: There were no significant associations between the T/S ratio and severity of MA-use, MIP, and MA withdrawal symptoms. MIP was significantly predicted by alcohol dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and MA-use severity. There were significantly positive associations between the T/S ratio and previous traumatic and life-threatening events. The T/S ratio was not affected by alcohol and nicotine dependence. Alcohol and nicotine dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and severity of MA use increased risk of MA withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: MIP and MA-use severity are not associated with leukocyte telomere length, but previous traumatic and life-threatening events are associated with increased telomere length.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

In this process, biogas is catalytically upgraded into CH4-rich gas in METH reactor using Ni/CeO2 catalyst, and the obtained CH4-rich gas is subsequently decomposed into H2 and CNTs in CDM reactor over CoMo/MgO catalyst. Among the three different process scenarios proposed, the combined process with a steam condenser equipped between METH and CDM reactors could greatly improve a CNTs productivity. The CNTs production yield increased by more than 2.5-fold, maximizing at 9.08 gCNTs/gCat with a CNTs purity of 90%. The deposited carbon product was characterized as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a surface area of 136.0 m2/g, comparable with commercial CNTs of 199.8 m2/g. The remarkable IG/ID ratio of 2.18 confirms a superior portion of graphitic carbon in the synthesized CNTs upon the commercial CNTs with IG/ID = 0.74. Notably, the CH4 conversion reached 94.5%, while the CO2 conversion achieved 100%, resulting in the H2 yield and H2 purity higher than 90%. This combined process demonstrates a promising route for production of high quality CNTs and high purity H2 with complete CO2 conversion using biogas as abundant renewable energy resources. In addition, the test of raw biogas showed no deactivation of catalyst, justifying the implementation of the developed process for real biogas without purification.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

In this contribution, we demonstrate the capacity of FPL-LISP to analyze representative commercial beverages for their natural or artificial sweetener contents. As a benchmark, the speed of sound was determined for solutions of sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose), mock high fructose corn syrup (HFCS-55), and 12 household sweeteners (culinary sugars, syrups, honey, molasses) across the concentration range of 1–20% w/v in water, simulating the typical sweetener range found in commercial soft drinks. The setup was then employed to estimate sweetener contents of 26 popular commercial beverages using the HFCS-55 standard curve as a training data set. Our results are remarkably consistent with the label values for these representative commercial beverages, in spite of the fact that some beverages clearly employ a sweetener other than HFCS-55 or a proprietary blend, suggesting the excellent potential of the FPL-LISP setup as a quick screening tool well-suited to quality control and real-time assessment in the beverage and fermentation industrial sectors. The proposed approach represents a significant improvement over many existing methods on the basis of measurement time (down to 1 s, which can be considered real time for many applications), lenient sample requirements (tens of microliters to 1 mL), robust and user-friendly analysis, practical considerations (e.g., economical, minimal service and maintenance concerns), and prospects for advancing both online monitoring and fully portable versions of this instrumentation.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

In this work, electroactive materials based on the dibutyl phathalate (DBP) plasticized poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and fullerene (C60) were produced by a simple solvent casting method. The PLA composites exhibited fast and reversible responses under electrical stimulus. The highest storage modulus response was obtained from the 1.0%v/v C60/PLA/DBP at 23.51 × 105 Pa under the 1.5 kV mm-1 electric field. In the bending experiment, the PLA composites bended towards the anode from the attractive force between the negative charges of the induced dipole moments namely the carbonyl groups in PLA and DBP and the π-conjugated electrons of C60 and the positive electrode. The C60/PLA/DBP composite with a small C60 content (0.1%v/v) yielded the maximum bending distance of about 6.0 mm within 10 s and the highest dielectrophoresis force of 1.01 mN at 550 V mm-1. Thus, the electrically responsive PLA composites fabricated here with the short response time and high bending deformation are demonstrated here to be promising biobased materials towards actuator applications.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics, Materials Science","Signal Processing, Civil and Structural Engineering, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Results: a large part (50%, n = 30) of patients with MA dependence could be allocated to a cluster characterized by high psychosis ratings including delusions, suspiciousness, conceptual disorganization and difficulties abstract thinking and an increased OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 29.9% of the variance in MIP severity (a first factor extracted from psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, and formal thought disorder scores) was explained by HDL, TAC and zinc (all inversely) and oxLDL (positively). MA dependence and dosing explained together 44.7% of the variance in the OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio. Conclusions: MA dependence and intoxication are associated with increased oxidative stress and lowered antioxidant defenses, both of which increase risk of MIP during acute intoxication. MA dependence is accompanied by increased atherogenicity due to lowered HDL and increased oxLDL and oxHDL.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Here, we discuss the in-situ synthesis of metal nanoparticle embedded soft hybrid materials via eco-benign approach which exclude the use of toxic reducing/capping agents or toxic reaction media. In this protocol, the gel matrix composed of benign organic templates act as reducing as well as stabilizing agent for the in-situ generation and stabilization of metal nanoparticles. As the incorporation of metal salts (as nanoparticle precursor) in the gel medium is required in this process, in most of the cases aqueous media were used for the generation of metal nanoparticle embedded soft hybrid materials. This discussion includes interesting findings from our laboratory where hybrid gel matrix composed of renewable chemicals was utilized for the in-situ synthesis of palladium nanoparticle embedded soft trihybrid material. The hybrid gel matrix rich in polyphenols/flavonoids was exploited to generate palladium nanoparticle embedded trihybrid gel through in-situ reduction of doped Pd (II) salts to stable PdNPs. The xerogel of this trihybrid material was utilized as recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for C-C coupling reaction in air under phosphene free condition and reduction reaction.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The extraction results showed that MLE from condition of 60 °C (X1, temperature), 30 min (X2, time) and 60% v/v (X3, ethanol concentration) exhibited the highest bioactive compound and antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assay). Based on this optimal condition, MLE was further encapsulated by spray drying. It was found that MLE encapsulated with resistant maltodextrin at ratio of MLE and resistant maltodextrin 1:1 (w/w) showed the highest encapsulation yield (%) and encapsulation efficiency (%). Water solubility, moisture content and water activity were non-significant (p > 0.05) among the microcapsules. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that the types of coating material affected their microstructures and microcapsules prepared by resistant maltodextrin as coating material had a spherical shape, smooth surface and less shrinkage than microcapsules prepared by maltodextrin and gum arabic which had rough surfaces. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained from microcapsule prepared by gum arabic at ratio of MLE and gam arabic 1:2 (w/w). In conclusion, optimal condition from UAE and encapsulation by spray drying suggest the critical potential for production of functional food with improved bioactive compound stability and maximized antioxidant activity.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental, medical, physics, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Environmental Chemistry, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Moreover, the variable characteristics of VRE cause a mismatch between electricity demand and power generation, resulting in a greater expected energy not supplied (EENS) value. EENS involves an expected outage cost, which is one of the important components of power-generation costs. A utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) is popularly used to provide ancillary services to mitigate the VRE impact. The general BESS ancillary-service applications are as a spinning reserve, for regulation, and for ramping. A method to determine optimal sizing and the optimal daily-operation schedule of a grid-scale BESS (to compensate for the negative impacts of VRE in terms of operating costs, powergeneration-reliability constraints, avoided expected-outage costs, and the installation cost of the BESS) is proposed in this paper. Moreover, the optimal BESS application at a specific time during the day can be selected. The method is based on a multiple-BESS-applications unit-commitment problem (MB-UC), which is solved by mixed-integer programming (MIP). The results show a different period for a BESS to operate at its best value in each application, and more benefits are found when operating the BESS in multiple applications.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, many times, surface errors of a microlens array (MLA) are responsible for degradation in the images captured by a plenoptic camera. Additionally, the limited pixel count of the sensor can cause missing parallax information. The aforementioned issues are crucial for creating accurate maps for Intelligent Autonomous Transport System (IATS), because they cause loss of LF information, and need to be addressed. To tackle this problem, a learning-based framework by directly simulating the LF distribution is proposed. A high-dimensional convolution layer with densely sampled LFs in 4D space and considering a soft activation function based on ReLU segmentation correction is used to generate a superresolution (SR) LF image, improving the convergence rate in the deep learning network. Experimental results show that our proposed LF image reconstruction framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches; specifically, it is effective for learning the LF distribution and generating high-quality LF images. Different image quality assessment methods are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, such as PSNR, SSIM, IWSSIM, FSIM, GFM, MDFM, and HDR-VDP. Additionally, the computational efficiency was evaluated in terms of number of parameters and FLOPs, and experimental results demonstrated that our proposed framework reached the highest performance in most of the datasets used.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Automotive Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications"

The trained YOLOv5 then detects the frequency bands from spectrogram images by bounding boxes. The trained YOLOv5 performance achieves 99.3% precision and 100% recall (sensitivity) on the training dataset.

The effects of Na modification and pretreatment atmosphere on phase evolution of Fe2O3 sample and the synergistic effect between iron oxides and carbides were investigated using in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD). The physiochemical properties of catalyst were characterized by H2-TPR and CO+H2-TPSR-MS. When the reducing environment is H2, Na promoter inhibited the reduction of Fe2O3. However, when the reducing atmosphere is syngas (CO/H2 = 1:2), a suitable amount of Na promoter decreased the reduction and activation temperatures, and increased the iron carbide concentration. The selectivity of light olefins increased from 0.3% to 20.2%, and CO2 conversion increased from 7.3% to 25.8% when syngas was used as the reducing gas compared to using H2 as the reducing gas. Compared with pure Fe2O3, the CH4 selectivity of Na modified Fe2O3 decreased from 43.2% to 14.9%, while the selectivity of C5+ increased from 7.8% to 37.0%, owing to the fact that the Fe5C2 content increased from 8.5% to 38.4%. The ratio of Fe3O4 to Fe5C2 in the catalyst could be effectively controlled by changing the reducing atmosphere and the amount of Na promoter, thereby improving the CO2 hydrogenation activity and target product selectivity.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Accordingly, the cellular biomass growth and lipid content in relation to the organic nutrient removals from municipal wastewater medium were evaluated from the various light/dark photoperiod cycles amidst mixotrophic metabolism. The mixotrophic treatment had been proven effective in producing high microalgal biomass and lipid while alternating its autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms. Thus, exploiting the optimum cellular biosynthesis pathways in inducing both biomass growth and lipid accumulation. Amidst mixotrophy, prolonging light condition would favour biomass growth, whilst extending dark condition had elevated cell lipid content. Accordingly, the 16:8 (light:dark) hours/cycle photoperiod was found adequate in yielding high biomass and lipid productions (0.89 and 0.16 g/L, respectively), while achieving near complete removal (>94%) of chemical oxygen demand and ammonium-nitrogen from municipal wastewater.

The present study aimed to produce CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells for a non-radioactive binding assay as a platform to identify drug candidates targeting CXCR4. Main methods: HEK293T cells stably expressing human CXCR4 were constructed by transfection of CXCR4 plasmids from the human CXCR4 gene. The CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells were obtained by fluorescence-activated sorting and verified by conducting the competition binding assay of a known CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 (plerixafor), to determine the IC50 value against monoclonal anti-human CD184 (hCD184) antibody tagged with fluorescence probe, phycoerythrin (PE). The non-radioactive binding assay using CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells and PE-anti hCD184 was applied as a platform for identifying the target of natural compounds that exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. Key findings: The CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells were produced with high expression (99.8%). The IC50 value of plerixafor determined by fluorescence tagged antibody-based competition assay using our developed cells agree with previously reported values using a radioligand binding assay. We observed no significant displacement of bound PE-anti-hCD184 by the test natural compounds which could be due to non-specific binding to other functional targets or organelles, low potency of the natural compounds, or binding to CXCR4 at deeper pockets. Significance: The verified non-radioactive binding assay can serve as an alternative screening tool for anticancer lead compounds targeting CXCR4 and an essential tool for proof of mechanism study in the drug discovery.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

These systems provide an alternative approach to restore lost motor functions in stroke patients by inducing brain plasticity. To utilize BCI systems for stroke rehabilitation, user movement intentions from electroencephalogram are used as triggers for rehabilitation tools such as electrical stimulators. A reliable movement intention detection plays a vital role in an effective rehabilitation to establish a relation between movement intentions and corresponding feedback from a rehabilitation tool. We therefore propose a novel movement intention detection algorithm based on time series shapelets. We collected a dataset of subjects performing a self-pace ankle dorsiflexion and tested the algorithm in both classification and pseudo-online detection. The classification results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms six other algorithms and achieves the highest classification performance with F1-score of 0.82. For pseudo-online detection, our algorithm gains very high performance in all performance metrics with 69% True Positive Rate (TPR), 8 False Positives per minute (FPs/min), and 44 ms Detection Latency (DL). Our proposed algorithm does not only provide competitive performance to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of TPR, but also maintain low FPs/min and DL. In addition, the DL of our proposed algorithm is low enough to induce effective brain plasticity for neurorehabilitation. These promising results enlighten the development of asynchronous BCI systems based on time series mining techniques to enhance stroke rehabilitation results.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

It is also a competitive industry for retailers who would like to gain attention from customers and grow their profit. To achieve their goals, doing promotion is a way to go. However, promotion has two sides where the gain is also coming with the possibility of loss, so a thoughtful decision is concerned when doing the promotion. This study aims to develop agent-based simulation, an approach to deal with complex and high-dimension problems, to find how each strategy works on different price elasticities for strategic insights for the company's future planning. The agent-based simulation is able to reach many possibilities of combinations between strategy and price elasticity instead of testing or gathering data in the real world. To achieve our purpose, we vary strategies while fixing the price elasticity and see how customers react in each situation. The customer's decision is initially based two factors (advertisement effectiveness, and word of mouth), and then it is based on price reduction rate when they come to the store. The strategy is designed on two dimensions, percentage of price reduction and frequency of the promotion. The result shows that different strategies work on different price elasticity values where high price reduction rate strategy works well on high price elasticity, and vice versa. This study provides an insight about promotional strategy selection and future vision for a new method to approach complex problems.","fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Our objective was to assess the add-on benefits of saline treatment in adults with ARS. Methods: Literature searches were performed (updated May 9, 2021). Randomized, controlled trials studying the effects of nasal saline treatment in adults with ARS were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Outcomes were composite symptoms score (CSS), disease-specific quality-of-life (DS-QoL) score, individual symptom score, endoscopy score, saccharin transit time, cure rate, days to resolution, and adverse events. Results: Eleven studies (718 patients) were included in our investigation. Nasal discharge was the only symptom improved (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.66 to −0.05]. Saline as an add-on treatment brought no benefit to CSS and DS-QoL score at both time-points (3-10 days and at the end of the study).

Fragment/short-chain hyaluronic acid (sHA) was incorporated in this hydrogel to encourage the bio-synergistic effects of two different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid. The physical properties of the hydrogel system, including gelation time, mechanical profile, swelling and degrading behavior, etc., were tested to assess the effect of incorporated sHA. Additionally, the biological properties of the hydrogels were performed in both in vitro and in vivo models. The results revealed that sHA slightly interfered with some behaviors of networking systems; however, the overall properties were not significantly changed compared to the base MeHA hydrogel. In addition, all hydrogel formulations were found to be compatible with oral tissues in both in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, this HA-based hydrogel could be a promising delivery system for low molecular weight macromolecules.

Seven other A. pleuropneumoniae-specific marker candidates within the eamA, nusG, sppA, xerD, ybbN, ycfL, and ychJ genes were validated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be specific to 129 isolates of A. pleuropneumoniae (covering all 19 serovars), but not to four closely related Actinobacillus species, four [Actinobacillus] species, or seven other bacterial species. This is the first study to identify A. pleuropneumoniae-specific markers through genome mining. Seven novel A. pleuropneumoniae-specific DNA markers were identified by a combination of in silico and molecular methods and can serve as additional or alternative targets for A. pleuropneumoniae diagnostics, potentially leading to better control of the disease. IMPORTANCE Species-specific markers are crucial for infectious disease diagnostics. Mutations within a marker sequence can lead to false-negative results, inappropriate treatment, and economic loss. The availability of several species-specific markers is therefore desirable. In this study, 12 DNA markers specific to A. pleuropneumoniae, a pig pathogen, were simultaneously identified. Five marker candidates are within a known A. pleuropneumoniae-specific gene. Seven novel markers can be used as additional targets in DNA-based diagnostics, which in turn can expedite disease diagnosis, assist farm management, and lead to better animal health and food security. The marker discovery strategy outlined herein requires less time, effort, and cost, and results in more markers compared with conventional methods. Identification of species-specific markers of other pathogens and corresponding infectious disease diagnostics are possible, conceivably improving health care and the economy.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, environmental, Immunology, medical","Physiology, Ecology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Cell Biology, Infectious Diseases"
"The influence of the National Health Insurance scheme of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic on healthcare access and catastrophic health expenditures for patients with chronic renal disease, and the possibility of integrating organ transplantation into the health financing system","Bodhisane S., Pongpanich S.",2022-12-01,"Health Expenditures, Health Services Accessibility, Healthcare Financing, Humans, Laos, National Health Programs, Organ Transplantation, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Accessibility to haemodialysis, Chronic kidney health issues, Haemodialysis, Haemodialysis-related expenditures, Health financing coverage, Kidney transplant, Lao National Health Insurance","Citizens of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic have difficulties in obtaining proper health services compared to more developed countries, due to the lack of available health facilities and health financing programmes. Haemodialysis (HD) is currently included under the coverage of the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme. However, there are several technical barriers related to health service utilization. This study aims to analyse the effects of the Lao NHI on issues of accessibility and the possibility of encountering catastrophic health expenditures for patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, the study provides policy recommendations for policy-makers regarding the provision of organ transplantation under NHI in the future. Savannakhet Province was purposively selected as a study site, where 342 respondents participated in the study. Two logistic regression models are used to assess the effectiveness of the NHI in terms of accessibility and financial protection against catastrophic health expenditures. The Andersen behavioural model is applied as a guideline to identify factors that affect accessibility and economic catastrophe. NHI is found to improve accessibility to health service utilization for household members with chronic kidney disease. However, due to the limited HD services, there are barriers to accessing health services and a risk of financial hardship due to nonmedical expenditures. Chronic conditions, in addition to kidney issues, dramatically increase the chances of suffering catastrophic health expenditures. In the short run, collaboration with neighbouring countries’ hospitals through copayment programmes is strongly recommended for NHI’s policy-makers. For long-term policy guidelines, the government should move forward to include kidney transplantation in the NHI healthcare system.",medical,Health Policy

After reeling of silk, the silkworms are treated as waste and disposed. However, the silkworms contain up to 25–30 % proteins, 40 % oil and 20–25 % carbohydrates and are inexpensive and a renewable resource for various biopolymers. Proteins extracted from silkworms had purity of 90 %, molecular weights of about 30 kDa and were soluble in a weak alkali. The proteins could be made into films using a simple compression molding technique. Hydroxyapatite (HA) was synthesized and added to the proteins to promote cell growth for tissue engineering applications. The changes in the structure, properties and enhancement in cell viability and growth due to the addition of HA were studied. The ability of the films to differentiate osteoblast cells was determined using ALP assay and calcium activity tests. Results showed that the addition of HA increased the tensile properties including the strength (3.5 to 5.5 MPa, elongation from 3.3 to 5.7 % and modulus from 153 to 242 MPa). However, no significant change was observed in terms of cell attachment, growth or viability. Yet, the inclusion of HA did not increase the cytotoxicity and hence, is considered to be beneficial to obtain silkworm protein-based films.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Methods: Postoperative magnetic resonance images of patients who underwent XLIF and OLIF for degenerative spine diseases were reviewed. An axial cut T2-weighted image that was the middle cut of operated disc space was selected. We divided the disc area into 5 zones: central, left anterior, left posterior, right anterior, and right posterior. Disc area was measured using a picture archiving and communication system program. The angle of intervertebral cage was also measured. Results: A total of 61 levels of XLIF from 51 patients and 62 levels of OLIF from 34 patients were included. The area of unremoved disc at left anterior, right anterior, and left posterior zones of OLIF were significantly greater than XLIF (55.7 ± 41.5 vs. 29.8 ± 33.3 mm2, 57.9 ± 43.6 vs. 34.1 ± 33.1 mm2, and 50.5 ± 41.8 vs. 31.5 ± 35.9 mm2, respectively; P < 0.01). No significant differences were found at the right posterior and central zones. A 9.2° ± 6.1° and 0.7° ± 4.9° cage angulation from left anterior to right posterior was found in OLIF and XLIF, respectively, with statistical significance. Conclusions: Our study found a greater area of unremoved disc in OLIF compared with XLIF. The common locations were in the contralateral side of the surgical approach—right anterior in OLIF, and right posterior in XLIF. The greater area of the unremoved disc in the anterior zone after OLIF due to oblique corridor to disc space may cause cage malposition. Meticulous disc removal should be performed, especially in OLIF, to prevent complications.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for articles published from inception until July 31, 2021. Forty-six studies on 3.798 MCI individuals and 6.063 healthy controls were included. The O&NS/ANTIOX ratio was significantly higher in MCI than in controls with a Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)= 0.378 (95% CI: 0.250; 0.506). MCI individuals showed increased lipid peroxidation (SMD=0.774, 95%CI: 4.416; 1.132) and O&NS-associated toxicity (SMD=0.621, CI: 0.377; 0.865) and reduced glutathione (GSH) defenses (SMD=0.725, 95%CI: 0.269; 1.182) as compared with controls. MCI was also accompanied by significantly increased homocysteine (SMD=0.320, CI: 0.059; 0.581), but not protein oxidation, and lowered non-vitamin (SMD=0.347, CI: 0.168; 0.527) and vitamin (SMD=0.564, CI: 0.129; 0.999) antioxidant defenses. The results show that MCI is at least in part due to increased neuro-oxidative toxicity and suggest that treatments targeting lipid peroxidation and the GSH system may be used to treat or prevent MCI.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience","Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Aging, Molecular Biology, Neurology"
Comparison of transcriptomic profiles in edge to center of plaque reveals chronological molecular events in psoriatic plaque formation,"Boonpethkaew S., Meephansan J., Jumlongpim O., Charoensuksira S., Tangtanatakul P., Wongpiyabovorn J., Komine M.",2022-10-01,"Humans, Inflammation, Interleukins, Psoriasis, Skin, Skin Abnormalities, Transcriptome, Chronic skin disease, Cytokines, Genes, Inflammation, Pathogenesis, RNA-sequencing","Background: Peripheral edge (PE) of plaques contains inflammatory molecules and has potential to initiate plaque formation, while the center (CE) of plaques has regression trends. Objective: To elucidate the chronological molecular events by comparing the gene profiles in PE skin to those in CE skin. Methods: Biopsied PE, CE, and uninvolved (UN) skin samples were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Three groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed, PE/UN-, CE/UN-, and PE/CE-skin-derived DEGs. Results: PE skin contained inflammation-priming molecules, such as S100A7 and S100A15, and inflammatory drivers, such as interleukin (IL)-36α. IL-6 signaling was more active in PE than in CE skin. IL-8, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and human β-defensin-2 were all regulated with the similar pattern in both areas. However, PE skin created a more active inflammatory network and downstream functions, including chemotaxis and angiogenesis, were more prominent than in CE skin. Conversely, CE skin, where epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor increased their activity, was found to be more stable. Conclusion: This is the first RNA-seq-based report to determine the chronological molecular events in plaque formation. In the early phase, inflammation might be initiated through molecules, such as IL-36α, S100A7, and S100A15, as observed in PE skin. The inflammation state in PE skin progresses to the more stable state found in CE skin. In CE skin, the growth factor activities are increased, which might lead to attenuation of initial inflammation and initiation of the regression phase. These molecular events may accelerate research towards developing novel therapies for psoriasis.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"
Possible Pathways toward Carbon Neutrality in Thailand’s Electricity Sector by 2050 through the Introduction of H2 Blending in Natural Gas and Solar PV with BESS,"Diewvilai R., Audomvongseree K.",2022-06-01,"Battery energy storage systems, Carbon neutralities, Development planning, Generation expansion, Generation expansion planning, Hydrogen blending in natural gas, Power development, Power development planning, Solar photovoltaics, Thailand, battery energy storage system, carbon neutrality, generation expansion planning, hydrogen blending in natural gas, power development planning, solar photovoltaic","To avoid the potential adverse impacts of climate change from global warming, it is suggested that the target of net zero emissions should be reached by this mid-century. Thailand is aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Since electricity generation is one of the largest producers of carbon dioxide emission, the associated emissions must be greatly reduced to achieve the targets mentioned above. Thus, new generation expansion plans must be well developed. This paper discusses the development of generation expansion plans considering Thailand’s latest policies along with enhancement of the existing multi-period linear programming model, allowing new electricity generation technologies having low emissions, e.g., solar PV with battery and hydrogen blending in natural gas, to be integrated into generation expansion planning. Then, four generation expansion plans with different levels of hydrogen blending in natural gas are proposed and discussed. It is found that Thailand can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by promoting more use of renewable energy altogether with trade-off between land for solar PV installation and amount of hydrogen blended in natural gas. The lesson learned from this study provides crucial information about possible pathways to achieve carbon neutrality in the electricity sector for policy makers in other countries.","mixing and separation, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Prosthesis detachment and opposing enamel wear are major concerns in restorative dentistry. An experimental biopolymer, hybridized enamel, was synthesized and utilized as a dental prosthesis to compare hardness and tensile bond strength (TBS) with those of commercial materials. Vickers hardness (VHN) with a 100 g loading for 15 s at eight indentations on each specimen (n = 20) was measured. TBSs between prostheses and two types of resin luting agents (n = 10), Super-Bond C&B and All-Bond2 + Duo-Link, were tested. Fractured surfaces and the luting resin-prosthesis interface were examined under a stereomicroscope or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Statistically significant differences in the TBS and hardness were revealed (p < 0.05). The experimental biopolymer provided a hardness value comparable with human enamel and the highest TBS for both luting agent types. The SEM micrograph demonstrated a honeycomb-like pattern interface between the experimental biopolymer and luting resin. These results suggest that this experimental biopolymer may be a better restorative material to protect from natural enamel loss from tooth reduction or attrition and prevent prosthesis detachment during mastication.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The TPS crystalline pattern changes from a VH-type to an EH-type after TPS modification with a hydrophobic-PLLA segment. Heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation confirmed the successful formation of PLLA-TPS-PBS copolymers via two different in situ chemical modification pathways (i.e., (I) step-by-step modification and (II) one-pot reaction). All obtained PLLA-TPS-PBS copolymers functioned as the miscible phase, enhancing PLA/PLLA-TPS-PBS/PBS ternary blend miscibility, especially the random structural PLLA-TPS-PBS-II copolymers created in an in situ one-pot reaction. However, the PLLA-TPS-PBS-I copolymers can enhance PBS crystallization only. While the random PLLA-TPS-PBS-II copolymers exhibit a homogeneous multi-phase dispersion and crystallization acceleration in both the PLA and PBS chains. Moreover, the storage modulus level of the PLA/PLLA-TPS-PBS-II/PBS ternary blend remains high with a downward temperature shift in the glass transition region, indicating a stronger and more flexible system. The practical achievement of in situ modified TPS and, consequently, a miscible PLA/PLLA-TPS-PBS/PBS ternary blend with favorable physical properties, reveal its potential application in both compostable and food contact packaging.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

This article proposes a timed-up-and-go (TUG) task features analysis and classification of MCI and DEM using inertial measurement units (IMUs) in wearable devices. Our goal is to create a generalized model that can be used for preclinical screening. As a result, rather than classifying only one subtype of DEM, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), we classify all subtypes as DEM. We also utilize feature selection methods on features from TUG tasks to optimize the MCI and DEM classification performance. From the results, our generalized model can outperform other works in normal control (NC)-MCI&DEM classification with an accuracy of 86.94% and sensitivity of 97.40%. For NC-DEM classification, the performance of our generalized model is slightly lower than that of specific-subtype models (e.g., NC versus AD). However, our generalized model can outperform the specific-subtype models when using a diverse variety of subtypes. It is a reasonable tradeoff, and it can be a good first step toward a future where the patient can preclinically self-screening the cognitive impairments using wearable devices in free-living environments. This could allow patients to notice the cognitive impairment early on and seek a comprehensive diagnosis from a doctor.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Human populations and livelihoods in these coastal provinces are at greater risk than those in inland provinces. However, little is known about the communities’ resilience and coping capacities regarding hydrometeorological hazards of varying magnitudes. The study conducted a quantitative socio-economic assessment of how people in Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces manage and respond to hydrometeorological hazards, examining their resilience and coping capacities. This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data collection on the social and economic dimensions of resilience, and a review of literature on coping mechanisms to hydrometeorological hazards within the study area. Measuring and mapping socio-economic resilience was based on the available data gathered from the social and economic dimensions, with existing or standard indicators on exposure and vulnerability applied uniformly across subdistricts. A combination of social and economic dimensions produced novel socio-economic resilience index scores by subdistrict, which were mapped accordingly for the two coastal provinces. The study also derived a coping capacity index scores by combining availability of skills or soft capacity and availability of structural resources or hard coping capacity. Socio-economic resilience index scores varied greatly amongst subdistricts. Combining the soft and hard coping capacities, the average score across districts in both provinces was 3 out of a possible 4, meaning that most of the districts were largely resilient. However, variations also existed by subdistrict. Few subdistricts in both Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces had low coping capacity index scores between 1 and 2 out of 4. District averages of socio-economic resilience scores mask the variations at subdistrict level.

Statistical parameters of su variation - mean, coefficient of variance, and scale fluctuation (correlation length) - were estimated from simulated and field data. Monte Carlo probabilistic analyses were performed on embankment stability based on both stationary and nonstationary random fields and all copula approaches; results showed more frequent embankment failures at low water levels in the embankment ditch. In particular, the nonstationary random field (su increases with depth) simulations more closely reflected real observed data, with higher probabilities of slope failure and lower mean factor of safety than the stationary random field simulations.

Despite widespread vaccination, MD-related cases have been frequently observed worldwide, including in Thailand. However, no information is available on the genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand. This study investigated the geographic distribution and genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021 by analysing the Meq and pp38 genes. Out of a total of the 286 clinical samples obtained from 70 chicken farms located in major chicken raising areas of Thailand, 138 samples (48.25%) from 46 chicken farms (65.71%) tested positive for MDV-1 field strains. Results demonstrated that MDV-1 field strains were extensively distributed in major chicken raising areas. Phylogenetic analyses based on the Meq gene revealed that four clusters of MDV-1 circulated in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021. Among these clusters, cluster 1 was the predominant cluster circulating in chickens in Thailand. Additionally, our findings based on molecular characteristics of Meq and pp38 gene/protein suggested that most of the Thai MDV-1 field strains were potentially highly virulent. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the circulation of different clusters of MDV-1 with virulence characteristics in chickens in Thailand, indicating high genetic diversity of MDV-1 in Thailand.

Currently, B cell malignancies have been among the few cancers to which CAR T cells have shown persistent and resilient anti-tumor responses. A growing body of evidence suggests that the persistence of CAR T cells within patients following infusion is linked to the mitochondrial fitness of the CAR T cell, which could affect clinical outcomes. Analysis of CAR T cells from patients undergoing successful treatment has shown an increase in mitochondrial mass and fusion events, and a reduction in aerobic metabolism, highlighting the importance of mitochondria in CAR T cell function. Consequently, there has been recent interest and investment in approaches that focus on mitochondrial programming. In this regard, miRNAs are promising agents in mitochondrial reprogramming for several reasons: (1) natural and artificial miRNAs are non-immunogenic, (2) one miRNA can simultaneously modulate the expression of multiple genes within a pathway, (3) the small size of a sequence required for producing mature miRNA is ideal for use in viral vectors and (4) different precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) hairpins can be incorporated into a polycistronic miRNA cluster to create a miRNA cocktail. In this perspective, we describe the latest genetic engineering strategies that can be used to achieve the optimal expression of candidate miRNAs alongside a CAR construct. In addition, we include an in silico analysis of rational candidate miRNAs that could promote the mitochondrial fitness of CAR T cells.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Cell Biology"

Environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, genetic factors and viral infections may be implicated in the development of pterygia. Human papillomavirus (HPV), an oncogenic virus, has previous been detected in individuals with pterygia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HPV genotypes in pterygia from Thai individuals. Methods: DNA was extracted from 389 pterygia. HPV was detected by nested PCR and HPV genotyping was conducted using reverse hybridization. The DNA sequences of HPV-L1 genes were analyzed. Results: HPV was detected in only 6.8% (25/389) of pterygia from Thai individuals. The majority (16/25, 64%) of strains were genotyped as HPV-16 and the remainder (9/25, 36%) could not be typed. Four pterygia showed evidence of coinfection by HPV-16 and either HPV-18 (2/25, 8%) or HPV-58 (2/25, 8%). Nine of 11 samples showed the same HPV-16 L1 gene sequence that was identical to a HPV-16 reference sequence in GenBank. The remaining two samples each bore silent single nucleotide mutations (T1078G and T1081A) that did not result in amino acid changes. Conclusion: HPV, especially HPV-16, may be one of the pathogens causing pterygia in Thai individuals. Genotyping data suggested that HPV-16 from pterygia may be similar in sequence to HPV-16 causing cervical cancer.",medical,"Epidemiology, Ophthalmology"
Assessing face mask littering in urban environments and policy implications: The case of Bangkok,"Tesfaldet Y.T., Ndeh N.T., Budnard J., Treeson P.",2022-02-01,"Awareness, Bangkok, COVID-19, Face masks, Mask handling, Mask littering, Microplastics, Policy implications, Single use, Surgical face mask, COVID-19, Humans, Masks, Pandemics, SARS-CoV-2, Thailand, Awareness, COVID-19, Mask handling, Mask littering, Microplastic, Surgical face mask","Face mask usage is one of the preventive measures encouraged worldwide to limit the transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Hence, production and mass use of face masks is on the rise due to the pandemic as well as government rules that mandate citizens to wear face masks. However, the improper disposal of face masks has been polluting the environment with enormous hazardous waste. In this study, a face mask littering assessment in an urbanized environment, Bangkok, was carried out. Three streets in the city were selected and observed for face mask littering for 5 h per day for 42 days. Moreover, a questionnaire from 605 participants was recorded to determine mask handling and disposal practices. The study found a total of 170 single-use face masks within a 13.30 km path. Furthermore, the highest (40) and lowest (17) cumulative litter were recorded on Sunday and Monday, respectively. Buffer analysis at 300 m showed 47% of mask litter was found within five mass transit stations, while 15% are within a single street market. Of 605 respondents, 82.15% used a single-use face mask. Surprisingly, most of them (70.58%) disposed of used face masks in regular bins along with their household waste. The results highlight three policy implications to tackle the growing problem: raising awareness, regulation, and provision of bins designed for used face masks in strategic places and supporting innovations and research for eco-friendly face masks.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

It is important to identify candidate materials for optoelectronic devices, particularly for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and absorbers in tandem photovoltaics. Here, we fabricated MgSnN2 thin films, as promising II-IV-N2 semiconductors, on stainless-steel, glass, and silicon substrates via combinatorial radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The structural defects of the MgSnN2 films were studied as a function of the Sn power density, while the Mg and Sn atomic ratios remained constant. Polycrystalline orthorhombic MgSnN2 was grown on the (120) orientation within a wide optical band gap range of ∼2.20-2.17 eV. The carrier densities of 2.18× 1020 to 1.02 × 1021 cm-3, mobilities between 3.75 and 2.24 cm2/Vs, and a decrease in resistivity from 7.64 to 2.73 × 10-3 Ω cm were confirmed by Hall-effect measurements. These high carrier concentrations suggested that the optical band gap measurements were affected by a Burstein-Moss shift. Furthermore, the electrochemical capacitance properties of the optimal MgSnN2 film exhibited an areal capacitance of 152.5 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s with high retention stability. The experimental and theoretical results showed that MgSnN2 films were effective semiconductor nitrides toward the progression of solar absorbers and LEDs.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Methods: Selective caries removal to leathery dentin was performed in 40 extracted primary molars. The samples were scanned using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to determine the MMD baseline and randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10): Equia™ group, applied dentin conditioner and restored with H-GIC (Equia Forte™), CHX-Equia™ group, disinfected the cavity with 2% CHX before applying dentin conditioner and restored with H-GIC (Equia Forte™), Ketac™ group, restored with H-GIC (Ketac Universal™) and CHX-Ketac™ group, disinfected the cavity with 2% CHX before restored with H-GIC (Ketac Universal™). The samples underwent micro-CT scanning post-restoration and post-pH-cycling to determine their respective MMDs. One sample from each group was randomly selected to analyze by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The MMD gain in the 4 groups post-restoration was significantly different between the Equia™ and CHX-Ketac™ groups (oneway ANOVA with Post hoc (Tukey) test, P = 0.045). There was a significant difference in MMD gain post-restoration between the Equia™ and CHX-Equia™ groups (Independent t-test, P = 0.046). However, the Ketac™ and CHX-Ketac™ group’s MMD were similar. The SEM images revealed that the CHX-Ketac™ group had the smallest dentinal tubule orifices and the thickest intertubular dentin among the groups. However, the CHX-Equia™ group had thicker intertubular dentin than the Equia™ group. Conclusion: Applying 2% CHX on demineralized dentin enhances the remineralization of the dentin beneath the restoration.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

In this study, the silica nanoparticle (SNP) was added in an ultralow interfacial tension foam (ULIFT), called SNP-ULIFT foam, which was successfully prepared by ternary surfactant systems. The Carboxylate-based extended surfactant (Carboxylate), Dioctyl Sulfosuccinate Sodium salt (AOT), and Sodium Diphenyl Oxide Disulfonate (DODS) at a 0.48:0.48:0.04 wt ratio were conducted as the surfactant system. Remarkable results in the selected surfactant system were observed in terms of the ability to form foaming and ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) at 60 ± 2 °C with the ADNOC crude oil (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) as model oil. The optimum salinity of the surfactant system was found at 2.5 wt% (8:2 Na:Ca by weight), indicating a minimum IFT of 0.0019 mN/m. The adsorption capacities at the optimum salinity condition of each surfactant in the mixture onto the SNP's surface were 1.4, 7.3 and 19.4 molecule/nm2 for the DODS, Carboxylate and AOT surfactants, respectively; the calculated total surfactant adsorption was 2.6 mg surfactant/mg nanoparticles. While in the presence of SNP, the surfactant adsorption of the ternary surfactant foam system onto the sand surface was significantly reduced by 16.2% at 200 psi and 60 °C when compared with the neat ULIFT foam system. It was remarkably noted that the adsorption of the surfactant onto the SNP surface could result in a reduction of surfactant adsorption onto the sand surface. The oil recovery performance in the core flood by ULIFT foam was the greatest with 43% of Original Oil in Place (OOIP), and it further increased by 13% in the presence of 200 ppm SNP. In addition, the stress and viscosity of ULIFT microemulsion significantly decreased with SNP. This suspension exhibited the most non-Newtonian behavior with shear-thinning behavior over different ranges of shear rate. Therefore, SNP-ULIFT foam with the appropriate surfactant selection was a successful method for improving oil recovery performance.","oil field chemistryicals; enhanced recovery; surfactants, hydrocarbons, energy, earth sciences","Fuel Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of IBD demographics, disease phenotype, and treatment across 38 centers in 15 countries of South Asia, South-East Asia, and Middle East. Intergroup comparisons included gross national income (GNI) per capita. Results: Among 10 400 patients, ulcerative colitis (UC) was twice as common as Crohn's disease (CD), with a male predominance (UC 6678, CD 3495, IBD unclassified 227, and 58% male). Peak age of onset was in the third decade, with a low proportion of elderly-onset IBD (5% age > 60). Familial IBD was rare (5%). The extent of UC was predominantly distal (proctitis/left sided 67%), with most being treated with mesalamine (94%), steroids (54%), or immunomodulators (31%). Ileocolic CD (43%) was the commonest, with low rates of perianal disease (8%) and only 6% smokers. Diagnostic delay for CD was common (median 12 months; interquartile range 5–30). Treatment of CD included mesalamine, steroids, and immunomodulators (61%, 51%, and 56%, respectively), but a fifth received empirical antitubercular therapy. Treatment with biologics was uncommon (4% UC and 13% CD), which increased in countries with higher GNI per capita. Surgery rates were 0.1 (UC) and 2 (CD) per 100 patients per year. Conclusions: The IBD-ENC cohort provides insight into IBD in South-East Asia and the Middle East, but is not yet population based. UC is twice as common as CD, familial disease is uncommon, and rates of surgery are low. Biologic use correlates with per capita GNI.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

The present study sets out to examine the impact that pollution can have on the health of people living in the inner city of Bangkok, Thailand. Consequently, in 2021, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and coarse particulate matter (PM10) chemical composition and sources are evaluated at three locations in Bangkok. To identify the possible sources of such particulates, therefore, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is duly carried out. As determined via PCA, the major sources of air pollution in Bangkok are local emission sources and sea salt. The most significant local sources of PM2.5 and PM10 in Bangkok include primary combustion, such as vehicle emissions, coal combustion, biomass burning, secondary aerosol formation, industrial emissions, and dust sources. Except for the hazard quotient (HQ) of Ni and Mn of PM2.5 for adults, the HQ values of As, Cd, Cr, Mn, and Ni of both PM2.5 and PM10 were below the safe level (HQ = 1) for adults and children. This indicates that exposure to these metals would have non-carcinogenic health effects. Except for the carcinogenic risk (HI) value of Cr of PM2.5 and PM10, which can cause cancer in adults, at Bangna and Din Daeng, the HI values of Cd, Ni, As, and Pb of PM2.5 and PM10 are below the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). Ni and Mn pose non-carcinogenic risks, whereas Cr poses carcinogenic risks to adults via inhalation, a serious threat to the residents of Bangkok.","atmospheric pollution, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

A previous phylogenetic analysis based on spike genes suggested that PDCoV was divided into three different groups, including China, the United States, and Southeast Asia (SEA). SEA PDCoV, however, is genetically separated from China and the United States but shares a common ancestor. Its origin and evolution have yet been identified. Herein, phylodynamic analyses based on the full-length genome were performed to investigate the origin and evolution of SEA PDCoV. In the study, 18 full-length genome sequences of SEA PDCoV identified in 2013–2016 together with PDCoV from other regions were used in analyses. The results demonstrated that PDCoV was classified into two genogroups including G1 and G2. G1 is further evolved into G1a (China) and G1b (US). G2 (SEA) group is further evolved into three clades, including SEA-1 (Thailand), SEA-2 (Vietnam) and SEA-2r (Vietnam recombinant) clades. The time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of global PDCoV was estimated to be approximately 1989–1990 and possibly have been circulated in SEA more than a decade. SEA PDCoV is genetically diverse compared to China and U.S. PDCoV. The substitution rate of SEA PDCoV was lower than those of China and the United States, but the recombination rate of SEA was higher. Recombination analyses revealed four potential recombinant events in SEA PDCoV, suggesting that they were derived from the same ancestor of China PDCoV. The SEA-2r subgroup was potentially recombinant between SEA-2 and U.S. strains. In conclusion, the major mechanisms driving the complex evolution and genetic diversity of SEA PDCoV were multiple introductions of exotic PDCoV strains followed by recombination.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

The bone boundary model was created, while bone density types I–IV were determined. Von Mises stress was measured at bone tissues and bone-implant interfaces. To validate the models, the RAI was 3D printed through a laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) approach. The results revealed that all RAI designs could not cause plastic deformation or fracture resulting in lower stress than the ultimate tensile stress of natural bone and implant. Compared to a conventional screw-type implant, RAIs possess a more favorable stress distribution pattern around the bone tissue and the bone-implant interface. The presence of a porous structure was found to reduce the stress at cancellous bone in type IV bone density.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

However, the effectiveness and students’ attitudes towards this method under this special circumstance have not been exclusively studied. Hence, we aimed to evaluate these aspects of cardiovascular physiology teaching in an undergraduate medical curriculum. Methods: We analysed and compared the academic achievement and attitudes of 613 medical students on cardiovascular physiology between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 years in which different teaching methods were implemented. In addition, we also explored the importance of teaching methods and teachers by subgroup analysis to evaluate whether they influenced the academic achievement and attitudes of students. Results: Overall students’ academic achievement was significantly higher when lectures were taught by the traditional method than by the asynchronous online method. Moreover, subgroup analysis revealed that teachers were also a factor influencing students’ academic achievement. Although most students had positive attitudes towards asynchronous online lectures, overall satisfaction was slightly higher when all lectures were taught by the traditional method than by the asynchronous online method. Conclusions: Asynchronous online lectures might not be an effective teaching method especially during the abrupt change in education. Under the ‘new normal’ medical education, not only teaching methods but also teachers are the essential keys to the success in academic achievement and attitudes of undergraduate medical students.",sociology,Education

The hitting noise is observed when the passenger releases the grip to return to its normal position. The company notices that the current hitting noise is louder than the standard. The cause-and-effect matrix in the measure phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC approach is employed to identify the root causes of the problem. Such causes (factors) include spring constant, material, grip weight, hitting area, and operation angle. After the improvement phase, when all parameters of different factors are properly established according to the results obtained from the improvement phase, the hitting noise is reduced satisfactorily within the company's standard. Moreover, the damper is permanently removed from the assist grip resulting in a lower component cost.

Amino acid analysis showed that all Thai IAV-H11 viruses have low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) characteristics and sensitive to Oseltamivir and Amantadine. Novel reassortant viruses (IAV-H11N7 and IAV-H11N9) have been observed. The reassortant viruses contained NP, M, and NS gene segments which originate from intercontinental sources which never been reported in Thai IAVs. In summary, this study demonstrated high genetic diversity of IAV-H11 circulating in free-grazing ducks. Free-grazing ducks infected with IAVs generated novel reassortant IAV-H11. Thus, surveillance of IAVs in free-grazing ducks should be routinely conducted to monitor novel reassortant viruses and subsequently potential virulence viruses.",medical,"Epidemiology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The clinical outcomes of high neutralizing antibodies titer convalescent plasma therapy in early developed severe COVID-19 patients; a case–control study,"Nontawong N., Siripongboonsitti T., Tawinprai K., Boonpratoom M., Krailassiri N., Boonkhum C., Soonklang K., Poovorawan Y., Mahanonda N.",2022-12-01,"Antibodies, Neutralizing, Case-Control Studies, COVID-19, Humans, Immunization, Passive, Convalescent plasma, COVID-19, Mortality, Severe COVID-19","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes life-threatening pneumonia. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is expected to be the effective COVID-19 treatment for passive immunity. The high neutralizing antibodies titer of CPT is needed to prove the benefit in early developed severe COVID-19. Objective: This case–control study evaluated transfusion efficacy and adverse events with high-titer (≥ 1:320) COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared with standard care alone in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Among 107 severe COVID-19 patients, 55 received CPT plus standard care, and 52 received standard care alone. All-cause mortality was 15.3% in the CPT group compared with 85.4% in the standard care group (p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed reduced mortality with CPT (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.07–0.31; p < 0.001 and HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.08–0.79; p = 0.018, respectively). CPT resulted in decreased use of mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, and high-flow oxygen requirement. Clinical and radiological outcomes improved. Conclusions: Immediate high neutralizing antibody titer CPT is safe and reduces mortality in early developed severe COVID-19 patients. The benefit of CPT in the early course of illness is challenging and requires additional study.

Glycemic index and glycemic load of common fruit juices in Thailand,"Visuthranukul C., Sampatanukul P., Aroonparkmongkol S., Sirimongkol P., Chomtho S.",2022-12-01,"Adult, Blood Glucose, Citrus sinensis, Dietary Carbohydrates, Fruit and Vegetable Juices, Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load, Humans, Insulin, Thailand, Fructose, Fruit juice, Glycemic index, Glycemic load, Insulin, Postprandial glucose","Background: The glycemic index (GI) reflects body responses to different carbohydrate-rich foods. Generally, it cannot be simply predicted from the composition of the food but needs in vivo testing. Methods: Healthy adult volunteers with normal body mass index were recruited. Each volunteer was asked to participate in the study center twice in the first week to consume the reference glucose (50 g) and once a week thereafter to consume the study fruit juices in a random order. The study fruit juices were Florida orange juice, Tangerine orange juice, Blackcurrant mixed juice, and Veggie V9 orange carrot juice which were already available on the market. The serving size of each fruit juice was calculated to provide 50 g of glycemic carbohydrate. The fasting and subsequent venous blood samplings were obtained through the indwelling venous catheters at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the test drink consumption and immediately sent for plasma glucose and insulin. GI and insulin indices were calculated from the incremental area under the curve of postprandial glucose of the test drink divided by the reference drink. Glycemic load (GL) was calculated from the GI multiplied by carbohydrate content in the serving size. Results: A total of 12 volunteers participated in the study. Plasma glucose and insulin peaked at 30 min after the drink was consumed, and then started to decline at 120 min. Tangerine orange juice had the lowest GI (34.1 ± 18.7) and GL (8.1 g). Veggie V9 had the highest GI (69.6 ± 43.3) but it was in the third GL rank (12.4 g). The insulin responses correlated well with the GI. Fructose to glucose ratio was inversely associated with GI and insulin responses for all study fruit juices. Fiber contents in the study juices did not correlate with glycemic and insulin indices. Conclusions: The GIs of fruit juices were varied but consistently showed a positive correlation with insulin indices. Fruit juices with low GI are a healthier choice for people with diabetes as well as individuals who want to stay healthy since it produces more subtle postprandial glucose and insulin responses.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical, environmental","Food Science, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

PICF and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected for inflammatory cytokine detection by ELISA. Cytokine levels in PICF or GCF of the same individual were compared using the paired t-test, and those from titanium or gold-casting (UCLA) abutment were compared using the independent t-test. Human gingival fibroblast re sponses to PICF and GCF were then evaluated with one-way ANOVA. Results The results demonstrated that IL-6, IL-8, TNF, and IFNγ expressed in PICF are similar to GCF in the same ndividual. However, IL-1β (p 0.032) and IL-1 (p 0.030) was statistically significantly higher in PICF than in GCF. IL-8 level was statistically significantly higher with gold-casting than with titanium abutments (p 0.003). PICF statistically significantly stimulated higher expression of RANKL, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in human gingival fibro blasts (HGF), while focal adhesion kinase (FAK) suppressed mRNA. Conclusion The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-1β, are higher in healthy peri-implant tissues. Abut ment materials may also influence the level of inflammatory cytokines in PICF.

PCC 6803, NADPH is generated from photosynthesis and utilized in various metabolism, including the biosynthesis of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (the upstream substrate for carbon metabolism), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), photosynthetic pigments, and hydrogen gas (H2). Redirecting NADPH flow from one biosynthesis pathway to another has yet to be studied. Synechocystis's H2 synthesis, one of the pathways consuming NAD(P)H, was disrupted by the inactivation of hoxY and hoxH genes encoding the two catalytic subunits of hydrogenase. Such inactivation with a complete disruption of H2 synthesis led to 1.4-, 1.9-, and 2.1-fold increased cellular NAD(P)H levels when cells were cultured in normal medium (BG11), the medium without nitrate (-N), and the medium without phosphate (-P), respectively. After 49-52 d of cultivation in BG11 (when the nitrogen source in the media was depleted), the cells with disrupted H2 synthesis had 1.3-fold increased glycogen level compared to wild type of 83-85% (w/w dry weight), the highest level reported for cyanobacterial glycogen. The increased glycogen content observed by transmission electron microscopy was correlated with the increased levels of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate, the two substrates in glycogen synthesis. Disrupted H2 synthesis also enhanced PHB accumulation up to 1.4-fold under -P and 1.6-fold under -N and increased levels of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin) by 1.3- to 1.5-fold under BG11. Thus, disrupted H2 synthesis increased levels of NAD(P)H, which may be utilized for the biosynthesis of glycogen, PHB, and pigments. This strategy might be applicable for enhancing other biosynthetic pathways that utilize NAD(P)H.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science, Cell Biology"

Indigenous plants including Garcinia mangostana play a vital role in human health and well being. Many species of this plant have been reported with myriads of potent medicinal properties. However, the aims of this study were, for the first time, to isolate compounds from the flower of G. mangostana and to test their anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion activity against Acanthamoeba triangularis. Powdered flowers of G. mangostana were extracted and chromatographed on a silica gel column. The structures of the compounds were established with the aid of 1H NMR. More so, the anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion properties were tested on a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate and soft contact lenses. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the features of A. triangularis on contact lenses. Eight pure compounds were obtained, namely 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone, tovophillin A, garcinone E, garcinone B, α-mangostin, gartinin, 8-deoxygartinin and γ-mangostin. The extract and pure compounds exhibited anti-Acanthamoeba activity with MIC values in the range of 0.25–1 mg/mL. In addition, the extract and α-mangostin displayed significant activity against the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites both in polystyrene plate and in contact lenses at 0.5 × MIC (0.25 mg/mL). Furthermore, α-mangostin has the potential to remove A. triangularis adhesion in contact lenses similar to a commercial multipurpose solution (MPS). SEM study confirmed that crude extract and α-mangostin are effective as solutions for contact lenses, which removed A. triangularis trophozoites within 24 h. Alpha-mangostin was non-toxic to Vero cells at a concentration below 39 μM in 24 h. Crude extract of G. mangostana flower and its α-mangostin serve as candidate compounds in the treatment of Acanthamoeba infection or as lens care solution, since they can be used as a source of natural products against Acanthamoeba and virulence factor associated with the adhesion of A. triangularis.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

The best way to control influenza outbreaks is through vaccination. The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) is currently approved to manufacture influenza vaccines. However, the viral load from cell-based production is limited by host interferons (IFN). Interferon regulating factor 7 (IRF7) is a transcription factor for type-I IFN that plays an important role in regulating the anti-viral mechanism and eliminating viruses. We developed IRF7 knock-out MDCK cells (IRF7−/− MDCK) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The RNA expression levels of IRF7 in the IRF7−/− MDCK cells were reduced by 94.76% and 95.22% under the uninfected and infected conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the IRF7 protein level was also significantly lower in IRF7−/− MDCK cells for both uninfected (54.85% reduction) and viral infected conditions (32.27% reduction) compared to WT MDCK. The differential expression analysis of IFN-related genes demonstrated that the IRF7−/− MDCK cell had a lower interferon response than wildtype MDCK under the influenza-infected condition. Gene ontology revealed down-regulation of the defense response against virus and IFN-gamma production in IRF7−/− MDCK. The evaluation of influenza viral titers by RT-qPCR and hemagglutination assay (HA) revealed IRF7−/− MDCK cells had higher viral titers in cell supernatant, including A/pH1N1 (4 to 5-fold) and B/Yamagata (2-fold).

All participants used the first 12-week phase to monitor body weight. They were then randomly divided into two groups: (1) 300 mg IG or (2) placebo (PLA). Both groups took one tablet per day for 12 weeks. The variables were measured before supplementation and after 3, 6, and 12 weeks of supplementation. RTL and aerobic capacity were measured before and after 12 weeks. Compared with the PLA, the IG increased plasma vitamin C after supplementation at 6 (p < 0.01) and 12 weeks (p < 0.05) and serum adiponectin after 3 weeks (p < 0.05). Compared with before supplementation, plasma malondialdehyde in the IG and serum leptin in the PLA were decreased after 12-week supplementation, without any differences between the groups. There were no differences between groups with respect to metabolism, inflammation, RTL, and aerobic capacity after the supplementation. We suggest that 12-week daily IG supplementation improved plasma vitamin C and adiponectin. The findings show the possible mechanism contributing to the effect of IG supplementation on a reduction in obesity-related complications.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"
Comparison of intermetallic compound growth and tensile behavior of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu/Cu solder joints by conventional and microwave hybrid heating,"Said M., Sharif N.M., Nazeri M.F.M., Kheawhom S., Mohamad A.A.",2022-03-01,"Aging time, Comparatives studies, Growth behavior, Intermetallic compound growths, Isothermal ageing, Microwave hybrid heating, Sn-3.0ag-0.5cu solders, Solder joints, Tensile behaviors, Ultimate tensile strength, Interfacial reaction, Isothermal aging, Microwave hybrid heating, Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder, Tensile strength","Microwave hybrid heating (MHH) is a possible approach for soldering; yet, the long-term reliability of solder joints is still unclear. In this work, a comparative study was carried out on the influence of isothermal aging on SAC305/Cu solder joints by conventional reflow and MHH. The conventional reflow oven was set to 260 °C at 60 s holding time, and MHH was carried out at high operating power at 40 s. The reflowed sample was isothermally aged at 150 °C for various aging times (0, 240, 480 and 960 h) in a laboratory oven. The conventional reflow and MHH transformed the IMC structure from scallop-like to a planar-like Cu6Sn5 with a linear increase in thickness and a thin layer of Cu3Sn was observed at 240 h of aging. While Ag3Sn particles grew larger at longer aging time. The MHH shows a thinner Cu6Sn5 layer, and a smaller grain size compared to conventional reflow. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) for conventional reflow (32.7 MPa) is 26.8% lower compared to MHH (44.7 MPa). The UTS for MHH is greater than conventional reflow as the isothermal aging time increases.","heat exchange, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"
Zwitterionic nano-objects having functionalizable hydrophobic core: Formation via polymerization-induced self-assembly and their morphology,"Damsongsang P., Yusa S.-I., Hoven V.P.",2022-10-05,"(PPFPMA) and zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine), 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, Block co polymers, Core functionalization, Diblock-copolymer, Functionalizations, Pentafluorophenyl methacrylate, PISA, Polymer precursors, Zwitterionics, Block copolymer, Core functionalization, PISA, PMPC, Polymer precursor","Functionalizable poly(pentafluorophenyl methacrylate) (PPFPMA) and zwitterionic poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) are two polymers with an extremely different solubility. It is, therefore, almost impossible to synthesize their block copolymers in a controlled manner using a conventional approach. Herein, it is demonstrated, for the first time, that the synthesis and in situ formation of nanoassemblies of their diblock copolymers (PMPC-b-PPFPMA) can be achieved via polymerization-induced self-assembly using reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer dispersion polymerization in ethanol as a selective solvent. The PMPC was synthesized as the first block and further employed as a macro chain transfer agent (PMPC Macro-CTA) for the synthesis of the PPFPMA second block. In situ self-assembled nanostructures of the diblock copolymers were found to be mostly spherical with a varied degree of inter-micellar aggregation depending on the solid concentration and the relative length of the two blocks. Apparently, the limited chain mobility of the core-forming PPFPMA block, due to π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions, hampered the formation of nanostructures of high-order morphologies. It is possible to perform core functionalization via post-polymerization modification with 1-pyrenemethylamine to yield fluorescently labeled nanostructures that may be applicable as biocompatible and non-fouling nanocarriers and nanosensors in the future.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science, chemistry","Physics and Astronomy (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In this study, BC:HC (hydrolyzed collagen) blend films coated with 1 wt% chitosan (CS) were loaded with ascorbic acid to study loading/releasing performance. At first, the mechanical properties of the blend films were found to be dependent on HC ratio. After chitosan coating, the coated films were stronger due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction and the miscibility of two matrixes at the interface. The antibacterial activity test according to the AATCC Test Method revealed that chitosan-coated BC/HC films exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against S.aureus growth from the underneath and the above film when compared to BC and BC:HC films. Moreover, chitosan was attractive to ascorbic acid during drug loading. Consequently, its releasing performance was very poor. For BC:HC blend films, ascorbic acid loading/releasing performance was balanced by water swellability, which was controlled using blending formulation and coating. Another advantage of BC films and BC:HC blend films was that they were able to maintain active ascorbic acid for a long period of time, probably due to the presence of plenty of BC hemiacetal reducing ends (protective group).","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Here, polyelectrolyte complex membrane (PECs) of poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) [P+] and poly (styrene sulfonate) [P−] were modified by the in-situ polymerization of aniline monomer into polyaniline (PANI). The initial PECs were prepared by the co-precipitation of polyelectrolytes with various [P+]: [P−] molar ratio and were formed into 100 micron thin membranes by compression molding. The in-situ polymerization of PANI was achieved by sequential dipping of the PECs in ammonium peroxydisulfate solution to load the oxidant and in the aniline monomer solution to initiate the polymerization. Both the polyelectrolyte stoichiometry and the NaCl concentration used during the formation of the complex were found to have a profound effect on the polymerization reaction. UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the changes in color of the PANI membranes and to confirm the synthesis of PANI.

Two types of bio-oils, i.e., palm oil and soybean oil, were used, and distillate aromatic extract (DAE)-based petroleum oil was employed as a reference. The bio-oils caused no significant change in the vulcanization of rubber compounds cured using peroxide. However, the compounds containing bio-oils and cured with sulfur showed a faster vulcanization than the ones with DAE. The bio-oils strongly affected the crosslink density of rubber compounds in both curing systems. The use of bio-oils caused a low crosslink density due to the possible implication of curing agents to bio-oil molecules. The properties of rubber compounds dependent on the different levels of crosslink density were also investigated. The results revealed that when the crosslink density increased, the modulus, tensile strength, and hardness of the rubber compounds increased and the elongation at break and compression set decreased. The use of bio-oils in the rubber compounds cured with different curing systems gave low modulus at 300% strain, tensile strength, and hardness but high elongation at break and compression set when compared to the ones with DAE. However, no significant change was observed for the compression set of the rubber compounds cured using sulfur. With the presence of bio-oils, the properties of rubber compounds cured with sulfur system deteriorated less than those of the ones cured with peroxide.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The curing, mechanical, and morphological properties were studied to evaluate the mechanism of binary filler dispersion in the rubber matrix. Binary fillers comprising silica and graphite offered better mutual dispersion, which was observed by scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing and confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Better filler dispersion in natural rubber improved the mechanical and age resistance properties. The modulus at 100% strain and stress at break of unfilled rubber were increased by nearly 110% and 15%, respectively, when 20 phr (per hundred gram of rubber) of binary filler in a 1:1 weight ratio was used, and the composite exhibited better aging resistance and mechanical properties, compared to those of composites with single-filler systems, which may be attributable to the excellent filler dispersion in the rubber matrix.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
Municipal solid waste sanitary and open landfills: Contrasting sources of microplastics and its fate in their respective treatment systems,"Thaiyal Nayahi N., Ou B., Liu Y., Janjaroen D.",2022-12-20,"Controlled landfills, Disposal methods, Emerging pollutants, Leachates, Membrane treatments, Microplastics, Open dumping, Polymer types, Research studies, Treatment systems, Leachate, Microplastics, Open dumping, Sanitary landfill, Treatment system","Recently, research studies in identifying microplastics (MPs) from various environment has become a notable work, in the view of MPs as emerging pollutants as well as due to many undiscovered high-level impacts to both the environment and living beings. Out of many other sources, municipal solid waste land disposal methods, both controlled landfills and open dumping are observed to be one of the major sources of MPs origination as the predominant quantity of plastic wastes generated is being discarded in those methods. In this study, quantification, and characterization of MPs from the leachate generated from two different solid waste disposal methods and in their respective individual treatment systems were identified. From the studies, 20 different polymer types were spotted with the concentrations in the fresh leachate as 8.80 MPs/L and 9.93 MPs/L in the controlled landfill and open dumping, respectively. The fibers, films, and fragments are found to be the predominant polymer shapes in both the discarding process. Polypropylene and Polyethylene are the main prevailing polymer type in the controlled landfill, whereas polyethylene and polystyrene are in open dumping leachate samples. In addition, the analysis of the treatment system reveals that the ongoing units can remove the MPs from the leachate to some extent. For example, it removed ∼57.1% of MPs from landfill leachate using biological treatment combined with disinfection. Whereas ∼75.2% from the aerated lagoon and membrane treatment for leachate from the open dumping. More fibers with varying polymer types were identified from the effluent of membrane treatment, which is due to the membrane used. Finally, 37 MPs/g from dewatered sludge and ∼500 MPs/L of return sludge indicate the possibility of MPs that can reenter the biological system allowing an increase in the MPs abundance in the biological unit.","energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

First, a preliminary screening of several alcohols was carried out and showed that the MAE/n-butanol/water system had the potential to become an excellent phase change absorbent. Then, through phase change experiment, absorption experiment, desorption experiment, and theoretical energy consumption analysis, the MAE:n-butanol:water ratio of 3:4:3 possessed the most impressive CO2 capture performance. Theoretical calculation of CO2 desorption energy consumption showed that in comparison with 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA), 50% of reboiler heat duty can be reduced in case of the 3:4:3 system. In addition, equilibrium phase diagram of the three components showed that concentration of n-butanol significantly affected the phase separation. The two-phase species distribution after phase separation was determined using Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). This work also shows that temperature has influence on absorption and desorption performance. Finally, the absorbent stability test during absorption–desorption process confirmed that MAE/n-butanol/water absorbent had a great potential for capturing CO2.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Aberrant levels of DNA methylation and H3K9 acetylation in the testicular cells of crossbred cattle–yak showing infertility,"Phakdeedindan P., Wittayarat M., Tharasanit T., Techakumphu M., Shimazaki M., Sambuu R., Hirata M., Tanihara F., Taniguchi M., Otoi T., Sato Y.",2022-03-01,"Acetylation, Animals, Cattle, Cattle Diseases, DNA Methylation, Infertility, Male, Male, Spermatogenesis, Testis, 5MC, AcK9, cattle–yak, hybrid, spermatogenesis, yak","Although the interspecies hybridization of bovids, such as cattle–yak (Bos taurus × Bos grunniens), has heterosis benefits, the infertility of hybrid males affects the maintenance of dominant traits in subsequent generations. To achieve reproductive capacity, male germ cell development requires coordinated changes in gene expression, including DNA methylation and generalized histone modifications. Although gene expression-related mechanisms underlying hybrid male sterility have been investigated recently, information on the cell types and stage-specific controls remains limited. Here, we used immunohistochemistry and image analyses to evaluate the 5-methylcytosine (5MC) and acetyl-histone H3 Lys9 (AcK9) expression in all spermatogonia and testicular somatic cell types to determine their roles in cattle–yak spermatogenesis. Testicular tissues from yak (1–3 years old) and backcrossed hybrids (2 years old) were used. In yak, the AcK9 expression levels increased in all cell types during maturation, but the 5MC expression levels did not change until reaching 3 years when they increased in all testicular cell types, except spermatogonia. Cattle–yak hybrids showed higher 5MC expression levels and different AcK9 expression levels in all cell types compared to the same-aged yak. These results suggested that both gene modulation by AcK9 and constant levels of DNA methylation are required for spermatogenesis during maturation in yak. Therefore, inappropriate expression levels of both AcK9 and DNA methylation might be the major factors for disruption of normal germ cell development in cattle–yak. Additionally, various modulations occurred depending on the cell type. Further experiments are needed to identify the stage-specific gene expression modulations in each cell type in yak and cattle–yak to potentially solve the infertility issue in crossbreeding.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

In Thailand, Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis is the most frequent cause of visceral leishmaniasis and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis among HIV/AIDs patients. Amphotericin B (AmB) is the only drug currently available for the treatment of leishmaniasis in Thailand, but has some limitations like high renal toxicity and the prolonged hospitalization required for the treatment. Moreover, recurrence of the disease has been reported in several cases, indicating that new drugs or treatment strategies should be improved. In this study, Artesunate (ARS) was determined for anti-Leishmania activity against L. martiniquensis in promastigotes and amastigotes. In addition, the combination effects of ARS and AmB against intracellular amastigotes on THP-1 derived macrophages were also investigated for the first time. The result showed that L. martiniquensis was susceptible to ARS in both stages of the parasite. ARS was effective against intracellular amastigotes and safe to macrophage host cells, showing a SI value of 1,065. Furthermore, combination effects of ARS and AmB showed five synergistic combinations with a combination index (CI) value less than 1.0 (0.28–0.92) for intracellular amastigotes ranging from slight synergism to strong synergism. The strong synergistic combination had the highest dose reduction index (DRI), approximately a 9.7-fold reduction in AmB used. None of the treatments in combination had noticeable toxicity to THP-1 derived macrophages in the concentration range examined. The data provided in this study lead to further study in vivo and to develop a novel formulation of drug combinations to improve the outcome of leishmaniasis treatment.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

Materials and Methods: Patients with posterior ISSC under maintenance between July 2019 and July 2020 were recruited. OHRQoL of patients who self-reported food impaction between ISSC and teeth was evaluated by Oral Impacts on Daily Performance questionnaire and reported at patient level. Interproximal prosthesis contours and periodontal/peri-implant tissue conditions were assessed by clinical and radiographic examination. Differences between food impaction (FI) and non-food impaction (NFI) sites were analysed. Results: Totally, 178 patients (286 ISSC and 410 interproximal spaces) were included. Among 119 patients who self-reported food impaction, 84 (70.6%) reported their OHRQoL to be affected with minor-to-severe intensity. The most commonly affected daily performance was the ability to clean the teeth. Plaque accumulation at ISSC, deeper probing depth, complete interdental papilla fill, loose contact, longer contact length, lower contact point level, closer distance between ISSC and tooth, lesser embrasure surface area, tissue-level implant and cement-retained restoration were found significantly more in the FI group than the NFI group (p <.05). Conclusion: Interproximal features of the implant prosthesis were associated with food impaction between the ISSC and the adjacent tooth, which might affect periodontal and/or peri-implant tissue health conditions.

Antioxidants help counteract cellular oxidant species and maintain cell homeostasis. This study aimed to examine the protective effect of standardized ethanolic extract of Thunbergia laurifolia leaves on PM2.5mediated oxidative stress in epidermal keratinocytes. Materials and Methods: The extract was standardized with rosmarinic acid. Effects of standardized T. laurifolia extract (STLE) (0-400 μg/ml) and PM2.5 (0-32 μg/ml) on cell viability after 24 h of treatment were detected using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. PM2.5 (0-32 μg/ml) induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 6 h was monitored using 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Cells were co-treated for 6 h with PM2.5 (32 μg/ml) and STLE (25-100 μg/ml) and monitored for oxidative stress inhibition. Proteins related to cellular antioxidant defense system were examined by western blot analysis, after co-treatment and STLE treatment for 6 h and 24 h, respectively. Nuclear expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) and p62 were determined by immunofluorescence after co-treatment of 6 h. Results: PM2.5 (32 μg/ml) remarkably induced ROS production within 6 h. The co-treatment dramatically inhibited PM2.5induced oxidative stress at 6 h. In addition, STLE enhanced cellular defense system by increasing the levels of p62, NRF2 and superoxide dismutase 1 proteins. STLE stimulated nuclear localization and function of NRF2 and p62 proteins, while suppressing Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1.

The placenta showed a lymphohistiocytic villitis with isolated CMV inclusions, in combination with MFI. The villitis had features intermediate between CMV placentitis and villitis of unknown etiology (VUE). Conclusion: VUE is considered to be a maternal anti-fetal immune reaction resembling allograft rejection. We postulate that the viral infection in our case may have triggered this immune response, given that CMV antigens are known to cross react with some human antigens, in particular HLA.

Recent research suggests that FOG may result from dysfunctional plantar peripheral sensory systems. The impact of combined plantar pressure and vibratory stimulation over vibratory or pressure alone on FOG remains unexplored. Methods: PD patients with FOG were randomised into four groups and treated with combined vibratory and pressure stimulation, vibratory stimulation alone, pressure stimulation alone, or controls (no stimulation). Vibratory stimulation targeted both Achilles' tendons. Simultaneous bilateral pressure stimulation was applied to the first hallux, first metatarsal bone, and the sole. The primary outcome included normalized percent changes in percent FOG measured both pre- and immediately post-stimulation. Other outcomes including clinical rating scale, response to questionnaires, number and duration of freezing episodes, and spatiotemporal gait parameters at pre- and freezing episodes were also explored. Results: Sixty PD patients participated in the study. Patients who were treated with combined vibratory and pressure stimulation responded with significant decreases in normalized percent changes of percent FOG (62.75 ± 25.54%, p < 0.001) compared with those treated with vibration alone (11.38 ± 8.29%, p < 0.001), pressure alone (15.15 ± 16.18%, p < 0.001), or controls (8.59 ± 16.85%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the benefit of combined vibratory and pressure stimulation on FOG suggesting that this strategy might be developed as a novel treatment modality for PD patients with FOG.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

Multiple abiotic stress tolerances were found in these two actinobacterial strains, including Cd stress (CdS), drought stress (DS) and high-temperature stress (HTS). Both actinobacterial strains exhibited multifarious plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits such as phosphate solubilization, and production of indole-3-acetic acid, siderophores and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase under CdS, DS and HTS conditions. The inoculation of strains RA04 and RA07 significantly increased Sorghum bicolor growth and photosynthetic pigments under CdS, DS, HTS, CdS + DS and CdS + HTS conditions as compared to their respective uninoculated plants. The actinobacterial inoculants reduced malondialdehyde concentration and enhanced antioxidant enzymes in plants cultivated under various abiotic stress conditions, indicating that actinobacterial inoculants reduced oxidative damage. Furthermore, strains RA04 and RA07 enhanced the accumulation of Cd in plant tissues and the translocation of Cd from root to shoot under CdS, CdS + DS and CdS + HTS treatments as compared to their respective uninoculated plants. These findings suggest that RA04 and RA07 strains could be effective bio-inoculants to accelerate phytoremediation of Cd polluted soil even in DS and HTS conditions.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, plant ecology; genergyal, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

In contrast to the traditional design of MPPTs, it is demonstrated that the sampling frequency of MPPT can be increased to achieve an even faster dynamic than the settling time of the dc-voltage control loop as long as the closed-loop MPPT is still stable. Response time of the proposed P-V2 based MPPT can be designed with a much faster dynamic than the conventional MPPT methods while its stability is guaranteed because i) adopting the squared PV voltage makes the dc-voltage control loop linear, and ii) the whole MPPT system conforms to the Lure's systems whose stability can be rigorously analyzed to obtain design guidelines for stable MPPT.

Although numerous methods have been developed to mitigate the nulls, additional active circuitry was required, increasing the complexity. In this article, the MI waveguide with alternate magnetic coupling polarities between successive resonator cells is proposed for a true nulls-free DWPT system with no use of active components. Two configurations of the alternately coupled MI (ACMI) waveguide are developed-one with the incorporation of a quadrature-phase termination for a linear waveguide, and the other with the adoption of a circular waveguide. Extensive analysis of the generalized ACMI waveguide is provided, and the developed configurations are theoretically verified to maintain power transfer efficiency, independent of the free-positioned load. Practical implementation of DWPT systems using the linear and circular ACMI configurations with seven resonator cells at 13.56-MHz operation are experimentally demonstrated to exhibit no power transfer nulls and achieve up to fivefold reduction in efficiency variation, as compared to their MI counterparts. Comparisons with theoretical calculation are given for verification of the analysis integrity. An experimental model of a batteryless DWPT system is also demonstrated using the circular waveguide as accompanied by a video.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors for postoperative morbidity after extensive cytoreductive surgery for primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), particularly those which may be modifiable. Methods: Electronic databases were searched. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. Results: Fifteen relevant studies, involving 15,325 ovarian cancer patients, were included in this review. Severe 30-day postoperative complications occurred in 2,357 (15.4%) patients. The postoperative mortality rate was 1.92%. Meta-analysis demonstrated that patient with following risk factors; age (p<0.001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score >0 (p=0.001), albumin level <3.5 g/dL (p<0.001), presence of ascites on CT scan (p=0.013), stage IV disease (p<0.001) and extensive surgical procedure (p<0.001) has a significantly increase risk of developing postoperative complications. Surgical procedures including peritonectomy (p=0.012), splenectomy (p<0.001) and colon surgery (p<0.001) were significant predictors for postoperative complications. Moreover, we found that patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS) had a lower risk of developing severe complications compared to those who underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that patient performance status and hypoalbuminemia were the only significant adjustable preoperative risk factors associated with postoperative complications. Patients who underwent NACT-IDS had a lower risk of developing severe complications compared to PDS.

Flood resilience assessment was performed based on a multi-criteria decision-making approach or the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) of pairwise comparison. The results indicate that runoff is considered the most influential factor in flood hazards, followed by land use, rainfall, and historical flood events, sequentially. Regarding the flood incident management concept, a questionnaire survey (n = 552) was conducted to understand the impacts of flood on local communities. The findings reveal that 50% of respondents had never received any flood information or participated in training sessions on flood preparedness. Most reported their concerns about the inadequate supply of drinking water during a flood. Spearman’s correlation coefficient shows positive correlations between flood disaster relief payments, preparedness training, access to flood hazard mapping, emergency health services, and their flood preparation actions. According to the modified UNDRR indicators, the top three highest AHP values in building community resilience to flood hazards in Ayutthaya are flood risk scenario identification, the effectiveness of emergency flood disaster response, integrated urban planning, and disaster risk reduction. The policy implications of this research include the need for national authorities to better understand the role cities can play a vital role in supporting both national and international climate resilience frameworks, especially Thailand’s National Disaster Management Plan, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has emerged as a promising diagnostic platform for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, in part because it can be performed with simple instrumentation. However, isothermal amplification methods frequently yield spurious amplicons even in the absence of a template. Consequently, RT-LAMP assays can produce false positive results when they are based on generic intercalating dyes or pH-sensitive indicators. Here, we report the development of a sensitive RT-LAMP assay that leverages on a novel sequence-specific probe to guard against spurious amplicons. We show that our optimized fluorescent assay, termed LANTERN, takes only 30 min to complete and can be applied directly on swab or saliva samples. Furthermore, utilizing clinical RNA samples from 52 patients with COVID-19 infection and 21 healthy individuals, we demonstrate that our diagnostic test exhibits a specificity and positive predictive value of 95% with a sensitivity of 8 copies per reaction. Hence, our new probe-based RT-LAMP assay can serve as an inexpensive method for point-of-need diagnosis of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","engineering, biochemistryistry","Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)"

The differential diagnosis is broad, including both tumors and tumor-like lesions. Initial radiologic assessment is sometimes inaccurate. Histopathology is needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis. This study analyzed discrepancies between histopathology and radiologic findings of focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology. Methods: A six-year retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Thailand. All focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology were retrieved. Clinicopathologic features of these cases were analyzed. The pathological diagnosis was rendered primarily based on routine histopathology, using other ancillary studies as an adjunct. Results: 287 biopsies and 151 resection specimens with focal liver lesions were identified. In 12 (2.7%) cases, tumors or tumor-like lesions with spindle cell morphology were retrieved. A total of five cases had discrepancies between histopathology and radiologic findings. These lesions encompassed primary liver tumors (EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor and leiomyosarcoma); metastatic tumors (gastrointestinal stromal tumor, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma); and a tumor-like lesion (endometriosis). Several morphologic findings (i.e., cytologic grades, dense and loose areas, intratumoral lymphocytes, distinct perinuclear vacuoles, and hemosiderin) are important clues to diagnose these spindle cell lesions. Conclusions: Pathologists play a critical role in diagnosing focal liver lesions with spindle cell morphology, particularly those with limited clinical data at the initial presentation. A thorough evaluation of histomorphology on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides is essential for correct diagnosis.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine
Inactivation rate of African swine fever virus by a formaldehyde-based product,"Le V.P., Trinh T.B.N., Nguyen V.T., Nguyen T.L., Nuanualsuwan S.",2022-10-01,"African Swine Fever, African Swine Fever Virus, Animals, Commerce, Formaldehyde, Internationality, Sus scrofa, Swine, Swine Diseases, African swine fever, D value, formaldehyde-based product, inactivation rate","African swine fever (ASF) is an important transboundary animal disease with a high mortality rate. The high African swine fever virus (ASFV) titers in the excretion of infected wild boar possibly contaminate the feed ingredient. Once contaminated, it could support persistent residual titer of the ASFV. The chemical inactivation of imported feed ingredients is a precautionary risk management measure to restrict the import risk of ASFV through international trade. The log ASFV titers were linearly reduced as a function of the inactivation time after exposure to 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% formaldehyde-based product (FBP). A four-log reduction of ASFV titer was achieved after exposure to 0.2% FBP and 0.03%–0.1% FBP for 30-min and 60-min inactivation times, respectively. The decimal reduction time or D value is defined as the time required to inactivate the virus titer by 1 log. The ASFV inactivation rate from the independent experiment of FBP concentration was converted to a D value. The observed mean D0.2%, D0.1%, D0.05%, and D0.03% of FBP were 13.4, 44.9, 45.0, and 45.3 min per log reduction of ASFV, respectively. The interpretation of D0.2% of FBP is that the ASFV titer is inactivated by 1 log after being exposed to 0.2% FBP for every 13.4 min. A more effective chemical has a lower D value because of a shorter inactivation time required to achieve the same 1-log reduction. In addition, the hypothetical inactivation time by any chemical additive is scenario-specific and is calculated by the product of D value (at a certain concentration) and log titers of residual ASFV. This study introduces the concept and application of the D value to compare the virucidal activity of chemicals and to determine the hypothetical inactivation time of chemicals depending on the chemical concentration including the virus titer in the feed.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Food Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Genetics"

The cure, mechanical, and thermal properties of rubber vulcanizates were studied with magnesium oxide-based cure activator. Notable synergism in the delta torque, cross-link density, and mechanical properties was found when using binary accelerators with magnesium oxide. The zinc-containing thiocarbamate accelerator, ZDMC, showed better synergistic activity in presence of magnesium oxide than the non-zinc-based thiuram accelerator, TMTD. To find out the possibility of making a zinc-oxide-free natural rubber compound, a control compound was prepared with 5 phr of zinc oxide as a cure activator with the best evaluated binary accelerators system with magnesium oxide (3:6 millimolar ratio of ZDMC to MBTS).

This study implements a novelty detection method as a one-class classification to detect early signs of failure in a rolling bearing using long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder. LSTM autoencoder is a deep learning algorithm combining an autoencoder and LSTM network to reconstruct the normal data to learn nonlinear relationships and temporal nature. The model was tested on historical multivariate time-series fault data provided by Case Western Reserve University.

Among the prepared biocomposite films, the PLA/TixSiy films showed an improvement in the tensile strength and Young’s modulus (up to 5% and 31%, respectively) in comparison to neat PLA films. Photocatalytic efficiency to degrade methylene blue (MB), hydrolytic degradation, and in vitro degradation of PLA are significantly improved with the addition of TixSiy oxides. Furthermore, PLA with the addition of TixSiy oxides exhibited an excellent antibacterial effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli or E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus or S. aureus), indicating the improved antimicrobial effectiveness of PLA composites. Importantly, up to 5% TixSiy loading could promote more PLA degradation via the water absorption ability of mixed oxides. According to the research results, the PLA composite films produced with TixSiy oxide were transparent, capable of screening UV radiation, and exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy, making them an excellent food packaging material.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Synergistic interplay between Aliquat 336 and organophosphorus extractants towards non-dispersive extraction of arsenic from petroleum produced water via hollow fiber membrane contactor,"Mohdee V., Woraboot C., Maneeintr K., Nootong K., Pancharoen U.",2022-04-01,"Aliquat-336, Arsenic removal, Arsenic sludge, CYANEX 921, Extractability, Extractants, Hollow fiber membrane contactors, Non-dispersive separation, Organo-phosphorus extractants, Synergistic, Aliquat 336, Arsenic removal, Arsenic sludge, Hollow fiber membrane contactor, Non-dispersive separation, Synergistic","This work presents the elimination of arsenic from petroleum produced water via hollow fiber membrane contactor (HFMC). Results demonstrate that the extractability of arsenic is successfully achieved through the blended extractants of Aliquat 336 + Cyanex 921 suggesting the occurrence of synergism. Under optimum conditions, the extraction and stripping of arsenic achieved 94.42% and 78.90%, respectively. Slope analysis is applied to determine the stoichiometric coefficients of synergistic interplay. Both kinetics and mathematical modelling are employed to describe the behaviors arising in the HFMC system. It is seen that chemical reactions proved to govern the transportation of arsenic across HFMC. Besides, a novel approach as regards reaction mechanisms in a binary system is adopted.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; water pollution; control, mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

This research aimed to improve the versatile backbone for dense prediction without convolutions—namely, using the pyramid vision transformer (PRM-VS-TM) to incorporate attention mechanisms across various feature maps. Furthermore, the PRM-VS-TM constructs an end-to-end object detection system without convolutions and uses handcrafted components, such as dense anchors and non-maximum suspension (NMS). The present study was conducted on a private dataset, i.e., the Thailand Landsat-8 challenge. There are three baselines: DeepLab, Swin Transformer (Swin TF), and PRM-VS-TM. Results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms all current baselines on the Thailand Landsat-8 corpus, providing F1-scores greater than 80% in almost all categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our model, without utilizing pre-trained settings or any further post-processing, can outperform current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for both agriculture and forest classes.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Information Systems
PAC-MAN: Multi-Relation Network in Social Community for Personalized Hashtag Recommendation,"Padungkiatwattana U., Maneeroj S.",2022-01-01,"Attention mechanisms, Behavioral science, BERT, Bit-error rate, Correlation, Graph neural networks, Hashtag recommendation, Hashtags, Personalizations, Social communities, Social networking (online), Task analysis, attention mechanism, BERT, graph neural network, hashtag recommendation, personalization, Recommendation systems, social community","Previous personalized hashtag recommendations have been able to recommend suitable hashtags for a given microblog. Despite their performance improvement, we argue that three challenges remain unexplored. First, prior studies capture user interests solely from user-hashtag interactions that are directly connected (i.e., first-order relations), making them unable to deal with multiple user behaviors, including user-user social and hashtag-hashtag co-occurrence, and also restrict relations from similar users that are indirectly connected (i.e., high-order relations). Second, previous works personalize content at the microblog level, ignoring the personalized aspects that users have for each word in the microblog. Third, past studies capture correlations among hashtags in the same microblog from only the left-side correlations, restricting the right-side correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel integral model for personalized hashtag recommendation named PAC-MAN, which explores high-order multiple relations to model fruitful user and hashtag representation before fusing with word representation for word-level personalization and integrating with sequenceless hashtag correlation for the recommendation. First, to derive fruitful user and hashtag representation from higher-order multiple relations, Multi-relational Attentive Network (MAN) applies GNN to jointly capture relations on three communities: (1) user-hashtag interaction; (2) user-user social; and (3) hashtag-hashtag co-occurrence. Second, to personalize content at a word level, Person-And-Content based BERT (PAC) extends BERT to input not only word representations from the microblog but also the fruitful user representation from MAN, allowing each word to be fused with user aspects. Finally, to capture sequenceless hashtag correlations, the fruitful hashtag representations from MAN that contain the hashtag's community perspectives are inserted into BERT to integrate with the hashtag's word-semantic perspectives, and a hashtag prediction task is then conducted under the mask concept, enabling hashtag correlations to be obtained from both left and right sides without sequence constraints. Extensive experiments on the Twitter dataset demonstrate that PAC-MAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including neural network based and traditional graph based methods, over precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Though many countries have accepted conventional medicine as the best alternative to synthetic drugs, there exists limitations such as lack of awareness among general public and unavailability of easy access to its source evidences that has led to its limited acceptance and usability. Herein, an intelligent system is proposed to use Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi) and the RPi camera to capture the leaf images of Indian medicinal herbs and reveal their medical properties. Five types of models implemented to identify the medicinal plants. One of the models proposed as Herbmodel extracts a feature map from a captured medicinal leaf by combining three different feature extraction techniques, namely, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and histogram of oriented gradients on support vector machine as a classifier, predicts an average accuracy of 96.22% over a custom medicinal leaf dataset of 40 different species containing 2515 samples. Generate Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) by applying K-Means clustering on both SIFT and ORB descriptors to reduce the dimensionality. The combined feature vector is further analysed using random forest and k-nearest neighbor classifier. The efficacy of the proposed approach is benchmarked using Flavia dataset and artificial neural network (ANN) as a classifier. Our findings prove that the combination of local descriptors is an efficient measurement approach that benefits automatic recognition of plants based on leaf images. Also, a reliable source of medicinal leaf datasets with good quality leaf images is necessary to establish a machine learning model for medicinal plants.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Ni modified on calcined dolomite (Ni-DM) was used to determine the effectiveness of the catalytic activity and the effect of doping non-noble metals on the product distribution of both pyrolyzed biomasses. The lignocellulosic biomass components showed different effects on the decomposition characteristics of the pyrolysis vapor and its devolatilization, while Ni-DM showed a catalytic effect to enhance the decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and secondary reaction of tar cracking affecting CO2 and CO removal; additionally, the catalytic activity also promoted the formation of aliphatic and olefin hydrocarbon compounds and facilitated C–C cleavage and scission to smaller hydrocarbon compounds. With increased Ni loading, the yield of noncondensable gas increased. Furthermore, gas chromatography analysis indicated that the composition of gas mainly consisted of hydrogen gas, which increased significantly due to a water-gas shift during the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass at high temperature with 10% Ni-dispersed calcined dolomite acting as the catalyst. Meanwhile, the pore structure and the modified-Ni on calcined dolomite enhance decrease acids and sugars in bio-oil yield and favor the formation of alkane gases of liquid hydrocarbon fuels including the dramatically increased in alkane gases.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Engineering (all)

Many previous studies have shown that the auricular dimension varies among ethnic groups; however, there are currently no available data for the Thai population. The objective of this investigation was to provide normative values regarding the adult ear dimensions in Thailand. A total of 200 Thai volunteers between the ages of 18 and 70 years (80 men, 120 women) were enrolled in this study. We measured six dimensions, including the auricular, lobular, and conchal length and width and the auricular projection at the superaurale and tragal levels. Moreover, we calculated the auricular, lobular, and conchal indices. The selected dimensions of the external ears were shown as means ± standard deviations. These parameters were then compared between the right and left sides, men and women and participants aged ≥50 and <50 years. We found that men have a significantly larger and more projected ear than women do. The length of the entire auricles and the length of the earlobe were also significantly longer in the population ≥50 years than those <50 years.

Based on the amount of HPV present in each sample, the results revealed that the cervical virome of HPV-infected individuals could be split into two categories: HPV-dominated (HD; ≥60%) and non-HPV-dominated (NHD; <60%). Cervical samples contained traces of several human viral species, including the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4), torque teno virus (TTV), and influenza A virus. When compared to the HD group, the NHD group had a higher abundance of several viruses. Human viral diversity appears to be influenced by HPV dominance.

In this study, the characteristics and catalytic properties of OMC-supported Pt catalysts prepared by one-step modified soft-template self-assembly method (Pt/OMC-one-pot) were compared to the Pt impregnated on OMC, activated carbon (AC), and non-uniform meso/macroporous carbon (MC) in the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FA) under mild conditions (50℃, 2 MPa H2). Larger Pt particle size (~4 nm) was obtained on the Pt/OMC-one-pot comparing to all the impregnated ones, in which the Pt particle sizes were in the range 0.5 – 2 nm. Reduction step was not necessary on the Pt/OMC-one-pot and among the catalysts studied, the Pt/OMC-one-pot exhibited the highest furfural conversion and FA selectivity under aqueous conditions. The use of methanol as the solvent resulted in the formation of solvent product (2-furaldehyde dimethyl acetal) instead. The amount of Pt being deposited, location of Pt particles, and metal-support interaction strongly affected recyclability of the catalysts because some larger size Pt particles with weak metal-support interaction could be leached out during the liquid-phase reaction, rendering similar catalytic performances of the various porous carbon supported catalysts after the 3rd cycle of run.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

It is unclear whether body composition or its longitudinal changes contribute to increased mortality among prevalent PD patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS). Lean and fat tissue indices were derived from lean and fat mass indexed to height-squared, respectively. The patient’s baseline BIS results were used to explore its mortality risk prediction for the entire cohort. Among patients with subsequent BIS measurements, changes of lean and fat mass over time were also examined with survival outcomes. Results: Among all participants (n = 555, PD vintage 38 months), higher baseline lean tissue index was associated with lower mortality after adjusting for fat tissue index and confounders (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.84–0.97, p = 0.01). However, this association was no longer significance after the final adjustment with serum albumin level (p = 0.06). A total of 136 patients had repeated BIS data. After the interval of 10.1 months during two consecutive BIS measurements, there was a strong inverse correlation between the percentage changes of lean and fat tissue indices (r = − 0.73, p < 0.001). The longitudinal changes in lean mass, either high or low categories, were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality. In contrast, patients who were classified as having low values of fat tissue index (below median) from baseline to the next BIS measurements had a lower odds of death in the univariable (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12–0.84, p = 0.02) but not in the adjusted models. Conclusion: Among prevalent PD patients, higher baseline lean mass was independently associated with better survival.

In contrast, the maintenance of low fat status over time appeared to be associated with a lower likelihood of death among PD population.","urology and nephrology, medical","Nephrology, Urology"
Indirect Immobilised Jagged-1 Enhances Matrisome Proteins Associated with Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells: A Proteomic Study,"Chansaenroj A., Kornsuthisopon C., Roytrakul S., Phothichailert S., Rochanavibhata S., Fournier B.P.J., Srithanyarat S.S., Nowwarote N., Osathanon T.",2022-11-01,"Collagen Type VII, Dental Pulp, Extracellular Matrix, Fibrillar Collagens, Humans, Jagged-1 Protein, Osteogenesis, Proteomics, Stem Cells, extracellular matrix, human dental pulp stem cells, indirect immobilisation Jagged-1, proteomics","The indirect immobilisation of Jagged-1 (Jagged-1) promoted osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPs). Furthermore, the analysis of the Reactome pathway of RNA sequencing data indicates the upregulated genes involved with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hence, our objective was to investigate the effects of Jagged-1 on proteomic profiles of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC). hDPSCs were cultured on the surface coated with human IgG Fc fragment (hFc) and the surface coated with rhJagged1/Fc recombinant protein-coated surface. Cells were differentiated to the osteogenic lineage using an osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) for 14 days, and cells cultured in a growth medium were used as a control. The protein component of the cultured cells was extracted into the cytosol, membrane, nucleus, and cytoskeletal compartment. Subsequently, the proteomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Metascape gene list analysis reported that Jagged-1 stimulated the expression of the membrane trafficking protein (DOP1B), which can indirectly improve osteogenic differentiation. hDPSCs cultured on Jagged-1 surface under OM condition expressed COL27A1, MXRA5, COL7A1, and MMP16, which played an important role in osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, common matrisome proteins of all cellular components were related to osteogenesis/osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the gene ontology categorised by the biological process of cytosol, membrane, and cytoskeleton compartments was associated with the biomineralisation process. The gene ontology of different culture conditions in each cellular component showed several unique gene ontologies. Remarkably, the Jagged-1_OM culture condition showed the biological process related to odontogenesis in the membrane compartment. In conclusion, the Jagged-1 induces osteogenic differentiation could, mainly through the regulation of protein in the membrane compartment.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Structural Behavior of Large-Scale Hollow Section RC Beams and Strength Enhancement Using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Composites,"Sirisonthi A., Julphunthong P., Joyklad P., Suparp S., Ali N., Javid M.A., Chaiyasarn K., Hussain Q.",2022-01-01,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymers sheets, Carbon fibre reinforced polymer, Cost-benefits analysis, Fiber-reinforced polymers, Fibre reinforced polymers, Hollow section, Reinforced concrete beams, U shape, Ultimate deflection, Ultimate loads, Carbon, Cost-benefit analysis, Energy dissipation, Fiber reinforced polymers, Hollow section, Reinforced concrete beams, Strain, Ultimate deflection","An experimental program was conducted to ascertain the efficiency of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) in enhancing the flexural response of hollow section reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Nine beams were tested under four-point bending in three groups. Beams were cate-gorized to reflect the presence or configuration of the CFRP sheet. Each group consisted of three beams: one with a solid section, one with a square 50 × 50 mm x mm opening, and 1 with 100 × 100 mm x mm opening. Beams in 1st group were tested in as-built conditions. Beams in the 2nd group were strengthened with a single CFRP sheet bonded to their bottom sides. Configuration of CFRP sheet was altered to U-shape applied to the tension side of 3rd group beams. The inclusion of openings, regardless of their size, did not result in degradation of ultimate load and correspond-ing deflections. However, cracking loads were found to decline as the opening size increased. Regardless of the opening size and CFRP configuration, ultimate loads of beams increased with the application of CFRP. However, this improvement was limited to the debonding and rupture of CFRP in group 2 and 3 beams, respectively. A comparison in the behavior of group 2 and 3 beams revealed that the application of the U-shape CFRP sheet yielded better flexural performance in comparison with the flat-CFRP sheet bonded to the bottom of beams. In the end, In order to further evaluate the economic and performance benefits of these beams, the cost-benefit analysis was also performed. The analysis showed that the feasibility of the hollow section RC beams is more than the solid section RC beams.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
First-principles calculation on effects of oxygen vacancy on α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 during oxygen reduction reaction for rechargeable metal-air batteries,"Rittiruam M., Buapin P., Saelee T., Khajondetchairit P., Kheawhom S., Alling B., Praserthdam S., Ektarawong A., Praserthdam P.",2022-12-10,"Computational hydrogen electrode, Defect engineering, Density-functional-theory, Hydrogen electrodes, Manganese dioxide electrocatalyst, Metal-air battery, Oxygen reduction reaction, Performance, Reaction activity, ]+ catalyst, Computational hydrogen electrode, Defect surface, Density functional theory, Manganese dioxide electrocatalysts, ORR","MnO2 is widely applied as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in different metal-air batteries (MABs). Enhancing the ORR activity of MnO2-based catalysts is necessary for improving the performance of MABs. Defect-engineering of catalyst materials is a key approach for enabling the high performance of ORR. Here, the defect-engineering of α-MnO2 (211) and β-MnO2 (110) by oxygen vacancy (OV) is investigated using the first-principles density functional theory calculation. The geometric structure, adsorption, electronic conductivity, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity are studied. As a result, the OV induces the geometric structure that the Mn–Mn and Mn–O distances are closer when the catalysts lose the oxygen atom(s) on the top-layer surfaces. The presence of OV not only enhances the adsorption energy of *OOH, *O, and *OH, but also increases the electronic conductivity analyzed via the electron transfer. The Bader charge analysis demonstrates that the Mn(IV) can be altered to Mn(III) by the electron accumulation from OV. The volcano plot of ORR overpotential indicates that having the excess OV concentration on MnO2 surfaces cannot enhance the ORR activity. The excellent activity is yielded by 12.50 % OV α-(211) and 66.66 % OV β-(110) with the ORR overpotential of 0.31 V and 0.60 V, respectively. The results demonstrate that Ov is an essential parameter defining the existence of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) on the surface of MnO2-based catalysts. The optimal ratio of Mn(IV):Mn(III) is in challenge developing the α-MnO2 and β-MnO2 electrocatalyst cathode for metal-air batteries. This study provides a guideline for developing the potential cathode catalyst for MABs, used for harvesting energy.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of BRAF V600E expression with clinicopathological features and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with ameloblastoma. Seventy-four conventional ameloblastoma samples were collected. Immunohistochemistry using anti-BRAF V600E antibody was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes were retrieved from the patient medical records. BRAF V600E immunoreactivity was detected in 50/74 cases (67.6%); 39 were strongly positive and 11 weakly. There was a significant difference in BRAF V600E expression between ameloblastoma and dental follicle (P = 0.034). However, there was no significant association of BRAF V600E expression with any clinicopathological features, including sex, age, location, duration, tumour size, radiographic appearance, cortical perforation, recurrence, and histological subtype. DFS analysis revealed that patients with BRAF-mutated ameloblastoma had a shorter median survival time (84 months vs 168 months) and lower 5-year survival rate (59% vs 67%) compared to the BRAF wild-type group; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.169). Moreover, logistic regression analysis revealed that treatment with enucleation was an independent risk factor for tumour recurrence (odds ratio 9.236; P = 0.028). This study demonstrated that the BRAF V600E mutation was not associated with any clinicopathological features of ameloblastoma. A trend towards earlier recurrence in tumours with BRAF mutation was observed, but this requires further investigation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the treatment modality is an important factor in determining recurrence in ameloblastoma despite genetic alterations.","orthopedic surgery, medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

Phonological STM, as proposed in the working memory model is closely linked to semantic LTM. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of maintenance with STM, and transfer of information with LTM are poorly understood. Candidate mechanisms within phonological STM are rehearsal (either articulatory or elaborative), and refreshing. There is also evidence of long-term learning within STM. In this paper we use the Behavior and Reasoning Descriptive Language (BRDL) to model human memory contents as well as the perceptions that allow humans to input information into STM. By using the Maude rewrite system to provide semantics to BRDL and dynamics to BRDL models, we can explore various cognitive theories about phonological STM maintenance and transfer of information for long-term retention, such as articulatory rehearsal, elaborative rehearsal, and refreshing. This approach has been implemented in a tool that allows cognitive scientists to carry out in silico the simulation of learning processes as well as the replication of experiments conducted with human beings in order to contrast alternative cognitive theories.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle’s flying fox, is an important host of NiV in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production, and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-fit model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand.",environmental,"Ecology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This study investigates the effects of root growth and decay on the changes in root biomechanical properties and the shearing behaviour of vegetated soils. Columns of compacted soils were grown with a grass species, Cynodon dactylon. The grass was grown for 6 months, followed by burning or herbicide applications to introduce root decay. The top part of each column was used for direct shear tests, whilst the roots collected from the bottom part were used for the measurements of root tensile and chemical properties. The vegetated soils displayed greater shear strength and larger dilatancy, which were attributable to the growth-induced increase in the root cellulose content, and thus the root tensile strength and modulus. Root decay, upon burning or herbicide use, caused significant declines in the root tensile properties, which translated to the reductions in soil dilatancy and soil shear strength lower than those of the fallow soil. Herbicide use introduced a much faster and significant loss of root reinforcement than burning because of the more severe decay and loss of root biomechanical properties.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Experiments were carried out to observe the behavior of an aqueous sessile drop in a parallel electrode system. The comparison between the experimental and numerical results shows a good agreement of the drop profiles for a wide range of the applied electric field. The calculated critical electric field of drop instability is lower than the value from the experiments by 4%.

Reliance on self-care for AR symptom management was substantial during the pandemic with many patients encouraged to only seek in-person medical care when necessary. The advantage of digital technology becomes apparent when patients and healthcare providers had to change and adapt their method of interaction from the regular physical face-to-face consultation to telehealth and mobile health in the provision of care. Despite the pandemic and the ever-evolving post pandemic situation, optimal management of AR remains paramount for both patients and healthcare professionals. A reshaping of the delivery of care is essential to accomplish this goal.

The gasification-MeOH process offered a higher amount of valuable product (methanol) and released a larger amount of CO2. The energy analysis indicated the two biomass conversion processes were exothermic process. The gasification-DME process presented a higher biomass conversion efficiency of 59.5% compared to 47.6% of the gasification-MeOH.

The half plane was mathematically constituted by the surface layer and bulk materials, and the mechanical response of each component was described by means of the Gurtin-Murdoch surface-elasticity and couple-stress elasticity theories, respectively. Under an applied eccentric load, the geometric compatibility condition for points within the contact region and the equilibrium conditions of the indenter were utilized to establish a set of governing equations for the unknown contact pressure. Selected efficient numerical schemes, based mainly upon the solution discretization, the standard collocation technique, and the fundamental solution of an elastic half plane under surface normal loads, were developed to construct the solution of complete and receding contacts numerically. Obtained results from an extensive numerical study apparently reflect the crucial effects of the surface and couple stresses on the indentation behaviors of the tilted indenters and the elastic response of the bulk material, and, in particular, the strong size-dependency of solutions when the width of the indenter becomes comparable to the length scale parameter of the surface and bulk materials. These characteristics not only provide valuable information for a better understanding of the mechanical properties of materials by micro-/nano-indentation tests, but also facilitate a basis for further investigations in the area of micro-/nano-mechanics.","Materials Sciencerials handling equipment, fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

The magnitude of axial force was 25% of the nominal compressive strength. Therefore, test variables included the presence of axial force (beam or column), stirrup spacing (75 or 150 mm), hook angle (90 or 135°) of the closed stirrups, and presence of CFRP sheets. Test results showed that the externally bonded CFRP sheets significantly increased the cracking, yielding, and maximum torsional moment capacities of RC beams and columns. The full wrap configuration enhanced the maximum torsional moment capacity by up to 190% and 116% for RC beams and columns, respectively. Also, the use of 135-degree hook for closed-stirrups was more effective than 90-degree hook for both unwrapped and CFRP-wrapped members.

Due to the widespread delta variant, more than 600 healthcare workers had COVID-19 despite completion of two-dose CoronaVac. The Ministry of Public Health recommended that healthcare workers received a third dose of AZD1222 to increase level of protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, immune response after the AZD1222 booster in individuals who completed the two-dose CoronaVac vaccine are limited. In this study, sera from those who received a booster of AZD1222 in June-July 2021 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG, anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and anti-spike protein 1 (S1) IgA. The neutralizing activities in a subset of serum samples were tested against the wild type and variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.617.2, and B.1.351) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based surrogate virus neutralization test. Participants who received the booster of AZD1222 possessed higher levels of spike RBD-specific IgG, total immunoglobulins, and anti-S1 IgA than the two-dose vaccinees (p < 0.001). They also elicited higher neutralizing activity against the wild type and all variants of concern than the recipients of the two-dose vaccines. This study demonstrated a high immunogenicity of the AZD1222 booster in individuals who completed the two-dose inactivated vaccines.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
"Effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) service model to enhance family-based long-term care for Thai older adults in Chiang Mai, Thailand: a cluster-randomized controlled trial TCTR20190412004","Aung M.N., Moolphate S., Aung T.N.N., Koyanagi Y., Kurusattra A., Chantaraksa S., Supakankunti S., Yuasa M.",2022-11-01,"Activities of Daily Living, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, COVID-19, Female, Humans, Long-Term Care, Pandemics, Thailand, Asia, Frailty, Global health, Health promotion, Implementation research, Population ageing, Service delivery model, Universal coverage","Background: Populations around the world are ageing faster, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries where health and social care are yet to be universal and inclusive for the ageing population. This community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model is a novel prevention-based, long-term care model enhancing the family-based care system traditionally practised in Thailand and neighbouring Asian countries, and many low-and middle-income countries globally. This study assessed the effectiveness of the CIIC model in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods: The two-arm parallel intervention study was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The study population at randomization and analysis was 2788 participants: 1509 in six intervention clusters and 1279 in six control clusters. The research protocol was approved by the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee (WHO/ERC ID; ERC.0003064). The CIIC service intervention model is a combination of formal care and informal care in a subdistrict setting consisting of three components: (1) care prevention delivered as community group exercise and home exercise; (2) care capacity-building of the family caregiver; and (3) community respite service. The primary outcome was family caregivers’ burden at 6-month follow-up, and secondary outcome was activities of daily living. Analysis applied the intention-to-treat approach using cluster-level analysis via STATA 16 SE. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ between the two arms. Loss of follow up was 3.7%. Mean age of the participants was 69.53 years. Women constituted 60%. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delayed implementation. The proportion of families with reduced caregiver burden at 6-month follow-up was higher among the intervention clusters (mean 39.4%) than control clusters (mean 28.62%). The intervention clusters experienced less functional decline and fewer people with depression. Conclusions: When communities are integrated for preventing care, and families are empowered for giving care, it is possible to secure universal access to health and social care for the older persons, with basic resources mobilized from communities. This study had shown the CIIC model as an effective and potential step to the realization of universal health and long-term care coverage being inclusive of ageing populations in Thailand and globally.

Materials and Methods: Forty-four patients with clinical contrast-enhanced abdominal examinations on each of the 3 DECT scanner types and a phantom scanned with the same protocols were included in this retrospective study. Qualitative and quantitative assessment was performed on VUE images. Quantitative evaluation included measurement of attenuation and image noise for various tissues and the phantom. Virtual unenhanced image attenuation and noise were compared between scanner types, and intrapatient interscanner reproducibility of virtual unenhanced image attenuation was calculated as the percentage of measurement pairs with an interscanner difference ≤ 10 HU. Image quality, noise, sharpness, and iodine elimination were assessed qualitatively by 2 radiologists. Results: Significant interscanner differences in VUE attenuation and noise were found in all tissues. dlDECT and rsDECT showed significantly higher VUE attenuation than dsDECT in the aorta, portal vein, and kidneys (P < 0.05). Conversely, VUE attenuation in dsDECTwas significantly higher than in dlDECT/rsDECT for subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat (both P < 0.05). A total of 91.9% (385/419) of measurements were reproducible between rsDECT and dlDECT, 70.9% (297/419) between dsDECT and rsDECT, and 66.8% (280/419) between dsDECT and dlDECT. Virtual unenhanced image attenuation in the contrast media–filled phantom cavity was 12.7 ± 4.7 HU in dlDECT, −5.3 ± 4.2 HU in rsDECT, and −4.0 ± 10.7 HU in dsDECT with significant differences between dlDECT and rsDECT/dsDECT, respectively (P < 0.05), between which attenuation was comparable in the unenhanced extraluminal phantom component (P = 0.11–0.62). Qualitatively, dsDECTyielded best iodine elimination, whereas sharpness, image noise, and overall image quality were rated higher in dlDECT and rsDECT. Conclusions: There are significant interscanner differences in the attenuation measurements and qualitative assessment of VUE images, which should be acknowledged when using these images in patients that are being scanned on different DECT scanner types during imaging follow-up.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

SS coupons were subjected to surface roughness measurement using Atomic Force Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope. The surface of 316L/2B was the roughest surface while 403/2B and 304/BA were the least roughness surface. VP were able to attach on all SS surfaces immediately after contact. They tended to attach on the rougher surface of the SS samples better than the smoother ones. They could be released from surfaces into liquid medium and grew very fast, after contact. Attached cells formed multilayer clumps within 72 h. Cells in biofilms survived on all SS surfaces under dry condition for more than 72 h. The 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) completely eliminate 8 log10 CFU mL−1 planktonic cells immediately after contact, but it took more than 1 min to eliminate viable cells of 24 and 72h biofilms from 304/2B and 316L/2B.

Solvatochromic fluorescent styryl pyrene probes for the quantitative determination of water content in organic solvents,"Noikham M., Sriwiphasathit C., Siriwong K., Vilaivan T.",2022-12-01,"Intra-molecular charge transfer, Intramolecular charge transfer, Intramolecular charge transfers, Limit of detection, Pyrene probe, Quantitative determinations, Solvatochromic, Solvatochromisms, Synthesised, Water sensors, Fluorescence, Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), Pyrene, Solvatochromism, Water sensor","A series of D-π-A fluorescent styryl pyrene probes were synthesized through the Wittig reaction. The introduction of an electron-withdrawing substituent on the phenyl ring creates a push-pull system that shows solvent-dependent intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and solvatochromic properties. Among these, the styryl pyrene probes with nitro (Py-NO2) and aldehyde (Py-CHO) substituents exhibited remarkable sensitivity to environment polarity. They show remarkable fluorescence changes from green to red, and blue to orange in nonpolar to polar organic solvents, respectively. The results were explained by the Lippert-Mataga and ET(30) models, which were supported by theoretical calculations by the density functional theory (DFT). Importantly, the fluorescence emission of Py-NO2 in organic solvents is sensitive to the presence of water in the range of 0–34.2% (v/v) in THF, 0–9.1% (v/v) in DMF, and 0–39.7% (v/v) in CH3CN. The limits of detection of water were established as low as 0.007%, 0.033%, and 0.036% (v/v) in THF, DMF, and CH3CN, respectively. Py-CHO showed somewhat higher limits of detection than Py-NO2 for the same solvents but exhibited a broad linear response to water content in EtOH between 3.3 and 63.6% (v/v) water content with the limit of detection at 2.350% (v/v). Thus, it is possibly useful as a sensor for the wide range detection of alcohol content in beverages. These push-pull styryl pyrene probes not only served as a new supersensitive fluorescent sensor for the quantitative detection of low to medium-level water content in organic solvents but may also be useful in a broad range of applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

Gas absorption into aqueous amine solutions is an immediate technology for carbon capture that has been tested in many demonstration plants. One concern of using the amine-based carbon capture process is the environmental impacts and health risk caused by emissions of gaseous amines from the process to the atmosphere. This work applied the knowledge of air dispersion modelling to map out the atmospheric dispersion and resulting ground surface level concentration of gaseous amine, namely Monoethanolamine (MEA), from a coal-fired power plant (with a carbon capture unit) and in surrounding areas, in case of an accidental leaking of amine from the CCS system to the atmosphere. The chosen study area was centered on a coal-fired power plant in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. The Environmental Protection (EPA) approved air pollution model (CALPUFF), together with meteorological and geophysical data were used for gaseous amine dispersion simulation. The results were presented, and the ground amine concentrations were found to vary with wind patterns (wind direction and wind speed). The maximum ground surface amine concentrations standard is 15.2 µg/m3 . However, the results showed that when using the water wash unit, the MEA concentrations were well below the standard level, compared to those without the water wash unit. It is essential for CO2 capture plants located in highly populated areas to be equipped with water wash units.","mixing and separation, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Among tested substrates, the gluten/GG blend indicated a strong adhesion to wood and paper substrates and showed a maximum adhesive strength at 1.5 wt% of GG in the copolymer (gluten/GG-1.5%). The adhesive strength of gluten/GG-1.5% decreased in the acceptable range when it was applied in 10 repeated adhesion cycles. The gluten/GG-1.5% exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 0.12 S/m and stretchability of 465%. The gluten/GG-based sensor containing glycerol showed long-term stability of self-healing, remolding, and self-powered ability when stored for 7 days, whereas the self-adhesive ability decreased with increasing storage time. The self-adhesive gluten/GG-1.5% was used to monitor human limb movements, which showed remarkable sensitivity during the storage time of 3 days.

As people spend most of their time indoors, there is a high chance that they are exposed to indoor air pollution. This exposure might lead to adverse health outcomes such as allergies, infection, and respiratory diseases. Therefore, proper indoor environment management is crucial for promoting indoor air quality, consequently benefiting the health and well-being of occupants. In commercial spaces, a lot of people gather and perform various activities together, and higher concentrations of indoor air pollution are generated, which leads to accumulation of pollutants if proper management is not achieved, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when biological pollutants (i.e., viral particle) can accumulate indoors due to poor ventilation environment. In residential spaces, indoor air quality may worsen due to activities such as cooking, painting, using personal care products, and washing. These activities generate indoor air pollution, thus affecting the health of occupants. In addition, poor air quality in microenvironments apparently affects sleep quality. This chapter proposes a concept of indoor air quality management in commercial and residential spaces including sources and control. Moreover, the management technologies have been summarized varying from a simple technique that can be handled by the occupants to a more complicated technique that requires more equipment and professional skill. The methods provided here can benefit the occupants, especially the occupants living in limited-space residences, such as apartment buildings in urban areas.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics","Signal Processing, Instrumentation, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence"

Conventional image compression methods such as JPEG XR use a high quantization parameter (QP) to produce a highly compressed file for any given image. However, higher QP has unpleasing artifacts that lead to perceptual quality degradation. A feasible solution to tackle this limitation is to reduce the high-resolution image size by downsampling it before encoding with JPEG XR. Then, the super-resolution algorithm is applied to the resultant low-resolution image to reconstruct the high-resolution result. In this paper, we downsample the input image before JPEG XR. Then, we investigate the performance of integrating deep learning-based FSRCNN super-resolution (SR) with JPEG XR in terms of quality and compressed file size.

Unsaturated fatty acids viz., palmitoleic acid (16:1), have resulted in high yields (22.85%), followed by linoleic acid (18:2), 28.27%; oleic acid (C18:1), 14.38%; and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5), 4.49%. Hence, the simultaneous production of high value-added products, viz., astaxanthin, and lipids makes the whole process economically viable and environmentally sustainable and elevates the commercial potential during scale-up. The astaxanthin radical scavenging activity was also assessed by H2O2 assay, and the maximum scavenging activity was determined as 91%. The study confers the potential advantages of algal cultivation for high-value commercial product synthesis towards additional revenue generation and development of an efficient microalgae-based biorefinery process.

Heat shock protein 90 of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is possibly involved in promoting white spot syndrome virus infection,"Yingsunthonwattana W., Junprung W., Supungul P., Tassanakajon A.",2022-09-01,"Animals, Genes, Viral, Heat-Shock Proteins, Hemocytes, Penaeidae, White spot syndrome virus 1, Heat shock protein 90, Litopenaeus vannamei, White spot syndrome virus, WSSV pathogenesis","Viruses cause up to 60% of disease-associated losses in shrimp aquaculture, and the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a major viral pathogen in shrimp. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are host chaperones that help promote many viral infections. We investigated the involvement of Litopenaeus vannamei (Lv) HSP90 in WSSV infections. Expression of LvHSP90 at the transcript and protein levels were upregulated after WSSV infection. Silencing LvHSP90 resulted in the increased cumulative mortality rate and the reduction of circulating hemocytes. The inhibition of LvHSP90 also induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes which indicated the induction of apoptotic pathway and might lead to shrimp death. However, lower the number of WSSV-infected cells and viral copy numbers were detected in the LvHSP90-silenced shrimp compared with those of the controls, corresponding with significantly decreased expressions of viral genes, including the immediate-early genes WSV083 and WSV249 and viral DNA polymerase. Conversely, injecting shrimp with WSSV that had been co-incubated with a recombinant LvHSP90 (rLvHSP90) promoted WSSV infection as evidenced by an increased cumulative mortality rate and viral copy numbers at 40–48 h post infection (hpi). Subcellular localization of LvHSP90 in WSSV-infected hemocytes at 3, 6 and 12 hpi demonstrated increased expression and translocation of LvHSP90 into the nucleus where WSSV DNA can replicate. Thus, LvHSP90 might be involved in the WSSV pathogenesis by promoting WSSV replication.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Rapid biodegradation of high molecular weight semi-crystalline polylactic acid at ambient temperature via enzymatic and alkaline hydrolysis by a defined bacterial consortium,"Mistry A.N., Kachenchart B., Wongthanaroj A., Somwangthanaroj A., Luepromchai E.",2022-08-01,"Alkaline hydrolysis, Bacterial consortium, Biodegradation mechanism, High molecular weight, Hydrolytic enzyme, Natural environments, Plastics waste, Poly lactic acid films, Polylactic acid, Semicrystallines, Bacterial consortium, Biodegradation mechanism, Hydrolytic enzymes, Plastic waste, Polylactic acid","Biodegradation of polylactic acid (PLA) in the natural environment is usually slow. This study aims to develop a bacterial consortium that biodegrades semi-crystalline PLA films with high molecular weight, at an ambient temperature of 30 °C. PLA-degrading bacteria were enriched from polymeric wastes. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Actinobacteria relative abundances were high during the PLA-enrichment process. Four isolated bacteria, Nocardioides zeae EA12, Stenotrophomonas pavanii EA33, Gordonia desulfuricans EA63, and Chitinophaga jiangningensis EA02, which synthesized PLA degradative enzymes such as protease, esterase and lipase were mixed as consortium EAc. PLA films inoculated with EAc showed biofilm formation (10.54 log CFU/cm2), molecular weight (Mv) reduction (61%), and weight loss (9.68%) after 35 days. The extent of biodegradation was significantly higher than that by individual strains. Decrease in PLA Mv fitted the first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.028 d−1. UV spectroscopy of biodegraded PLA suggested the carbonyl bond cleavage, while substantial chain scissions in the ester backbone of PLA were detected by ATR-FTIR. The rapid PLA biodegradation was due to the synthesis of diverse hydrolases and increase in pH, which led to enzymatic and alkaline hydrolysis. Consequently, EAc consortium could be applied in general solid waste treatment facilities for PLA degradation.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The results suggest it is possible to form 756–881 kg/m3 lightweight aggregate with 20.30–28.84% water absorption, using FA and 10% Portland cement type 1 (PC). Single pellet crushing strength of 4–8 mm BA-FA and W-FA aggregates were 272.97 N and 194.82 N, making it comparable in strength to a commercially available ECA. The high strength of CBP aggregates was attributed to the SAI values, SiO2 and Al2O3 content of the ashes. Compressive strength of lightweight concrete reinforced with CBP biomass ash aggregate was found to be as high as 19.65 MPa.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: Human dentin surfaces with a standardized smear layer were pretreated using a 105 ppm HOCl solution with/without SrCl2 (0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.4 M) or ZnCl2 (0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.2 M) for 5 s, 15 s, or 30 s. After the deproteinizing solution was washed out with water for 5 s, 15 s, or 30 s, pretreated surfaces were bonded with one-step self-etch adhesive Bond Force II or universal adhesive Clearfil Universal Bond Quick, and µTBS was measured after 24 h. Additionally, the deproteinizing effects of HOCl solutions with/without the metal chlorides were compared by measuring changes in the amide:phosphate ratio using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using multifactor ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc tests and t-tests (p < 0.05). Results: Pretreatment with pure HOCl for 15 s and 30 s significantly decreased the amide:phosphate ratio (p < 0.05), indicating effective deproteinization, but the µTBS of both adhesives increased significantly only if HOCl was washed out for 30 s (p < 0.05). Increasing the concentrations of metal chlorides enabled shortening of the wash-out time down to 5 s while maintaining the improved µTBS (p < 0.05). The deproteinizing effect of HOCl was not significantly altered by the addition of metal chlorides (p > 0.05). Significance: The effectiveness of smear layer deproteinization using HOCl can be improved by the addition of metal chlorides, as their increasing concentration allowed to shorten the wash-out time from 30 s down to 5 s","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, dentistry, engineering","Materials Science (all), Dentistry (all), Mechanics of Materials"

The compound has been reported to have several pharmaceutical activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and anticancer. However, the toxicological profile of sesamolin does not currently include developmental toxicity. In this study, we assessed sesamolin toxicity to embryonic development of zebrafish by exposure for 72 h at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μM. The evaluation revealed that sesamolin did not affect survival and hatching rates. However, it did induce embryo malformations and reduced embryonic heart rates in a dose-dependent manner. By qRT-PCR analysis, it downregulated the expression of oxidative stress-related genes, including superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1), catalase (cat), and glutathione S-transferase pi 2 (gstp2). Alkaline phosphatase staining of embryos revealed that sesamolin inhibited the development of subintestinal vessels, and hemoglobin staining revealed a negative impact on embryonic erythropoiesis. These findings showed that sesamolin affected genes related to angiogenesis and erythropoiesis. The risks of sesamolin to embryonic development found in this study may imply similar effects in humans and other mammals.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, pharmacology, environmental","Biochemistry, Physiology, Aquatic Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Toxicology, Cell Biology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

It has also caused unprecedented disruption to Thailand’s educational system. For instance, regular face-to-face classrooms had been temporarily stopped and moved to full-time online learning in which educators and students have used commercially available e-learning platforms (e.g., Moodle) and conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom). Although e-learning platforms and conferencing tools have shown benefits for both educators and learners, social interaction is limited on such platforms. Alternative solutions such as Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have shown promise to solve these challenges; however, research is limited in using such VR technologies in higher education in Thailand. To fill these gaps, we conducted a comparative usability study of three different learning platforms (three-dimensional VR – Spatial.io, two-dimensional VR – Gather.town, and Zoom application) to understand differences in usability and user experiences in terms of students’ engagement, enjoyment, and their sociability in learning. Findings suggest that due to its game-like environment and user-friendly features and user interface, Gather.town is the most promising alternative for online learning in higher education in Thailand. This study suggests opportunities for using game-like virtual classrooms for students to improve their engagement in learning.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)"

Most COVID-19 pathogenesis is associated with hyperinflammatory conditions driven primarily by myeloid cell lineages. The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection post recovery include various symptoms. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study of the innate immune profiles 1 and 3 months after recovery in the Thai cohort by comparing patients with mild, moderate, and severe clinical symptoms using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 62). Results: Significant increases in the frequencies of monocytes compared to controls and NK cells compared to mild and moderate patients were observed in severe patients 1–3 months post recovery. Increased polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) were observed in all recovered patients, even after 3 months. Increased IL-6 and TNFα levels in monocytes were observed 1 month after recovery in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, while decreased CD86 and HLA-DR levels were observed regardless of stimulation. A multiplex analysis of serum cytokines performed at 1 month revealed that most innate cytokines, except for TNFα, IL4/IL-13 (Th2) and IFNγ (Th1), were elevated in recovered patients in a severity-dependent manner. Finally, the myelopoiesis cytokines G-CSF and GM-CSF were higher in all patient groups. Increased monocytes and IL-6- and TNFα-producing cells were significantly associated with long COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: These results reveal that COVID-19 infection influences the frequencies and functions of innate immune cells for up to 3 months after recovery, which may potentially lead to some of the long COVID symptoms.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The rPP can be added at up to 40 wt% into the PP matrix without significantly affecting the mechanical properties. MFI of blended PP increased with increasing rPP content. Modulus and tensile strength of PP slightly decreased with increased rPP content, while the elongation at break increased to up to 30.68% with a 40 wt% increase in rPP content. This is probably caused by the interfacial adhesion of PP and rPP during the blending process. The electrical conductivity of materials was improved by adding carbon black into the rPP matrices. It has a significant effect on the mechanical and electrical properties of the composites. Stress-strain curves of composites changed from ductile to brittle behaviors. This could be caused by the poor interfacial interaction between rPP and carbon black. FTIR spectra indicate that carbon black did not have any chemical reactions with the PP chains. The obtained composites exhibited good performance in the electrical properties tested. Finally, DSC results showed that rPP and carbon black could act as nucleating agents and thus increase the degree of crystallinity of PP.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Objective: Several candidates of microRNAs (miRs) in plasma exosome or whole plasma were evaluated for IF/TA biomarker. Methods: Kidney samples from biopsy and plasma were tested for miRs expression. Results: Expression of miR-21, miR-142-3p and miR-221 in renal histology with high fibrosis score (Banff classification) was higher than the samples with lesser score (n = 17/group). However, expression of these miRs from plasma exosome or from whole plasma of post-KT patients with different severity of IF/TA as determined by percentage of IF/TA including; grade I (5-25%) (n = 15), grade II (26-50%) (n = 15), grade III (≥ 50%) (n = 6) versus stable graft function (no IF/TA) (n = 15) was not different. However, high expression of miR-21 in exosome, but not from whole plasma, was demonstrated in IF/TA grade II and III compared with IF/TA grade I. In contrast, serum creatinine (Scr) and proteinuria, the current standard biomarkers, could not differentiate IF/TA grade I out of grade II/III. There was no correlation between exosome miR-21 versus the current standard renal injury biomarkers, including Scr, blood urea nitrogen and proteinuria, in IF/TA grade II or grade III. Conclusion: High miR-21 in plasma exosome, but not in whole plasma, indicated high grade IF/TA in post-KT patients. This non-invasive monitoring biomarker allows the more frequent evaluation on IF/TA than renal biopsy (a standard but more invasive procedure) resulting in the earlier management. More studies on patients are warrant.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

This study also focuses on the role of l-phenylalanine as a supplement to enhance flavonoids. The current work establishes the relation between nitrates, external carbon, and l-phenylalanine for enhanced production of flavonoids and lipids. The extracted flavonoids were found to be maximum in CP-autotrophic mode followed by CV-mixotrophic mode with 138 μg/ml and 118 μg/ml, respectively. The common flavonoids observed with both the microalgal strains were quercetin, catechin, and p-coumaric acid. In comparison, the production of the maximum lipid of 23.7% was reported with mixotrophic operation in CV, followed by CP (19.4%). The scavenging activity of the extracted flavonoids was determined using a hydrogen peroxide assay and was found to be in the range of 63–73% at all experimental conditions. CP was found to produce more flavonoids in autotrophic mode, whereas mixotrophic mode showed maximum production of lipids and flavonoids in the CV.

In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been developed to identify the relationship between various ballasted track conditions and outputs, namely safe temperature and buckling temperature. The variables included in the objective function of the optimization problems are the lateral resistance of ballasted track provided by ballast-sleeper interaction, torsional resistance provided by fastening systems, and misalignment of the track. Due to its complexity in parameter combinations, the objective of this study is to create predictive models with the aim of minimizing the usage of scarce resources. Thus, this paper is the first to develop a novel machine learning-Aided prediction of railway track buckling due to extreme temperature. Comprehensively, all 353 datasets of the safe and buckling temperatures derived from previous finite element (FE) simulation results have been collected and trained. Note that the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) are considered to quantify the performance of the ANN architectures. The optimal ANN architecture with a very high rate of accuracy has been determined and highlighted. Thus, the suggested neural network model can be applied conveniently to help estimate safe and buckling temperatures of the complex track models in order to improve track conditions and thus prevent track buckling in summer.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

The 2k factorial experimental design was used to study the effect of particle size and rod-like particle loading on the average mixing index, as measured by the Lacey mixing index. The use of smaller spheres and rod diameters resulted in a high average mixing index despite increasing the rod weight. The effect estimates from the factorial experimental design indicated that the rod diameter was the most crucial factor for the average mixing index. Furthermore, the sphere diameter also had a significant effect. Nevertheless, the rod weight and interaction of parameters had a slight effect on the average mixing index.

However, only limited mutual confirmation from different studies is available. The objectives of this study were to identify genomic regions as well as genes and pathways associated with the first-lactation milk, fat, protein, and total solid yields; fat, protein, and total solid percentage; and somatic cell score (SCS) in a Thai dairy cattle population. Effects of SNPs were estimated by a weighted single-step GWAS, which back-solved the genomic breeding values predicted using single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) fitting a single-trait random regression test-day model. Genomic regions that explained at least 0.5% of the total genetic variance were selected for further analyses of candidate genes. Despite the small number of genotyped animals, genomic predictions led to an improvement in the accuracy over the traditional BLUP. Genomic predictions using weighted ssGBLUP were slightly better than the ssGBLUP. The genomic regions associated with milk production traits contained 210 candidate genes on 19 chromosomes [Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 1 to 7, 9, 11 to 16, 20 to 21, 26 to 27 and 29], whereas 21 candidate genes on 3 chromosomes (BTA 11, 16, and 21) were associated with SCS. Many genomic regions explained a small fraction of the genetic variance, indicating polygenic inheritance of the studied traits. Several candidate genes coincided with previous reports for milk production traits in Holstein cattle, especially a large region of genes on BTA14. We identified 141 and 5 novel genes related to milk production and SCS, respectively. These novel genes were also found to be functionally related to heat tolerance (e.g., SLC45A2, IRAG1, and LOC101902172), longevity (e.g., SYT10 and LOC101903327), and fertility (e.g., PAG1). These findings may be attributed to indirect selection in our population. Identified biological networks including intracellular cell transportation and protein catabolism implicate milk production, whereas the immunological pathways such as lymphocyte activation are closely related to SCS. Further studies are required to validate our findings before exploiting them in genomic selection.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Food Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Genetics"
A Review of Ground Source Heat Pump Application for Space Cooling in Southeast Asia,"Ratchawang S., Chotpantarat S., Chokchai S., Takashima I., Uchida Y., Charusiri P.",2022-07-01,"Coefficient of Performance, Energy savings, Energy-savings, Groundsource heat pump (GSHP), Heat-pump systems, Performance, Southeast Asia, Space cooling, Subsurface temperature, Tropical climates, coefficient of performance, energy saving, ground source heat pump, Southeast Asia, space cooling, subsurface temperature","Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems have been used worldwide in buildings because of their advantages of highly efficient performance in terms of energy and environment for space cooling and heating; however, cooling demand is predominant in tropical climates. This paper reviews of the GSHP systems applications in Southeast Asia; several applications of GSHP in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam have been addressed. Experiments were initiated in 2006 in Kamphaengphet; the latest experiment found in the Scopus searching tool is the GSHP simulation in Kuantan in 2019 using EnergyPlus using the ground loop design software. GSHP systems have the potential to be used in Southeast Asia despite the dominance of cooling demand, leading to a thermal imbalance within the subsurface. This imbalance can reduce the performance of the system; however, groundwater flow is considered as a key factor in preventing the effect of thermal distribution owing to GSHP operation. These results suggest that the GSHP has the potential to reduce emissions and electricity consumption within areas having tropical climates, such as Southeast Asia, for sustainability and future generation.","energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Detection via Cobas® 4800 and REBA HPV-ID® Assays,"Liewchalermwong S., Oranratanaphan S., Termrungruanglert W., Triratanachat S., Tantbirojn P., Kitkumthorn N., Bhattarakosol P., Chaiwongkot A.",2022-12-01,"Cervix Uteri, Early Detection of Cancer, Female, Genotype, Human papillomavirus 16, Human Papillomavirus Viruses, Humans, Papillomaviridae, Papillomavirus Infections, Uterine Cervical Dysplasia, Uterine Cervical Neoplasms, cervical cancer, HPV testing","Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs), particularly HPV16 and 18, has long been known to induce cervical cancer progression. However, given that a minority of HPV-infected women develop cancer, analysis of HR-HPV-infected women could help to predict who is at risk of acquiring cervical cancer. Therefore, to improve HR-HPVs detection, we used the FDA-approved cobas® 4800 HPV and REBA HPV-ID® HPV assays to detect HR-HPVs in colposcopy-derived cervical cells from 303 patients, detecting 72.28% (219) and 71.62% (217) of HR-HPVs positive cases, with HPV16 detection rates of 35.64% (108) and 30.69% (93), respectively. Of the HPV16-positive cases, cobas® 4800 and REBA HPV-ID® identified 28.81% (51) and 25.42% (45) of the CIN1 cases, and 55% (33) and 50% (30) of the 60 CIN2/3 cases, respectively. HPV-diagnostic concordance was 82.17% overall (kappa = 0.488), 87.45% for HR-HPVs (kappa = 0.689), and 88.33% for CIN2/3 (kappa = 0.51). The HR-HPVs detection rates of these assays were comparable. Our findings reveal that the FDA-approved HR-HPVs detection assay is appropriate for screening women with HR-HPVs infection, and for predicting increased risk of cervical cancer progression. REBA HPV-ID® can be used to detect low risk-HPV types in high-grade cervical lesions that are HR-HPV negative as well as in the distribution of HPV types.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

This is very interesting to review in detail about CZO structures. A summary of the convergence criteria of geometry optimization for CZO structures from the literature survey (2010–2021) is tabulated and discussed. The impact of the Hubbard-U scheme in the exchange-correlation functional on the standard Density Functional Theory (DFT) miscalculation for CZO properties is comprehensively reviewed. The inclusion of Ud-Zn, Ud-Cu and Up-O all to gather leads to a correct energy band gap, and exhibits a slight effect on the lattice constant. The values of Ud-Zn, Ud-Cu and Up-O have a considerable impact on the intensity and position of the main peaks of the imaginary part. The magnetic phase of the CZO structure is found to be influenced by both Ud,Zn and Ud,Cu. More attention is paid to the influence of Cu doping content on CZO properties, including electronic, structural, optical and magnetic properties. The magnetic moment mainly comes from Cu ions with little contribution from O ions. Ferromagnetic (FM) spin ordering of Cu ions are suggested to be mediated by the holes induced in p-d hybridization. Finally, some perspectives for future studies are discussed as well.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

The objectives of this systematic review were to assess the global prevalence and clinical manifestations of cutaneous adverse reactions following COVID-19 vaccination. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for articles published from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021, and reference lists for each selected article were screened. Case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials that provided information on cutaneous adverse reactions following COVID-19 vaccines were included. A total of 300 studies were included in a systematic review of which 32 studies with 946 366 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of cutaneous manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination was 3.8% (95% CI, 2.7%–5.3%). COVID-19 vaccines based on the mRNA platform had a higher prevalence than other platforms at 6.9% (95% CI, 3.8%–12.3%). Various cutaneous manifestations have been reported from injection site reactions, which were the most common (72.16%) to uncommon adverse reactions such as delayed inflammatory reactions to tissue filler (0.07%) and flares of pre-existing dermatoses (0.07%). Severe cutaneous reactions such as anaphylaxis have also been reported, but in rare cases (0.05%). In conclusion, cutaneous adverse reactions are common, especially in those receiving mRNA vaccines. Most reactions are mild and are not contraindications to subsequent vaccination except for anaphylaxis, which rarely occurs. COVID-19 vaccination may also be associated with flares of pre-existing dermatoses and delayed inflammatory reactions to tissue filler. Patients with a history of allergies, pre-existing skin conditions or scheduled for filler injections should receive additional precounselling and monitoring. A better understanding of potential side-effects may strengthen public confidence in those wary of new vaccine technologies.",medical,"Dermatology, Infectious Diseases"

Glycidyl methacrylate grafted poly (butylene succinate) (PBS-g-GMA) was prepared via a reactive melt grafting reaction to serve as a compatibilizer for WHF/APP/PBS composites. Effects of incorporating APP and WHF, and PBS-g-GMA on mechanical properties, thermal properties and flame retardancy of PBS composites were investigated. Results showed that the addition of PBS-g-GMA greatly improved tensile strength, flexural strength and crystallization rate of WHF/APP/PBS composites. According to UL-94 and limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests, the presence of 15 wt% WHF, 30 wt% APP, and 15 wt% PBS-g-GMA enabled the WHF/APP/15PBS-g-GMA/PBS composite to achieve a V-0 rating and the maximum LOI value of 29.2%. Char residue analysis revealed that the combination of APP and WHF promoted the formation of an expanded char layer, whereas the addition of PBS-g-GMA induced the formation of compact, highly graphitized residues. Findings will contribute to the development of biodegradable flame-retardant polymer composites for engineering applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Aims: To delineate the associations between affective and CFS-like symptoms in COVID-19 and chest computed tomography scan anomalies (CCTAs), oxygen saturation (SpO2), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), albumin, calcium, magnesium, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and soluble advanced glycation products (sRAGEs). Method: The above biomarkers were assessed in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls who had measurements of the Hamilton Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue (FF) Rating Scales. Results: Partial Least Squares-SEM analysis showed that reliable latent vectors could be extracted from a) key depressive and anxiety and physiosomatic symptoms (the physio-affective or PA-core), b) IL-6, IL-10, CRP, albumin, calcium, and sRAGEs (the immune response core); and c) different CCTAs (including ground glass opacities, consolidation, and crazy paving) and lowered SpO2% (lung lesions). PLS showed that 70.0% of the variance in the PA-core was explained by the regression on the immune response and lung lesions latent vectors. One common “infection-immune-inflammatory (III) core” underpins pneumonia-associated CCTAs, lowered SpO2 and immune activation, and this III core explains 70% of the variance in the PA core, and a relevant part of the variance in melancholia, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. Discussion: Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by lung lesions and lowered SpO2 which may cause activated immune-inflammatory pathways, which mediate the effects of the former on the PA-core and other neuropsychiatric symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
Multifunctional bacterial cellulose-gelatin containing mangosteen extract films with improved antibacterial and anticancer properties,"Chiaoprakobkij N., Seetabhawang S., Okhawilai M., Uyama H., Phisalaphong M.",2022-08-01,"Antibacterial properties, Anticancer properties, Bacterial cellulose, Direct contact, Garcinia mangostanum, Gelatin, Gingival fibroblasts, Human keratinocyte, Mangosteen extract, Oral cancer, Bacterial cellulose, Garcinia mangostana, Gelatin, Gingival fibroblasts, Human keratinocytes, Mangosteen extract, Oral cancer","In this study, we developed green composites made of homogenized-bacterial cellulose, that is, gelatin containing different concentrations of mangosteen extract using tannin as a natural crosslinker. The films were fabricated using a fast and simple casting method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs showed uniform morphology. The water vapor permeability of the films ranged from 628 to 976 g/m2/day, which was comparable to commercial dressings. The fluid uptake ability ranged between 250 and 390%. All films in hydrated state were flexible, stable, and capable of bearing force. Furthermore, films containing the mangosteen extract had good stability, were well-embedded in the bacteria cellulose-based matrix, and could retain its bioactivity. The fabricated film exhibited good antibacterial property against S. aereus and E. coli upon direct contact according to the surface method test (JIS Z 2801), which become comparable to commercial tulle dressing. Films were nontoxic to human keratinocytes (HaCat) and human gingival fibroblasts (GF). Films exhibited anticancer properties against human oral cancer cells (CAL27). Bacterial cellulose pellicles were mechanically disintegrated into fibrils suspension and then reconstructed with the incorporation of gelatin and mangosteen extract. The novel biocomposites were created with improved antibacterial and anticancer properties. Our findings suggest that the biocomposites from bacterial cellulose, gelatin incorporated with mangosteen extract, could be an intriguing option for further research as the daily and single-use direct contact film for the treatment of skin wounds, gingivitis, periodontitis, and oral cancer.

Experimental and Analytical Study on Shear Performance of Embedded Through-Section GFRP-Strengthened RC Beams,"Bui L.V.H., Klippathum C., Prasertsri T., Jongvivatsakul P., Stitmannaithum B.",2022-10-01,"Anchorage, Embedded through-section, Fiber-reinforced polymers, Fibre reinforced polymers, Glassfiber reinforced polymers (GFRP), Shear behaviour, Shear strength model, Shear strengthening, Shears strength, Strength models, Anchorage, Embedded through-section, FRP, Shear behavior, Shear strength model, Shear strengthening","The structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear with embedded through-section (ETS) glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars is experimentally and analytically investigated. Three-point bending tests are performed. The investigated parameters include the number of existing steel stirrups (ρsw = 0.28%), concrete compressive strength (fc′ = 27 and 43 MPa), shear span-to-effective depth ratio (a/d = 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8), anchorage presence (with and without anchorage), and anchorage properties (steel and GFRP anchorage systems, as well as the anchorage length). The results indicate that the shear capacity and stiffness of the beams are enhanced by applying ETS-GFRP, increasing concrete strength, and decreasing shear span-to-effective depth ratio. The ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams exhibit a more ductile failure mode than the unstrengthened beam owing to concrete crushing in loading areas. The beam stiffness depends significantly on the anchorage presence and properties, and the beam shear capacities differ considerably for different anchorage systems. Anchorage with four steel nuts or two GFRP nuts at the ETS bar ends provides the highest shear resistance and stiffness for the ETS-strengthened beams. The results of this study suggest that the details and configuration of the anchorage system should be carefully considered for the development of unanimous specifications. Additionally, previously proposed shear models can be used to conservatively analyze test results with sufficient accuracy. The newly developed model for estimation of the shear strengths of ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams and the effective strains in ETS-GFRP bars agrees well with the test data. Practical Applications The experimental results obtained from the present study demonstrate the potential of the embedded through-section (ETS) method for practical applications in the shear strengthening of the reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The predrilled holes through the beam height are made at the marked positions, which could be determined by a rebar detector. Next, the adhesive resin is fully injected into the holes prior embedding the fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars. In the present study, the glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are used. Then, the ends of each FRP bar are anchored with screwed nuts. Comparing with the unstrengthened beam, the ETS-strengthened beam offers a larger capacity, more ductility, and safer failure. The shear performance of the ETS-strengthened beams is proportional to the concrete compressive strength. The decrease of the shear span-to-effective depth ratio increases the shear resistance of the ETS-strengthened beams. The anchorage at two bar ends with two GFRP or four steel nuts is deemed to be most effective. Additionally, the proposed shear strength model can be used for the design of the beam with an ETS strengthening system.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

This study aimed to report and analyze the first case of monkeypox virus infection in Taiwan. Methods: The global epidemiological information was collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data from the first confirmed Taiwanese monkeypox case was obtained from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Monkeypox diagnosis and prevention strategies were obtained from WHO guidelines on monkeypox. Phylogenetic tree analysis and sequence alignment and comparison were used to identify the phylogeny and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characterization. Results: Epidemiological data indicated that since 2013, monkeypox has caused outbreaks outside African countries through contact with infected animals and international travels. Recently, two confirmed monkeypox cases were reported in Singapore and South Korea. On June 24, 2022, Taiwan CDC reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox virus infection in a 20-year-old man who returned from Germany, from January to June 2022. This is the third confirmed case of an imported monkeypox infection in Asia. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this imported monkeypox virus belonged to the West African clade and is clustered with the 2022 European outbreak monkeypox isolates. Full-length sequence analysis indicates that this virus contains 51 SNPs, and has five variant SNPs compared with the recent outbreak strains. Conclusion: This study suggests that active surveillance, enhancing border control, and the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs are urgently required to prevent and control the burden of monkeypox disease.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

This work produced bio-jet fuel (C9–C14 hydrocarbons) from palm olein oil through hydrocracking over varied metal phosphide supported on porous biochar catalysts. Relative metal phosphide catalysts were investigated for the highest performance for bio-jet fuel production. The palm oil’s fiber-derived porous biochar (PFC) revealed its high potential as a catalyst supporter. A series of PFC-supported cobalt, nickel, iron, and molybdenum metal phosphides (Co-P/PFC, Ni-P/PFC, Fe-P/PFC, and Mo-P/PFC) catalysts with a metal-loading content of 10 wt.% were synthesized by wet-impregnation and a reduction process. The performance of the prepared catalysts was tested for palm oil hydrocracking in a trickle-bed continuous flow reactor under fixed conditions; a reaction temperature of 420 °C, LHSV of 1 h−1, and H2 pressure of 50 bar was found. The Fe-P/PFC catalyst represented the highest hydrocracking performance based on 100% conversion with 94.6% bio-jet selectivity due to its higher active phase dispersion along with high acidity, which is higher than other synthesized catalysts. Moreover, the Fe-P/PFC catalyst was found to be the most selective to C9 (35.4%) and C10 (37.6%) hydrocarbons.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Chondrocytes not only control cartilage metabolism, but are capable of immunogenic responses. The role of chondrocytes in the pathogenesis of OA is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the immunological role of chondrocytes in response to proteoglycan aggrecan (PG) peptides. Methods Human chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage of knee OA patients undergoing knee arthroplasty and stimulated with proteoglycan aggrecan peptides in the presence of IFNγ. Antigen presentation markers, co-stimulatory molecules, cytokine production, gene expression and antigen presentation to T cells were evaluated. Results Our results show that IFNγ was required for the expression of MHC class I and II. However, stimulation with PG peptides P16-31 and P263-280, but not P2379-2394, increased expression level of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) and IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα production. This upregulation was seen in chondrocytes to nearly comparable levels of professional antigen-presenting cells. A similar pattern of gene expression was observed between P16-31 and P263-280 peptide stimulation on chondrocytes and this was different from P2379-2394 peptide treatment. Co-culture with autologous T cells revealed significant proliferation of cells when stimulating with the P263-280 peptides. Conclusion Our study shows that human chondrocytes display unique features of antigen presentation. Their ability to process certain proteoglycan aggrecan peptides, in which these molecules are synthesised by the cartilage themselves render the possibility of a role for “self-antigens” in the immunopathogenesis of OA.","medical, Immunology","Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

This study demonstrated the application of LBS as an alternative substrate for the cultivation of the gray oyster mushrooms [Pleurotus sajor-caju (Fr.) Singer] to reduce productions costs. LBS has a high nitrogen content and essential oil as bioactive compounds. LBS was mixed with rubber sawdust (RS), the traditional substrate of mushroom cultivation in Thailand, to estimate the maximum loading of LBS in cylindrical baglog cultivation. Furthermore, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of the fruit body were measured. The optimal mass ratios of RS-to-LBS in the baglogs were in the range of 80:20–50:50. Results showed that the optimal amount of LBS enhanced mycelium growth and the biological efficiency of cultivated mushrooms. At a 50:50 RS-to-LBS mass ratio, the cost of baglog production was reduced by approximately 25% because the cost of LBS was lower than that of RS. Using LBS as replacement substrate at an optimal RS-to-LBS mass ratio not only reduced mushroom production costs but also promoted mycelium growth, biological efficiency, and antioxidant activity of the fruit body.

Average values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp, and tumor volume of the primary tumors were measured. Other potential clinical characteristics (age, sex, staging, pathology, pretreatment Epstein-Barr virus level, and treatment type) were analyzed. Patients underwent follow-up imaging 6 months after treatment initiation. Treatment responses were assigned according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guideline (version 1.1). Results Fifty-one patients showed complete response (CR), whereas 32 patients did not (non-CR). Univariable logistic regression with variables dichotomized by optimal cutoff values showed that ADC ≥1.45 × 10-3 mm2/s, Vp ≥0.14, tumor volume of ≥14.05 mL, high stage (stages III and IV), and Epstein-Barr virus level of ≥2300 copies/mL were predictors of non-CR (P = 0.008, 0.05, 0.01, 0.009, and 0.04, respectively). The final multivariable model, consisting of a combination of ADC ≥1.45 × 10-3 mm2/s, Vp ≥0.14, and high stage, could predict non-CR with a good discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.87]; sensitivity, 62.50%; specificity, 80.39%; and accuracy 73.49%). Conclusions A multivariable prediction model using a combination of ADC ≥1.45 × 10-3 mm2/s, Vp ≥0.14, and high stage can be effective for treatment response prediction in NPC patients.","fluidex; related topics, medical","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
The immediate patch test reaction to fragrance in patients with allergic contact dermatitis to fragrance: A prospective study,"Amornruk N., Siranart N., Sittiwattanawong P., Kueanjinda P., Loplumlert S., Wongpiyabovorn J.",2022-11-01,"Acrolein, Allergens, Benzyl Alcohols, Coumarins, Dermatitis, Allergic Contact, Humans, Odorants, Patch Tests, Perfume, Propanols, Prospective Studies, Sorbic Acid, allergic contact dermatitis, fragrance substances, immediate reaction","Background: Fragrance is one of the common causes of immediate contact reaction. Knowing the prevalence of a reaction in a given population enables prioritization of allergy screening. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of an immediate patch test reaction to fragrance in patients with fragrance allergic contact dermatitis. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 291 patients who were given standard patch tests for allergic contact dermatitis. Those with positive reactions were then asked to undergo additional patch tests to assess both immediate and delayed reactions to 28 different fragrance substances. Results: Cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamic alcohol were the most frequently encountered substances in positive immediate reactions and standard (delayed) patch test reactions. Immediate patch reactions to benzyl alcohol, sorbic acid, and coumarin were more frequently observed than standard patch test reactions. Limitations: Because of the small sample size of patients who agreed to continue further patch testing evaluation, a statistical association between patient characteristics and fragrance-positive patch test reactions was difficult to establish. Conclusions: In this population, cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamic alcohol were the most common fragrance allergens causing both immediate and delayed reactions, whereas reactions to benzyl alcohol, sorbic acid, and coumarin were frequently observed in immediate patch tests.","Immunologynology, serology and transplantation, medical",Dermatology

We sought to evaluate prostate cancer awareness (PCA) among post-GAS TGW. Methods: The investigators implemented a cross-sectional study and enrolled a sample of Thai post-GAS TGW without medical background. Predictor variables were categorized as demographic, clinical, operative, or postoperative. The outcome variable was PCA (yes/no). Appropriate statistics were computed, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The sample consisted of 100 Thai post-GAS TGW (4% bisexual, 12% bachelor [or higher] graduates, 51% service workers, 64% had monthly net income <40,000 TB [or ca. 1050 Euro], 92% operated by plastic surgeons) with a mean age of 26.2 ± 5.4 years (range: 18–45). On bivariate analysis, PCA was significantly associated with educational level (p = 0.007; adjusted odd ratio [ORadj.]: 5.85; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.65–20.69), being operated ≥ 10 years (p = 0.01; ORadj.: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04–0.76), self-recognition of the remaining prostate gland (p = 0.0001; ORadj.: 0.02; 95% CI: 0–0.12), and emphasis on PCA by the GAS operator (p = 0.01; ORadj.: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01–0.63). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant, positive correlation (r = 0.78; p = 0.0001) among these four predictors, and continued to confirm the positive effect on PCA in TGW with high education and realization of the prostate gland (r = 0.56; p = 0.04) or information on PCA by the operator (r = 0.68; p = 0.003). Conclusion: The GSA operator should intensively inform TGW about the remnant prostate and the risk of PC, especially those with low and middle levels of education attained.",medical,"Oncology, Urology"

To understand the structure-activity relationship of Lewis acid transformation and hydrogen bonding interactions, we explore the potential of using the in situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with adsorbed ammonia and hydrogen exposure. From the results of in situ DRIFTS measurements, Lewis acid sites on surface catalysts were transformed into new Brønsted acid sites upon hydrogen exposure. The adsorbed NH3 on Lewis acid sites migrated to Brønsted acid sites forming NH4+. The results show that the dissociated H atoms present on the catalyst surface formed new Si−OH hydroxyl species − the new Brønsted acid site. Besides, the isolated Si−O−W species is the key towards H-bond and Si−OH formation. Additionally, the H atoms adsorbed surrounding the Si−O−W species of mono-oxo O=WO4 and di-oxo (O=)2WO2 species, where the Si−O−W species are the main species presented on the Inc-SSP catalysts than that of the IWI-SSP catalysts.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Biotechnology, Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Differences between chronic low back pain patients in Germany and Thailand in terms of nature of disease and socioeconomic and psychological factors,"Yotnuengnit P., Boonyapaisancharoen P., Jamin N., Schulte-Goecking H., Azad S.-C., Kraft E., Piravej K., Leukert J.",2022-01-01,"Chronic Disease, Chronic Pain, Cross-Sectional Studies, Germany, Humans, Low Back Pain, Socioeconomic Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thailand, Chronic low back pain, Germany, psychological effect, socioeconomic status, Thailand","BACKGROUND: Worldwide, chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common causes of physical and psychological disabilities. The factors that affect low back pain (LBP) between Western and Eastern countries are different. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the factors associated with LBP and their impact in German and Thai CLBP participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 100 Thai and 100 German CLBP participants. Data were collected before the participants received treatment in the outpatient rehabilitation clinic. We used standardized questionnaires to assess the demographic and socioeconomic data, clinical features of the pain, the impact of pain during daily activities, and psychological consequences. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference between the two groups for minimal pain intensity (NRS German = 3.01, Thai = 1.83), and the participants' acceptable pain intensity (NRS German = 1.97, Thai = 3.88). The German participants had a higher negative impact score in their daily living compared to the Thai participants (German = 23.5, Thai = 10). Also, the German participants suffered more often from depression (CES-D score; German = 17, Thai = 4). However, the average back pain intensity was the same for both groups. CONCLUSION: German CLBP participants had significantly more depressive symptoms and pain-related impairments compared to the Thai participants. On the other hand, there were no differences in maximum and average pain severities.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation"
Development and evaluation of a visible reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for the detection of Asian lineage ZIKV in field-caught mosquitoes,"Siriyasatien P., Wacharapluesadee S., Kraivichian K., Suwanbamrung C., Sutthanont N., Cantos-Barreda A., Phumee A.",2022-12-01,"Animals, Culicidae, Humans, Molecular Diagnostic Techniques, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, RNA, RNA, Viral, Sensitivity and Specificity, Zika Virus, Zika Virus Infection, Mosquitoes, RT-LAMP, Thailand, Zika virus","The Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is an emerging and re-emerging arbovirus infection that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Early detection of ZIKV in mosquitoes is one of the prerequisite approaches for tracking the spread of the virus. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate a visual reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method called ZIKV-RT-LAMP, for detecting ZIKV in field collected mosquito samples from Thailand. A single-tube ZIKV-RT-LAMP assay was developed to detect Asian lineage ZIKV RNA. The detection limit and cross-reactivity of ZIKV were investigated. The hemi-nested RT-PCR (hn-RT-PCR) and the colorimetric LAMP kit (cLAMP kit) were performed as reference assays. The detection limit of the ZIKV-RT-LAMP assay was 10−6 ffu/ml or pfu/ml, making it highly specific and 100 times more sensitive than the hn-RT-PCR and cLAMP kits. The ZIKV-RT-LAMP assay detected the Asian lineage of ZIKV RNA without cross-reactivity with other arthropod-borne viruses. The sensitivity and specificity of the ZIKV-RT-LAMP assay were 92.31% and 100%, respectively. The ZIKV-RT-LAMP is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for detecting ZIKV in field-caught mosquitos. In the future, extensive surveys of field-caught mosquito populations should be conducted. Early detection of ZIKV in field-caught mosquitoes provides for prompt and effective implementation of mosquito control strategies in endemic areas.","Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

This study uses a bibliometric review of artificial coral reefs to identify five clusters as gate criteria for artificial reef design. These clusters enable the conceptualization and testing of artificial reefs for optimum integration of sociotechnical requirements, biological integrity, and ecological marine health. The five clusters are: (1) applications, solutions, and performance; (2) management, technology, and science; (3) calcification, biomineralization, chemistry, and ocean acidification; (4) coral species survival, mortality, and photosynthesis; and (5) artificial reef development, and coral and fish recruitment. The six biomimicry design stages are: define, biologize, discover, abstract, emulate, and evaluate. The 3D printing and hard corals design attracted a large number of planula larvae and different inhabitant corals, and a high species diversity in the surrounding waters. Practical implications include biomimicry-based means for coral reef restoration and recreational ecosystem services.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

Methods: Ten adult females from each Indochinese (WHM) and Sundaic (KN/KTK) Mf populations, which exhibited 50% and 15% of Mm autosomal SNPs, were selected as focal animals. Animals were observed for 12 months, and the frequencies of sexual proceptivity, attractivity and receptivity, number of newborns, and changes in sex skin were recorded. Results: Both populations showed all three sexual behaviors throughout the year, but they were classified as moderately seasonal breeders because their 3-month birth counts were as high as ~50%. The fecundity of WHM was lower than the KN/KTK. Changes in sex skin of WHM were more prone to Mm's pattern than the KN/KTK. Conclusion: The introgressive gene flow from Mm to Mf does not affect Mf's sexual behaviors; however, it can impact fecundity and physiological (sex skin) changes.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Animal Science and Zoology, Veterinary (all)"
Nitrogen fixation and other biogeochemically important features of Atacama Desert giant horsetail plant microbiomes inferred from metagenomic contig analysis,"Satjarak A., Graham L.E., Trest M.T., Zedler J., Knack J.J., Arancibia-Avila P.",2022-07-01,"Equisetum, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Microbiota, Nitrogen Fixation, Plants, Biogeochemistry, Equisetum xylochaetum, Metagenome, Plant microbiome, Vanadium nitrogenase, Wetlands","Background and Aims: Canyon stream beds in the hyperarid Atacama Desert surprisingly harbour magnificent groves of endemic giant horsetail wetland plants, Equisetum xylochaetum. Our previous metagenomic study of eukaryotes closely associated with this plant indicated that the microbiome included prokaryotes that might likewise influence host success and environment. We explored this possibility by using the metagenomic sequence to characterize prokaryote taxa and functional genes present in the microbiome of E. xylochaetum sampled from remote sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We focused on biogeochemical functions known to be important in wetland ecosystems. Methods: To ensure that analyses were conducted on microbes most closely associated with plants, we extracted DNA from well-washed plant organs whose microbial biofilms were revealed with scanning electron microscopy. To assess the benefits of longer sequences for taxonomic and gene classifications, results of analyses performed using contigs were compared with those obtained with unassembled reads. We employed methods widely used to estimate genomic coverage of single taxa for genomic analysis to infer relative abundances of taxa and functional genes. Key Results: Key functional bacterial genera (e.g. Hydrogenophaga, Sulfuritalea and Rhodoferax) inferred from taxonomic and functional gene analysis of contigs-but not unassembled reads-to occur on surfaces of (or within) plants at relatively high abundance (>50× genomic coverage) indicated roles in nitrogen, sulfur and other mineral cycling processes. Comparison between sites revealed impacts on biogeochemical functions, e.g. reduced levels of the nifH gene marker under disturbance. Vanadium nitrogenases were more important than molybdenum nitrogenases, indicated by both functional genes and taxa such as Rhodomicrobium and Phaeospirillum inferred from contigs but not unassembled reads. Conclusions: Our contig-based metagenomic analyses revealed that microbes performing key wetland biogeochemical functions occur as tightly adherent biofilms on the plant body, not just in water or sediments, and that disturbance reduces such functions, providing arguments for conservation efforts.","geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Plant Science

Background: The Hydra THV is a novel repositionable self-expanding system with supra-annular bovine pericardial leaflets. Methods: The Hydra CE study was a premarket, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study conducted across 18 study centers in Europe and Asia-Pacific countries. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days. All endpoints were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. Results: A total of 157 patients (79.2 ± 7.1 years of age, 58.6% female; Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 4.7 ± 3.4%) were enrolled. Successful implantation was achieved in 94.3% cases. At 30 days, there were 11 (7.0%) deaths, including 9 (5.7%) cardiovascular deaths, of which 5 (3.2%) were device related. At 1 year, there were 23 (14.6%) deaths, including 13 (8.3%) cardiovascular deaths. At 30 days, there were significant improvement of effective orifice area (from 0.7 ± 0.2 cm2 to 1.9 ± 0.6 cm2) and mean aortic valve gradient (from 49.5 ± 18.5 mm Hg to 8.1 ± 3.7 mm Hg), which were sustained up to 1 year. Moderate or severe paravalvular leak was observed in 6.3% of patients at 30 days and 6.9% of patients at 1 year. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was 11.7% at 30 days and 12.4% at 1 year. Conclusions: The Hydra CE study demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement with Hydra THV offered favorable efficacy at 1 year, providing large effective orifice area and low transvalvular gradient as well as acceptable complication rates with regard to new permanent pacemaker and paravalvular leak.

Variable Stiffness Pad and Its Application to Hybrid Rigid-Soft Robots,"Pitakwatchara P., Arunrat J.",2022-01-01,"Contact stability, Contact stiffness, Hybrid robots, Impedance control, ITS applications, Robot manipulation, Soft robot, Soft robot application, Variable stiffness, Variable stiffness pad, contact stability, hybrid robots, impedance control, soft robot applications, Variable stiffness pad","Robot manipulation can easily become unstable when interacting with stiff environment. This is due to high contact stiffness, which is usually cannot be controlled. Contact stiffness is an important factor for the robot to perform the tasks successfully. It helps determining the contact force, which in turn affects the robot response and stability of the interaction. To resolve this fatal shortcoming, we have developed the variable stiffness pad (VSP) and its pressure supply system, which can be integrated to typical rigid robots. It allows one to modify the contact stiffness appropriately for the task and environment at hand. By the controlled pressured of 0-100 kPa, the prototype VSP attached to a rigid gripper can vary its stiffness linearly in the range of 23.5-42.0 kN/m during contact with time constant of 130 ms. This unique feature is used to modify contact stiffness properly. Moreover, contact stress is reduced since the effective contact area is enlarged thanks to the adaptation of the VSP local contact surface to the object. A concept of hybrid robots, where several VSPs are installed at the interaction surface of rigid robot, is proposed. Unlike traditional robots, both manipulation impedance and contact impedance of the hybrid robot may be adjusted in order to interact with unstructured environment properly. Analysis and experiments show that the hybrid rigid-soft gripper can manipulate objects with different shapes and stiffness safely.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Unlike the traditional circular foundations, very few studies were reported with regard to the bearing capacity of ring foundations. In addition, the study on the stability effects of anisotropic and nonhomogeneous clays is yet to be found in the current literature. The purpose of the technical note is therefore to bridge the current research gap. By using the robust lower and upper bound finite-element limit analysis in axisymmetric conditions, new stability solutions of ring footings on anisotropic and nonhomogeneous clays are obtained using dimensionless parameters. The associated failure mechanisms are also examined and discussed, while the design equations are proposed for predicting the bearing capacity of ring foundations. The findings in this study provide a reliable solution to improve the current design standard for ring footings in anisotropic and nonhomogeneous clays.","petroleum engineeringneering, foundations and piles, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science"

CMS detector against τ h candidates that originate from quark or gluon jets, electrons, or muons. The algorithm inputs information from all reconstructed particles in the vicinity of a τ h candidate and employs a deep neural network with convolutional layers to efficiently process the inputs. This algorithm leads to a significantly improved performance compared with the previously used one. For example, the efficiency for a genuine τ h to pass the discriminator against jets increases by 10-30% for a given efficiency for quark and gluon jets. Furthermore, a more efficient τ h reconstruction is introduced that incorporates additional hadronic decay modes. The superior performance of the new algorithm to discriminate against jets, electrons, and muons and the improved τ h reconstruction method are validated with LHC proton-proton collision data at s = 13 TeV.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

Through machine learning-based methods, these signals are translated into long-read sequences that overcome the read size limit of short-read sequencing. However, analyzing the raw nanopore signal data provides many more opportunities beyond just sequencing genomes and transcriptomes: algorithms that use machine learning approaches to extract biological information from these signals allow the detection of DNA and RNA modifications, the estimation of poly(A) tail length, and the prediction of RNA secondary structures. In this review, we discuss how developments in machine learning methodologies contributed to more accurate basecalling and lower error rates, and how these methods enable new biological discoveries. We argue that direct nanopore sequencing of DNA and RNA provides a new dimensionality for genomics experiments and highlight challenges and future directions for computational approaches to extract the additional information provided by nanopore signal data.",biochemistryistry,Genetics
Model-Based Approach on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning With Multiple Clusters for Peer-To-Peer Energy Trading,"Sanayha M., Vateekul P.",2022-01-01,"Deep learning approach, Energy trading, Learning approach, Model based approach, Model-based reinforcement learning, Multi agent, Multi-agent reinforcement learning, Peer to peer, Peer-to-peer energy trading, Real-world, deep learning approach, model-based reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, Peer-to-peer energy trading","Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading system has the ability to completely revolutionize the current household energy system by sharing energy among residents. As the number of customers employing distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar rooftops increase, innovation in the double auction market (DA) system is becoming more significant. In this paper, a novel model-based, multi-agent asynchronous advantage actor-centralized-critic with communication (MB-A3C3) approach is carried out. Previous studies are limited since they suffer from unpredictable behavior in renewable energy resources and a large number of prosumers in the peer-to-peer market. As for the model-based strategy, we forecast the trading price and trading quantity in the daily energy trading system in order to overcome unpredictable issues. For the large number of prosumers, the multi-agent and multithreading RL has been chosen as our backbone since the prosumers' behavior can be diverse; time-series clustering is introduced based on their daily trading behavior. With its environmental model and multi-threaded mechanism, MB-A3C3 is seen to be most efficient in carrying out tasks regards time and precision. The model is conducted on a large scale real-world hourly 2012-2013 dataset of 300 households in Sydney having rooftop solar systems installed in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Results reveal that the MB-A3C3 approach outperforms other reinforcement learning methods (MADDPG and A3C3), producing lower community energy bills for 300 households. When internal trade (trading among houses) increased and external trade (trading to the grid) decreased, our multiple agent RL (MB-A3C3) significantly lowered energy bills by 17%. In closing the gap between the real-world and theoretical problems, the algorithms herein aid in reducing customers' electricity bills.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

One of the problems when using antibiotic creams is antibiotic molecules cannot penetrate the stratum corneum layer of the skin, which acts as a barrier for the molecules. To overcome this problem, a transdermal patch with micron-size needles was developed. This research aimed to fabricate a sodium alginate (S)-gelatin (G) microneedles patch containing clindamycin for acne treatment. The S-G microneedles containing different amounts (i.e., 6, 8, and 10 μmol/L) of the clindamycin hydrochloride were prepared. Their mechanical properties, densities, and release patterns were investigated. The composition of gelatin increased the average force and density of the S-G microneedles. While, the addition of clindamycin hydrochloride did not affect their mechanical properties. The released amount of clindamycin increased with increasing the loading quantity within S-G microneedles. The S-G microneedles successfully penetrated the pig cadaver skin. Lastly, these clindamycin-loaded S-G microneedles could inhibit the growth of C. acnes and were non-toxic to normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cells. Thus, the S-G microneedles patch had the potential for use in acne treatment.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

Design: International, cross-sectional, multicenter study. Participants: A total of 1.112 million images of 8694 volume scans (2294 patients) from 3 centers were included in this study (Task I, training/internal validation/external testing: 4515, 1101, and 2222 volume scans, respectively; Task II, training/internal validation/external testing: 378, 376, and 102 volume scans, respectively). Methods: For Task I, a narrow angle was defined as an eye in which the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible in more than 180° without indentation in the primary position captured in the dark room from the scans. For Task II, PAS was defined as the adhesion of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. The diagnostic performance of the 3D DGS was evaluated in both tasks with gonioscopic records as reference. Main Outcome Measures: The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the 3D DGS were calculated. Results: In Task I, 29.4% of patients had a narrow angle. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 3D DGS on the external testing datasets were 0.943 (0.933–0.953), 0.867 (0.838–0.895), and 0.878 (0.859–0.896), respectively. For Task II, 13.8% of patients had PAS. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 3D DGS were 0.902 (0.818–0.985), 0.900 (0.714–1.000), and 0.890 (0.841–0.938), respectively, on the external testing set at quadrant level following normal clinical practice; and 0.885 (0.836–0.933), 0.912 (0.816–1.000), and 0.700 (0.660–0.741), respectively, on the external testing set at clock-hour level.

The American College of Radiology Ultrasound LI-RADS includes the visualization score as a subjective measure of examination quality and the expected level of sensitivity. Whether a single suboptimal visualization score warrants a change in surveillance strategy is unknown. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine the relative stability of visualization scores on serial surveillance ultrasound examinations in patients at risk for HCC. METHODS. This retrospective study included patients at risk for HCC who underwent at least two HCC surveillance ultrasound examinations at one of three institutions between January 2017 and November 2020. The frequencies of the score remaining unchanged after variable numbers of preceding examinations with the given score were determined. A mixed-effects logistic model was fitted to identify factors associated with a repeat score of C (denoting severe limitations) versus a change to score A (indicating no or minimal limitations) or score B (denoting moderate limitations). RESULTS. A total of 3169 patients underwent at least two ultrasound examinations, yielding a total of 9602 examinations. A total of 8030 examinations (83.6%) were assigned score A; 1378 (14.4%), score B; and 194 (2.0%), score C. The frequency of score A was 88%, 91%, and 93% after one, two, and three consecutive prior examinations with score A, respectively. The frequency of score B was 45%, 48%, and 55% after one, two, and three consecutive prior examinations with score B. The frequency of score C was 42%, 67%, and 80% after one, two, and three consecutive prior examinations with score C. Among 109 examinations with score C in 91 patients with an available follow-up examination, no factor (including age, sex, severe steatosis, advanced cirrhosis, ascites, body mass index, and a change in the ultrasound machine, sonographer, or radiologist) was significantly associated with repeat score C (all p > .05). Although not statistically significant, presence of severe steatosis and presence of advanced cirrhosis had the highest odds ratios (2.88 and 2.38, respectively) for repeat score C in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION. Only 42% of patients with visualization score C on a single surveillance examinations have score C on follow-up examinations; however, after two or more score C examinations, the chance of future score C substantially increases. CLINICAL IMPACT. The findings may inform decisions regarding alternative surveillance strategies in patients with visualization score C on ultrasound. This decision should consider the number of previous examinations with score C.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The effect of material microstructure is modeled using the generalized continuum theory of couple stress elasticity. In the formulation, the displacement field is chosen as a primary unknown and the generalized Navier's equation is established for a generic material layer. The Fourier integral transform method is directly applied to derive the general solution of the elastic field for the generic layer, and such solution is subsequently utilized to form the layer stiffness equation in the transform space. Boundary conditions together with the field continuity across the material interfaces are enforced, via the standard assembly procedure, to obtain a system of linear algebraic equations governing all unknowns of the multi-layered system. An efficient quadrature is adopted to carry out all involved integrals arising from the integral transform inversion. Detailed results are reported that confirm the validity of our results through the comparison with well-known solutions and demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to simulate various scenarios of layered media including those made of functionally graded materials. The important role of the material length scale effect on the predicted response is also elucidated.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Modeling and Simulation, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

It was proposed that the new species was generated via electron transfer between aniline-containing N-based ligand and Cu(ClO4)2, resulting in oxidative ligand cleavage. Monitoring the reaction of Cu(atpa) with Cu(ClO4)2 for a period of time revealed a gradual decrease of an active species, concomitant with the growth of a variety of organic fractions including 9-anthraldehyde and anthraquinone compounds. Cu(tpa) (Cu coordinated with tripodal amine ligand without anthracene analogue) was also detected from this reaction. This finding was indicative of an oxidative ligand cleavage via the N-dealkylation pathway. In addition to oxidative ligand cleavage, the new species was competent to oxidize other substrates such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as well.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Chemistry (all)

The coral reef degradation problem does not just happen in Thailand but around the world; it is intensified and widespread. If such a situation continues without correction or solution, corals will be depleted from the sea. In the past, several agencies have attempted to fix this problem by restoring coral reefs in different ways. Accordingly, one of the common solutions is to use discontinued materials, such as motorcycles, tanks, tires, PVC pipes, or square cement bars, as artificial corals. However, these materials have become visual pollution and may contain environmental toxins. With such a problem, design and traditional materials need an innovation to increase their efficiency and have good visuals. Leading to the development of Innovareef, a new model of artificial coral reef and product creation was designed based on new product developments and in-depth interview data collection from specialists. This model aims to guide product developments with natural beauty to fix visual pollution and reduce the burden of coral reefs in marine tourism.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, environmental","Computer Science Applications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Global and Planetary Change, Waste Management and Disposal"

Materials and methods: This 10-year retrospective cohort study comprised 2216 employees of the Electric Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Their demographic, medical, and periodontal status was collected. Subjects with periodontitis progression were defined as having ≥ 2 teeth with progression. Additional proximal clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm or tooth loss with severe periodontitis at baseline were used to identify disease progression at the tooth level. Central obesity was classified using the waist-hip ratio. Multi-level Poisson regression was used to determine the effect of obesity on periodontitis progression by adjusting for age, sex, education, income, smoking, alcohol drinking, exercise, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Results: The cumulative incidence of periodontitis progression during the 10-year period was 59.6 cases per 100 persons (95% CI: 57.5, 61.6).

However, when confounders were analyzed simultaneously, the effect of obesity was not significant with a risk ratio of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.08). Conclusions: Despite the higher incidence of disease progression in the obese, obesity is not an independent risk factor for periodontitis progression. Clinical relevance: Obesity and periodontitis progression share many common risk factors. Using the obesity as a preliminary screening for periodontitis progression may be an alternative prevention protocol.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Effective vaccines and optimized booster vaccination strategies are thus highly required. Here, the gene encoding six different RBD (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon variants) along with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc) was cloned into plant expression vector and produced in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. Further, the immunogenicity of plant-produced variant RBD-Fc fusion proteins were tested in cynomolgus monkeys. Each group of cynomolgus monkeys was immunized three times intramuscularly with variant RBD-Fc vaccines at Day 0, 21, 42, and neutralizing antibody responses were evaluated against ancestral (Wuhan), Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants. The results showed that three doses of the RBD-Fc vaccine significantly enhanced the immune response against all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, the vaccines based on Delta and Epsilon mutant RBD elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against ancestral (Wuhan), Alpha, and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants whereas Beta and Gamma RBD-Fc vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies against their respective SARS-CoV-2 strains. The Delta and Epsilon RBD-Fc based vaccines displayed cross-reactive immunogenicity and might be applied as a booster vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. These proof-of-concept results will be helpful for the development of plant-derived RBD-Fc-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Several gaps in the availability of HIS for kidney disease were highlighted by the first iteration of the Global Kidney Health Atlas. Methods: As part of its second iteration, the International Society of Nephrology conducted a cross-sectional global survey between July and October 2018 to explore the coverage and scope of HIS for kidney disease, with a focus on kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Results: Out of a total of 182 invited countries, 154 countries responded to questions on HIS (85% response rate). KRT registries were available in almost all high-income countries, but few low-income countries, while registries for non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) were rare. Registries in high-income countries tended to be national, in contrast to registries in low-income countries, which often operated at local or regional levels. Although cause of end-stage kidney disease, modality of KRT and source of kidney transplant donors were frequently reported, few countries collected data on patient-reported outcome measures and only half of low-income countries recorded process-based measures. Almost no countries had programs to detect AKI and practices to identify CKD-targeted individuals with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, rather than members of high-risk ethnic groups. Conclusions: These findings confirm significant heterogeneity in the global availability of HIS for kidney disease and highlight important gaps in their coverage and scope, especially in low-income countries and across the domains of AKI, non-dialysis CKD, patient-reported outcomes, process-based measures and quality indicators for KRT service delivery.",medical,"Nephrology, Transplantation"

It can transfer overall user preferences across domains to solve sparsity problems, but it is not sufficient to train good user embeddings in the target domain, which are normally obtained at an individual user level. Although some works have tried to transfer at the individual user level to cover dominant user characteristics in each domain, these rely on simple combining operations. If users from two domains differ, such operations cannot properly represent their individual dominant characteristics. Traditionally, CDRSs consider improving recommendation performance only in the target domain. However, the shared user embeddings contain dominant user characteristics from two domains, which can improve the performance of both domains simultaneously; this is referred to as a dual-target CDRS. In this work, we propose a user embedding sharing method that can extract and share dominant user characteristics of two domains at the individual user level to improve the recommendation performance in dual-target systems using deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA). User embeddings from the proposed method can preserve important user information from each domain while obtaining dominant user characteristics from maximally correlated user embeddings of the same user from two domains. Using four real-world datasets, experiments indicate that our method outperforms four baselines in rating prediction and ranking.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, sociology","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems and Management, Communication"

VPD was used to improve the mechanical performance, strength, and engineering properties of HAC. CKD and OPC were used as a partial replacement for VPD in different proportions of 0, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% by weight. Na2SiO3 and NaOH were used as alkaline activator solutions to realize the alkaline reaction process in geopolymer paste. Workability, compressive strength, and engineering properties, such as bulk density, porosity, and water absorption, were studied. Results of this research indicated that increasing the replacement rates of CKD or OPC decreased slump flow but increased the strength of HAC and enhanced the values of its engineering properties. Geopolymer concrete with OPC and CKD as partial replacement of 30% by weight of VPD achieved an increase of 23% and 8%, respectively, in compressive strength at a test age of 90 days. Meanwhile, 20% VPD replacement by CKD achieved 11% higher compressive strength for the VPD–CKD samples compared with the control mixture.

Recently, “MXenes” have been identified as a novel class of advanced two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal compounds that have piqued the interest of researchers in a variety of electrochemical applications due to their remarkable physicochemical properties that resemble other 2D materials such as graphene. Similarly, an amorphous transition metal boride compound has sparked considerable interest as a potential candidate for battery-type supercapacitor electrodes. However, the concerns about MXene layer restacking and the low electrical conductivity of metal borides limit their usefulness. Herein, we present the fabrication of a novel metal boride-MXene (CoB-V-MX) architecture using a simple one-pot chemical reduction process of cobalt boride nanoparticles and V-MXene flakes. An asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) with activated carbon as the anode and the prepared composite as the cathode was developed. The HSC device can operate over a wider voltage range (1.6 V), distribute a high specific energy of 31.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, and retain up to 89.2% of its initial capacitance for up to 2500 charge-discharge cycles, demonstrating the increased possibility of designing a novel composite architecture in advanced energy storage applications.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of patients with cancer and hematologic disease, who aged 12-18 years old and received 2 doses the BNT162b2 vaccines at 4 weeks apart were enrolled. Immunogenicity was determined by measuring serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 domain of the spike protein (Anti S-RBD), surrogated viral neutralization test (sVNT) of SARS-CoV-2 and Delta strain.

However, the exact function of Notch signaling in OSCC remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of Notch signaling inhibition using a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) on OSCC behaviours in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis of public-available gene expression profiles revealed the dysregulation of the Notch signaling pathway in OSCC compared with normal tissues, indicating the role of Notch signaling in OSCC regulation. RNA sequencing analysis of DAPT-treated human OSCC cells revealed the dysregulation of genes related to cell cycle-related pathways. Blocking Notch signaling significantly inhibited cell proliferation. DAPT-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, cell migration and invasion were also reduced in DAPT-treated cells. These findings indicate that Notch signaling activation participates in OSCC regulation by promoting cell growth, cell cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion. These mechanisms could facilitate OSCC progression. These results imply the potential use of Notch signaling inhibitors as a candidate adjuvant treatment in OSCC patients.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

CKD-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) induced by hyperphosphatemia is a major pathophysiologic mechanism. The effects of phosphate binders on bone turnover biomarkers and bone mineral density (BMD) in haemodialysis patients are still inconclusive. Our aim is to demonstrate the effects of these phosphate binders on different aspects of CKD-MBD. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort of 65 haemodialysis patients to investigate the effect of 12-month monotherapy of phosphate binders composing calcium-based phosphate binders (CPB) or non-calcium-based phosphate binders (NCPB), including sevelamer and lanthanum, on bone turnover biomarkers and BMD changes. The performance of bone turnover biomarkers to predict low BMD was attentively determined. Results: When compared with CPB, NCPB use was associated with higher levels of bone turnover biomarkers. NCPB was also associated with lower BMD at lumbar and distal radius. Total procollagen type 1N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) provided the best performance for diagnosing low BMD in haemodialysis patients. Conclusion: Switching from CPB to NCPB might increase bone biomarkers and prevent the development of adynamic bone disease. On the contrary, NCPB should be cautiously used in haemodialysis patients who already had low BMD. P1NP, BALP and TRAP5b could be used to guide the appropriate management, including anti-resorptive and anabolic medications, and predict low BMD in haemodialysis patients treated with phosphate binders.",medical,Nephrology

Zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs) are viewed as having significant promise for usage as renewable energy storage devices due to their high energy density and low cost. The battery management system (BMS) for ZAFBs, on the other hand, is still in its infancy, as a precise prediction of their nonlinear behavior is necessary. To address this shortcoming, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model is constructed via a multiple linear time-invariant (LTI) model using charge/discharge current and state of charge (SOC) as scheduling parameters. The model created is validated using a variety of battery data from several experimental batches. According to the discharge current and state of charge, the results reveal that the established LPV model can accurately predict the nonlinear behavior of the ZAFBs. Thus, it is determined that in terms of local accuracy, the LPV model is comparable to the linear model. With respect to the global accuracy, the analysis demonstrates that the LPV model outperforms the linear model. This result provide arguments for the LPV model's capacity to anticipate the dynamics of ZAFBs and their suitability for usage in the BMS.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Control and Systems Engineering

Although HIV-specific CD8+ T cells become dysfunctional without treatment, antiretroviral therapy (ART) partially restores their function. However, the extent of this recovery under long-term ART is less understood. Methods: We analyzed the differentiation status and function of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells after long-term ART initiated in acute or chronic HIV infection ex vivo and upon in vitro recall. Findings: ART initiation in any stage of acute HIV infection promoted the persistence of long-lived HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with high expansion (P<0·0008) and cytotoxic capacity (P=0·02) after in vitro recall, albeit at low cell number (P=0·003). This superior expansion capacity correlated with stemness (r=0·90, P=0·006), measured by TCF-1 expression, similar to functional HIV-specific CD8+ T cells found in spontaneous controllers. Importanly, TCF-1 expression in these cells was associated with longer time to viral rebound ranging from 13 to 48 days after ART interruption (r =0·71, P=0·03). In contrast, ART initiation in chronic HIV infection led to more differentiated HIV-specific CD8+ T cells lacking stemness properties and exhibiting residual dysfunction upon recall, with reduced proliferation and cytolytic activity. Interpretation: ART initiation in acute HIV infection preserves functional HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, albeit at numbers too low to control viral rebound post-ART. HIV remission strategies may need to boost HIV-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and induce stem cell-like properties to reverse the residual dysfunction persisting on ART in people treated after acute infection prior to ART release.

The reason for this is unclear. In addition to the role of genetics, bisphenol A (BPA) has been investigated as a possible causal factor for T1DM. This study aimed to determine the correlation between urinary BPA levels and T1DM in Thai children and adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in T1DM patients who were followed at the endocrinology clinic at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from December 2018 to December 2019 and age-matched healthy controls. Urinary BPA levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and adjusted by urine creatinine. Anthropometric data were measured in all participants and clinical data were collected for the T1DM patients. All participants completed a questionnaire regarding possible BPA exposures. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio for T1DM. Results: Seventy-five T1DM patients and 113 age-matched controls were included in the study. The mean age for T1DM and control groups were 14.8 ± 5.7 and 14.4 ± 6.2 years, respectively. The T1DM group had a significantly higher median (interquartile range) level of adjusted urinary BPA compared to the control (31.50 [7.87, 69.45] vs 10.1 [0, 54.01] μg/g creatinine, P = 0.02). Urinary BPA of 17 μg/g creatinine or more was significantly associated with TIDM, with adjusted odds ratio (95% Confident interval, CI) of 2.38 (1.27, 4.44), P = 0.006. Conclusions: Higher urinary BPA level is one of the possible risk factors for T1DM.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"
Optimization of a vertical axis wind turbine with a deflector under unsteady wind conditions via Taguchi and neural network applications,"Chen W.-H., Wang J.-S., Chang M.-H., Tuan Hoang A., Shiung Lam S., Kwon E.E., Ashokkumar V.",2022-02-15,"Artificial intelligence and neural network, Artificial intelligence and neural networks, Computational fluid dynamic, Neural network model, Power coefficients, Taguchi's methods, Tip speed ratio, Unsteady wind, Vertical axes wind turbines, Wind conditions, artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network (NN), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Taguchi method, Unsteady wind, Vertical axis wind turbine","Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), so named because of their vertical axis of rotation, are a sustainable, opportune, and versatile means of producing energy. Their operation is not dependent on wind direction, making them suitable for use in settings with turbulent and inconsistent winds (e.g., urban locations), and they can be installed at the bottom of towers for easier installation and maintenance. However, unsteady wind may cause a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) to operate under drag-controlled conditions and reduce its performance. The power coefficient of a VAWT under unsteady wind conditions is heavily impacted by the tip speed ratio (TSR). Understanding and optimizing TSR is critical to making VAWTs a more viable and attractive option for sustainable energy production. Deflectors have been shown to improve the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines. In the present study, the Taguchi method is used in the experimental design, and a high-fitting neural network (NN) model based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data is adopted to predict the optimal mean TSR for a VAWT operation with a deflector. The amplitude and frequency fluctuations of the mean inlet velocity are used to specify the unsteady wind conditions. The results show that the imposed unsteady wind reduces the average power coefficient (Cp-) of the VAWT. By applying the Taguchi method and NN analysis to the impact of unsteady wind conditions, it is found that the mean TSR (TSRmean) is the factor producing the greatest impact on Cp-. The optimal TSRmean is evaluated by the NN model. In light of the recommendation from the NN predictions, the Cp- value from CFD can be improved by up to 3.58 folds under the optimal TSRmean. Furthermore, the relative errors of predicted Cp- values between the NN and CFD simulation are less than 4%, showing the reliability of predictions of the developed NN model in efficiently calculating the optimal operation for a VAWT.","petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; unconventional, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Exergy and exergoeconomic assessment of sustainable light olefins production from an integrated methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins system,"Detchusananard T., Prasertcharoensuk P., Patcharavorachot Y., Marechal F., Arpornwichanop A.",2022-05-01,"Cost rates, Exergoeconomic analysis, Exergoeconomics, Exergy Analysis, Exergy efficiencies, Integrated systems, Light-olefins, Methanol synthesis, Methanol to olefin, Syn gas, Exergoeconomic analysis, Exergy analysis, Methanol synthesis, Methanol-to-olefins","Integrated methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins systems are considered attractive and promising technologies to produce light olefins from syngas derived from biomass feedstock. In this study, a flowsheet model of a proposed system was developed and employed for system design and analysis. The system consists of four main parts: methanol synthesis, methanol-to-olefins process, olefins separation, and power plant. The effects of important operating parameters on the exergy efficiency were investigated to determine the optimal operating conditions to achieve the maximum exergy efficiency of this system. The results indicate that the methanol synthesis process should be operated at temperature, pressure, and recycling ratio of 250 °C, 150 bar, and 0.85, respectively, whereas the methanol-to-olefins process should be operated at a temperature of 480 °C and the power plant should be run at steam temperature and steam pressure of 650 °C and 50 bar, respectively. Heat integration based on a pinch analysis was subsequently performed to improve the system energy usage, resulting in a 9.29% increase in the exergy efficiency of the integrated system. An exergoeconomic analysis of the integrated system with the designed heat exchanger network was performed. The results show that the power plant has the highest cost rate of exergy destruction and total cost rate. Moreover, the syngas feedstock cost has the greatest impact on the exergoeconomic indicators; it is necessary to minimize this cost to achieve economic viability of the process for industrial use. The production of light olefins from the integrated methanol synthesis and methanol-to-olefins system using a renewable syngas feedstock has a potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of renewable sources replacing fossil sources.","heat exchange, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

A coreless silica fiber (CSF) was connected to a single-mode fiber (SMF) at both ends to achieve a SMF–CSF–SMF structure. CSF is the sensing region where multimode interference (MMI) generates higher light interaction at the interface between the fiber and sensing medium, leading to enhanced sensitivity. Optimization of the CSF length was conducted numerically to attain the highest possible coupling efficiency at the output. Surface functionalization was achieved via hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanorods directly onto the CSF at low temperatures. The optical fiber-based sensor was successfully fabricated and tested with 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of IPA. The sensor response was recorded using an optical spectrometer and analyzed for sensor sensitivity. The fabricated sensor shows the potential to detect isopropanol with the sensitivity of 0.053 nm/%IPA vapor. Further improvement of the sensor sensitivity and selectivity is also proposed for future work.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Incidence and risk factors associated with superior-segmented facet joint violation during minimal invasive lumbar interbody fusion,"Singhatanadgige W., Jaruprat P., Kerr S.J., Yingsakmongkol W., Kotheeranurak V., Limthongkul W.",2022-09-01,"Humans, Incidence, Lumbar Vertebrae, Middle Aged, Pedicle Screws, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Spinal Fusion, Zygapophyseal Joint, Adjacent segmental degeneration, Entry point, Facet joint violation Instrumentation, MIS surgery interbody fusion, Navigation, Risk factor","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The trend of minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion is increasing, and adjacent segmental degeneration (ASD) is one of the complications of the procedures in which facet joint violation (FJV) is a cause. FJVs can occur during percutaneous instrumentation. This study aimed to identify the risk factors that affect FJV during minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion. PURPOSE: To identify the risk factors for FJVs and the factors that have a strong impact on the violation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion with percutaneous screw fixation between June 2018 and December 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of the FJV was reviewed by CT scans which obtained within 6 months after surgery, and the axial, coronal, and sagittal cuts of the scans were evaluated. The FJV was defined as the screw being visible in the facet joint in at least one plane of the CT scan. Radiographic parameters were measured using CT scans including diameters of the facet joints in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes defined by the facet diameter. The facet angle (FA), the pedicle angle (PA), the screw-facet angle (SFA), the screw-endplate angle (SEA), and the superior margin of the facet joint in the sagittal plane (SD) differed from the head of the screw. At Last, the depth of back muscle was measured in the axial cut of the MRI. METHODS: This study analyzed 119 patients who underwent minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion between June 2018 and December 2019. Facet joint violation at the uppermost level was examined using CT in all dimensions. Radiographic parameters (facet diameter, facet angle, pedicle angle, screw-facet angle, screw-endplate angle, and distance between the head of the screws and the facet) were measured. BMI, age, diagnosis, and navigation assistance were included in the study. Risk factors were analyzed to determine which factors had an effect on FJV, and the cut-off was calculated for each parameter. RESULTS: This study included 119 patients, with a mean age of 63 years. FJV occurred in 13/119 (10.9%) patients and 15/238 (6.3%) joints, respectively. No FJV occurred in 120 joints operated with navigation-assistance and 15/178 (8.4%) joints operated without navigation (p=.01). We found an increasing proportion of violations at more caudal levels: no violations occurred in eight patients with lumbar at L1 or L2, and 1/40 (2.5%), 7/158 (4.4%), and 7/32 (21.9%) of violations occurred at L3, L4, and L5, respectively (p=.01). The diameter of the facet in the axial cut, facet angle, screw facet angle, and distance between the head of the screw and facet were statistically significant in determining the increasing rate of FJV after multivariate analysis was performed (AROC=0.9486, p≤.05). The cutoff point for each radiographic parameter were diameter of facet in the axial ≥17.5 mm, diameter of facet in coronal plane ≥19.5 mm, facet angle ≥41.5o, screw-facet angle ≥39o, and distance between facet and the screw ≥-2.6 mm. The estimated probability of FJV was 96.9% when every parameter was greater than the cut-off point. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the facet diameter in the axial plane, coronal plane, facet angle, screw facet angle, and the distance between the dome of the screw and facet are risk factors for FJV. Surgeons can avoid violations when radiographic considerations are done. Careful screw placement and good entry points for instrumentation may decrease the rate of facet violation.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Neurology (clinical)"

Our report was designed to investigate HCV prevalence and genotype, in addition to the clinical use of HCV core antigen (HCVcAg), within multiple HD facilities in Thailand. Methods: This cross‐sectional report was investigated between January and June 2019. HCV infection was assessed by anti-HCV and confirmed active infection by measuring HCV RNA and HCVcAg. HCV genotype was determined by phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of NS5B region. Results: Overall, 140 of 3,305 (4.2%) patients in 15 dialysis centers had anti-HCV positive. Among them, HCV RNA was further assessed in 93 patients and was detectable in 59 (63.4%) persons. Considering HCV viremia, HCVcAg measurement exhibited high accuracy (96.8%), sensitivity (94.9%) and specificity (100%) in comparison with HCV RNA testing. Moreover, individuals infected with HCV received a longer duration of dialysis vintage when compared to anti-HCV negative controls. The major sub-genotypes were 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b, 6f and 6n. Regarding phylogenetic analysis, there were 7 clusters of isolates with high sequence homology affecting 17 individuals, indicating possible HCV transmission within the same HD centers. Conclusions: HCV frequency and common sub-genotypes in HD centers were different from those found in the Thai general population. HCVcAg might be an alternate testing for viremia within resource-limited countries. Enhanced preventive practices, dialyzer reuse policy and better access to antiviral therapy are crucial for HCV micro-elimination within HD facilities.",medical,Infectious Diseases

However, the low separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs of pure g-C3N4 is still limited the real applications. In this work, we synthesized a g-C3N4 photocatalyst with hollow porous worm-like structure morphology as well as phosphorus (P) doping through simple thermal polymerization with NaH2PO4·2H2O as both P source and template. The results show that the synthesized g-C3N4 photocatalysts with hollow porous worm-like structure. The specific surface area of modified photocatalysts can be enlarged from 39.29 m2/g to 51.36 m2/g, and the photochemical test show that the as-prepared photocatalysts has better visible light response and more highly separation efficiency of photogeneration electron-hole than that of pristine g-C3N4. As expected, the photocatalytic hydrogen measurements reveal that the obtained P-doped hollow porous worm-like structured g-C3N4 has highly efficient activity than pure g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic hydrogen production capacity can reach up to 10.985 mmol/g for 5 h, which is about 7.6 times that of the pure g-C3N4. Finally, based on the above analysis, we further proposed a reasonable photocatalytic mechanism.

Here, this research proposed a novel sustainable method for direct biogas upgrading to high-quality biomethane by catalytic CO2 methanation and focused on the performance improvement of Ni-based catalysts. Carbon nanotubes-silica fiber (CNT-SF) composite as a high-heat transfer fibrous support was successfully synthesized using the Ni/silica fiber (SF) catalyst as a core-fiber seeding structure in ethanol steam reforming. The Ni/CNT-SF catalyst was extensively characterized and investigated in the direct biogas upgrading by CO2 methanation. The results revealed that Ni/CNT-SF catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance than the Ni/SF and conventional Ni/silica porous (SP) catalysts. This suggested that the Ni/CNT-SF catalyst easily accessed the reactant molecules and exhibited an enhanced metal-support interaction with smaller Ni crystalline size, leading to a higher dispersion of the Ni active site, enhancing the CO2 methanation. Furthermore, the addition of Mg (1–3%wt.) into the Ni/CNT-SF catalyst resulted in a stronger metal-support interaction and increased moderate basic sites, which could suppress the Ni sintering and promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. Under optimum conditions (350 °C, 10 bar, H2/CO2 molar ratio of 4, and GHSV of 24,000 mL⋅g−1⋅h−1), the Ni-2Mg/CNT-SF catalyst achieved the highest CO2 conversion, CH4 selectivity, producing high-quality biomethane with CH4 content at approximately 95%, without CH4 losses.","heat exchange, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Health departments and regulatory agencies have interests in monitoring of PFAS presences and exposures. For the detection of PFAS, numerous highly precise and sensitive chromatographic methods are available. However, the drawbacks of analytical techniques include timely sample preparations and the lack of on-site applicability. As a result, there is an increasing demand for simple sensor systems for monitoring of PFAS in real field samples. In this review, we first describe the sample pre-treatment and analytical techniques for the detection of PFAS. Second, we broadly discussed available sensor system for the quantification of PFAS in different filed samples. Finally, future trends in PFASs sensor are also presented.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, pharmacology","Food Science, Toxicology"
Paradoxically Greater Persistence of HIV RNA-Positive Cells in Lymphoid Tissue When ART Is Initiated in the Earliest Stage of Infection,"Kroon E., Chottanapund S., Buranapraditkun S., Sacdalan C., Colby D.J., Chomchey N., Prueksakaew P., Pinyakorn S., Trichavaroj R., Vasan S., Manasnayakorn S., Reilly C., Helgeson E., Anderson J., David C., Zulk J., De Souza M., Tovanabutra S., Schuetz A., Robb M.L., Douek D.C., Phanuphak N., Haase A., Ananworanich J., Schacker T.W.",2022-06-15,"Anti-Retroviral Agents, CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, HIV Infections, Humans, Lymph Nodes, RNA, T-Lymphocytes, Viral Load, acute HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy, HIV reservoir, in situ hybridization, lymphoid tissues","Starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Fiebig 1 acute HIV infection limits the size of viral reservoirs in lymphoid tissues, but does not impact time to virus rebound during a treatment interruption. To better understand why the reduced reservoir size did not increase the time to rebound we measured the frequency and location of HIV RNA+ cells in lymph nodes from participants in the RV254 acute infection cohort. HIV RNA+ cells were detected more frequently and in greater numbers when ART was initiated in Fiebig 1 compared to later Fiebig stages and were localized to the T-cell zone compared to the B-cell follicle with treatment in later Fiebig stages. Variability of virus production in people treated during acute infection suggests that the balance between virus-producing cells and the immune response to clear infected cells rapidly evolves during the earliest stages of infection.

Despite intensified treatment, patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) still carry a dismal prognosis. The Thai Pediatric Oncology Group (ThaiPOG) proposed the use of a multimodality treatment to improve outcomes of HR-NBL in non-immunotherapy settings. Methods: Patients with HR-NBL undergoing ThaiPOG protocols (ThaiPOG-NB-13HR or -18HR) between 2013 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic data, treatment modalities, outcomes, and prognostic factors were evaluated and analyzed. Results: A total of 183 patients with HR-NBL undergoing a topotecan containing induction regimen were enrolled in this study. During the consolidation phase (n = 169), 116 patients (68.6%) received conventional chemotherapy, while 53 patients (31.4%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 41.2% and 22.8%, respectively. Patients who underwent HSCT had more superior 5-year EFS (36%) than those who received chemotherapy (17.1%) (p =.041), although they both performed similarly in 5-year OS (48.7% vs. 39.8%, p =.17). The variation of survival outcomes was observed depending on the number of treatment modalities. HSCT combined with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) treatment and maintenance with 13-cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA) demonstrated a desirable 5-year OS and EFS of 65.6% and 58.3%, respectively. Poorly or undifferentiated tumor histology and cis-RA administration were independent factors associated with relapse and survival outcomes, respectively (p <.05). Conclusion: A combination of HSCT and cis-RA successfully improved the outcomes of patients with HR-NBL in immunotherapy inaccessible settings.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Hematology, Oncology"
Automatic Diagnosis Model for Risk Factors of Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism based on Machine Learning,"Anupoomchaiya P., Sukperm A., Rojnuckarin P., Sa-Ing V.",2022-01-01,"Automatic diagnosis, Diagnosis model, Imbalanced data, Machine-learning, On-machines, Random forests, Resampling method, Risk factors, Thailand, Venous thromboembolism, imbalanced data, machine learning, resampling method, venous thromboembolism","Thrombosis is the main cause of blood clots that obstructs the flow of blood in an artery or venous thrombosis. Thus, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most serious cause of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, this disease is a leading cause of death in Thailand because of a lack of understanding and caution. In this research, we propose an automatic diagnosis model by using effective machine learning to predict the important risk factors for VTE. The raw data were collected from the medical ward at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital of Thailand. Before the analysis, this data consisted of 1,290 rows and 65 columns that were analyzed, solved, and transformed as prepared data. By resampling algorithms to import into each model, this research spits the prepared data into the training dataset and the testing dataset with a ratio of 80:20. In the experiments, our research compares the effectiveness of the three machine learning models that consist of Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to find the best diagnostic model. According to the experimental results, the Random Forest model was computed by the class weight and oversampled by the sampling strategy 0.25 technique is the most efficient model to represent the most prediction accuracy of 99.61 percent. Therefore, the Random Forest and our proposed setting will assist the medical doctors in determining the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. In addition, our proposed model can be used to forecast the likelihood of VTE based on a combination of the important risk factors.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Simulations were conducted using the realizable k-epsilon model and the wall function. The simulation results show that the hole positions affect the Nusselt number and friction factor values. The Nusselt number was highest when the hole position was located near the dead zone of the flow field. This can be evinced with a temperature distribution on an absorber plate. The effect of hole positions on the friction factor can be explained by flow velocity distributions in the x-direction of the air influx. The velocity distributions revealed that a hole in a proper position reduces the momentum flux flowing toward the winglet vortex generator, resulting in a less pressure drag.",engineering,"Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

High levels of TIM-3 expression on AML blasts were correlated with first 7 + 3 induction failure (CR 16.2% vs. non-CR 36.4%, p =.038). In contrast, high TIM-3 levels on natural killer (NK) cells were associated with complete remission (CR) status after induction (CR 24.7% vs. non-CR 6.5%, p =.035). Few PD-L1 positive AML blasts and PD-1 or PD-L1 positive NK cells were observed. Although the exhausted PD-1 expressing T cells were detected in 28.3% of T cells, the double positive of PD-1 and TIM-3 T cells were rarely detected. In summary, the TIM-3 levels on AML blasts and NK cells are potentially the prognostic biomarkers in AML.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Oncology, Cancer Research"

Used shot blasts are rich iron sources of Fe0, which becomes an effective catalyst in the Fenton reaction. A modified air-Fenton (MAF) system was proposed to generate hydroxyl radicals that eliminated recalcitrant organics in cutting oil wastewater. First, the Taguchi method, comprising the L18 orthogonal array design, was used to identify significant operation factors, including the size and amount of used shot blasts, initial pH, reaction time, mixing speed, initial cutting oil concentration, and air flow rate. Then, a central composite rotatable design coupled with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimal conditions and model the influencing variables. The results provided three crucial variables for the cutting oil wastewater treatment through use of the MAF system: initial pH, the amount of used shot blasts, and initial cutting oil concentration. RSM was applied to reveal the optimum operating conditions, achieving a maximum removal efficiency of 92.82% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 80.18% for total organic carbon (TOC), and 99.55% for turbidity within 45 min of operating the MAF system. The model agreed well with the experimental data, with coefficient of determination values of 0.9819, 0.9654, and 0.9715 for COD, TOC, and turbidity removal efficiency, respectively. Pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics fitted well for COD removal, with a rate constant of 0.0218 min−1 and hydrogen peroxide generation of 0.0169 M. Overall, the proposed MAF system was efficient and had a low operating cost (0.67 USD/m3).","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The thermal stability, water vapor transmission rate, hydrophobicity, and antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite films were better than those of pure PVA. Tests on water loss in vegetables at room temperature revealed that the vegetable wrapped in packaging films could keep more water for more than 4 days. Tests on the shelf life of chicken meat packed in films suggested that the growth of natural microorganisms in raw chicken kept in the preservation storage of the refrigerator could be inhibited for at least 36 h.

The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been developed as an alternative. We describe surgical techniques for AP and EEA and compare the anatomic exposures of each. Methods: Ten cadaveric heads (20 sides) were dissected. Specimens were divided into 4 groups: 1) AP, 2) EEA for medial petrosectomy (MP), 3) EEA for inferior petrosectomy (IP), and 4) EEA for inferomedial petrosectomy (IMP). Outcomes were areas of exposure, angles of attack to neurovascular structures, and bone resection volumes. Results: AP had a greater area of exposure than did MP and IP (P = 0.30, P < 0.01) and had a higher angle of attack to the distal part of the facial nerve–vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve [CN] VII/VIII) complex than did IP and IMP (P < 0.01). MP had a lower angle of attack than IMP to the midpons (P = 0.04) and to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (P < 0.01). Compared with IMP, IP had a lower angle of attack to the proximal part of the CN VII/VIII complex (P < 0.01) and the flocculus (P < 0.01). The bone resection volume in AP was significantly less than that in MP, IP, and IMP (P < 0.01). Conclusions: AP and all EEA techniques had specific advantages for each specific area. We suggest AP for the ventrolateral pons and the anterior superior internal auditory canal, MP for the midline clivus, IP for the ventrolateral brainstem, and IMP to enhance the lateral corridor of the abducens nerve.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

This study aimed to identify transcriptomic biomarkers among MAP genes for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer by analyzing differential gene expressions and correlations with tumor progression. Gene expression data of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to identify differentially expressed MAP genes (DEMGs). Their prognostic value was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. Moreover, the relationships between alterations in lung cancer hallmark genes and the expression levels of DEMGs were investigated. The candidate biomarker genes were validated using three independent datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on clinical samples. A total of 88 DEMGs were identified from TCGA data. The 20 that showed the highest differential expression were subjected to association analysis with hallmark genes. Genetic alterations in TP53, EGFR, PTEN, NTRK1, and PIK3CA correlated with the expression of most of these DEMGs. Of these, six candidates—NUF2, KIF4A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, NEK2, and LRRK2—were significantly differentially expressed and correlated with the overall survival (OS) of the patients. The mRNA expression profiles of these candidates were consistently verified using three GEO datasets and qRT-PCR on patient lung tissues. The expression levels of NUF2, KIF4A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, NEK2, and LRRK2 can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for LUAD and LUSC. Moreover, the first five can serve as prognostic biomarkers for LUAD, while LRRK2 can be a prognostic biomarker for LUSC.

As part of the ongoing evaluation of the rhesus macaque model of severe malaria, a detailed ultrastructural analysis of the interaction between the parasite and both the host erythrocytes and the microvasculature was undertaken. Tissue (brain, heart and kidney) from splenectomized rhesus macaques and blood from spleen-intact animals infected with P. coatneyi were examined by electron microscopy. In all three tissues, similar interactions (sequestration) between infected red blood cells (iRBC) and blood vessels were observed with evidence of rosette and auto-agglutinate formation. The iRBCs possessed caveolae similar to P. vivax and knob-like structures similar to P. falciparum. However, the knobs often appeared incompletely formed in the splenectomized animals in contrast to the intact knobs exhibited by spleen intact animals. Plasmodium coatneyi infection in the monkey replicates many of the ultrastructural features particularly associated with P. falciparum in humans and as such supports its use as a suitable animal model. However, the possible effect on host-parasite interactions and the pathogenesis of disease due to the use of splenectomized animals needs to be taken into consideration.","Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Animal Science and Zoology, Infectious Diseases"

Perhaps, dengue infection might induce gut translocation of several pathogenic molecules that affect the disease severity. At the enrollment, there were 31 dengue cases in febrile and critical phases at 4.1 ± 0.3 days and 6.4 ± 1.1 days of illness, respectively, with the leaky gut as indicated by positive lactulose-to-mannitol excretion ratio. With blood bacteriome, the patients with critical phase (more severe dengue; n = 23) demonstrated more predominant abundance in Bacteroidetes and Escherichia spp. with the lower Bifidobacteria when compared with the healthy control (n = 5). Meanwhile, most of the blood bacteriome results in dengue with febrile stage (n = 8) were comparable to the control, except for the lower Bifidobacteria in dengue cases. Additionally, endotoxemia at the enrollment was demonstrated in five (62.5%) and 19 (82.6%) patients with febrile and critical phases, respectively, while serum BG was detectable in two (25%) and 20 (87%) patients with febrile and critical phases, respectively. There were higher peripheral blood non-classical monocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells) at the enrollment in patients with febrile phage than in the cases with critical stage. Then, non-classical monocytes (CD14-CD16+) and NK cells (CD56+CD16-) increased at 4 and 7 days of illness in the cases with critical and febrile stages, respectively, the elevation of LPS and/or BG in serum on day 7 was also associated with the increase in monocytes, NK cells, and cytotoxic T cells. In summary, enhanced Proteobacteria (pathogenic bacteria from blood bacteriomes) along with increased endotoxemia and serum BG (leaky gut syndrome) might be collaborated with the impaired microbial control (lower non-classical monocytes and NK cells) in the critical cases and causing more severe disease of dengue infection.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

We aimed to describe spirometry indices of children with tracheomalacia, including Empey index and flow-volume curve pattern, and determine whether these indices relate with bronchoscopic features. Methods: From the database of children with tracheomalacia diagnosed during 2016–2019, we reviewed their flexible bronchoscopy and spirometry data in a blinded manner. We specially evaluated several spirometry indices and tracheomalacia features (cross-sectional lumen reduction, malacic length, and presence of bronchomalacia) and determined their association using multivariable regression. Results: Of 53 children with tracheomalacia, the mean (SD) peak expiratory flow (PEF) was below the normal range [68.9 percent of predicted value (23.08)]. However, all other spirometry parameters were within normal range [Z-score forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) = −1.18 (1.39), forced vital capacity (FVC) = −0.61 (1.46), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity​​​​​​ (FEF25%–75%) = −1.43 (1.10), FEV1/FVC = −1.04 (1.08)], Empey Index = 8.21 (1.59). The most common flow-volume curve pattern was the “knee” pattern (n = 39, 73.6%). Multivariable linear regression identified the presence of bronchomalacia was significantly associated with lower flows: FEV1 [coefficient (95% CI) −0.78 (−1.54, −0.02)], FEF25%–75% [−0.61 (−1.22, 0)], and PEF [−12.69 (−21.13, −4.25)], all p ≤ 0.05. Other bronchoscopic-defined tracheomalacia features examined (cross-sectional lumen reduction, malacic length) were not significantly associated with spirometry indices. Conclusion: The “knee” pattern in spirometry flow-volume curve is common in children with tracheomalacia but other indices, including Empey index, cannot be used to characterize tracheomalacia. Spirometry indices were not significantly associated with bronchoscopic tracheomalacia features but children with tracheobronchomalacia have significantly lower flow than those with tracheomalacia alone.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine"

A series of aluminum-grafted SBA-15 mesoporous silica with Si/Al molar ratios of 1.5–20 was prepared by tuning aluminum precursors, solvents, and the pH values in grafting. Among them, the 3Al-S15-w-pH 8 catalyst with high acid capacity and mixed acid sites of Lewis and Brønsted acids was fabricated by adjusting the pH value of the water-soluble aluminum precursor to 8 in a water medium. Thus, it converted 87% of glucose at 160 °C for 5 h in the water medium with 33% HMF selectivity. Moreover, the used 3Al-S15-w-pH 8 catalyst was easily regenerated by calcination in air, which was further used for converting glucose to HMF without losing its performance. Our findings provide new ideas for environmentally friendly catalyst preparation and biomass conversion methods, which can be readily applied to catalysis and bio-refining processes.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"
Effect of body refrigeration on the postmortem formation of gamma hydroxybutyrate in whole blood,"Charunyanont Y., Tubtimrattana A., Tansrisawad N., Thirati P.",2022-05-01,"Autopsy, Chromatography, Liquid, Refrigeration, Sodium Oxybate, Substance Abuse Detection, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Gamma hydroxybutyrate, GHB, LC-MS/MS, Postmortem, Refrigeration, Storage, Whole blood","Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) levels in biological fluids are known to be increased after death. To date, there have been studies on sample storage conditions and preservatives on the postmortem in vitro formation of GHB. However, only few studies explored the effects of body storage conditions on GHB formation after death. In this study, we determined the effect of body refrigeration during body storage in mortuary refrigerators on postmortem formation of GHB in whole blood samples. A total of 41 fatalities were divided into two groups: Group A with a total refrigeration time less than 10 h and Group B with a total body refrigeration time more than 10 h. Femoral blood was collected 3 times: upon arrival at the mortuary, after 4 h of refrigeration, and at autopsy. Rectal temperatures were recorded at the time of specimen collection. Blood GHB concentration was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The rate of change in GHB levels was calculated. The study revealed that in the later phase of refrigeration, no difference was observed in the blood GHB levels between the two groups despite differences in the postmortem interval (PMI) and refrigeration time. Moreover, the rate of change in the GHB levels was lower in the group with a longer refrigeration time. Hence, we concluded that once the plateau of postmortem GHB formation is reached in a refrigerated body, further formation is not expected even with prolonged PMI. Early body refrigeration can minimize postmortem GHB production, thereby preventing the incorrect interpretation of analytical results.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical",Pathology and Forensic Medicine

Materials and methods: Human enamel specimens were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 22): Filtek™ Z350, EQUIA Forte®, and Cention N®. The baseline hardness was determined using a Knoop microhardness assay. AIEC was formed in the specimens, and they were placed in contact with the proximal restorative materials then subjected to a 7-day pH cycling. Microhardness was determined post-artificial caries formation and post-pH cycling. The differences in the percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SHR) between the groups were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test. The Dunn’s test was used for between-group comparisons (p < 0.05). Specimen surface morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the calcium, phosphorus, and fluoride contents were analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). ANOVA with the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison test was used to evaluate the differences between groups (p < 0.05). Results: The Cention N® %SHR was the highest, followed by EQUIA Forte®, and Filtek™ Z350. There was a significant difference in the %SHR between Cention N® and Filtek™ Z350 (p < 0.05). In contrast, there were no significant difference between Cention N® and EQUIA Forte®. Significantly increased enamel surface fluoride content was observed in the Cention N® compared with Filtek™ Z350 specimens (p < 0.05). The SEM image of the Cention N® specimens demonstrated the greatest mineral deposition. Conclusions: Cention N® markedly increased the surface hardness and fluoride content of adjacent AIEC compared with Filtek™ Z350 restorations. Clinical relevance: Cention N® is a promising alternative restorative material to remineralize initial enamel lesions in approximal adjacent surfaces, especially in high-risk caries patients.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
Influence of Aging on the Fracture Characteristics of Polyetheretherketone Dental Crowns: A Preliminary Study,"Lu W.-J., Srimaneepong V., Chen C.-S., Huang C.-H., Lin H.-C., Liu C.-F., Huang H.-H.",2022-10-01,"Ageing treatments, Dental crowns, Fracture characteristics, Fracture load, Fracture morphology, Polyetheretherketone, aging, dental crown, fracture, polyetheretherketone, TiO2","Although polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is becoming more widely used in dentistry applications, little is known about how aging will affect this material. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of an aging treatment on fracture characteristics of PEEK dental crowns. Additionally, the impact of the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2) into PEEK was examined. Two types of commercial PEEK discs were used in this study, including TiO2-free and 20% TiO2-containing PEEK. The PEEK dental crowns were fabricated and aging-treated at 134 °C and 0.2 MPa for 5 h in accordance with the ISO 13356 specification before being cemented on artificial tooth abutments. The fracture loads of all crown samples were measured under compression tests. Results demonstrated that adding TiO2 enhanced the fracture load of PEEK crowns compared to TiO2-free PEEK crowns before the aging treatment. However, the aging treatment decreased the fracture load of TiO2-containing PEEK crowns while increasing the fracture load of TiO2-free PEEK crowns. The fracture morphology of TiO2-containing PEEK crowns revealed finer feather shapes than that of the TiO2-free PEEK crowns. We concluded that adding TiO2 increased the fracture load of PEEK crowns without aging treatment. Still, the aging treatment influenced the fracture load and microscopic fracture morphology of PEEK crowns, depending on the addition of TiO2.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In this study, the semisynthesis of 28 furofuran lignans using samin (5) as the starting material is described. Our methodology involved the protonation of samin (5) to generate an oxocarbenium ion followed by the attack from two different nucleophiles, namely, thiols (RSH) and alcohols (ROH). The highly diastereoselective thioether and ether furofuran lignans were obtained, and their configurations were confirmed by 2D NMR and X-ray crystallography. The mechanism underlying the reaction was studied by monitoring 1H NMR and computational calculations, that is, the diastereomeric α- and β-products were equally formed through the SN1-like mechanism, while the β-product was gradually transformed via an SN2-like mechanism to the α-congener in the late step. Upon evaluation of the inhibitory effect of the synthesized lignans against α-glucosidases and free radicals, the lignans 7f and 7o of the phenolic hydroxyl group were the most potent inhibitors. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the α-glucosidase inhibition of 7f and 7o were verified to be of a mixed manner and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively. The results indicated that both 7f and 7o possessed promising antidiabetic activity, while simultaneously inhibiting α-glucosidases and free radicals.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

We recently found that treatment with ozone nanobubbles (NB–O3) activated expression of several immune-related genes leading to effective response to subsequent exposure to fish pathogens. In this study, we investigated whether pre-treatment of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with NB-O3 can enhance specific immune responses and improve efficacy of immersion vaccination against Streptococcus agalactiae. Spleen and head kidney of fish in the vaccinated groups showed a substantial upregulation in expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) and immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgD, IgT) compared with the unvaccinated control groups. The mRNA transcript of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes was greatest (approx. 2.8–3.3 folds) on day 7 post-vaccination, whereas the relative expression of immunoglobulin genes was greatest (approx. 3.2–4.1 folds) on day 21 post-immunization. Both systemic and mucosal IgM antibodies were elicited in vaccinated groups. As the result, the cumulative survival rate of the vaccinated groups was found to be higher than that of the unvaccinated groups, with a relative percent survival (RPS) ranging from 52.9 to 70.5%. However, fish in the vaccinated groups that received pre-treatment with NB-O3, bacterial antigen uptakes, expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IgM, IgD, and IgT, as well as the specific-IgM antibody levels and percent survival, were all slightly or significantly higher than that of the vaccinated group without pre-treatment with NB-O3.

Methods: Trigeminocervical complex neurons (n = 53) responsive to nociceptive activation of the dura mater were studied in rats using electrophysiological techniques. Results: A sub-population (n = 32) showed an average inhibition of dural-evoked responses of 65 ± 14% from baseline with cortical spreading depression. This response was reversed by the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, GR127935 (3 mg/kg; n = 6, iv), and a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (1.5 mg/kg; n = 6, iv), five minutes after injection. To determine the role of the nucleus raphe magnus in the trigeminocervical complex inhibitory effect, microinjection of lidocaine (2%, n = 6) or muscimol (100 mM, n = 5) into the nucleus raphe magnus was performed. There was no effect on cortical spreading depression-induced inhibition of neuronal firing in trigeminocervical complex by either.

The Cu-Cr catalysts were prepared via co-precipitation method using chromium (III) nitrate and copper nitrate precursors having different CuO weights between 50 and 80 wt% balancing with Cr2O3. The fresh catalyst was reduced by mixed gas of H2:N2 (10:90%) at 250ºC for 1 and 2 h (the non-reduced sample was also tested for comparative results). The structural properties of Cu-Cr catalysts were investigated by N2 physisorption, XRD, SEM-EDX, H2-TPR, XPS, NH3-TPD, and CO2-TPD. The ethanol dehydrogenation was carried out in a borosilicate glass fixed-bed continuous flow reactor at the specific condition [300 °C, atmospheric pressure, and WHSV = 3 (gethanol gcatalyst−1) h−1]. Based on the results, the ethyl acetate selectivity on 50 Cu-Cr catalyst (Low atomic Cu/Cr ratio) apparently increased by 1.6 times with increasing reduction time to 2 h having the highest ethyl acetate selectivity. Interestingly, the results from ethanol dehydrogenation indicated that the chromium promoter combining with CuxO in the 50 Cu-Cr catalyst increased the dispersion of copper species, facilitated the reduction, and increased the amount of Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the suitable reduction times can alter the distribution of CuCr2O4, Cu+, and Cu0, which resulted in increased ethyl acetate selectivity. The 50 Cu-Cr catalyst also exhibited good stability.","the atmosphere, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The effect of heat curing (25, 80 and 105 °C) on film properties was investigated by measuring water vapour permeability (WVP), contact angle, tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), Young’s modulus (YM), opacity, chemical structure and antioxidant activity. Results showed that genipin-crosslinked chitosan/astaxanthin film and heat cured at 105 °C (CAG-105) have the lowest (P < 0.05) WVP value which decreased by 55% while a contact angle increased from 50.2° to 74.6°, when compared to CAG-25 film. Heat curing affected the chemical-crosslinked interaction between chitosan and genipin with the establishment of new chemical bonds, leading to the improvement of TS and YM by 55% and 42%, respectively, for CAG-105 film. However, EAB and antioxidant activity of the CAG-105 slightly decreased. Moreover, heat curing changed the colour of genipin-crosslinked chitosan/astaxanthin film from light brown to reddish brown and increased the film opacity which can lower light transmission through the film. The developed film not only had better water barrier, TS and YM but, due to its opacity, could also provide light protection, and thus would be appropriate for packaging material of foods that degrade when exposed to moisture or light.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, engineering","Food Science, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Electrophysiology is an extension of the clinical exam. Electrophysiologic tests are diagnostic of physiologic tremor, primary orthostatic tremor, and functional tremor, but they are valuable in the clinical characterization of all forms of tremor. Electrophysiology will likely play an increasing role in axis 1 tremor classification because many features of tremor are not reliably assessed by clinical examination alone. In particular, electrophysiology may be needed to distinguish tremor from tremor mimics, assess tremor frequency, assess tremor rhythmicity or regularity, distinguish mechanical-reflex oscillation from central neurogenic oscillation, determine if tremors in different body parts, muscles, or brain regions are strongly correlated, document tremor suppression or entrainment by voluntary movements of contralateral body parts, and document the effects of voluntary movement on rest tremor. In addition, electrophysiologic brain mapping has been crucial in our understanding of tremor pathophysiology. The electrophysiologic methods of tremor analysis are reviewed in the context of physiologic tremor and pathologic tremors, with a focus on clinical characterization and pathophysiology. Electrophysiology is instrumental in elucidating tremor mechanisms, and the pathophysiology of the different forms of tremor is summarized in this review.","neuroscience, medical","Sensory Systems, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

Aims: To characterize variability of rtPA price, its availability, and its association with and impact on each country’s health expenditure (HE) resources. Methods: We conducted a global survey to obtain information on rtPA price (50 mg vial, 2020 US Dollars) and availability. Country-specific data, including low, lower middle (LMIC), upper middle (UMIC), and high-income country (HIC) classifications, and gross domestic product (GDP) and HE, both nominally and adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), were obtained from World Bank Open Data. To assess the impact of rtPA cost, we computed the rtPA price as percentage of per capita GDP and HE and examined its association with the country income classification. Results: rtPA is approved and available in 109 countries. We received surveys from 59 countries: 27 (46%) HIC, 20 (34%) UMIC, and 12 (20%) LMIC. Although HIC have significantly higher per capita GDP and HE compared to UMIC and LMIC (p < 0.0001), the median price of rtPA is non-significantly higher in LMICs (USD 755, interquartile range, IQR (575–1300)) compared to UMICs (USD 544, IQR (400–815)) and HICs (USD 600, IQR (526–1000)). In LMIC, rtPA cost accounts for 217.4% (IQR, 27.1–340.6%) of PPP-adjusted per capita HE, compared to 17.6% (IQR (11.2–28.7%), p < 0.0001) for HICs. Conclusion: We documented significant variability in rtPA availability and price among countries. Relative costs are higher in lower income countries, exceeding the available HE. Concerted efforts to improve rtPA affordability in low-income settings are necessary.",neuroscience,Neurology

Objective: This study was aimed at investigating the role of rs7574865, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in STAT4, in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Methods: A total 261 Thai patients (115 HBeAg-positive and 146 HBeAg-negative CHB) treated with 48-week PEG-IFN were recruited. Virological response (VR) at 48 weeks post treatment was defined as HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-positive CHB and HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative CHB. The SNP was analyzed by TaqMan PCR assay. Results: The distribution of GG, GT and TT genotypes of rs7574865 was 41.8%, 42.9% and 15.3%, respectively. There was no different in its distribution according to HBeAg status. Overall, patients with TT genotype, compared with non-TT genotype, achieved higher VR (64.3% vs. 30.5%; P < 0.001) and HBsAg clearance (23.8% vs. 5.0%; P < 0.001). There was the same trend in the HBeAg-positive group (VR, 52.4% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.077; HBsAg clearance, 23.8% vs. 6.4%; P = 0.028) and in the HBeAg-negative group (VR, 68.4% vs. 32.3%; P = 0.004; HBsAg clearance, 21.1% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.026). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that low baseline HBsAg level and TT genotype were factors independently associated with VR and HBsAg clearance. Conclusions: Our data support that SNP rs7574865 is associated with response to PEG-IFN therapy in Thai patients with CHB, regardless of baseline HBeAg status. Thus, the determination of this SNP could maximize cost-effectiveness of PEG-IFN in patients with CHB.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Misinformation on social media is one of the major issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, which must be carefully considered. To address this issue, people’s health information-seeking behaviours play an important role to access accurate and reliable information on social media. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire-based study in Myanmar, which is one of the developing countries according to the United Nations to understand university students’ health information-seeking behaviours on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings suggest that social media plays a vital role to spread reliable and accurate information during the pandemic. The role of governments and authorities is also important to effectively use social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) to reach out to the public so that they can spread timely and accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, users need to assess and verify the credibility of information related to pandemics on social media when they seek health-related information. This study suggests opportunities for further research in health information seeking on social media.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)"

Uremic toxin-removing effectiveness between HD + MCO and mixed-dilution olHDF, one of the currently most efficient olHDF modalities, has not been assessed. Method: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 14 prevalent thrice-a-week HD patients with blood flow rate above 400 mL/min. The patients were randomized into two sequences of 2-week treatment periods of HD + MCO and later mixed-dilution olHDF or vice versa. The reduction ratio (RR) values of small-molecule as well as middle-molecule uremic toxins and protein-bound uremic toxins were measured at baseline and at the end of the treatment. Results: When compared with mixed-dilution olHDF, HD + MCO provided slightly lower β2M RR, but the value was still higher than 75%; showed similar κFLC RR, IS RR, and URR; and yielded significantly higher RR values of α1M (p < 0.001) and λFLC (p < 0.001). Despite higher albumin loss in HD + MCO, the serum albumin levels at the end of the study were comparable between both groups. Conclusion: Expanded HD (HD + MCO) provided similar effectiveness in removing various uremic toxins and could exhibit greater removal of large middle-molecule uremic toxins, such as α1M and λFLC. Expanded HD can be used as an effective alternative option for mixed-dilution olHDF.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"

Recently, a distinctive soft tissue tumor with a PLAG1 fusion has been reported in the pediatric age group. These are low grade tumors with a fibroblastic or mixed fibroblastic and myxoid morphology but no other lines of differentiation. They are typically immunopositive for desmin and CD34. The partner genes for these tumors have included YWHAZ, EEF1A1, ZFHX4l, CHCHD7, and PCMTD1. We report another case of this fibromyxoid tumor with a PLAG1 fusion, this time with COL3A1 as the partner gene. The fusion placed expression of a full-length PLAG1 protein under the control of the constitutively active COL3A1 promoter. Overexpression of PLAG1 was confirmed by diffusely positive immunostaining for PLAG1. The most novel aspect of this tumor is the intracranial location. Opinion has been divided over whether these tumors are a specific entity, or related to lipoblastoma, since that tumor also typically occurs in soft tissue in the pediatric age group and shows many of the same gene fusions. However, lipoblastoma has never been reported in an intracranial location and, thus, our case provides compelling evidence that this fibromyxoid tumor is indeed a distinct entity.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Neurology (clinical)"

Transcriptome profiling reveals the novel immunometabolism-related genes against WSSV infection from Fenneropenaeus merguiensis,"Jaree P., Boonchuen P., Thawonsuwan J., Kondo H., Hirono I., Somboonwiwat K.",2022-01-01,"Animals, DNA Virus Infections, Gene Expression Profiling, Hemocytes, Penaeidae, RNA-Seq, Transcriptome, White spot syndrome virus 1, Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, Glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, Immunometabolism-related genes, Transcriptome profiling, White spot syndrome virus","The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been considered a serious threat to shrimp aquaculture. Besides, the activation of cell metabolism as an immune reaction to the virus is now recognized as a piece of the pivotal puzzle of the antiviral responses. Hence, this study explores the relationship between metabolic gene expression and antiviral responses in shrimp using transcriptome analysis. The RNA-seq libraries of Fenneropenaeus merguensis hemocytes after WSSV challenge at early (6 hpi) and late (24 hpi) stages of infection were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that the WSSV subverted the expression. One-hundred-thirty-three DEGs that were expressed in response to WSSV infection at both stages were identified. Based on the GO annotation, they were related to innate immunity and metabolic pathway. The expression correlation between “full term” (NGS) and qRT-PCR of 16 representative DEGs is shown. Noticeably, the expression profiles of all the selected metabolic genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism showed a specific correlation between NGS and qRT-PCR upon WSSV infection. Of these, we further characterized the function related to the WSSV response of glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (FmGFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which was found to be up-regulated at the late stage of WSSV infection. Suppression of FmGFAT by RNA interference resulted in postponing the death of WSSV-infected shrimp and reduction of viral copy number. These results suggested that the FmGFAT is linked between metabolic change and WSSV responses in shrimp, where the virus-induced metabolic rewiring hijack biological compounds and/or energy sources to benefit the viral replication process.","environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

This study aims to investigate the effect of electrolyte-containing ions from human plasma and annealing temperature on structural, morphological, and mechanical parameters of TiO2NTs films, targeting its potential biomedical applications. Bio-inspired TiO2NTs were grown from Ticp and its Ti6Al4V alloy by potentiostatic anodization in the recently developed SBF-based electrolyte, maintained at 10 C and 40 C. The thermal investigation was performed by TGA/DSC and used to define the phase transition temperatures used for annealing (450 C and 650 C). Morphological and structural parameters were evaluated by FE-SEM, XRD, contact angle measurements, and nanoindentation. Results show that self-organized as-formed TiO2NTs were grown under all synthesis conditions with different wettability profiles for each substrate group. At 450 C annealing temperature, the beginning of nanostructures collapse starts, becoming evident at 650 C. The nanoindentation characterization reveals that both electrolyte and thermal annealing exhibited low effects on the hardness and Young's modulus. The tailoring of specific properties by different synthesis conditions could allow the individualization of treatments and better performance in vivo.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Improvement of Fusel Alcohol Production by Engineering of the Yeast Branched-Chain Amino Acid Aminotransaminase,"Koonthongkaew J., Ploysongsri N., Toyokawa Y., Ruangpornvisuti V., Takagi H.",2022-07-01,"Bat1, Bat2, Branched chain amino acids, Branched-chain amino acid aminotransaminase, Branched-chain high alcohol, Computational analysis, Higher alcohols, In silico computational analyse, In-silico, Amino Acids, Branched-Chain, Ethanol, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Transaminases, Bat1, Bat2, branched-chain amino acid, branched-chain amino acid aminotransaminase, branched-chain higher alcohol, in silico computational analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast","Branched-chain higher alcohols (BCHAs), or fusel alcohols, including isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, and active amyl alcohol, are useful compounds in several industries. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can synthesize these compounds via the metabolic pathways of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Branched-chain amino acid aminotransaminases (BCATs) are the key enzymes for BCHA production via the Ehrlich pathway of BCAAs. BCATs catalyze a bidirectional transamination reaction between branched-chain a-keto acids (BCKAs) and BCAAs. In S. cerevisiae, there are two BCAT isoforms, Bat1 and Bat2, which are encoded by the genes BAT1 and BAT2. Although many studies have shown the effects of deletion or overexpression of BAT1 and BAT2 on BCHA production, there have been no reports on the enhancement of BCHA production by functional variants of BCATs. Here, to improve BCHA productivity, we designed variants of Bat1 and Bat2 with altered enzyme activity by using in silico computational analysis: the Gly333Ser and Gly333Trp Bat1 and corresponding Gly316Ser and Gly316Trp Bat2 variants, respectively. When expressed in S. cerevisiae cells, most of these variants caused a growth defect in minimal medium. Interestingly, the Gly333Trp Bat1 and Gly316Ser Bat2 variants achieved 18.7-fold and 17.4-fold increases in isobutanol above that for the wild-type enzyme, respectively. The enzyme assay revealed that the catalytic activities of all four BCAT variants were lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Our results indicate that the decreased BCAT activity enhanced BCHA production by reducing BCAA biosynthesis, which occurs via a pathway that directly competes with BCHA production. IMPORTANCE Recently, several studies have attempted to increase the production of branched-chain higher alcohols (BCHAs) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The key enzymes for BCHA biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae are the branched-chain amino acid aminotransaminases (BCATs) Bat1 and Bat2. Deletion or overexpression of the genes encoding BCATs has an impact on the production of BCHAs; however, amino acid substitution variants of Bat1 and Bat2 that could affect enzymatic properties—and ultimately BCHA productivity—have not been fully studied. By using in silico analysis, we designed variants of Bat1 and Bat2 and expressed them in yeast cells. We found that the engineered BCATs decreased catalytic activities and increased BCHA production. Our approach provides new insight into the functions of BCATs and will be useful in the future construction of enzymes optimized for high-level production of BCHAs.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciencesculture, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental, Immunology","Biotechnology, Food Science, Ecology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Periarticular Injection of Ketorolac Augmenting Intravenous Administration of Ketorolac for Postoperative Pain Control: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Simultaneous Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Laoruengthana A., Rattanaprichavej P., Mahatthanatrakul A., Tantimethanon T., Lohitnavy M., Pongpirul K.",2022-07-01,"Administration, Intravenous, Analgesics, Analgesics, Opioid, Anesthetics, Local, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bupivacaine, Humans, Injections, Intra-Articular, Ketorolac, Pain, Postoperative, analgesic ceiling, ketorolac, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, periarticular injection, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty","Adequate postoperative pain control with minimal side effects is necessary for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Ketorolac is a frequently used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug due to its excellent disposition in all administration routes; however, it possesses an analgesic ceiling, which means that higher doses of the drug have no additional analgesic effect. Alternatively, increasing the local concentration of ketorolac via periarticular injection may provide additional pain relief to parenteral administration of ketorolac, but evidence demonstrating the benefits and safety of this approach is limited. Therefore, this study assesses whether local ketorolac injection could yield additional pain reduction to intravenous administration of ketorolac. A total of 54 patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA were enrolled. Randomization was performed to determine whether 50 mg of bupivacaine plus 30 mg of ketorolac (ketorolac group), or only 50 mg bupivacaine (bupivacaine group) would be periarticularly injected into the first knee operated on (more painful), and then the contralateral knee would receive another mixture. Ketorolac (30 mg) was intravenously given every 8 hours for the first 48 hours. Visual analog scales (VASs) were used to assess pain, knee recovery function, and patients' preferred knee. Postoperative VAS pain scores in the ketorolac group were lower than those in the bupivacaine group 6 to 96 hours postoperatively and reached statistical significance 12 (4.25 ± 2.38 vs. 5.06 ± 2.48, respectively; p = 0.04) and 24 hours (4.22 ± 1.94 vs. 5.30 ± 2.12, respectively; p < 0.01) postoperatively. The ketorolac group had higher degrees of knee flexion and straight leg raise. No patient experienced adverse effects of ketorolac. On the day of discharge, 61.11% of the patients favored the knee that received local ketorolac injection (p < 0.01).

Failure was defined as IOP ≤5 or ≥21 mm Hg for 2 consecutive visits, or when an additional glaucoma surgery was required to control IOP. Survival curves were analyzed using multilevel mixed-effect Weibull model. Results: A total of 81 eyes from 55 PCG patients were included. Surgical procedures involved 20 goniotomies, 15 trabeculotomies, 16 trabeculectomies, 15 CTT, and 15 TSCPC. Median follow-up time was 24 months (interquartile range: 9 to 60 mo). Overall success rates were 68.8% at 1 year, 63.8% at 3 years, and 53.7% at 5 years. All types of surgery except TSCPC had comparable cumulative 1 year success rates ranging from 78.5% to 83.3%. Cumulative success rates of trabeculotomy (80.05%) and CTT (79.4%) were maintained at 3 and 5 years and were the highest among all procedures at 5 years. TSCPC had a significantly lower success rate compared with other types of surgery (hazard ratio: 7.4 to 13.1, all P=0.01). All patients receiving primary TSCPC showed no success at 48 months. Conclusion: Primary trabeculotomy and primary CTT demonstrated the highest long-term success rates in PCG patients.",medical,Ophthalmology

Hence, tumor position, tumor area, and tumor categories evaluation are also mandatory concerns for the proper medication. This paper presents a new intelligent system for diagnosing the human brain tumors using 60 magnetic resonance images (MRI) with contrast. The proposed methods have five distinct modules including pre-processing, performance elements, critic, learning element, and classification. In the pre-processing, the quality of MR images are enhanced and the noises are removed from it. In the performance elements, the images are segmented with K-mean algorithm and the feathers are extracted from the images with the help of gray level co-occurrence matrix. Next, the data is manipulated in critical part with roles and it is transfered to the learning element part. Then, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) is used to identify the exact location of tumors. Finally, the four types of tumors, astrocytoma, meningiomas, metastatic and glioblastoma will be classified by the K-mean type-2 fuzzy neural. The obtained results indidate that the proposed method has greater values of Sensitivity, Precision, F-measure, Accuracy, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) compare to other relevant methods.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Media Technology, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Networks and Communications"

Data analysis, Wide-field, Gamma rays: general, Methods: data analysis","Context. Ground-based γ-ray astronomy is still a rather young field of research, with strong historical connections to particle physics. This is why most observations are conducted by experiments with proprietary data and analysis software, as is usual in the particle physics field. However, in recent years, this paradigm has been slowly shifting toward the development and use of open-source data formats and tools, driven by upcoming observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this context, a community-driven, shared data format (the gamma-Astro-data-format, or GADF) and analysis tools such as Gammapy and ctools have been developed. So far, these efforts have been led by the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope community, leaving out other types of ground-based γ-ray instruments. Aims. We aim to show that the data from ground particle arrays, such as the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, are also compatible with the GADF and can thus be fully analyzed using the related tools, in this case, Gammapy. Methods. We reproduced several published HAWC results using Gammapy and data products compliant with GADF standard. We also illustrate the capabilities of the shared format and tools by producing a joint fit of the Crab spectrum including data from six different γ-ray experiments. Results. We find excellent agreement with the reference results, a powerful confirmation of both the published results and the tools involved. Conclusions. The data from particle detector arrays such as the HAWC observatory can be adapted to the GADF and thus analyzed with Gammapy. A common data format and shared analysis tools allow multi-instrument joint analysis and effective data sharing. To emphasize this, a sample of Crab nebula event lists is made public with this paper. Because of the complementary nature of pointing and wide-field instruments, this synergy will be distinctly beneficial for the joint scientific exploitation of future observatories such as the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory and CTA.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Acetic acid, a dominant VFA, was supplemented weekly (0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/L) in a chicken manure-based bioponic system, and its effect on the performance of bioponics (e.g., plant yield and nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities) was examined. Microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the functional gene abundances were predicted using PICRUSt. Although acetic acid negatively affected plant yield, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was noted in the average nitrogen or phosphorus concentration. In terms of nutrient recovery, the bioponic systems still functioned well, although higher concentrations of acetic acid decreased plant yield and altered the bacterial communities in plant roots and chicken manure sediments. These data suggest that an acetic acid concentration of < 500 mg/L or a longer loading interval is recommended for the effective operation of chicken manure and digestate-based bioponics.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal
Emergy investigation of carbon dioxide utilization processes for methanol synthesis,"Nimmanterdwong P., Piumsomboon P., Chalermsinsuwan B.",2022-08-01,"Biomass to methanol, Carbon dioxide to methanol, Carbon dioxide utilization, Carbon emissions, Emergy analysis, Methanol production, Methanol synthesis, Sustainable solution, Transformity, Water electrolysis, Biomass to methanol, Carbon dioxide to methanol, Carbon dioxide utilization, Emergy analysis, Methanol production","CO2 to methanol (C2M) technology has been a promising sustainable solution with negative carbon emissions. A suitable indicator is needed to ensure that it demonstrates the progress in moving toward a zero-net emission. This study proposed an emergy analysis of three alternative methanol productions from captured CO2. These are methanol from direct hydrogenation with hydrogen from natural gas reforming (Case 1), methanol from direct hydrogenation with hydrogen from water electrolysis (Case 2), and methanol from CO2/NG/steam-mixed reforming (Case 3). The highest emergy consumption per joule methanol (with a transformity of 2.93 ×105 sej/J) was Case 2. According to emergy distribution, the emergy input that dominates each case study includes; natural gas (as raw material and fuels) in Case 1 and Case 3 and electricity for water electrolysis in Case 2. When comparing transformity with conventional methanol production from fossil fuel, the CO2 to methanol processes could compete with the traditional one. Moreover, with the implementation of renewable electrical sources (wind power), the transformity of Case 2 could be reduced to 4.95 × 104 sej/J and became lower than the methanol production from biomass (7.87 ×104 sej/J). This improvement leads Case 2 to be the preferable choice for methanol production.","power genergyation and power plants, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The effects of seasonal and meteorological conditions on MPs are not well understood. This study demonstrates the impacts of seasonality on the fate and transport, and the efficacy of MPs removal by a wastewater treatment plant. The fate and transport of MPs at a WWTP in Nonthaburi, Thailand were tracked during the dry and wet seasons of 2019–2020. Polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and toothpaste formulations were the most abundant MP types observed. Total detected MP quantities ranged between 76 and 192 particles L−1 during the dry season, and only 36–68 particles L−1 during the wet season, indicating runoff dilution effects. T-test analysis found a statistically significant difference between MP concentrations between the dry and wet seasons of 2019–2020. Spearman's correlation showed statistically strong negative relationships between MP concentrations versus wastewater flow, and MP concentrations versus precipitation; a positive correlation between MP abundance versus temperature in the treatment system was observed. During the dry seasons, MPs were mostly found in the aeration process, and were mostly rayon or polyester particles in the shape of fibers. Contrarily, in the wet seasons, MPs were detected in both the raw influent and aeration process, with PE, polyacrylate, and polyethylene terephthalate fragments dominating the make-up. MPs were also detected in the return activated sludge, thus calling for proper sludge age and drainage management. No MPs were detected in the plant's effluent during the wet season, suggesting that the plant had sufficient MPs removal capability during normal wet-season conditions. Overall, this study suggests that municipalities should focus on increasing MPs removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants for dry seasons, while properly managing the water flows of combined sewage systems to prevent overflows that may inevitably become point-sources of MPs release into water bodies during wet seasons.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Lignin is a renewable source of phenolic precursors for fuels and chemicals. Hydrogenolysis of lignin cleaves the abundant β-O-4 bonds and releases phenolics. However, selective hydrogenolysis of lignin's β-O-4 bonds is challenging because it requires high-pressure H2. Here we show efficient hydrogenolysis of lignin model compounds and technical lignin by Ru/C catalyst and internal hydrogen. The aliphatic hydroxyl groups (Cα−OH) in lignin enabled Ru-catalyzed dehydrogenation of internal hydrogen and the formation of reactive keto intermediate, which facilitated the β-O-4 cleavage into phenolic monomers. Furthermore, solvents that had a high donor number (Lewis basicity) enhanced the yield of phenolic monomers, equal to 27.9 wt.% from technical lignin. These findings offer a novel approach for biorefineries to design lignin isolation processes and/or solvent systems to maximize phenolic monomers and to control product selectivity/stability.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Methods: Using a retrospective double-cohort study design, we enrolled stage I-III PO/OPC patients treated in two German medical centers during a 4-year interval. The predictor variable was surgical technique (LS-MSA/TOA), and main outcomes were complete resection with R0 margins (CR-R0), 5-year overall survival and recurrence (OS5; R5), and adverse events (AEs). Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed with α = 95%. Benefit-risk profiles were investigated using number needed to treat (NNT), to harm (NNH), and likelihood to be helped or harmed (LLH). Results: At 5-year follow-ups of 202 subjects, LS-MSA caused significantly better CR-R0 (P = 0.001; NNT: 4) and fewer R5 (P = 0.003; NNT: 5), but more risks of wound dehiscence ([WD]; P = 0.01; NNH = 8), and orocutaneous fistula ([OCF]; P = 0.01; NNH: 10). LLH calculations demonstrated that LS-MSA was 2 and 1.6 times more likely to result in CR-R0 and fewer R5 than an incident of WD. There was no significant difference in OS5, postoperative infections (within 30 postoperative days) and AE domains according to the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire version 4 (UW-QoLv4) between the surgical approach groups. Conclusions: Compared to TOA, LS-MSA is an efficacious and tolerable intervention for inspecting and eradicating stage I-III PO/OPCs, and reducing recurrences at 5-year follow-ups.

This study investigated the applicability of an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (AMBBR) to treating high-salinity wastewater. The removal performance and microbial community were examined under salinity conditions of 1000–3000 mg/L, and a soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) removal efficiency of up to 8% ± 2.74% was achieved at high-salinity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that microorganisms successfully attached onto the polyvinyl alcohol gel carrier, and the extracellular polymeric substances on the biofilm increased at higher salt concentrations. The AMBBR also maintained traditionally accepted levels of total alkalinity and volatile fatty acids for stable wastewater processing under these operating conditions. High-throughput sequencing indicated that Desulfomicrobium and three methanogenic groups were the dominant contributors to sCOD removal. Overall, the results showed that the AMBBR can successfully treat fish factory wastewater under varying salinity conditions.","geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

In this context, food literacy is defined as food skills and abilities to plan, select, and prepare to achieve adequate consumption under new or adverse social and culinary contexts of the migrant experience. In this paper, we consider both how nutritional precarity arises in the migrant experience, and to what extent food literacy can mitigate it under various conditions. The research approach involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches that were adjusted to address the limited mobility for social science research during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Data collection was conducted through hybrid (online and in-person) ethnography, focus group discussions, food literacy questionnaires, and key informant interviews, often facilitated through internet messaging clients. The findings indicate that, while generally high food literacy may facilitate the transition to the foreign food systems found in migration destinations, optimizing nutrition and well-being requires reinforcement by context-specific food literacy, such as openness to foreign flavors and recipes. Contextual food literacy most directly leads to positive social and health outcomes while simultaneously expanding universal food literacy in the long-term.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

However, existing portable solar systems rely on single storage with high risk of suspension in emergency and prolonged cloudy period. This work presents a portable solar-dual storage system, which enables essential loads to function continuously regardless of weather. The system operates with a supercapacitor to buffer fluctuating solar power in the Direct mode, a battery-supercapacitor integration to enable extended low light load usage in the Off-grid mode, and a developed mode selector controller for overall energy management. Optimum size of the supercapacitor was determined to buffer the load and quickly recharge within the average low light period of 5–12 min. The simulated solar irradiance from 400-1000 W/m2 was utilized to verify automatic selection between two independent modes: direct and off-grid. Furthermore, outdoor behavior of the system has been investigated on a representative sunny, cloudy, and mixed day. Moreover, different combinations of DC and AC loads including an 80 W notebook with a power larger than the solar panel (20 W) have been demonstrated to function steadily for a few hours outdoor. This system's signatures include manual mode selection possibility by users and automatic switching ability to a direct mode for when the battery is completely discharged or malfunction for continuous operation of the loads. This portable solar-powered system can be used in variety of scenarios and provides clean solar energy to essential electrical appliances for lighting, communication etc., thus increasing the chance of survival during emergency.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy, Materials Science","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all)"

Similarly, in Europe, initially, the two types of CFR peaked at 9.0% and 10.0%, respectively. The random-model results showed an increase near 5.0%. In high-income countries, pooled estimates and fixed-model showed gradually increasing trends with a final pooled estimates and random-model reached about 8.0% and 4.0%, respectively. In middle-income, the pooled estimates and fixed-model have gradually increased reaching up to 4.5%. in low-income countries, CFRs remained similar between 1.5% and 3.0%. Our study emphasizes that COVID-19 CFR is not a fixed or static value. Rather, it is a dynamic estimate that changes with time, population, socioeconomic factors, and the mitigatory efforts of individual countries.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"
Inflammatory Modulation of miR-155 Inhibits Doxorubicin-Induced Testicular Dysfunction via SIRT1/FOXO1 Pathway: Insight into the Role of Acacetin and Bacillus cereus Protease,"Anwar H.M., Hamad S.R., Salem G.E.M., Soliman R.H.M., Elbaz E.M.",2022-11-01,"Acacetin, Bacillus cereus protease, Chemotherapeutic agents, Doxorubicin, Four-group, FOXO1, Male infertility, Mir-155, Sirtuin1, Wistar rat, Animals, Antibiotics, Antineoplastic, Antioxidants, Apoptosis, Bacillus cereus, Doxorubicin, Flavones, Male, MicroRNAs, Oxidative Stress, Peptide Hydrolases, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Sirtuin 1, Testis, Testosterone, Acacetin, Bacillus cereus protease, Doxorubicin, FOXO1, miR-155, SIRT1","Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that can disrupt testicular function leading to male infertility. This study examined the protective role of natural flavone, acacetin (ACA), and a protease of Bacillus cereus bacteria (B. cereus) as well as the potential role of miR-155/SIRT1/FOXO1 network in DOX-induced testicular injury. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups and treated as follows: Control, DOX (1 mg/kg, i.p) every other day for 21 days with a total dose equal to 10 mg/kg throughout the experiment, and pre-treated groups that received ACA (5 mg/kg/day, p.o) or B. cereus protease (36 mg/kg/day, p.o) for a week prior to DOX administration. DOX challenge reduced the testis weight coefficient, serum testosterone, and testicular 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). DOX caused a significant increase in testicular oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers. Aberrant testicular miR-34c, a germ-specific miRNA, and miR-155 expressions were observed, along with decreased protein expression of sirtuin1 (SIRT1) dependent forkhead box 1 (FOXO1) acetylation which induces apoptosis. Besides, abnormal histopathological architecture and a marked reduction in the testicular expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were observed. ACA or protease administration significantly improved the histopathological and immunohistochemical pictures compared with DOX alone and renovated testicular functions. Interestingly, treatment with protease was more significant than treatment with ACA in ameliorating DOX-induced testicular injury. Taken together, this study reveals the prophylactic role of these two regimens on male fertility by exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects against DOX-elicited testicular damage, possibly via modulating miR-155/SIRT1/FOXO1 network.

A comparison of artificial intelligence versus radiologists in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules using ultrasonography: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Potipimpanon P., Charakorn N., Hirunwiwatkul P.",2022-11-01,"Artificial Intelligence, Humans, Radiologists, Sensitivity and Specificity, Thyroid Nodule, Ultrasonography, Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Neural network, Thyroid nodule, Ultrasonography","Background: Thyroid nodules are common. Ultrasonography (US) is the first investigation for thyroid nodules. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely integrated into medical diagnosis to provide additional information. The primary objective of this study was to accumulate the pooled sensitivity and specificity between all available AI and radiologists using thyroid US imaging. The secondary objective was to compare AI’s diagnostic performance to that of radiologists. Materials and methods: A systematic review meta-analysis. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library data were searched for studies from inception until June 11, 2020. Results: Twenty five studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI were 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.91) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.73–0.83), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of radiologists were 0.85 (95% CI 0.80–0.89) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.77–0.86), respectively. The accuracy of AI and radiologists is equivalent in terms of AUC [AI 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.92), radiologist 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.93)]. The diagnostic odd ratio (DOR) between AI 23.10 (95% CI 14.20–37.58) and radiologists 27.12 (95% CI 17.45–42.16) had no statistically significant difference (P = 0.56). Meta-regression analysis revealed that Deep Learning AI had significantly greater sensitivity and specificity than classic machine learning AI (P < 0.001). Conclusion: AI demonstrated comparable performance to radiologists in diagnosing benign and malignant thyroid nodules using ultrasonography. Additional research to establish its equivalency should be conducted.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology

We aimed to examine the prevalence of abnormal esophageal motor patterns in health, and to determine optimal thresholds for software metrics across HRM systems. Design: Manometry studies from asymptomatic adults were solicited from motility centers worldwide, and were manually analyzed using integrated relaxation pressure (IRP), distal latency (DL), and distal contractile integral (DCI) in standardized fashion. Normative thresholds were assessed using fifth and/or 95th percentile values. Chicago Classification v3.0 criteria were applied to determine motor patterns across HRM systems, study positions (upright vs supine), ages, and genders. Results: Of 469 unique HRM studies (median age 28.0, range 18–79 years). 74.6% had a normal HRM pattern; none had achalasia. Ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) was the most frequent motor pattern identified (15.1% overall), followed by EGJ outflow obstruction (5.3%). Proportions with IEM were lower using stringent criteria (10.0%), especially in supine studies (7.1%–8.5%). Other motor patterns were rare (0.2%–4.1% overall) and did not vary by age or gender. DL thresholds were close to current norms across HRM systems, while IRP thresholds varied by HRM system and study position. Both fifth and 95th percentile DCI values were lower than current thresholds, both in upright and supine positions. Conclusions: Motor abnormalities are infrequent in healthy individuals and consist mainly of IEM, proportions of which are lower when using stringent criteria in the supine position. Thresholds for HRM metrics vary by HRM system and study position.","gastroenterology, medical","Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

Over 80% of the initial free enzyme activity was detected on the bound enzyme. The immobilized β-xylosidase (204.7 ± 6.5 U g-1 of perlite) exhibited transxylosylation activity when sugars from black liquor xylan hydrolysate and a variety of alcohols (C1-6) were used as donor and acceptor molecules, respectively, yielding a number of alkyl xylosides. The synthesized hexyl xyloside exhibited some interesting properties comparable with those of a commercial hexyl glucoside, including an antioxidant activity (IC50 = 8.9 ± 2.0 mg mL-1), wetting time (43 s), and critical micelle concentration value (252 mmol L-1). Optimization for hexyl xyloside synthesis was performed via statistical analysis using a Box and Behnken design. The maximum predicted yield of hexyl xyloside (499.0 ± 1.1 mg g-1 xylan hydrolysate) was obtained with 10% (w/v) xylan hydrolysate, 10 U g-1 immobilized β-xylosidase, and 13% (v/v) hexanol at 70 °C, pH 6.0 for 4 h, and it was validated by the following experimental yield (498.9 ± 4.8 mg g-1 xylan hydrolysate). The maximum production yield remained relatively stable after the immobilized enzyme was reused for 12 cycles with a 471.5 ± 15.1 mg g-1 hexyl xyloside yield (94.4% of the first cycle). Thus, the immobilized β-xylosidase has a high potential as a robust catalyst for application in alkyl xyloside production.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

These two tools have been translated into many languages. The aims were to translate PISQ-IR and PFDI-20 into Thai and to assess their validity and test/re-test reliability. Methods: Two hundred Thai women with PFD were recruited from an outpatient gynecologic clinic at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during June–December, 2017. All women completed the Thai version of PISQ-IR and PFDI-20 twice at an interval of 2 weeks and completed the Thai version of FSFI and P-QOL questionnaires at first visit for analysis of criterion validity. Results: For PISQ-IR, the internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) ranged from 0.49 to 0.95 in the non-sexually active (NSA) group and 0.63 to 0.89 in the sexually active (SA) group. The test-retest reliability [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCr)] of all subscales ranged from 0.79–0.96 in the NSA group and 0.92–0.96 in the SA group. For total PFDI-20 score, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.93 and ICCr 0.83. The criterion validity (correlations of PISQ-IR subscales to FSFI) ranged from low to high correlation (r = 0.10–0.64) while the correlations of PISQ-IR subscales to PFDI-20 scores ranged from low to moderate correlation (r = 0.20–0.36). Conclusions: The Thai versions of the PISQ-IR and PFDI-20 proved to have good internal consistency with strong reliability.

In addition, its effect on human periodontal ligament cell (hPDLC) mineralization was assessed in vitro. Methods: First molars of 8-week-old Wistar rats were extracted. In 1 group, the root surfaces were treated with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and the other group's root surfaces were treated with 10−6 mol/L iloprost before replantation. At day 30, maxillae were prepared for micro–computed tomographic imaging and histomorphometric analysis. The effect of iloprost on mineralization by hPDLCs was analyzed by mineralized nodule formation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction at 7 and 14 days. Results: Micro–computed tomographic imaging demonstrated a significant higher bone volume in the iloprost groups, whereas the HBSS groups had extensive bone and root resorption. Histologic analysis revealed deposition of a thick AC layer along the root in the iloprost group with well-organized periodontal ligament fibers inserted into the cementum. The HBSS group demonstrated more osteoclasts than the iloprost group. In vitro, iloprost-treated hPDLCs had a significantly increased RUNX2, OSX, BSP, and ALP gene expression that coincided with an increased deposition of mineralized nodules. These effects were abrogated by a PGI2 receptor inhibitor. Conclusions: Our results revealed that iloprost promoted PDL regeneration in replanted molars. Furthermore, resorption of the roots was decreased, whereas AC deposition was stimulated. Iloprost-treatment increased hPDLC mineralization and was mediated by PGI2 receptor activation. These observations indicate that iloprost may be a promising root surface treatment agent.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Growing evidence indicates that it results from dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, which interferes with the host immune system, leading to bone destruction. Immune cells activate periodontal ligament cells to express the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) and promote osteoclast activity. Osteocytes have active roles in periodontitis progression in the bone matrix. Local proteins are involved in bone regeneration through functional immuno-logical plasticity. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms in periodontitis, the roles of local proteins, and promising synthetic compounds generating a periodontal regeneration effect. It is anticipated that this may lead to a better perception of periodontitis pathophysiology.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

However, its role in the framework set by the scaling relations in galaxy evolution remains to be understood. In this work we follow up on the galaxy sample from the GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, an ALMA blind survey at 1.1 mm covering a continuous area of 72.42 arcmin2 using two array configurations. We derived physical properties, such as star formation rates, gas fractions, depletion timescales, and dust temperatures for the galaxy sample built from the survey. There exists a subset of galaxies that exhibit starburst-like short depletion timescales, but they are located within the scatter of the so-called main sequence of SFGs. These are dubbed starbursts in the main sequence and display the most compact star formation and they are characterized by the shortest depletion timescales, lowest gas fractions, and highest dust temperatures of the galaxy sample, compared to typical SFGs at the same stellar mass and redshift. They are also very massive, accounting for ∼60% of the most massive galaxies in the sample (log(M∗/M· ) > 11.0). We find trends between the areas of the ongoing star formation regions and the derived physical properties for the sample, unveiling the role of compact star formation as a physical driver of these properties. Starbursts in the main sequence appear to be the extreme cases of these trends. We discuss possible scenarios of galaxy evolution to explain the results drawn from our galaxy sample. Our findings suggest that the star formation rate is sustained in SFGs by gas and star formation compression, keeping them within the main sequence even when their gas fractions are low and they are presumably on the way to quiescence.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

This study aimed to perform clinical PGT-M in a family with a history of MFS1 for two generations. A family with two members affected by MFS1 approached the hospital for PGT-M. The couple decided to join the project following extensive counselling and informed consent was obtained. The mutation contributory to MFS1 was identified using whole-exome sequencing (WES). A novel PGT-M protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and tested. Ten blastocysts were subjected to PGT-M in two clinical PGT cycles. Mini-sequencing revealed four normal and six affected embryos. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis confirmed mutation analysis results in all samples. The embryos diagnosed as normal (non-MFS1) were chosen for transfer. A pregnancy was obtained in the third embryo transfer. Invasive prenatal diagnosis confirmed the normal genotype of the baby. This study demonstrated comprehensive management using the application of clinical-based diagnosis, WES for mutation identification within the MFS1 gene, mini-sequencing for embryo selection and microsatellite-based linkage analysis for backup of PGT-M results and contamination detection to assist couples in having a healthy child when there was a family history of Marfan syndrome.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Marfan syndrome (MFS1, OMIM#154700) is an autosomal dominant condition causing aortopathy including fatal aortic dissection. Pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) is an alternative to traditional invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) giving the couples the chance of starting pregnancy with the confidence that the baby will be unaffected. Most of the previous PGT reports employed microsatellite-based linkage analysis. A few PGT studies used sequencing, mini-sequencing and mutation analysis; however, the details of the techniques were not described. What do the results of this study add? Single-cell PCR protocol using multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing was developed and validated. Two clinical PGTs cycles for Marfan syndrome were performed. A healthy baby was resulted. The details of multiplex fluorescent PCR and mini-sequencing protocols are described in this study so that the procedures can be reproduced. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Embryo selection can help the family suffering from Marfan syndrome for two generations to start a pregnancy with confidence that their child will be unaffected. This study also shows the use of a mini-sequencing protocol for PGT, which can be a universal protocol for other mutations by changing the PCR primers and mini-sequencing primers.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology
Effect of Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Attention and Working Memory in Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review,"Aniwattanapong D., List J.J., Ramakrishnan N., Bhatti G.S., Jorge R.",2022-04-01,"Attention, Cognition, Epilepsy, Humans, Memory, Short-Term, Treatment Outcome, Vagus Nerve, Vagus Nerve Stimulation, Attention, epilepsy, mood disorders, vagus nerve stimulation, working memory","Background: It has been suggested that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may enhance attention and working memory. The neuromodulator effects of VNS are thought to activate the release of neurotransmitters involving cognition and to promote neuronal plasticity. Therefore, VNS has been studied for its effects on attention and working memory impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effects of VNS on attention and working memory among patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, examine stimulation parameters, provide mechanistic hypotheses, and propose future studies using VNS. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review using electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane library, and PsycINFO (Ovid). Narrative analysis was used to describe the therapeutic effects of VNS on attention and working memory, describe stimulation parameters, and propose explanatory mechanisms. Results: We identified 20 studies reporting VNS effects on attention and working memory in patients with epilepsy or mood disorders. For epilepsy, there was one randomized controlled trial from all 18 studies. It demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the cognitive tasks between active and control VNS. From a within-subject experimental design, significant improvement of working memory after VNS was demonstrated. One of three nonrandomized controlled trials found significantly improved attentional performance after VNS. The cohort studies compared VNS and surgery and found attentional improvement in both groups. Nine of 12 pretest-posttest studies showed improvement of attention or working memory after VNS. For mood disorders, although one study showed significant improvement of attention following VNS, the other did not. Conclusions: This review suggests that, although we identified some positive results from eligible studies, there is insufficient good-quality evidence to establish VNS as an effective intervention to enhance attention and working memory in persons with neuropsychiatric disorders. Further studies assessing the efficacy of such intervention are needed.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

Data from the Stern-Volmer's plots at various temperatures, zetasizers, NMR, and UV–Vis spectroscopy indicate a plausible mechanism involving the formation of a non-emissive Au(III) complex. An application of JR-01 as Au(III) sensor in real water samples reveals a good sensing efficiency which is comparable to the analysis result from ICP-QMS. In addition, when an excess amount of L-cysteine is added to the JR-01/Au(III) mixture, the fluorescence signal is restored and the 1H NMR data suggests that JR-01 remains intact. As an extension of this study, we successfully demonstrate the detection of L-cysteine by fluorescence turn-on process using the JR-01/Au(III) mixture with a detection limit of 14.0 μM.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

The microcantilevers (3 mm ×2 mm ×0.1 mm) based on a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) beam sandwiched by thin gold (Au) electrodes were fabricated by screen-printing. Mesocellular foam silica (MCF-Si) was synthesized and used as the sensitive material due to its high specific surface area and pore volume. This material was functionalized by hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to enhance hydrophobicity. By a small deposition of HMDS-MCF-Si, the obtained devices demonstrated longitudinal vibration mode with the quality factor of approximately 200 at ambient temperatures. Responsiveness of the microcantilever coated with HMDS-MCF-Si to each solvent vapor at room temperature was compared. The largest response was obtained from exposure to toluene vapor with the sensitivity of 0.85 ppm/ppmV (218 mHz/ppmV) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 28 ppmV. The sensitivity dropped by almost six times when exposed to the higher polar vapor of ethanol. Very low response to water vapor (0.05 ppm/ppmV) confirmed the hydrophobic behavior of HMDS-MCF-Si. Detectable performances under different vapors of our device can be utilized as a guide for developing sensitive materials and resonant microcantilever-based vapor sensors.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

DBTH undergoes a color change from colorless to brown after reaction with CN− because of a strong blue shift in the absorption peak at 353 nm. The interaction between blue-fluorescent DBTH and CN− results in a significant decrease in fluorescence. The nucleophilic addition of CN− is the cause of the optical response of DBTH to CN−. The hypothesized mechanism was supported by 1H NMR titrations, mass spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. The detection limit of the probe is (colorimetrically 8.4 nM and fluorometrically 8.9 nM), which is less than the threshold of 1.9 μM set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for CN− ions in an aqueous solution. DBTH coated test kits were developed for on-site detection of cyanide ion that have the added benefit of being solid-supported chemosensors.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The printing system is affordable and can be customized for the use with micropipettes for applications such as drop-casting, biological assays, sample preparation, rinsing, cell culture, and online analyte monitoring using multi-well plates. The robot is more compact (25 × 30 × 35 cm) and user-friendly than commercially available systems and does not require mechatronic experience. For fabrication of ion-selective electrodes, a carbon black intermediate layer and ion-selective membrane were successively drop-cast on the surface of stencil-printed carbon electrode using the dispensing robot. The 3D-printed robot increased ISE robustness while decreasing the modification time by eliminating manual steps. The Na+-ISEs and K+-ISEs were characterized for their potentiometric responses using a custom-made, low-cost (<$25) multi-channel smartphone-based potentiometer capable of signal processing and wireless data transmission. The electrodes showed Nernstian responses of 58.2 ± 2.6 mV decade−1 and 56.1 ± 0.7 mV decade−1 for Na+ and K+, respectively with an LOD of 1.0 × 10−5 M. We successfully applied the ISEs for multiplexed detection of Na+ and K+ in urine and artificial sweat samples at clinically relevant concentration ranges. The 3D-printed pipetting robot cost $100 and will pave the way for more accessible mass production of ISEs for those who cannot afford the expensive commercial robots.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Objective: The purpose of this article was to assess the efficacy of early VT CA in patients with ICD. Methods: EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane were searched from inception to April 2022. Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of early VT CA with control groups, both in patients with ICD, were included in the analysis. Data on effect estimates in individual studies were extracted and combined via random effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method, a generic inverse variance strategy. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials with 1106 patients (n = 1018, 92.1% with ischemic cardiomyopathy and n = 88, 7.9% with nonischemic cardiomyopathy) were evaluated. VT CA was associated with reduced VT recurrences (odds ratio [OR] 0.64; P = .007), appropriate ICD shocks (OR 0.53; P = .002), ICD therapies (OR 0.54; P = .002), and cardiovascular hospitalization (OR 0.67; P = .004). However, no significant differences were observed in terms of mortality rate, heart failure hospitalization, and quality of life between the early VT CA and control groups. Conclusion: Early CA was beneficial in reducing VT burden and ICD therapies. However, it did not affect mortality rate and quality of life. Since most patients in the included studies presented with ischemic cardiomyopathy, further studies on nonischemic cardiomyopathy should be conducted to validate if early CA has similar outcomes.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

This study aims to retrospectively explore other simian Plasmodium species in the blood samples of symptomatic malaria patients in Thailand. Methods: A total of 5271 blood samples from acute febrile patients from 5 malaria endemic provinces and 1015 blood samples from long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques from 3 locations were examined for Plasmodium species by microscopy and species-specific polymerase chain reaction. The Plasmodium mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (COX1) gene was analyzed by amplicon deep sequencing as well as Sanger sequencing from recombinant plasmid clones to reaffirm and characterize P. inui and P. fieldi. Results: Besides human malaria, P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. inui and P. fieldi infections were diagnosed in 15, 21, 19, and 3 patients, respectively. Most P. inui and all P. fieldi infected patients had simultaneous infections with other Plasmodium species, and seemed to be responsive to chloroquine or artemisinin-mefloquine. P. inui was the most prevalent species among macaque populations. Phylogenetic analysis of the COX1 sequences from human and macaque isolates reveals the genetic diversity of P. inui and suggests that multiple parasite strains have been incriminated in human infections. Conclusions: Both P. inui and P. fieldi could establish infection in humans under natural transmission. Despite occurring at a low prevalence and mostly co-existing with other Plasmodium species, P. inui infections in humans have a wide distribution in Thailand.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Recent research suggests that NGAL is also a promising biomarker for tubular damage and aids in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Therefore, the development of a method to efficiently produce recombinant NGAL has considerable clinical value. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between fluorescence reporter (enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) intensity and NGAL levels, mediated by a bicistronic expression system based on internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). During the 14-day culture period, EGFP intensity was positively correlated with NGAL concentrations. The purified protein also exerted bacteriostatic effects, interfering with bacterial iron uptake machinery during periods of iron starvation. The purified NGAL was also applied to generate a standard curve that could be used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of samples containing unknown NGAL quantities. In conclusion, we successfully developed a procedure using EGFP and IRES-based vector to predict NGAL production levels and optimize protein harvest time. Our approach is also a simple and effective method for evaluating bioactivity.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry",Biotechnology

This will directly affect the base electricity tariff. Therefore, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) shall identify the accurate financial status and consider the decrease in the amount of power demand due to the intervention of private companies of TPA. To calculate the base electricity effectively, this study, therefore, proposes a guideline for calculating the base electricity tariff to reflect the operating costs of the three electricity utilities more clearly by managing the base electricity tariff considering the wheeling charge required from the private companies of TPA for using the transmission systems.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, the application of CP is limited owing to its low solubility. The purpose of this research was to optimize the condition for non-enzymatic deamidation of CP and elucidate its effect on the functional properties of this protein. The CP was deamidated through physical (heating), chemical (hydrochloric acid, HCl), and a combination of heat and HCl treatments. The degree of deamidation (DD) and degree of hydrolysis (DH) increased with an increase in temperature and HCl concentration. The optimal condition, a combination of heat and HCl mediated deamidation, was successfully derived using the response surface methodology. The selected optimal conditions, which helped achieve high DD (>30%) with low DH (≤4%), including 0.3 mol/L HCl with heat treatment at 65, 70, and 75 °C were examined for assessing the functional properties of CP. The deamidated CP exhibited improved solubility, foaming capacity, and emulsifying activity, while the emulsion stability was found to be decreased after deamidation. Additionally, foaming stability decreased over the resting period. From the above selected conditions, the deamidated CP treated with 0.3 mol/L HCl at 75 °C exhibited the highest solubility and enhanced foam and emulsion ability.","mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Recent studies in animal models have shown neutrophil/myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR-223) as a key regulator in the development of various liver diseases including fibrosis, where hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the key player in pathogenesis. However, the precise roles of miR-223 in human HSCs and its therapeutic potential to control fibrosis remain largely unexplored. Using primary human HSCs, we demonstrated that miR-223 suppressed the fibrogenic program and cellular proliferation while promoting features of quiescent HSCs including lipid re-accumulation and retinol storage. Furthermore, induction of miR-223 in HSCs decreased cellular motility and contraction. Mechanistically, miR-223 negatively regulated expression of smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and thus reduced cytoskeletal activity, which is known to promote amplification of fibrogenic signals. Restoration of α-SMA in miR-223-overexpressing HSCs alleviated the antifibrotic effects of miR-223. Finally, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-233 in liver fibrosis, we generated co-cultured organoids of HSCs with Huh7 hepatoma cells and challenged them with acetaminophen (APAP) or palmitic acid (PA) to induce hepatotoxicity. We showed that ectopic expression of miR-223 in HSCs attenuated fibrogenesis in the two human organoid models of liver injury, suggesting its potential application in antifibrotic therapy.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The CTBO particles could reinforce in both NR and IR composites. However, the improvement of tensile properties in CTBO-filled NR composites was higher than that of IR composites due to the presence of non-rubber components in NR. The non-rubber components promoted the strong interfacial adhesions with filler and rubbery matrix to increase the bound rubber content. These results affected the increase of the stress softening degree, hysteresis loss, residual strain during cyclic deformation and the volume fraction of constrained rubber region (immobilized area of rubber) in CTBO-filled NR composites. The atomic force microscopy evidently revealed good compatibility between the CTBO particles and the NR matrix due to the presence of organic components from CTBO particles and from non-rubber components in NR. Accordingly, the CTBO particles and non-rubber components play important roles in improving the properties of green rubber composite materials.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

This review focuses on the production of hydrogen by biological methods, highlighting various fermentation processes, the role of enzymes, and different pretreatment methods. The waste materials used are briefly summarized, and current strategies in biological hydrogen production, including biomimetic and synthetic biology approaches, are assessed for their economic feasibility and their potential to contribute to net zero carbon emission. The lignocellulosic waste and the dynamic membrane bioreactor are the best suitable biomass and bioreactor, respectively for biohydrogen production. The integrated method of dark fermentation and electro-fermentation yields 41% higher hydrogen compared with dark fermentation alone. Finally, this review points out that significant efforts focusing on the development of hybrid fermentation technologies along with the development of novel engineered strains are needed for the commercial-scale production of biohydrogen in the future.","process equipment, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

SSVEP is a robust EEG signal suitable for many BCI applications. It is strong at the visual cortex around the occipital area, but the SNR gets worse when detected from other areas of the head. To make use of SSVEP measured around the ears following the ear-EEG concept, especially for practical binaural implementation, we propose a CNN structure coupled with regressed softmax outputs to improve accuracy. Evaluating on a public dataset, we studied classification performance for both subject-dependent and subject-independent trainings. It was found that with the proposed structure using a group training approach, a 69.21% accuracy was achievable. An ITR of 6.42 bit/min given 63.49 % accuracy was recorded while only monitoring data from T7 and T8. This represents a 12.47% improvement from a single ear implementation and illustrates potential of the approach to enhance performance for practical implementation of wearable EEG.","fluidex; related topics, neuroscience","Neuroscience (miscellaneous), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

To validate our work, we implement our design in VerilogHDL. The performance is evaluated using an FPGA simulator. The result shows a dramatic improvement in the simulation process comparing to those of simulation on classical computers.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Selective colorimetric detection of Cr(VI) using starch-stabilized silver nanoparticles and application for chromium speciation,"Sapyen W., Toonchue S., Praphairaksit N., Imyim A.",2022-06-05,"% reductions, Analytical performance, Chromium speciation, Color changes, Colorimetric detection, High sensitivity, Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, Linear range, Oxidative degradation, Speciation, Chromium, Colorimetry, Metal Nanoparticles, Silver, Starch, Chromium, Colorimetric detection, Silver nanoparticles, Speciation, Starch","The selective quantitation of Cr(VI) was developed through colorimetric detection using starch-stabilized silver nanoparticles (starch-AgNPs). The detection of Cr(VI) was based on oxidative degradation of starch-AgNPs as the reduction of UV-Vis signal and the distinctive color change from yellow to colorless of starch-AgNPs were observed. To achieve the highest sensitivity by this method, pH 3, and only 1 min were required for the determination of Cr(VI). For analytical performances, two linear ranges of 0–6 µM and 10–80 µM with limit of detection of 0.93 µM (48 µg/L) and 11.57 µM (0.60 mg/L) were obtained, respectively. The developed colorimetric method was combined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for the speciation analysis of chromium. The concentration of Cr(III) was calculated by subtraction of Cr(VI) from the total chromium concentration determined by ICP-OES. A satisfactory accuracy and precision based on the AOAC guidelines also proved that this simple and rapid sensor was successfully applied for speciation of chromium in real water samples.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics","Analytical Chemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Spectroscopy"

Treatments, including subtalar fusion, were proposed. The Grice procedure maintains foot stability, but bone graft non-union poses a challenge. This study aimed to identify the rate and factors related to post-operative bone graft non-union. Methods: Thirty-one paediatric CP patients (age, 8.9 ± 1.8 years) who underwent the Grice procedure (53 feet) using ipsilateral tibial bone grafts were reviewed. Pre-operative gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) classes were class 1 in five, 2 in five, 3 in 14, and 4 in seven patients. Standing foot radiographs were assessed for signs of non-union, and parameters (talocalcaneal and talar declination angles and talar head uncovering index) measured pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at the most recent evaluation were compared. Factors associated with bone graft non-union were analysed by regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Degenerative changes in hindfoot joints were evaluated by Bargon’s criteria. Results: At the average follow-up evaluation at 5.4 ± 4.3 years, the GMFCS class was improved or was maintained in 29/31 patients. Post-operative radiographic measurements were restored and were maintained over the follow-up period (P < 0.001). A total of 14/53 feet (26%) had non-union. The pre-operative lateral talocalcaneal angle (OR 1.08, p = 0.04) and follow-up duration (OR 1.18, p = 0.03) were identified in univariate analysis as potential factors related to non-union but were not confirmed in a multivariate model. Hindfoot joints in most feet showed mild degenerative changes. Conclusion: Grice subtalar fusion in patients with a higher pre-operative lateral talocalcaneal angle might lead to bone graft non-union.","orthopedic surgery, medical","Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"
Hyaluronic acid crosslinked with alginate hydrogel: A versatile and biocompatible bioink platform for tissue engineering,"Thanh T.N., Laowattanatham N., Ratanavaraporn J., Sereemaspun A., Yodmuang S.",2022-03-05,"3d bioprinting, Alginate hydrogels, Bioink, Bioprinting, Cartilage tissues, Crosslinked, Shear-thinning behavior, Tissue formation, Tissues engineerings, Volume ratio, 3D bioprinting, Alginate, Bioink, Cartilage tissue, Hyaluronic acid","Three-dimensional bioprinting holds promise in the anatomical fabrication of lost tissues and organs. Cell-laden hydrogels have been widely used as bioinks, extruded through a nozzle of 3D bioprinter to form the desired shape layer-by-layer. However, the major challenge in 3D bioprinting is finding functional biomaterials to develop bioinks, besides animal-based biomaterials, such as gelatin and collagen. The amine-hyaluronic acid (HA-NH2) was covalently crosslinked with the aldehyde-alginate (Alg-CHO). Once HA-NH2 and Alg-CHO solutions combine, by varying volume ratios, gelation is initiated through a Schiff's base reaction. The goal of this study was to investigate how volume ratios of HA-NH2 and Alg-CHO had impacts on the printability and biodegradability of the HA-Alg hydrogel and its potential use in the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The HA-Alg hydrogel made from equal volumes of HA-NH2 and Alg-CHO exhibited shear-thinning behaviours, which are essential features of a printable bioink. Moreover, we demonstrated cartilage tissue formation by encapsulating hMSCs in the HA-Alg hydrogel for 4 weeks. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept in creating an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN), the incorporation of silk fibroin into the HA-Alg hydrogel network was tested. This finding allowed the HA-Alg hydrogel to serve as a platform for development of other bioinks, without adverse effects on mechanical properties and shear-thinning behaviours. The results suggest that the HA-Alg hydrogel can be used as a printable biomaterial for the extrusion-based 3D bioprinter. The HA-Alg hydrogel promoted cartilage tissue development and potentially supported other tissue formation due to its tailorable mechanical and degradable properties.","physics, Materials Science, chemistry","Physics and Astronomy (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Sensitivity analysis with a 2k factorial design was conducted to analyze both main and interaction effects of process parameters on CO2 removal efficiency and reboiler specific heat duty. It was found that the liquid-to-gas (L/G) mass ratio and CO2 concentration in sour gas were the two most important parameters affecting both responses. Additionally, a pilot-scale CO2 capture process was simulated for both K2CO3 and monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions and compared in terms of CO2 removal efficiency, reboiler specific heat duty, and annual CO2 capture cost. The results showed that the optimal case for a K2CO3 solution achieved 87.04% CO2 removal efficiency, reboiler specific heat duty of 2.17 GJ/T CO2, annual CO2 capture cost of 57.50 USD/T CO2, and exergy efficiency of 40.71%, while the MEA solution case showed 73.35% CO2 removal efficiency, 4.78 GJ/T CO2, annual CO2 capture of 107.50 USD/T CO2, and an exergy efficiency of 18.49%.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

We therefore developed and tested, in a large patient cohort, a motion compensation algorithm called the Iterative Local Search Algorithm (ILSA), which can correct for both periodic and non-periodic in-plane motion and can reject frames with out-of-plane motion. CEUS cines of 183 focal liver lesions in 155 patients from three hospitals were used to develop and test ILSA. Performance was evaluated through quantitative metrics, including the root mean square error and R2 in fitting time–intensity curves and standard deviation value of B-mode intensities, computed across cine frames), and qualitative evaluation, including B-mode mean intensity projection images and parametric perfusion imaging. The median root mean square error significantly decreased from 0.032 to 0.024 (p < 0.001). Median R2 significantly increased from 0.88 to 0.93 (p < 0.001). The median standard deviation value of B-mode intensities significantly decreased from 6.2 to 5.0 (p < 0.001). B-Mode mean intensity projection images revealed improved spatial resolution. Parametric perfusion imaging also exhibited improved spatial detail and better differentiation between lesion and background liver parenchyma. ILSA can compensate for all types of motion encountered during liver CEUS, potentially improving contrast signal quantification of focal liver lesions.","fluidex; related topics, Health Professions, biochemistryistry, physics","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Biophysics, Acoustics and Ultrasonics"

This glomerular structure is the filtration unit of the nephron and is important for the kidney function, but it has been reported that the renal corpuscle was lost in at least four independent linages of fish (i.e., aglomerular kidney). In this study, the authors newly described renal structures for three species by histological and ultrastructural observations: two aglomerular kidneys from a seahorse Hippocampus barbouri and a toadfish Allenbatrachus grunniens and a glomerular kidney from a snake eel Pisodonophis boro. The renal development of H. barbouri was also described during 1–35 days after birth. In all species tested, the anterior kidney was comprised of haematopoietic tissues and a few renal tubules, whereas the posterior kidney contained more renal tubules. Although the glomerular structure was present in P. boro, light microscopic observations identified no glomeruli in the kidney of H. barbouri and A. grunniens. Ultrastructurally, abundant deep basal infoldings with mitochondria in the renal tubules were observed in A. grunniens compared to H. barbouri and P. boro, suggesting the possible role of basal infoldings in maintaining the osmotic balance. By integrating the results from the three species and comprehensive literature search, the authors further showed that 56 species have been reported to be aglomerular, and that the aglomerular kidney has evolved at least eight times in bony fishes.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Aquatic Science"

Due to the porous structure and low lignin content of water hyacinth, a 10 min-treatment time using the high-speed homogenization was sufficient to disintegrate nanofibers. The average width of the NFC treated for 40 min was 16.8 nm. With longer treatment times, a slight decrease in thermal stability of NFC was found while no changes in the crystallinity index of NFC were detected. Moreover, paper was formed from NFC with respect to mechanical treatment times. Results showed NFC treated with longer treatment times could prepare the paper with lower pore sizes between adjacent fibrils and porosity, resulting in higher wettability and mechanical properties. The contact angle of the 40 min-treated NFC paper was 36.0° while this contact angle result could not be measured from the samples of 0 min-treated NFC due to occurrence of large pores between fibers. The tensile strength of the NFC paper with 40 min-treatment time was ~18 times stronger than that of the 0 min-treated NFC paper. Mechanical energy consumption of the high-speed homogenization used to disintegrate NFC was also compared to that of the industrial defibrillation techniques.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

This study is the first dosimetric investigation comparing ultrahypofractionation using volumetric arc radiation therapy (VMAT) and intensity-modulated proton radiation therapy (IMPT) techniques in postmastectomy treatment planning. Materials and methods: Twenty postmastectomy patients (10-left and 10-right sided) were replanned with both VMAT and IMPT techniques. There were four scenarios: left chest wall, left chest wall including regional nodes, right chest wall, and right chest wall including regional nodes. The prescribed dose was 26 Gy(RBE) in 5 fractions. For VMAT, a 1-cm bolus was added for 2 in 5 fractions. For IMPT, robust optimization was performed on the CTV structure with a 3-mm setup uncertainty and a 3.5% range uncertainty. This study aimed to compare the dosimetric parameters of the PTV, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, heart, skin, esophageal, and thyroid doses. Results: The PTV-D95 was kept above 24.7 Gy(RBE) in both VMAT and IMPT plans. The ipsilateral lung mean dose of the IMPT plans was comparable to that of the VMAT plans. In three of four scenarios, the V5 of the ipsilateral lung in IMPT plans was lower than in VMAT plans. The Dmean and V5 of heart dose were reduced by a factor of 4 in the IMPT plans of the left side. For the right side, the Dmean of the heart was less than 1 Gy(RBE) for IMPT, while the VMAT delivered approximately 3 Gy(RBE). The IMPT plans showed a significantly higher skin dose owing to the lack of a skin-sparing effect in the proton beam. The IMPT plans provided lower esophageal and thyroid mean dose. Conclusion: Despite the higher skin dose with the proton plan, IMPT significantly reduced the dose to adjacent organs at risk, which might translate into the reduction of late toxicities when compared with the photon plan.",medical,"Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The blended SF/GA/Gly films were chemically conjugated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), either native (TMV-wt) or genetically modified with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences (TMV-rgd), to improve cellular responses. The attachment and proliferation of L929 cells on TMV-decorated films were improved, possibly due to enhanced surface roughness. The cellular responses were pronounced with TMV-rgd, due to the proper decoration of RGD, which is an integrin recognition motif supporting cell binding. However, the biological results were inconclusive for human primary cells because of an innate slow growth kinetic of the cells. Additionally, the cells on SF/GA/Gly films were greater populated in S and G2/M phase, and the cell cycle arrest was notably increased in the TMV-conjugated group. Our findings revealed that the films modified with TMV were cytocompatible and the cellular responses were significantly enhanced when conjugated with its RGD mutants. The biological analysis on the cellular mechanisms in response to TMV is further required to ensure the safety concern of the biomaterials toward clinical translation.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

The lipid components of lipoproteins are oxidized via lipid peroxidation and produce lipid radicals (L•) as the key initial intermediates. Modification of lipid components, therefore, might result in alterations in the rate and products of lipid peroxidation. In this study, the kinetics of L• formation during the 2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)- and hemin-induced oxidation of low-density and high-density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) from β-thalassemia patients and healthy volunteers were investigated using a specific and sensitive fluorescence probe for L•. Kinetic parameters, including initial lag time, propagation rate and total L• production, were calculated by monitoring a fluorescence-active NBD-Pen-L• adduct. Oxidation of thalassemia lipoproteins exhibited a significantly shorter lag time but a slower propagation rate of L• formation when compared with healthy lipoproteins. LDL showed higher resistance to oxidation during the initiation phase but higher L• formation than HDL. Our results indicated that the levels of α-tocopherol determined the initial lag time, whereas the levels of core lipids and cholesteryl esters, especially cholesteryl linoleate (CL), determined the propagation rate and total L• production. The difference in potency of AAPH and hemin supported that hemin preferentially targeted core lipids. Moreover, analysis of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid cholesteryl ester (13-HODE-CE)/CE ratio indicated that thalassemia lipoproteins have higher susceptibility to oxidation than healthy lipoproteins. In conclusion, our findings suggested that CL and α-tocopherol were implicated in the susceptibility of lipoproteins to lipid peroxidation in physiological and pathological conditions of β-thalassemia.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

In this study, we applied tissue-based proteomics to identify novel serological proteins for HCC and validated their performance in serum specimens. Methods: In a discovery set, liver tissue specimens of HBV-related HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) and colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (CRLM) were analyzed using mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap-XL). A subset of proteins that showed highly expressed in HCC were then confirmed by Western blotting. Additionally, clinical significance of selected candidate proteins was tested in serum samples of 80 patients with HBV-related HCC, 50 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis and 30 healthy controls. Results: Based on LTQ-Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer, various differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were identified. These included 77 DEPs for HCC, 77 DEPs for iCCA and 55 DEPs for CRLM. Among selected candidate proteins, annexin A2 and cathepsin D were confirmed to be overexpressed in HCC tissue by Western blot analysis. In a validate cohort, serum cathepsin D level, but not annexin A2, was significantly higher in HCC compared with the non-HCC groups. Serum cathepsin D level was also positively correlated with tumor size and tumor stage. Additionally, the combined assay of serum cathepsin D and alpha-fetoprotein had a high sensitivity in detecting early HCC (83%) and intermediate/advanced HCC (96%). Moreover, patients with low serum cathepsin D (<305 ng/mL) displayed significantly better overall survival than those whose serum levels were high (≥305 ng/mL). Conclusions: Proteomics and subsequent validation revealed cathepsin D as a novel biomarker for HCC. Apart from its diagnostic role, serum cathepsin D might also serve as a prognostic biomarker of HCC.

Plants are a versatile source of biologically active compounds for anticancer drug discovery, and aspiletrein A (AA) is a steroidal saponin isolated from Aspidistra letreae that has a potent cytotoxic effect on various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated and determined the underlying molecular mechanism by which AA induces apoptosis. AA strongly induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells by mediating ROS generation and thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Consequently, downstream signaling and levels of phosphorylated mTOR and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased. Pretreatment with either an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, or an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, could reverse the apoptosis-inducing effect and counteract the effect of AA on the AMPK signaling pathway. Decreased levels of Bcl-2 were due to AA-mediating Bcl-2 degradation via a ROS/AMPK/mTOR axis-dependent proteasomal mechanism. Consistently, the apoptotic-inducing effect of AA was also observed in patient-derived malignant lung cancer cells, and it suppressed an in vitro 3D-tumorigenesis. This study identified the underlying mechanism of AA on lung cancer apoptosis, thereby facilitating potential research and development of this compound for further clinical implications.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Organic phosphorus forms in a tropical sandy soil after application of organic residues of different quality,"Jantamenchai M., Sukitprapanon T.-S., Tulaphitak D., Mekboonsonglarp W., Vityakon P.",2022-01-01,"31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Incorporation of contrasting quality organic residue, Organic phosphorus, Organic residues, Polyphenols, Sandy soils, Sandysoil, Sequential extraction procedure, Thailand, Tropical sandy soil, 31P NMR spectroscopy, Incorporation of contrasting quality organic residues, Organic phosphorus, Sequential extraction procedure, Thailand, Tropical sandy soil","The addition of organic materials can improve soil fertility and phosphorus availability in agricultural soils. However, knowledge of organic P (Po) forms in soils with the incorporation of different quality residues is limited. This study investigated Po forms and determined the relationship between Po and soil properties in tropical sandy soils after application of local organic residues of different qualities, including groundnut stover (GN), tamarind leaf litter (TM), dipterocarp leaf litter (DP), and rice straw (RS). The Po forms were determined using a sequential extraction procedure and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Addition of residues, regardless of quality, had little effect on total Po accumulation, but it affected soil Po forms. Labile Po was a dominant form after incorporating high-quality residue (high nitrogen, low lignin, and low polyphenols) (e.g., GN), whereas nonlabile humic-Po and residual Po were dominant forms in soils treated with lower-quality residue with low N, high lignin, and high polyphenols (e.g., TM, DP, and RS). Using 31P NMR spectroscopy, orthophosphate and phosphate monoester (mono-P) were the major forms of inorganic P and organic P in all residue-treated soils, respectively. High-quality residue incorporation increased diester, DNA, and teichoic acid. The results showed that phosphonate occurred in GN soil because of acidic conditions occurring when GN was applied. The Po forms in lower-quality residue additions were dominated by mono-P because these residues had elevated contents of lignin and polyphenols, which has the potential to produce humic substances that form complexes with soil minerals. Furthermore, the nonlabile Po had a positive association with available P in tropical sandy soils.","mixing and separation, chemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Soil Science

At operating bulk dissolved oxygen concentration of 2 mg/L, nitritation was accomplished when the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) loading rate was ≥ 0.3 kgN/m3/d. At TAN loading rates of ≤ 0.2 kgN/m3 /d, complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate took place. Nitritation performance dropped with increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rates indicating limitation of nitritation reactor operation at some COD loading conditions. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the uncultured Cytophagaceae bacterium, Arenimonas, Truepera, Nitrosomonas, Comamonas, unclassified Soil Crenarchaeotic Group, and uncultured Chitinophagaceae bacterium were highly abundant taxa in the reactors’ gel bead matrices. qPCR with specific primers targeting amoA genes demonstrated the coexistence of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea, and Comammox in the gel bead matrices. AOB was likely the main functioning ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms due to the amoA gene being of highest abundance in most of the studied conditions. Nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms presented in less relative abundance than ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, with Nitrobacter rather than Nitrospira dominating in the group. Results obtained from this study are expected to further the application of nitritation entrapped cell reactors to real wastewater treatment processes.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The primary predictor was presence of syndromic mBCCs, and the main outcomes were jaw cysts and odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs). Descriptive, bi- and multivariate statistics, diagnostic test evaluation, and number needed to screen (NNS) were computed at α = 95%. Results: The sample comprised 527 mBCCs patients (36.1% females; 6.8% GGS; 5.5% OKCs; mean age, 74.5 ± 15.8 years [range, 15-102]). There was a significant association between syndromic mBCCs and jaw cysts (P <.0001; NNS = 2 [95% CI, CI, 1.1 to 1.4]).

The test may also induce premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in individuals without Brugada pattern, the clinical relevance of which is little known. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of short-coupled (Sc) PVCs induced by ajmaline or flecainide in patients with suspected or documented severe ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: We reviewed the SCB tests performed in 335 patients with suspected ventricular arrhythmias and structurally normal hearts in 9 centers. ScPVCs were defined as frequent and repetitive PVCs with an R-on-T pattern on SCB tests. Repeated SCB tests were performed in 7 patients and electrophysiological mapping of ScPVCs in 9. Results: Sixteen patients (8 men; mean age 36 ± 11 years) showed ScPVCs and were included. ScPVCs appeared 229 ± 118 seconds after the initiation of infusion and displayed coupling intervals of 288 ± 28 ms. ScPVC patterns were monomorphic in 12 patients, originating from the Purkinje system in mapped patients. Repetitive PVCs were induced in 15 patients (94%) including polymorphic ventricular tachycardias in 9 (56%). SCB infusion was repeated 45 (interquartile range 0.6–46) months later and induced identical ScPVC in all. SCB test was the only mean to reveal the malignant arrhythmia in 6 patients. Catheter ablation was performed in 9 patients, resulting in arrhythmia elimination in 8 with a follow-up of 6 (interquartile range 2–9) years. Conclusion: SCB can induce ScPVC, mostly from Purkinje tissue, in a small subset of patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias.

Methods: In this study, we assessed the invasion and maturation of P falciparum K1 in a culture of erythrocytes isolated from Thai subjects carrying Viangchan (871G>A) and Mahidol (487G>A). Results: We found that the parasites lost their ability to invade hemizygous and homozygous G6PD-deficient erythrocytes of Viangchan and Mahidol variants in the second and third cycles of intraerythrocytic development. It is interesting to note that P falciparum parasites selectively grew in erythrocytes from hemi-and homozygous genotypes with normal G6PD activity. Moreover, externalization of phosphatidylserine upon P falciparum infection was significantly increased only in Viangchan hemizygous variant cells. Conclusions: This study is the first to show that blockage of invasion in long-Term culture and potentially enhanced removal of parasitized erythrocytes were observed for the first time in erythrocytes from Viangchan and Mahidol G6PD-deficient individuals.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical","Immunology and Allergy, Infectious Diseases"

We report the final analysis of cohort 2 (Asia) within the context of published cohort 1 (Global) findings. Methods: Patients had HER2-positive, locally advanced, or metastatic BC progressing after chemotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy or ≤6 months after adjuvant therapy. The primary objective was to further evaluate T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg, administered intravenously every 3 weeks) safety/tolerability, including the following adverse events of primary interest (AEPIs): grade ≥3 AEPIs (hepatic events, allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage events), all grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs, and all-grade pneumonitis. Results: KAMILLA enrolled 2185 patients (cohort 1, n = 2003; cohort 2, n = 182) as of 31 July 2019. Of these, 2002 and 181 per cohort were treated and included in the safety population. Approximately 70% of patients had two or more previous treatment lines in the metastatic setting. Median T-DM1 exposure was 5.6 and 5.0 months per cohort; median follow-up was 20.6 and 15.1 months. The overall AEPI rate was higher in cohort 2 (93/181; 51.4%) versus cohort 1 (462/2002; 23.1%), mostly driven by a higher grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia rate in cohort 2. In cohort 2, grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia was not associated with grade ≥3 hemorrhagic events and most (128/138) fully resolved. Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEPI rates were 18.4% (cohort 1) and 48.6% (cohort 2), the latter mainly due to thrombocytopenia. Any-grade pneumonitis rates were 1.0% and 2.2%. No new safety signals were identified. Median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival was 6.8 months (5.8-7.6 months) and 5.7 months (5.5-7.0 months) in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively; median overall survival was 27.2 months (25.5-28.7 months) and 29.5 months (21.1 months to non-estimable). In both cohorts, median progression-free survival and overall survival decreased with increasing prior therapy lines. Conclusions: Cohort 2 results aligned with previous findings in Asian patients, supporting the manageable safety profile and use of T-DM1 in advanced BC.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

In recent years, numerous attempts have been made to develop zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs) with the premise that a flowing electrolyte can alleviate the shortcomings of zinc electrodes. Herein, the effects of electrolyte flow rate, current density, initial ZnO concentration, and electrolyte temperature on the performance and efficiency of a ZAFB are systematically explored. In addition, the paper discusses the morphological evolution of a zinc electrode with respect to different levels of parameters as well as gravity. Optimal parameters are determined by employing a combination of orthogonal array (OA) sampling and response surface methodology. Results demonstrate that a two-factor interaction regression model can effectively predict actual results with quite an acceptable accuracy. Applying optimal conditions, the battery obtains 99.27 % charge efficiency, 97.65 % discharge efficiency, 73.52 % overall round-trip efficiency, and charge and discharge overpotentials as low as 0.36 V and 0.09 V, respectively.

Methods We undertook a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 40-65 in Nan province, Thailand, between May and August 2019. We randomly recruited 345 villagers and enriched the sample with 82 government employees. All participants performed post-bronchodilator spirometry and completed a questionnaire covering information on respiratory symptoms, farming activities, pesticide use and known risk factors for respiratory disease. Associations of respiratory outcomes with farming and pesticide exposures were examined by multivariable regression analysis. Results The response rate was 94%. The prevalence of chronic airflow obstruction among villagers was 5.5%. Villagers had, on average, a lower percent predicted post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) than government employees (98.3% vs 100.3%; p=0.04). There was no evidence of association of lung function with farming activities, the use of specific herbicides (glyphosate and paraquat), insecticides (organophosphates and pyrethroids) or fungicides. The exceptions were poultry farming, associated with chronic cough and an increase of FEV 1 /FVC, and atrazine, for which duration (p-trend <0.01), intensity (p-trend <0.01) and cumulative hours (p-trend=0.01) of use were all associated with higher FEV 1 /FVC in an exposure-response manner. Cumulative hours (-280 mL/hour), low duration (-270 mL/year) and intensity (-270 mL/hour/year) of atrazine use were associated with lower FVC. Conclusions Chronic airflow obstruction is uncommon among villagers of an agricultural province in Nan, Thailand.

Some hepthamethine cyanine dyes can be transported into cancer cells via the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). In this study, we aimed to enhance the target ability of the sensitizer by conjugation Cy820 with indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to obtain Cy820–IMC that aimed to target cyclooxygenase–2 (COX–2) which overexpresses in cancer cells. The results showed that Cy820–IMC internalized the cancer cells faster than Cy820 which was verified to be related to COX–2 level and OATPs. Based on PDT experiments, Cy820–IMC has higher photocytotoxicity index than Cy820, >7.13 and 4.90, respectively, implying that Cy820–IMC showed better PDT property than Cy820. However, Cy820 exhibits slightly higher normal-to-cancer cell toxicity ratio than Cy820–IMC, 6.58 and 3.63, respectively. Overall, Cy820–IMC has superior cancer targetability and enhanced photocytoxicity. These characteristics can be further improved towards clinically approved sensitizers for PDT.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"

Clay bricks are most widely used in construction all over the world. Subsequently, waste generated from the demolition of clay-brick structures is most troublesome. Inherent porosity of bricks compromises the compressive strength of concrete with clay brick aggregates (C-CBA) that has rendered its use in structural concrete for quite some time. With some external clamping pressures, this deficiency can be countered. This study presents an experimental investigation into the use of steel clamps as a strengthening material for C-CBA. Steel clamps are cost-effective, readily available, and very easy to use. C-CBA were tested in two groups depending upon compressive strength: 15 & 35 MPa. Further, 3, 5, and 11 steel clamps were used in each group. Results suggested that steel clamps can effectively be used in enhancing the compressive strength of C-CBA to a level that is acceptable to be used in structural concrete. Increase in peak compressive strength of C-CBA was found to be proportional with the number of steel clamps employed. Three analytical concrete models were used to predict the compressive strength of C-CBA after strengthening. It was concluded that all three analytical models predicted well C-CBA compressive strength for 3-clamp specimens. However, their pre-diction accuracy was highly compromised as the number of steel clamps were increased.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

When compared with high-volume postdilution olHDF (convective volume of 26.02 ± 1.8 L/session), HD + SHF + HP provided comparable values of percentage reduction ratio of IS (52.0 ± 11.7 vs. 56.3 ± 7.5%, p = 0.14) and β2M (83.7 ± 4.9 vs. 84.0 ± 4.3%, p = 0.37) and slightly lower urea reduction ratio. Despite greater dialysate albumin loss (p = 0.008), there was no significant change in serum albumin level in HD + SHF + HP group. Conclusions: HD + SHF + HP could not provide superior efficacy in removing uremic toxins to high-volume postdilution olHDF. The use of low BFR of 200 ml/min during the first 2 h of HD + SHF + HP session, according to the instruction of manufacturer, might impair the efficacy of the HD + SHF part in removing uremic toxins.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, medical, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

In this article, an adaptive reduced-order observer is used to estimate both rotor speed and position. The proposed reduced-order observer is based on the stator equation, and four issues are explored. First, the stator equation is used to realize the adaptive reduced-order observer, by which the structure is simple without flux calculation. Second, the stability of adaptive reduced-order observer is analyzed by the linearization method, which paves the way for design procedure of observer's feedback gain. Third, the tracking performance of the rotor-position estimation is investigated through the acceleration/deceleration of rotor speed; an explicit guideline is provided to design the adaptation integral gain to satisfy the specified tracking response. Fourth, sensitivity to machine's parameter variations is studied; the robust stability property is enhanced by the observer's feedback gain; and the robust sensitivity to inductance variation is strengthened by the adjustment of mutual inductance with stator voltage accordingly. Experiment is conducted with a 4-kW DFIM drive system to verify the validation of the proposed theoretical concepts.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

Several polyphenols including (2S)-eriodictyol, (2S)-homoeriodictyol, moscatilin, gigantol, chrysotoxine and crepidatin are primarily found in Dendrobium species and can serve as bioactive markers of orchid plants. In the present study, a simple UPLC-UV method for the simultaneous determination of six polyphenols was developed for evaluating the distribution of bioactive phytochemicals in orchid plants and validated according to the ICH Q2 (R1) guidance. The sample was prepared by extracting dendrobium powder with methanol and the supernatant was analyzed using the Waters ACQUITY UPLCTM H-Class system on an ACQUITY UPLCTM BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with gradient elution of water and acetonitrile, containing 1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) each, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min and UV detection at 280 nm. The chromatographic condition provided good peak shape and resolution. The method was linear over the specific ranges with the coefficient of determination (r2) > 0.995. Accuracy of the method expressed as %recovery ranged from 80 to 110%. The precision of the method demonstrated as %CV was < 7.3%. The method is simple, accurate, precise and robust and is recommended for routine quality control analysis of orchid plants containing the six polyphenols as the main principles in the herb. The proposed method was successfully applied for simultaneous quantification of the 6 polyphenolic compounds in 11 samples from 3 Dendrobium species, suggesting that the method was suitable for quality assessment of orchid herbal raw materials.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

The highest yield of β-glucan (37.73 g/L) was obtained in the medium containing sucrose, NaNO3 and sunflower oil at concentrations of 60 g/L, 0.6 g/L, and 81.7 mL/L, respectively. The low molecular weight (LMW) β-glucan (78 kDa) was assessed its prebiotic property in comparison to the native one (>410 kDa). The growth of the probiotics, Lactobacillus casei and L. brevis, was significantly enhanced, although a higher growth was observed in the medium containing the native β-glucan. In addition, the native β-glucan was resistant with simulated salivary and gastrointestinal juice. The addition of β-glucan (2.5 and 5 g/L) in gummy jellies resulted in the increase of the color intensity, hardness, gumminess, and chewiness, while the springiness and cohesiveness decreased compared with the control. The highest score of overall acceptability (7.83 ± 0.75) according to 9-point hedonic scale was obtained from the gummy jellies with 0.5% β-glucan that could be stored at room temperature for seven days without microbial growth.

Sprayed water enhances the reduction of refrigerant temperature. The decrease of refrigerant temperature relates to the heat transfer improvement of air conditioning systems. This research aims to increase heat rejection by redesigning the condenser, using condensate water spray to a horizontal tube that connects between compressor and condenser. The effect of ambient relative humidity and air speed on refrigerant temperature is investigated in this study. The heat rejection steeply increases when the ambient relative humidity ranges from 47.8% to 73.1%. Then it remained constant until it reached 80.9%. The heat rejection was significantly reduced when the ambient relative humidity was in the range of 80.9% to 90.4%. In addition, lowering air speed and increasing ambient relative humidity reduce the convection heat transfer. Furthermore, the optimum condition for designing a model is between 73.1% to 80.9%.

Bacterial identification based on a combination of the biochemical characteristics, Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, and the species-specific PCR demonstrated the predominant Vibrionaceae were Vibrio harveyi (n = 56), Photobacterium damselae (n = 35), and V. vulnificus (n = 31), respectively. According to a laboratory challenge experiment, among the six isolates, only V. harveyi was found to cause clinical signs of muscle necrosis and scale loss in Asian sea bass. Antibiotics resistance test results exhibited high resistance to antibiotics such as metronidazole (100%), streptomycin (97%), clindamycin (96%), colistin sulphate (70%) and amoxicillin (59%). Remarkably, 100% of Vibrionaceae isolates are susceptible to florfenicol. The 28 of 29 resistance profiles were multidrug resistances (MDR), with V. vulnificus having the highest MAR value (0.66). The findings of this study advise that a surveillance program, as well as preventive and control measures, be developed for Vibrionaceae to reduce production loss, pathogen proliferation, and antibiotic abuse, whereas AMR data indicate substantial health problems for aquatic animals and humans.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

Hydrogen vacancy mechanisms of the host hydrides with the TM dopants are investigated using ab initio calculations. Remarkably, the results show the enhancement of the internal mechanism for hydrogen storage in the Na–Li–Al complex hydrides. Doping of Ni or Zn mainly reduces the energy barrier of diffusion kinetics in the host Na–Li–Al hydrides, leading to the improvement of the hydrogen storage efficiency of the host Na–Li–Al hydrides. Therefore, hydrogen vacancy diffusion kinetics in the Na–Li–Al hydrides can be induced by adding the Ni and Zn dopants.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Materials and methods: The review followed the guidelines set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, with guidance from the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Electronic searching and handsearching were performed using the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2010 to July 2022, respectively. Studies published in English were evaluated. Two independent examiners conducted the search and the review process. The risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated. Results: In total, 178 articles were evaluated for review, but only 15 of them were selected for full-text reading. Regarding cleaning efficacy, chemical decontamination using sodium hypochlorite produced better results than laser and mechanical decontamination with airflow. Similar efficacy was found between chemical and electrochemical decontamination. Combined use of chemical and electrochemical decontamination protocols demonstrated the greatest efficacy. Chemical and electrochemical decontamination methods were found to achieve better outcomes in preserving the surface properties of decontaminated healing abutments than laser and mechanical methods. Conclusion: The present review found that combined decontamination protocols (chemical, electrochemical processing and autoclave treatment) are favourable for obtaining healing abutments with optimally cleaned surfaces. Moreover, healing abutments located in an area that is difficult to access can be cleaned without affecting the surface properties.

In this study, Hyptis suaveolens (L.) was treated in water and the extracts obtained were used to synthesize copper nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the synthesized copper nanoparticles are spherical in shape with an average diameter of 7.2 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis showed that the particles were mostly of copper 92% and about 8% of oxygen indicating partial conversion of the copper sulphate into copper oxide. Plasmonic absorbance also indicated that the nanoparticles were predominantly made of copper. The nanoparticles showed excellent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi in the lowest concentration tested.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an essential treatment for severe forms of thalassemia. We performed a study to demonstrate RBC alloimmunization and other transfusion-related complications in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). Study Design and Methods: A multi-center web-based registry of TDT was conducted in eight medical centers across Thailand. Thalassemia information, transfusion therapy, and transfusion-related complications were collected. Factors associated with each complication were demonstrated using the logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 1000 patients recruited for the study, 449 were males (44.9%). The mean age was 23.9 ± 15.4 years. The majority of patients, 738 (73.8%) had hemoglobin E/beta-thalassemia. In the study, 421 transfusion-related complications were reported from 357 patients (35.7%). Alloimmunization was the most common complication which was found in 156 patients (15.6%) with 284 positive antibody tests. The most frequent antibodies against RBC were anti-E (80/284, 28.2%) followed by anti-Mia (45/284, 15.8%) and anti-c (32/284, 11.3%). Age ≥3 years at initial blood transfusion, splenomegaly, higher frequencies, and volumes of transfusion were significant factors associated with alloimmunization.

However, specific information concerning this hormone in controlling the reproductive organs of cats is limited. This study aimed to investigate the expression of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) and their signal mediator via prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS) in reproductive structures following oxytocin assisted electroejaculation. In Experiment 1, the testis, cauda epididymis and vas deferens from five cats were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction in order to study the responses of OTR and PTGIS mRNA to oxytocin injection. Experiment 2 examined the effect of oxytocin administration prior to electroejaculation on ejaculate characteristics and sperm quality in terms of motility, viability and fertilizing ability. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of OTRs in Leydig's, peritubular myoid cells and some spermatogenic cells. The expression was found in the epithelium and smooth muscle of the epididymis and vas deferens. After oxytocin administration, the OTR mRNA was upregulated in the epididymis (p >.05) and vas deferens (p =.01). The expression level of PTGIS mRNA increased in the response to oxytocin treatment only for the vas deferens (p >.05). Oxytocin treatment before electroejaculation resulted in an approximately twofold increase in sperm concentration and total sperm output/ejaculate, while this intervention did not significantly affect ejaculate volume, sperm quality or fertilizing ability. This study concluded that the oxytocin cascade is locally present in the reproductive structures and plays a role in promoting sperm delivery during electroejaculation in cats.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

Studies revealed that by 2050, global solid waste generation is expected to reach 70% to 3.4 billion metric tons. Thus, the authorities urgently need to provide a low-cost, efficient technology for treating waste disposal. However, it is evident that only 20% of waste is recycled, and the remaining is still being considered for landfilling. In developing countries, the generated waste is simply disposed of in an open area, which causes a severe threat to humans, animals, and the environment. To date, organic waste and fourth-generation biomass have been investigated for multiple targeted products. Thus, the present review article highlights the emerging problems in organic waste generation, management, and converting them into various value-added bioproducts. This review also deals with the conversion of multiple biofuels such as liquid, solid, gaseous, and bioelectricity from organic waste resources. Besides, the latest approaches in organic waste are also detailly addressed for the production of value-added bioproducts such as bioplastic, bio-compost, and organic acids. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of organic waste is also explored. The transformation of organic waste to value-added bioproducts enhances the circular bioeconomy approach by reducing waste, increasing energy production, and other healthcare products. Finally, it is concluded that the utilization of organic waste to value-added bioproducts and biofuels production will be helpful in achieving high energy security, environmental protection, as well as enhancing the bioeconomy perspective.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

To get pure H2, the CO2 must be removed. In this work, the CO2 was selectively separated from the gas mixture of CO2 and H2 by adsorption process using the spent disposable wooden chopstick (SWC)-derived activated carbon (AC) synthesized by the chemical activation. An appropriate condition for biochar preparation was first explored and then the chemical activation was carried out. Two types of activation chemicals (ZnCl2 and KOH) were employed to activate the biochar at different temperatures (500 – 800 °C). Effects of activation holding time (60 – 150 min) and activation chemical to biochar weight ratio (0.5 – 2.5) were also investigated. The optimal condition for biochar preparation was found at 500 °C and 15 min which can provide the AC yield of 29.5% and CO2 adsorption capacity of 19.2 mg/g from the gas mixtures with 50 mol% CO2 at 25 °C and 1 atm. The AC synthesized by the KOH activation at 700 °C using a KOH/biochar weight ratio of 1.5 for 90 min exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption of 115.7 mg/g for the first use and dropped approximately 20% after 6 adsorption/desorption cycles. Based on the perspective Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, the best synthesized AC exhibited the selectivity of CO2 adsorption 17.6 times higher than that of H2. The adsorption behavior and kinetic model of CO2 adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm and the pseudo-2nd order model, respectively and the CO2 adsorption occurred via the combined physical and chemical mechanism.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; hydrogen, mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

Aims: We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of snail secretion filtrate, Calendula officinalis, and Glycyrrhiza glaba root extract combination serum (SCGS) in treating the maskne. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study. This study enrolled 66 participants with mild-to-moderate maskne. The SCGS and placebo were randomly assigned for participants to use twice daily for 12 weeks. Percentage change of acne lesion count, acne severity by Investigator Global Evaluation Acne (IGEA), sebum levels, corneometry levels, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema score by Visia®, and adverse events were evaluated 4-weekly at baseline to Week 12. At Week 12, all participants evaluated their satisfaction scores using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Results: In the mask-covered area, the percent reduction in inflammatory acne lesions from the treatment group was significantly greater than the placebo group at all time points (coefficient of percentage change of inflammatory lesions = −33.89 [95% CI −65.24, −2.53]; p = 0.03). Also, a subgroup analysis with participants using concurrent acne treatments revealed similar results (12 participants, coefficient = −50.30 [95% −88.65, −11.95]; p = 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in non-inflammatory lesions, all skin biophysics, and VAS between groups. Adverse events were mild and occurred in a few cases in both groups. Conclusions: The SCGS could significantly improve inflammatory acne lesions and had a favorable tolerability profile, suggesting its role as an adjunctive treatment in maskne.",medical,Dermatology
3D printing filaments from plasticized Polyhydroxybutyrate/Polylactic acid blends reinforced with hydroxyapatite,"Kanabenja W., Passarapark K., Subchokpool T., Nawaaukkaratharnant N., Roman A.J., Osswald T.A., Aumnate C., Potiyaraj P.",2022-11-01,"3-D printing, 3D-printing, Bio-composite filament, Biocomposite, Biodegradable, Flowability, Polyhydroxybutyrate, Polylactic acid, Polymer blending, Propylene glycols, 3D printing, Bio-composite filament, Biodegradable, Polyhydroxybutyrate, Polylactic acid","This research focused on the fabrication of bio-composite filament from polymer blending between Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and Polylactic acid (PLA) while using hydroxyapatite (HA) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) as a reinforcing agent and plasticizer, respectively, targeting to be an alternative material used in 3D printing utilization stead of using commercial PLA. PHB/PLA blend containing 10, 20, and 30 phr HA, with equal PPG content were prepared using a melt-extrusion process via a twin-screw extruder. Herein, the thermal properties and flowability were investigated to optimize the 3D printing conditions. The results showed that adding PPG improved the processability during the filament extrusion and 3D printing process. The bio-composite with 10 phr HA and 10 phr PPG (HA-PPG 11) showed a consistent flow, leading to an excellent 3D printability, however, the flowability decreased with an increase in HA loading. Furthermore, the morphological and mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens were characterized. Mechanical testing exhibited that HA-PPG 11 occupied excellent mechanical properties, which included impact strength (1.85 kJ/m2), flexural modulus (3.20 GPa), and flexural stress at 2% strain (42.5 MPa); especially, elongation at break which higher than commercial PLA, all of which are attributed to the high-level of HA dispersion within the bio-composite.","mixing and separation, engineering, Materials Science","Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science (all), Engineering (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Three decades of a lesson learned from Thailand: compulsory service for dentist workforce distribution,"Arunratanothai T., Booncharoen R., Suwankomolkul S., Limpuangthip N.",2022-12-01,"Dentists, Health Facilities, Humans, Physicians, Thailand, Workforce, Admission track, Compensation, Compulsory service, Dentist allocation, Health policy, Health system, Health workforce, Policy implementation","Background: Thailand has encountered an imbalanced dentist distribution and an internal brain drain of dentists from public to private health care facilities. To tackle these challenges, the compulsory service (CS) program, which has been initially implemented for physicians, was extended for dentists. Method: This policy and workforce document review describes the background, development, and policy implementation of the CS program in Thailand during the past three decades. Outcomes after policy implementation and future directions are also discussed. The information was gathered from the relevant policy and workforce documents available from 1961 to 2021. Results: In Thailand, junior dentists, specifically newly graduates, have to enroll in the CS program by working as oral health practitioners in public hospitals for at least 3 years. Dentists must pay a maximum fine of 400 000 baht (~ 12 571 USD) if they wish to skip the program. This fine is lowered according to the number of attending years in the program. CS program conditions are related to each university’s admission track. The CS enrolled dentists receive several financial and non-financial benefits, including educational, employment-related, and living provisions. Altogether, successive Thai governments have launched directive policies to increase dentist distribution in rural areas and their retention in public hospitals. These policies have been implemented in 3 stages: (1) increase production of new dentists, (2) allocation of newly dental graduates to public hospitals, and (3) provide benefits for working in public hospitals. Conclusion: During the past three decades, several public policies have been implemented to improve dentist retention and distribution to public hospitals across Thailand, particularly in rural areas. The present CS program may not completely resolve the oral health inequalities because the dentist retention rate in public hospitals depends on multi-dimensional considerations. Further modifications on the CS program and future well-planned policies are needed.","sociology, medical","Public Administration, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In the present study, we established an optimal alginate encapsulated TiO2/Escherichia coli hybrid system by varying the initial concentrations of alginate (2–5%) and initial inoculum concentration (OD600 0.5–2.5) to form the hydrogel beads for efficient production of hydrogen in the presence of oxygen with the given visible-light intensity of 2000 W m−2. The maximum hydrogen production of 2.8 mmol H2/mmol glucose was obtained with hydrogel beads consisting of 4% sodium alginate and initial inoculum with a cell density of 1.5 OD600. Natural sunlight could also be used to produce hydrogen under the same optimized condition. The optimization of the encapsulated nano bio-hybrid system with respect to alginate and inoculum concentration allows for the enhancement of hydrogen production even in the presence of oxygen.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Cross-sectional risk assessment of zoonotic Streptococcus suis in pork and swine blood in Nakhon Sawan Province in northern Thailand,"Khantasup K., Tungwongjulaniam C., Theerawat R., Lamaisri T., Piyalikit K., Nuengjamnong C., Nuanualsuwan S.",2022-09-01,"Animals, Cross-Sectional Studies, Pork Meat, Red Meat, Risk Assessment, Streptococcal Infections, Streptococcus suis, Swine, Swine Diseases, Thailand, dose–response model, maximum likelihood estimator, pork, probability distribution, risk assessment, Streptococcus suis illness, swine blood","A cross-sectional study evaluated the risk of zoonotic Streptococcus suis (S. suis) illness from consuming raw pork and swine blood in Nakhon Sawan Province. A four-step risk assessment recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission was used to evaluate the risk along the pork supply chain. A total of 480 pork and swine blood samples were collected from the abattoir (n = 120) and retail (n = 360) during December 2020 and January 2021. Streptococcus suis in samples was enumerated using a culture-based technique and then confirmed by the biochemical and molecular technique. Streptococcus suis was serotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Two positive swine blood samples were contaminated with non-zoonotic S. suis serotype 23 at retail. In the case of all negative samples, the deterministic prevalence becomes zero and then the risk could not be estimated. Otherwise, the beta probability distribution was used to describe the probabilistic prevalence, while the maximum likelihood estimator was applied to estimate the upper limit of a probability distribution of concentration. The district averages of probabilistic prevalences of zoonotic S. suis in pork products at abattoir and retail were 9.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The district averages of concentrations of zoonotic S. suis in pork and blood samples from abattoir were 6.8 × 10−3 cfu/g and 6.83 cfu/ml and in pork and blood samples from retail were 2.3 × 10−3 cfu/g and 2.30 cfu/ml, respectively. The overall annual risk estimate per 100,000 population in pork and swine blood from abattoir and retail were 9.8 × 10−11, 2.2 × 10−6, 5.4 × 10−13, and 8.3 × 10−8. These risk estimates were negligible (<10−6) except for the annual risk estimate in swine blood from the abattoir. The results from this cross-sectional risk assessment should prompt the food safety regulator to cautiously sample by taking into account the duration of sampling and sample size.","medical, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Epidemiology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The traditional single-path transmission protocols are not efficient to serve several requirements of big data applications. In this paper, we propose an SDN-coordinated steering framework for multipath big data transfer applications. Multipath TCP protocol (MPTCP) coupled with SDN are mainly used for big data transfer in our framework. This framework is useful and cost-effective for OpenFlow networks and overlay networks. To provide a practical multipath transmission scheme for big data transfer applications using MPTCP, we propose a novel OpenFlow-Stats routing algorithm. In our algorithm, a new topology-pruning technique is applied, and the transmission paths are selected based on switch-port statistics. Our proposed framework is implemented and evaluated using the Mininet emulator and ONOS controller. The results show that our routing scheme can reduce the completion time of big data transfer up to 90% compared with the traditional routing with disjoint paths and up to 35% compared with the previous work. Moreover, our proposed routing is more scalable than other previous works in that it can provide lower complexity and system overhead. The results show that our routing scheme produces 57% less overhead compared with the previous work.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

A phonemic verbal fluency (PVF) task is a standard cognitive test that participants are asked to produce words starting with given letters, such as “F” in English and “ก” /k/ in Thai. With state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, features extracted from the PVF data have been widely used to detect MCI. The PVF features, including acoustic features, semantic features, and word grouping, have been studied in many languages but not Thai. However, applying the same PVF feature extraction methods used in English to Thai yields unpleasant results due to different language characteristics. This study performs analytical feature extraction on Thai PVF data to classify MCI patients. In particular, we propose novel approaches to extract features based on phonemic clustering (ability to cluster words by phonemes) and switching (ability to shift between clusters) for the Thai PVF data. The comparison results of the three classifiers revealed that the support vector machine performed the best with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.733 (N = 100). Furthermore, our implemented guidelines extracted efficient features, which support the machine learning models regarding MCI detection on Thai PVF data.","mixing and separation, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The formation of CuO and Fe2O3 with minor CuFe2O4 were observed after calcination at 600 °C and 700 °C, whereas the major phase of CuFe2O4 spinel-type structure was detected at 800 °C. To elucidate the structural CuFe transformation with catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), the calcined catalysts were activated in situ into active species using isopropanol as the hydrogen donor, and their catalytic performances were simultaneously employed for the CTH of furfural to furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran. Interestingly, the metallic Cu with minor Cu2O and magnetite Fe3O4 were generated after the CTH through combined XRD and ex situ XANES observations, acting as the active species for the reaction. The catalytic activity was higher for the CuFe600 and CuFe700 catalysts than for the CuFe800 catalyst because calcination at high temperature resulted in the formation of larger catalyst particles. Extended investigations on the catalyst lifetime confirmed that the deactivation of the CuFe700 catalyst was slower than that of the CuFe600 catalyst. Our investigation demonstrates the simultaneous catalyst activation and reaction accompanied by the catalyst recovery achieved by a magnetic field activated by isopropanol for the CuFe system.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The present study was performed to investigate whether oral administration of altrenogest until 112 days of gestation and double administration of PGF2α at 113 days of gestation can synchronise the onset of parturition in sows and minimise deleterious effects on the incidence of stillbirths and colostrum quality. Additionally, the effects of synchronised farrowing on colostrum yield and piglet birth weight, colostrum intake and survival rate of piglets until seven days of postnatal life were also investigated. In total, 193 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows were randomly allocated according to parity number into two groups, i.e. control (n = 95) and treatment (n = 98). The control sows were allowed to farrow naturally. The treatment sows were orally administered 20 mg per day of altrenogest for four days from 109 to 112 days of gestation and were administered PGF2α twice on day 113 of gestation. Individual body weight at birth and 24 h after birth of piglets in all litters were determined in both control (n = 1609) and treatment (n = 1707) groups. Colostrum consumption of all piglets, colostrum yield, colostrum IgG and serum progesterone of sows were determined. On average, the total number of piglets born per litter were 17.0 ± 3.1. The proportion of sows farrowed before 114 days of gestation was higher in the control than the treatment group (8.4% and 2.0%, respectively, P = 0.05) and 92.8% of sows in the treatment group farrowed on day 114 of gestation. The percentage of stillborn piglets per litter did not differ significantly between control and treatment groups (4.5% and 4.6%, respectively). Colostrum yield of sows did not differ between control and treatment groups (5.52 ± 0.13 and 5.28 ± 0.12 kg, respectively, P = 0.174). However, colostrum intake of piglets was lower in the treatment than the control group (354.7 ± 6.6 and 381.2 ± 7.0 g, respectively, P = 0.012). Colostrum IgG was higher in the control than the treatment group (41.2 ± 1.1 and 37.3 mg per ml, P = 0.013). In conclusion, altrenogest treatment from 109 to 112 days and double administrations of PGF2α on day 113 of gestation can control gestation length in sows. No deleterious effects of this protocol on the incidence of stillbirths and sow colostrum yield were detected. However, piglet colostrum intake and colostrum IgG were compromised. Thus, care of newborn piglets in the treatment group should be considered.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

The addition of POSS had enhanced the hydrophobicity of the PDMS and improved the affinity of furfural with membranes. At the same filler loading, OAPS/PDMS membrane showed a superior separation factor to the bare PDMS and the ONPS/PDMS composite. The effects of OAPS loading on property and pervaporation performance of the membrane were also investigated. The loading at 15 wt% was found to be the optimum value that could improve water contact angle to 116° and furfural affinity to achieve over 20% improvement in both furfural flux and separation factor. The PDMS membrane with 15 wt% of OAPS could provide 7-fold concentrated furfural solution compared to the feed. The newly developed OAPS/PDMS membrane showed great potential for furfural recovery as the alternative separation method with improved energy-effectiveness and low chemical footprint.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

In comparison with the parent strain, the Chlorhexidine-adapted strain formed smaller colonies with metabolic downregulation (proteomic analysis) with the cross-resistance against colistin (an antibiotic for several antibiotic-resistant bacteria), partly through the modification of L-Ara4N in the lipopolysaccharide at the outer membrane. Chlorhexidine-adapted strain formed dense liquid–solid interface biofilms with enhanced cell aggregation partly due to the Chlorhexidine-induced overexpression of psl (exopolysaccharide-encoded gene) through the LadS/GacSA pathway (c-di-GMP-independence) in 12 h biofilms and maintained the aggregation with SiaD-mediated c-di-GMP dependence in 24 h biofilms as evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The addition of Ca2+ in the Chlorhexidine-adapted strain facilitated several Psl-associated genes, indicating an impact of Ca2+ in Psl production. The activation by Chlorhexidine-treated sessile bacteria demonstrated a lower expression of IL-6 and IL-8 on fibroblasts and macrophages than the activation by the parent strain, indicating the less inflammatory reactions from Chlorhexidine-exposed bacteria. However, the 14-day severity of the wounds in mouse caused by Chlorhexidine-treated bacteria versus the parent strain was similar, as indicated by wound diameters and bacterial burdens. In conclusion, Chlorhexidine induced psl over-expression and colistin cross-resistance that might be clinically important.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Two types of bio-oil, palm oil and soybean oil, were studied in direct comparison with a distillate aromatic extract oil (DAE) as a reference. The scorch and cure times of the bio-oil-extended NR compounds were shorter than those containing DAE. The use of bio-oils gave a higher cure reaction rate constant along with a lower activation energy than the use of DAE. The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that the fatty acid segment of the bio-oils can react with zinc oxide to give zinc carboxylate, which is then involved in and promotes the vulcanization reaction. The use of bio-oils to increase the rate of vulcanization strongly influenced the crosslink density of the obtained NR vulcanizates, yielding NR vulcanizates with a lower crosslinking density. It is proposed here that the bio-oils might consume the curing agent via the reaction between their own unsaturated fatty acid and sulfur. This was supported by the increased viscosity of the oils after exposure to sulfur at a high temperature. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the bio-oil-extended NR compounds were lower and higher, respectively, than the NR extended with DAE oil due to the lower crosslink density of the bio oil-extended NR vulcanizates.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

Besides, the key role of M+ is to control the PEG group which stabilizes the catalyst structure. In addition, we found two key factors (shorter M-O1 and M-OPEG distances) for designing new catalysts from the pre-reaction state of the Ni-PEG(M+) catalysts. Finally, Ni-PEG(M2+) catalysts with Be2+, Mg2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ were suggested for candidates of highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The levels of both IL-1Ra and sVCAM-1 were not significantly increased with age.","Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"
Effects of Re and Co additions on lattice parameters and lattice misfit in cast Ni-based superalloys,"Nararak A., Kiatwisarnkij N., Rojhirunsakool T., Dasari S., Nusen S., Lothongkum G., Lampke T., Hartung F., Qin J., Wangyao P.",2022-12-01,"Coaddition, Elemental partitioning, Gamma prime, Lattice misfits, Long term exposure, Morphological evolution, Ni-based superalloys, RE additions, Topologically close packed phase, Vacuum arc melting, cobalt, lattice misfit, rhenium, superalloy, topologically close-packed phases","Morphological evolution of gamma prime precipitates was governed by an elemental partitioning ratio between the gamma and gamma prime phases. In the present study, Ni-based MGA 1400 alloy was modified by adding 4 wt% of Re and 6.4 wt% of Co by vacuum arc melting. The effects of Re and Co additions on lattice parameters of gamma and gamma prime phases were studied by TEM and XRD techniques. Calculated lattice misfit values obtained from XRD and TEM techniques were used to identify the shape and morphology of gamma prime precipitated particles after long-Term exposure at 1173 K for 1800 ks? After long-Term exposure, gamma prime particles became much coarser. The addition of Re retarded the coarsening rate of the gamma prime precipitates, resulting in smaller gamma prime particles at the same annealing times. Even though, both Re and Co atoms are strongly partitioned in the gamma matrix, the effect of Re and Co additions on lattice misfits was contradictory. The addition of Re produced rounded corner cuboidal morphology of gamma prime precipitates due to higher magnitude with negative lattice misfit (-0.3857%), while Co addition provided a more rounded shape of gamma prime particles due to the lattice misfit value approach to zero (+0.0936%).","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In 5G networks, different techniques are used, such as MIMO systems, and its network infrastructure is utilized by diverse services, for instance, vehicular communications. Thus, the description and the tracing of a communication scenario needs a large volume of data. Because of the difficulty to implement actual 5G networks, there is a lack of datasets containing complete 5G scenarios, the data is not enough or contain imbalanced classes to properly train machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this context, we propose a method to increase the amount of data to improve the machine learning performance of some classification models, specifically Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and k-Nearest Neighbors. In the experimental results of the test phase, considering the inclusion of synthetic data, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors reached macro F1 scores of 0.9341, 0.9241 and 0.9456, respectively, which are superior to the results obtained when training with the original data only.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

UV treatment is widely used in the decontamination process; however, predicting a sufficient UV dose by using traditional methods is doubtful. In this study, an in-house UVC apparatus was designed to investigate the process of the inactivation of five indicator bacteria when the initial cell concentrations and irradiation intensities varied. Both linear and nonlinear mathematical models were applied to predict the inactivation kinetics. In comparison with the Weibull and modified Chick-Watson models, the Chick-Watson model provided a good fit of the experimental data for five bacteria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. The specific death rate (kd) significantly increased when the irradiation intensity (I) increased from 1.41 W/m2 to 3.02 W/m2 and 4.83 W/m2 (P , 0.05). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the kd values among the groups of tested Grampositive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and B. subtilis spores, but the kd values differed among groups (P , 0.05). The death rate coefficient (k) varied from species to species. The k values of the tested Gram-positive bacteria were higher than those of the Gram-negative bacteria. The thick peptidoglycan layer in the Gram-positive membrane was responsible for UVC resistance. The high guanine-cytosine (GC) content in bacteria also contributed to UV resistance due to the less photoreactive sites on the nucleotides. This investigation provides a good understanding of bacterial inactivation induced by UVC treatment.","chemistryical reactions, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental, Immunology","Biotechnology, Food Science, Ecology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Typically, the clarity of structural-phase stability could be demonstrated by thermodynamical and dynamical stabilities. Herein, we introduce a critical temperature (Tc) superconductivity of the ternary pentahydride, based on the isotropic Éliashberg equation. The Tc is estimated by directly solving the Allen-Dynes equation, with a remarkable value of Tc at 25.6 K. Under the compressing pressure from 100 to 300 GPa, the Tc of MgNiH5 is determined by means of the phonon-mediated superconductivity, arising particularly from a magnitude of partial electron-phonon coupling. Our calculation paves the way for achieving a ratio and a Tc superconductivity in the family of ternary polyhydride.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This systematic review aimed to identify relevant studies and synthesize survey data on the acceptance and use of CAM among medical specialists. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Scopus databases for the acceptance and use of CAM among medical specialists. Each article was assessed by two screeners. Only survey studies relevant to the acceptance and use of CAM among medical specialists were reviewed. The pooled prevalence estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. This review followed both PRISMA and SWiM guidelines. Results: Of 5628 articles published between 2002 and 2017, 25 fulfilled the selection criteria. Ten medical specialties were included: Internal Medicine (11 studies), Pediatrics (6 studies), Obstetrics and Gynecology (6 studies), Anesthesiology (4 studies), Surgery (3 studies), Family Medicine (3 studies), Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (3 studies), Psychiatry and Neurology (2 studies), Otolaryngology (1 study), and Neurological Surgery (1 study). The overall acceptance of CAM was 52% (95%CI, 42–62%). Family Medicine reported the highest acceptance, followed by Psychiatry and Neurology, Neurological Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Internal Medicine, and Surgery. The overall use of CAM was 45% (95% CI, 37–54%). The highest use of CAM was by the Obstetrics and Gynecology, followed by Family Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurology, Pediatrics, Otolaryngology, Anesthesiology, Internal Medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Surgery. Based on the studies, meta-regression showed no statistically significant difference across geographic regions, economic levels of the country, or sampling methods. Conclusion: Acceptance and use of CAM varied across medical specialists. CAM was accepted and used the most by Family Medicine but the least by Surgery. Findings from this systematic review could be useful for strategic harmonization of CAM and conventional medicine practice.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a salt-sensitive epigenetic regulator associated with SSBP and aldosterone dysfunction. An LSD1 risk allele in humans is associated with SSBP and lower aldosterone levels in hypertensive individuals of African but not European descent. Heterozygous knockout LSD1 mice display SSBP and aldosterone dysregulation, but this effect is modified by age and biological sex. This might explain differences in cardiovascular risk with aging and biological sex in humans. Objective: This work aims to determine if LSD1 risk allele (rs587618) carriers of African descent display a sex-by-age interaction with SSBP and aldosterone regulation. Methods: We analyzed 297 individuals of African and European descent from the HyperPATH cohort. We performed multiple regression analyses for outcome variables related to SSBP and aldosterone. Results: LSD1 risk allele carriers of African (but not European) descent had greater SSBP than nonrisk homozygotes. Female LSD1 risk allele carriers of African descent had greater SSBP, mainly relationship-driven by women with low estrogen (postmenopausal). There was a statistically significant LSD1 genotype-sex interaction in aldosterone response to angiotensin II stimulation in individuals aged 50 years or younger, with female carriers displaying decreased aldosterone responsiveness. Conclusion: SSBP associated with LSD1 risk allele status is driven by women with a depleted estrogen state. Mechanisms related to a resistance to develop SSBP in females are uncertain but may relate to an estrogen-modulating effect on mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation and/or LSD1 epigenetic regulation of the MR.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

Moreover, the dynamic changes of salivary bacteriome in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are largely unknown. This research aimed to investigate and compare the salivary bacteriome and the co-infectious bacterial pathogens in the asymptomatic COVID-19 positive group to the negative group, based on novel nanopore sequencing. This cohort was a cross-sectional study including saliva samples collected from 82 asymptomatic participants (39 COVID-19 positive and 43 COVID-19 negative cases). All samples were sequenced for the full-length bacterial 16S rDNA. The alpha and beta diversity analyses were not significantly different between groups. The three major species in salivary bacteriome including Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mitis, and Prevotella melaninogenica were observed in both groups. Interestingly, Lautropia mirabilis was a significantly enriched species in the saliva of the asymptomatic COVID-19-positive cases based on linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis.

Although several studies have reported the relationship between TiO2 nanotubes and cell osseointegration rate, the corrosion rate of the TiO2 nanotube layer under the circumstance of usage has yet to be fully evaluated. In this work, we have studied the effect of surface preparation conditions on the corrosion behavior of a TiO2 nanotube layer on a pure Ti substrate. The surface of the titanium substrate was prepared by different methods, followed by one-step anodization to obtain a TiO2 nanotube array. A surface roughness non-contact tester and field emission scanning electron microscope were used to characterize the surface roughness and surface morphology of the as-received, mechanically polished, and chemically polished substrate both pre and post anodization. The corrosion behavior of the prepared substrates was also investigated in Phosphate Buffered Saline solution using potentiodynamic polarization technique. The results suggest that surface roughness at the nanoscale of the prepared surfaces has no relationship with corrosion resistance. However, after anodization, the corrosion rate has a good relationship with the standard deviation of inner tube/pore diameter.","corrosion, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

As tacrolimus acts on T lymphocytes and other white blood cells, including monocytes, we investigated the association of tacrolimus concentration in CD3+T lymphocytes (TAC[CD3]) and CD14+monocytes (TAC[CD14]) with acute rejection after kidney transplantation.Methods:From a total of 61 samples in this case-control study, 28 samples were obtained during biopsy-proven acute rejection (rejection group), and 33 samples were obtained in the absence of rejection (control group). PBMCs were collected from both cryopreserved (retrospectively) and freshly obtained (prospectively) samples. CD3+T lymphocytes and CD14+monocytes were isolated from PBMCs, and their intracellular tacrolimus concentrations were measured.Results:The correlation between tacrolimus whole-blood and intracellular concentrations was poor. TAC[CD3]was significantly lower than TAC[CD14](median 12.8 versus 81.6 pg/million cells; P < 0.001). No difference in TAC[PBMC](48.5 versus 44.4 pg/million cells; P = 0.82), TAC[CD3](13.4 versus 12.5 pg/million cells; P = 0.28), and TAC[CD14](90.0 versus 72.8 pg/million cells; P = 0.27) was found between the rejection and control groups. However, freshly isolated PBMCs showed significantly higher TAC[PBMC]than PBMCs from cryopreserved samples. Subgroup analysis of intracellular tacrolimus concentrations from freshly isolated cells did not show a difference between rejectors and nonrejectors.Conclusions:Differences in TAC[CD3]and TAC[CD14]between patients with and without rejection could not be demonstrated. However, further optimization of the cell isolation process is required because a difference in TAC[PBMC]between fresh and cryopreserved cells was observed.

The proposed framework is a direct coordinate regression approach leveraging a Transformer network to better utilize the spatial information in a feature map. An LOTR model consists of three main modules: 1) a visual backbone that converts an input image into a feature map, 2) a Transformer module that improves the feature representation from the visual backbone, and 3) a landmark prediction head that directly predicts landmark coordinates from the Transformer's representation. Given cropped-and-aligned face images, the proposed LOTR can be trained end-to-end without requiring any post-processing steps. This paper also introduces a loss function named smooth-Wing loss, which addresses the gradient discontinuity of the Wing loss, leading to better convergence than standard loss functions such as L1, L2, and Wing loss. Experimental results on the JD landmark dataset provided by the First Grand Challenge of 106-Point Facial Landmark Localization indicate the superiority of LOTR over the existing methods on the leaderboard and two recent heatmap-based approaches. On the WFLW dataset, the proposed LOTR framework demonstrates promising results compared with several state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we report an improvement in the performance of state-of-the-art face recognition systems when using our proposed LOTRs for face alignment.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

METHODS: Twenty-four dentists performed a one-visit endodontic treatment of an upper molar in a phantom head model. A video was recorded to evaluate the dentists᾽ neck postures using the Modified-Dental Operator Posture Assessment Instrument (M-DOPAI) and treatment duration. The M-DOPAI divides the dentists᾽ neck postures into three categories: acceptable, compromised, or harmful posture. The participants rated their ND using Borg᾽s CR-10 scale every 10 min. and at the end of each treatment step. The relationships between neck posture/treatment duration and Borg᾽s CR-10 scores were examined using partial correlation. RESULTS: The number of compromised and harmful neck postures during the endodontic procedure (r = 0.43, P =.04) and treatment duration (r = 0.58 P =.005) significantly correlated with ND at the end of treatment. The number of compromised and harmful neck postures during the OC step (r = 0.75, P <.001) and the duration of the OC step (r =.70, P <.001) significantly correlated with ND at the end of the step. CONCLUSION: Poor neck postures and long working duration during endodontic treatment correlated with ND among inexperienced dentists.

Target-based approaches on attractive drug targets, such as Plasmodium serine hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMTs) exhibiting distinct structure and function as well as kinetic mechanisms from the human enzyme homologue, are highly useful methods to be used for bypassing the present resistance in the field. Herein, 500-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to investigate the mode of action of pyrazolopyran(+)-85 and pyrazolopyran(+)-86 with the most attractive inhibition efficiency in Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax SHMTs (in the Schiff base form of PLP-L-serine (PLS) bound enzyme). The binding free energy results indicated the binding affinity of pyrazolopyran(+)-86 to Plasmodium SHMTs that is more favorable than pyrazolopyran(+)-85 by ∼ 2 kcal⋅mol−1, supported by the stronger ligand–protein hydrogen bonding and the lower solvent accessibility within the enzyme active site. According to the per-residue decomposition free energy analysis, residues L124, G128, H129, L130, K139, N356, and T357 are essential for inhibitors binding. By the rational structure-based drug design, the isopropyl moiety on the pyrazolopyran core should be changed to the negatively charged group (e.g., carboxylate group) for interacting with the positively charged residue R371. Alternatively, the phenolic compounds could be substituted with a phenyl or piperidine ring to promote hydrogen bond formation with the surrounding residues. Therefore, our findings presented here provide insights into the mode of inhibition of pyrazolopyran-based inhibitors and rational ideas for designing novel antimalarial drugs targeting Plasmodium SHMTs.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The study group comprised 257 cases (28.8% female; 13.2% aged ≥ 60 years; 10.5% with fractures; 39.7% with involvement of nasal/oral/orbital tissue [viral reservoir organs, VROs]; 81.3% with blunt trauma; 19.1% developed an SSI [vs 6.8% in the control group]) with a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (16.6) years (range 19–87). There was a significant relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and SSI events (p<0.0001; odds ratio 3.22; 95% confidence interval 2.17 to 4.78). On subgroup analysis, SSIs significantly increased with age ≥ 60 years, presence and treatment of fracture, contact with VROs, and prolonged antibiotic use (PAU). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed a positive effect only from old age, contact with VROs, and PAU (relative risk = 1.56, 2.52, and 2.03, respectively; r = 0.49; p = 0.0001). There was a significant 2.8-fold increase in SSIs among AS/MS-COVID cases, especially in those aged ≥ 60 years, or those with injuries to VROs, or both, who therefore required PAU.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"
Regional Differences in Admissions and Treatment Outcomes for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients in Thailand,"Kitiyakara T., Leerapun A., Sutthivanan C., Poovorawan K., Pan-Ngum W., Soonthornworasiri N., Chaiteerakij R., Treeprasertsuk S., Phaoswasdi K., Mairiang P., Kositchaiwat C.",2022-01-01,"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Radiofrequency Ablation, Thailand, Treatment Outcome, Chemoembolization, Hepatectomy, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Liver neoplasms, Survival","Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest cancers in Thailand. We report the stage and survival of patients who were admitted under the public universal health fund (NHSO) covering 47 million people to determine if there were regional disparities in the treatment outcomes in the country. Method: We used the 2009-2013 Nationwide Hospital Admission Data, Thailand. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were identified by the ICD10 code C22.0. Procedures were identified by ICD9-CM codes, and deaths were confirmed from the NHSO database and the national citizen registry. Thailand is divided into 6 regions and Bangkok. Hospitals were identified according to their specific reimbursement codes. Survival time started from the day of first admission and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical method used to compare regions was Chi-squared tests (Pearson, likelihood ratio, linear-by linear association and Mantel-cox). Results: There were 36,956 HCC patients admitted during the study period. The overall median survival was 36 days. 1.63% of the patients had surgery, 0.96% had radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and 5.24% had trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). 90.24% did not have any tumor-specific therapy. The proportion of patients admitted for tumor-specific therapy vs. no tumor-specific therapy was significantly different between regions in all treatment modalities (p<0.01). Each treatment modality showed a wide range of median survival values across the regions (p<0.01). The best survival was seen in Bangkok, the South and the North (for surgery, RFA and TACE) and was often more than twice as long as the regions with the lowest survival, Central, East and West. Conclusions: There was a large previously-unreported disparity in admissions and outcomes in Thailand for different treatment modalities for HCC. Bangkok and the South had the best treatment outcomes and often had median survivals more than twice as long as those in the West and East. Public policy to reduce this disparity will need to be implemented in the future.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

An additional aim was to examine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of expert and novice assessors using the block method. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we enrolled 62 participants with hyperkyphosis aged ≥10 years, with hyperkyphosis defined as one or more blocks. The participants were stratified by age (<60 years and ≥60 years). To determine concurrent validity, and kyphosis was assessed in all the participants using the block method and Cobb’s method. Finally, 15 participants were included in a reliability study. To determine intra- and inter-rater reliability, each participant was assessed twice, 7 days apart, by one expert and one novice using the block method. Results: The concurrent validity of the block method and gold standard method showed moderate correlation (rs = 0.53, P < .001). However, after stratifying the participants by age (<60 years and ≥60 years), there was small to moderate correlation (rs = 0.42, P = .006, and rs = 0.64, P = .002, respectively). The intra- and inter-rater reliability of the expert and novice assessors was excellent (ICC3,1 = 0.82–0.97, P < .001). Conclusions: The findings showed small correlation in those <60 and moderate correlation in those ≥60 years, and reported excellent reliability. The block method can be used by novices with strong reliability.

SF is a natural protein, well known for its good biocompatibility and biodegradability but it has poor mechanical properties compared to synthetic polymers. SF contains proteins which can promote cell adhesion and cell proliferation required for a tissue engineering scaffold. PLA is a popular material that is widely used in tissue engineering. It provides high mechanical properties but lacks bioactivity and cell affinity. Thus, a PLA/SF composite scaffold can improve these drawbacks. In this study, PLA/SF nanofibers were fabricated using an electrospinning process at various PLA and SF ratios (PLA: SF 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75). The SF content in the emulsion dominated the fiber diameter, fiber arrangement and processibility of nanofibrous scaffold. With increasing SF content, the %elongation at break of PLA/SF scaffold increased but Young's modulus decreased. The wettability of electrospun PLA was increased with an increase in SF content.","mixing and separation, physics",Physics and Astronomy (all)

Ba/AC was prepared by in-situ regeneration of amorphous cellulose from eucalyptus pulp and office waste paper with barium chloride. The shielding sheets were prepared by mixing vulcanized natural rubber with Ba/AC using both office waste paper (NR-W) and purified eucalyptus pulp (NR-E) and were compared to barium sulfate powder (NR-P) used as a conventional material. NR-W and NR-E exhibited a predominant attenuation property compared to that of NR-P. The amorphous cellulose surrounded by barium sulfate is essential in distributing and reducing the aggregation of barium sulfate particles. This behavior results in most incident X-ray beams being effectively absorbed. Subsequently, prototypes were fabricated using NR-W and NR-E with a thickness of 0.25-mm Pb in accordance with the quality standards of medical diagnostic X-ray machines in Thailand. The head, thyroid, and breast shields were produced to protect from direct X-ray beams. Additionally, a lab coat was prepared to block scattered beams. Finally, the fabricated X-ray shielding prototypes are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and nontoxic.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics",Radiation

However, for many patients, the application and removal of the NPWT is source of procedural pain. The authors hypothesized that administering cold sterile water into the NPWT sponge would decrease pain during dressing changes. A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on 27 patients who were undergoing 81 NPWT wound dressing changes (n = 81) at a single institution between October 2016 and September 2017. Each patient had 3 NPWT dressing changes. Cold sterile water (5.74 °C), room temperature sterile water (26.89 °C), and nothing were randomized and administered in the NPWT tubing into the sponge 10 minutes before changing the dressing in each and every procedure. Pain scores were assessed using a 0 to 10 numeric pain scale. Patients administered with cold water reported less pain than those administered with room temperature sterile water during the dressing change (4 vs 5.67; P <.003), and much less pain than those with nothing instilled before dressing change (4 vs 6.59; P <.001). There is no statistically significant difference in pain score between using the room temperature sterile water group and the control group that instilled nothing (5.67 vs 6.59; P =.065). This study has shown that cold water administered through the suction tubing before the dressing change had a better reduction in pain score than using room temperature sterile water and the control group.",medical,Surgery

The NCL disorders are, collectively, the most common group of degenerative brain disorders in children. Patient Descriptions: We report two cases of CLN disease that were diagnosed and treated at the Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Both cases of CLN disease (CLN1 and CLN6 diagnosed in 2016 and 2017, respectively) profiled in this report presented with clinical features of Rett syndrome. In the first case, a 2-year-old girl presented with Rett-like clinical features, including global developmental regression and hand-wringing action. Single-gene analysis of the MECP2 gene was negative. However, PPT1 gene sequencing revealed a novel homozygous frameshift mutation, c.629_630dupGT (p.Ile211Valfs∗10). In the second case, a 7.5-year-old girl presented with ataxia, progressive myoclonic epilepsy, and Rett-like hand-wringing. A c.794_796delCCT variant in the CLN6 gene was identified by whole-exome sequencing. Fingerprint bodies from electron microscopy of the skin also supported a diagnosis of CLN disease in our second case. Discussion: Presentation with clinical features of Rett syndrome has only been reported in patients diagnosed with CLN1 and CLN7 disease, and never in those with CLN6. Conclusions: Physicians should suspect and investigate for CLN disease in patients with Rett-like phenotype who are negative for MECP2 mutation, especially in patients with visual impairment and early prominent brain atrophy.","medical, neuroscience","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Neurology, Developmental Neuroscience, Neurology (clinical)"

In this work, the electrochemical activity of H3O+ is inhibited by the supramolecular host–guest complex composed of H3O+ as guest and 18-crown-6 as host. The even Zn plating is induced by the host–guest complex electrostatic shielding layer on Zn anode, as detected by in-situ optical microscopy. The lamellar Zn is plated which profits from the improved Zn plating behavior. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation presents the stable structure of complex. The less produced H2 content is monitored online by a mass spectrometer during Zn plating/stripping, which indicates HER can be hampered by the host–guest behavior. Thus, the ZIBs with long life and high Coulombic efficiency are achieved via introducing 18-crown-6. The proposed host–guest supramolecular interaction is expected to facilitate the furthermore development of Zn batteries.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

While some generated slogans can be catchy, they are often not coherent with the company's focus or style across their marketing communications because the skeletons are mined from other companies' slogans. We propose a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) Transformer model to generate slogans from a brief company description. A naïve seq2seq model fine-tuned for slogan generation is prone to introducing false information. We use company name delexicalisation and entity masking to alleviate this problem and improve the generated slogans' quality and truthfulness. Furthermore, we apply conditional training based on the first words' part-of-speech tag to generate syntactically diverse slogans. Our best model achieved a ROUGE-1/-2/-L <![CDATA[ $\mathrm{F}_1$ ]]> score of 35.58/18.47/33.32.

The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by thorough analysis of their 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data. The relative and absolute configurations of acrotrione B were determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Acrotrione B is an unusual, oxidized xanthenoid with a cyclohexadienone core that has not been previously reported. It thus represents a new skeletal type within the xanthenoid class. Acrotrione B (1) exhibited anti-proliferative activity against Hela (IC 50= 16.0 μM) and A549 (IC 50= 16.3 μM) cell lines. 5′-Prenylacrovestone (4) and acrovestone (5) were even more potent with IC 50values of 5.1 μM and 0.77 μM, respectively, against Hela cells and 11.8 μM and 1.13 μM, respectively, against A549 cells. Moreover, acrotrione B (1) displayed moderate antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis, with MIC values in the range of 16-64 μg/mL.

To early detection and control of DTMUV, the well-validated diagnostic tests for efficient detection of DTMUV infection in ducks are needed. In this study, we validated and compared hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) tests for identifying antibodies against DTMUV in duck serum samples. Our results demonstrated that HI and IFA tests can both be used to detect antibodies against DTMUV in duck serum samples with high sensitivity (100%), specificity (>87%) and overall agreement with the gold standard serum neutralization (SN) test (>90%). Additionally, DTMUV-specific antibody titres determined by HI and IFA tests correlated well with the neutralizing antibody titres obtained by SN test. No cross-reactivity against common duck viruses and other flaviviruses was observed in both tests. It is interesting to note that HI test had higher diagnostic specificity and exhibited a stronger positive correlation with SN test than IFA test. Evaluating the performance of HI and IFA tests with experimental and field serum samples revealed that both tests showed comparable performance with SN test in terms of antibody kinetic and detection rate. Collectively, these findings support the use of both tests, particularly HI test, as the alternative to SN test for measuring the antibody responses against DTMUV in ducks. These tests could be the suitable choices for DTMUV diagnosis, epidemiological study and vaccine efficacy evaluation.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Site investigation using standard penetration test and shear wave velocity measurement is conducted. Finite element liquefaction site response analysis integrated with a strain space multiple mechanism model is conducted. Ground motions variation is considered based on the seismic record at surrounding seismic stations. Attenuation analysis is conducted to determine the scaling factor for ground motions. Several results, such as acceleration profiles and cyclic behaviours are presented. The empirical analysis is also conducted to verify the results of the numerical analysis. The results explained that cyclic behaviours of sandy layers in the Izumio site show the liquefaction tendency. The results also showed that sandy layers are indicated as critical layers during the strong earthquake due to the excess pore water pressure reaching the liquefaction threshold. The results of the empirical analysis also present liquefaction indication at sand layers under the variation of ground motion, since the factor of safety against liquefaction is less than 1. The results are generally well-agree with liquefaction evidence and prediction presented in the previous study. The results could bring practical importance in understanding liquefaction potential in the study area.","engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Characteristics and triggers may be different in different geographical regions. Studies focusing on food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) in Asian developing countries are limited. Our study aimed to study characteristics of FIA in a tertiary care center in an Asian developing country. Methods: Retrospective review of pediatric anaphylaxis admission and outpatient visit at a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during 2008-2018 was performed. Data regarding clinical presentation, place reaction occurred, time of onset, investigations (serum tryptase, specific immunoglobulin E, and skin test), treatment, and follow-up periods were collected. Results: One hundred seventy-four anaphylaxis admission records of which 61 episodes of FIA were retrieved. Data from outpatients visit consisted of 17 patients. Most patients were male (76.7%). The median age was 7.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-12.4). The major causes of FIA were shrimp/shellfish (37%), wheat (15.1%), and cow's milk (11%). Food causing anaphylaxis varied according to age-group: infants had anaphylactic reactions to egg, wheat, and cow's milk, preschools to wheat and peanut, and older children to shrimp/shellfish. Cutaneous manifestations occurred in all patients, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms (83.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50.8%). There was no biphasic anaphylaxis reported. Elevated serum tryptase was found in only 4 patients (7%). Conclusion: Recognizing characteristics of pediatric FIA is crucial. The common causes of FIA in our study in Asian children were egg in infants, wheat and peanut in preschool children, and shrimp/shellfish in school-age children and adolescents.

In this work, the photocurrent generation via PEC oxidation of methanol was studied using surface-modified TiO2-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as a photoanode in combination with CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) dispersed in an electrolyte solution. Detailed studies revealed that surface modification of the TiO2 layer was crucial for good interfacial adhesion of CsPbBr3 QDs, which were surrounded by hydrophobic ligands, with the TiO2 surface. Self-assembled monolayers of octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) were applied on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the change of hydrophilic nature to a superhydrophobic surface. The photoluminescence measurement of the ODPA-modified TiO2/FTO photoanode demonstrated a significantly higher photoluminescence intensity than that of the unmodified one, indicating that CsPbBr3 QDs were well adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The photocurrent was generated via methanol oxidation by holes in CsPbBr3 QDs. The current-voltage measurements revealed that in the presence of methanol, the current density was increased from 1.2 mA/cm2 (without methanol) to the maximum of 1.6 mA/cm2 under visible light irradiation, indicating that methanol was a sacrificial hole scavenger. Electrons in QDs were injected into the photoanode which led to enhanced charge separation and PEC performance.

This can be applied to drawing group-level brain connectivity inferences from a homogeneous group of subjects or discovering network differences among groups of signals collected under heterogeneous conditions. By recognizing that the GC of a single multivariate time series can be characterized by common zeros of vector autoregressive (VAR) lag coefficients, a group sparse prior is included in joint regularized least-squares estimations of multiple VAR models. Group-norm regularizations based on group- and fused-lasso penalties encourage a decomposition of multiple networks into a common GC structure, with other remaining parts defined in individual-specific networks. Prior information about sparseness and sparsity patterns of desired GC networks are incorporated as relative weights, while a non-convex group norm in the penalty is proposed to enhance the accuracy of network estimation in low-sample settings. Extensive numerical results on simulations illustrated our method's improvements over existing sparse estimation approaches on GC network sparsity recovery. Our methods were also applied to available resting-state fMRI time series from the ADHD-200 data sets to learn the differences of causality mechanisms, called effective brain connectivity, between adolescents with ADHD and typically developing children. Our analysis revealed that parts of the causality differences between the two groups often resided in the orbitofrontal region and areas associated with the limbic system, which agreed with clinical findings and data-driven results in previous studies.","fluidex; related topics, neuroscience, computer science","Cognitive Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence"

Herein, we demonstrated the preparation of polymethyl methacrylate-grafted natural rubber (PMMA-g-NR) powders through emulsion polymerization followed by spray drying and investigated its impact reinforcement effect after blending with polylactic acid (PLA). The effects of feeding order, initiator concentration (CHPO/TEPA), monomer concentration (MMA) and reaction time on the grafting efficiency and yield were investigated. 1H-NMR and FTIR analyses confirmed the formation of PMMA-g-NR powder with high grafting efficiency (∼85%). TEM observations revealed the core-shell structure of the composite powder particles. DSC and TGA analyses proved that the PMMA-g-NR powder possessed improved thermal properties compared to neat NR. Impact strength of PLA/PMMA-g-NR blends were improved by 4.5-fold by the spray-dried composite powder prepared using 25 phr MMA and 1 phr CHPO/TEPA with 5 hours reaction time. The enhanced mechanical properties were attributed to the microstructures and high surface areas of PMMA-g-NR powder.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

The hemocompatibility of this SF is one of the important characteristics that have impacts on such applications. In this study, the hemocompatibility of Thai SF was investigated and its improvement by low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) immobilization was demonstrated. Endothelial cell proliferation on the SF and LMWH immobilized SF (Hep/SF) samples with or without fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was also evaluated. According to hemocompatibility evaluation, Thai SF did not accelerate clotting time, excess stimulate complement and leukocyte activation, and was considered a non-hemolysis material compared to the negative control PTFE sheet. Platelet adhesion of SF film was comparable to that of the PTFE sheet. For hemocompatibility enhancement, LMWH was immobilized successfully and could improve the surface hydrophilicity of SF films. The Hep/SF films demonstrated prolonged clotting time and slightly lower complement and leukocyte activation. However, the Hep/SF films could not suppress platelet adhesion. The Hep/SF films demonstrated endothelial cell proliferation enhancement, particularly with FGF-2 addition. This study provides fundamental information for the further development of Thai SF as a hemocompatible biomaterial.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Classification of stillbirth by the International Classification of Diseases for Perinatal Mortality using a sequential approach: A 20-year retrospective study from Thailand,"Taweevisit M., Nimitpanya P., Thorner P.S.",2022-05-01,"Cause of Death, Female, Humans, International Classification of Diseases, Perinatal Death, Perinatal Mortality, Placenta, Pregnancy, Retrospective Studies, Stillbirth, Thailand, autopsy, International Classification of Diseases, perinatal death, placenta, stillbirth","Aim: The International Classification of Diseases for Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM) is a system for recording causes of perinatal death. In this system, placental pathology is considered a “maternal condition” and this category does not cover the spectrum of placental pathology that can impact on perinatal death. The aim of the study was to apply a wider spectrum of placental pathology as a separate parameter for classifying death in the ICD-PM. Methods: All autopsy reports at a single institution over a 20-year period (2001–2020) were reviewed. Causes of stillbirth were analyzed in a sequential manner: step 1, clinical history and laboratory results; step 2, placenta; and step 3, autopsy; and classified at each step according to the ICD-PM. Results: The review identified 330 cases, including 126 antepartum and 204 intrapartum deaths. Step 1 identified a cause in 176 (86%) intrapartum deaths and 64 (51%) antepartum deaths. The addition of placental pathology (step 2) changed the cause of death in 12% of cases, with causes now identified in 190 (93%) intrapartum and 89 (71%) antepartum deaths. Adding step 3 did not identify any additional causes of death. Conclusion: The accuracy of the ICD-PM classification is dependent on the data available. Placental pathology made a significant difference in assigning causes of death in our series, stressing the importance of placental examination. Determination of the cause of death based on clinical history and laboratory data alone may be inaccurate, and less useful for comparative studies and planning prenatal care.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology

Because of the ease of maintaining rodent malaria parasites in laboratory mice, many genetic crosses of rodent malaria parasites have been performed to map the parasite genes contributing to malaria parasite development, drug resistance, host immune response, and disease pathogenesis. Drs. Richard Carter, David Walliker, and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh, UK, were the pioneers in developing the systems for genetic mapping of malaria parasite traits, including characterization of genetic markers to follow the inheritance and recombination of parasite chromosomes and performing the first genetic cross using rodent malaria parasites. Additionally, many genetic crosses of inbred mice have been performed to link mouse chromosomal loci to the susceptibility to malaria parasite infections. In this chapter, we review and discuss past and recent advances in genetic marker development, performing genetic crosses, and genetic mapping of both parasite and host genes. Genetic mappings using models of rodent malaria parasites and inbred mice have contributed greatly to our understanding of malaria, including parasite development within their hosts, mechanism of drug resistance, and host-parasite interaction.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Currently, there is no available effective therapy for PD; thus, novel therapeutic agents such as natural antioxidants with neuroprotective effects are emerging. Alpha-mangostin (αM) is a xanthone derivative compound from mangosteen peel with a cytoprotective effect depicted in neurodegenerative disease models. However, αM has low aqueous solubility and low biodistribution in the brain. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have been used to encapsulate bioactive compounds delivered to target organs to improve the oral bioavailability and effectiveness. This study aimed to investigate the effect of αM and αM encapsulated in NLC (αM-NLC) in mice with rotenone-induced PD-like neurodegeneration. Forty male ICR mice were divided into normal, PD, PD + αM, and PD + αM-NLC groups. Vehicle, αM (25 mg/kg/48 h), and αM-NLC (25 mg/kg/48 h) were orally administered, along with PD induction by intraperitoneal injection of rotenone (2.5 mg/kg/48 h) for 4 consecutive weeks. Motor abilities were assessed once a week using rotarod and hanging wire tests. Biochemical analysis of brain oxidative status was conducted, and neuronal populations in substantia nigra par compacta (SNc), striatum, and motor cortex were evaluated using Nissl staining. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining of SNc and striatum was also evaluated. Results showed that rotenone significantly induced motor deficits concurrent with significant SNc, striatum, and motor cortex neuronal reduction and significantly decreased TH intensity in SNc (p < 0.05). The significant reduction of brain superoxide dismutase activity (p < 0.05) was also detected. Administrations of αM and αM-NLC significantly reduced motor deficits, prevented the reduction of TH intensity in SNc and striatum, and prevented the reduction of neurons in SNc (p < 0.05). Only αM-NLC significantly prevented the reduction of neurons in both striatum and motor cortex (p < 0.05). These were found concurrent with significantly reduced malondialdehyde level and increased catalase and superoxide dismutase activities (p < 0.05). Therefore, this study depicted the neuroprotective effect of αM and αM-NLC against rotenone-induced PD-like neurodegeneration in mice. We indicated an involvement of NLC, emphasizing the protective effect of αM against oxidative stress. Moreover, αM-NLC exhibited broad protection against rotenone-induced neurodegeneration that was not limited to nigrostriatal structures and emphasized the benefit of NLC in enhancing αM neuroprotective effects.","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The prepared α-Bi2O3/TiO2 composites revealed higher photocatalytic activity for the conversion of glycerol (88.7%) compared with TiO2 (69.7%) under ultraviolet irradiation at 8 h which could be attributed to their relative positions of the energy bands. Nevertheless, all the Bi2O3/TiO2 heterostructures had the same photocatalytic transformation of glycerol and gave similar distribution of generated valuable products.

This study performed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify differentially expressed genes from white shrimp Penaeus vannamei hemocyte upon VPAHPND infection. Among the immune-related genes identified, Vago5, kunitz, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, and profilin are the most abundant genes classified as the up-regulated genes in the SSH library. The qRT-PCR results show that only Vago5 was highly up-regulated at 3 and 6 h post-VPAHPND challenge, whereas kunitz, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, and profilin were highly up-regulated at 48 h post-VPAHPND challenge. As an early VPAHPND infection-responsive gene, Vago5 was further functional characterized by RNA interference. Knockdown of Vago5 gene resulted in the significantly rapid increase of shrimp mortality and the number of bacteria in the stomach and hepatopancreas upon VPAHPND infection. Moreover, downstream genes of Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT pathways and phenoloxidase system were analyzed for the expression in the VPAHPND-infected shrimp hemocyte after dsVago5 treatment. Vago5 gene knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in transcript levels of PEN4, TNF, and PO2 genes as well as PO activity in the hemolymph, suggesting that Vago5 might modulate antibacterial infection through activation of the genes in the NF-κB mediated pathways, JAK/STAT pathway, and phenoloxidase system.","environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

This work aims to isolate valuable secondary metabolites from an orchid species (Dendrobium heterocarpum) and evaluate their possible roles in the growth and differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Six compounds were isolated from the orchid’s methanolic extracts and identified as amoenylin (1), methyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate (2), 3,4-dihydroxy-5,4’-dimethoxybibenzyl (3), dendrocandin B (4), dendrofalconerol A (5), and syringaresinol (6). Among these phytochemicals, compounds 2, 3, and 6 exhibited lower effects on the viability of 3T3-L1 cells, offering non-cytotoxic concentrations of ≲ 10 µM. Compared to others tested, compound 3 was responsible for the maximum reduction of lipid storage in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (IC50 = 6.30 ± 0.10 µM). A set of protein expression studies unveiled that compound 3 at non-cytotoxic doses could suppress the expression of some key transcription factors in adipocyte differentiation (i.e., PPARγ and C/EBPα). Furthermore, this compound could deactivate some proteins involved in the MAPK pathways (i.e., JNK, ERK, and p38). Our findings prove that D. heterocarpum is a promising source to explore bioactive molecules capable of modulating adipocytic growth and development, which can potentially be assessed and innovated further as pharmaceutical products to defeat obesity.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Methods: Radiation dose quantity as kerma-area-product (KAP) and cumulative air-kerma at reference point (CAK) from 76 catheterization labs in 38 hospitals in PCI registry of Thailand was transferred online to central data management. Sixteen months data (May 2018 to August 2019) was analyzed. We also investigated role of different factors that influence radiation dose the most. Results: Analysis of 22,737 PCIs resulted in national DRLs for PCI of 91.3 Gy.cm2 (KAP) and 1360 mGy (CAK). The NDRLs for KAP for type C, B2, B1 and A lesions were 106.8, 82.6, 67.9, and 45.3 Gy.cm2 respectively and for CAK, 1705, 1247, 962, and 790 mGy respectively. Thus, as compared to lesion A, lesion C had more than double the dose and B2 had nearly 1.6 times and B1 had 1.2 times CAK. Our DRL values are lower than other Asian countries like Japan and Korea and are in the middle range of Western countries. University hospital had significantly higher dose than private or public hospital possibly because of higher load of complex procedures in university hospitals and trainees performing the procedures. Transradial approach showed lower doses than transfemoral approach. Conclusions: This large multi-centric study established DRLs for PCIs which can act as reference for future studies. A hallmark of our study is establishment of reference levels for coronary lesions classified as per ACC/AHA and thus for different complexities.","biochemistryistry, medical, physics","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Physics and Astronomy (all)"

Many studies have revealed that several compounds can attenuate oxidative stress, suppress survival and proliferative signals, and diminish or suppress cancer stem cells (CSCs). These may provide novel lead compounds for drug development and benefit cancer therapy. The important pharmacological shift in anticancer therapy is the transition of drug discovery for cytotoxic drugs toward targeted therapy and more specific therapy like CSC-targeted therapy. Cancer-driven signaling, as well as survival pathways, have become vital targets for targeted therapeutic drug action. Furthermore, in aggressive cancers, such as lung cancer, it was shown that CSCs drive cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic failure. Moreover, plant-derived compounds are found as a component in diet and are considered safe. Here, we review cancer-protective elements found in plants, including phenolic compounds such as curcumin, carotenoids (β-carotene and lycopene), epigallocatechin-3-gallate, ginsenoside Rg3, resveratrol, and sulforaphane, for their possible anticancer, anti-metastasis, and cancer-preventive actions against lung cancer, especially in clinical and molecular pharmacological approaches. This review comprehensively summarizes the anticancer properties, target proteins, and CSC suppression capabilities of these plant-derived compounds that may potentially benefit the development of novel anticancer drugs or dietary recommendations for patients with lung cancer.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

The scheme involves two main steps: model estimation and model inference to estimate brain connectivity. The model estimation performs a subspace identification and active source selection based on group-norm regularized least-squares. The model inference relies on the concept of state-space GC that requires solving a Riccati equation for the covariance of estimation error. We verify the performance on simulated datasets that represent realistic human brain activities under several conditions, including percentages and location of active sources, and the number of EEG electrodes. Our model's accuracy in estimating connectivity is compared with a two-stage approach using source reconstructions and a VAR-based Granger analysis. Our method achieved better performances than the two-stage approach under the assumptions that the true source dynamics are sparse and generated from state-space models. When the method was applied to a real EEG SSVEP dataset, the temporal lobe was found to be a mediating connection between the temporal and occipital areas, which agreed with findings in previous studies.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence"

A lack of reliable information on the differences between 24- and 12-h shifts on care quality, nursing care quality, patient safety, and adverse and missed events warranted investigation in Cambodia. Aim: We aimed to examine the impacts of 12-h shifts compared with 24-h shifts. The purpose was to find evidence to support the use of maximum 12-h shifts by registered nurses working in ICU contexts. Method: A convergent mixed-method approach was chosen to highlight the issues around the long hours of shift work. We designed a 12-week coaching course during the implementation of 12-h shifts and assigned 30 nurses each to an experimental group and a control group. Data from quantitative surveying of 58 participants were combined with focus group discussions of 20 participants to gather qualitative insights. Pre- and post-test analysis involved descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon sign rank test for quantitative analysis and then merged with qualitative findings from content analysis. Reporting of this study was steered by the STROBE and COREQ guidelines for quantitative and qualitative findings, respectively. Results: Quantitative results showed the increased quality of nursing work-life, nursing care quality, and patient satisfaction; decreased missed care and adverse events were significantly associated with the 12-h shift. Qualitative data supported nurses preferring 12-h rather than 24-h shift options. Discussion and conclusions: Changing rosters to 12-h shifts in the intervention caused increases in the study variables’ scores. Results indicate the benefits of 12-h shifts on the quality of nursing work-life, nursing care quality, missed care, adverse events, and patient safety. Implications for nursing and nursing policy: We found that 24-h shifts had deleterious impacts on care quality and safety and nurse satisfaction with work. Health and nursing policymakers are urged to provide resources and strategize to implement 12 h shifts as soon as possible since the current 24-h shifts of nurses affect the patient quality of care and their health and safety and that of the nurses.",Nursing,Nursing (all)

Sericin hydrolysates consisted of sericin-related peptides in differing amounts and smaller sizes compared with unhydrolyzed sericin, as respectively demonstrated by peptidomic and SDS-PAGE analysis. The lower half-maximum inhibitory concentration (9.05 ± 0.66 mg/mL) compared with unhydrolyzed sericin indicated a potent effect of sericin hydrolysates on the diminution of melanin content in human melanoma MNT1 cells. Not only inhibiting enzymatic activity but also a downregulated expression level of tyrosinase was evident in MNT1 cells incubated with 20 mg/mL sericin hydrolysates. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed the decreased mRNA level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a tyrosinase transcription factor, which correlated with the reduction of pCREB/CREB, an upstream cascade, as assessed by Western blot analysis in MNT1 cells cultured with 20 mg/mL sericin hydrolysates for 12 h. Interestingly, treatment with sericin hydrolysates for 6–24 h also upregulated pERK, a molecule that triggers MITF degradation, in human melanin-producing cells.

The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) of fAUC/MIC was 60.4 (43.5-84.0) and 103.2 (70.1-151.8) in the WHO and higher-than-WHO dosage groups, respectively. There was no adverse event of QT prolongation or any other grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Conclusion: Levofloxacin at a higher dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day could achieve the fAUC/MIC target in children.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Hypothesis: Obesity is associated with higher complication rates and higher admission trend for AF ablation. Methods: We drew data from the US National Inpatient Sample to identify patients who underwent AF ablation between 2005 and 2018. Sociodemographic and patients' characteristics data were collected, and the trend, incidence of catheter ablation complications and mortality were analyzed, and further stratified by obesity classification. Results: A total of 153 429 patients who were hospitalized for AF ablation were estimated. Among these, 11 876 obese patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11 422–12 330) and 10 635 morbid obese patients (95% CI: 10 200–11 069) were observed. There was a substantial uptrend admission, up to fivefold, for AF ablation in all obese patients from 2005 to 2018 (p <.001). Morbidly obese patients were statistically younger, while coexisting comorbidities were substantially higher than both obese and nonobese patients (p <.01) Both obesity and morbid obesity were significantly associated with an increased risk of total bleeding, and vascular complications (p <.05). Only morbid obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of ablation-related complications, total infection, and pulmonary complications (p <.01). No difference in-hospital mortality was observed among obese, morbidly obese, and nonobese patients. Conclusion: Our study observed an uptrend in the admission of obese patients undergoing AF ablation from 2005 through 2018. Obesity was associated with higher ablation-related complications, particularly those who were morbidly obese.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Nutritional Support with Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Burn Patients: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Siritientong T., Thet D., Buangbon M., Nokehoon P., Leelakanok N., Methaneethorn J., Angspatt A., Meevassana J.",2022-07-01,"Burns, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Fish Oils, Humans, Nutritional Support, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, burn, fish oil, meta-analysis, nutrition, omega-3 fatty acid","Background: In burn patients, the profound effect of nutritional support on improved wound healing and a reduced rate of hospitalization and mortality has been documented. Fish oil as a primary source of omega-3 fatty acids in nutritional support may attenuate the inflammatory response and enhance immune function; however, unclear effects on the improvement of clinical outcomes in burn patients remain. Methods: The systematic literature review was conducted by searching the electronic databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to assess the randomized controlled trials of nutritional support with omega-3 fatty acids compared to control diets in patients that presented with burns from any causes. Results: Seven trials were included in this meta-analysis. We found no significant differences in length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.59), mortality (p = 0.86), ventilation days (p = 0.16), gastrointestinal complications—e.g., constipation and diarrhea (p = 0.73)—or infectious complications—e.g., pneumonia and sepsis (p = 0.22)—between the omega-3-fatty-acid-receiving group and the control/other diets group. Conclusions: We did not find a benefit of omega-3 support in reducing the various complications, mortality and LOS in burn patients. Further studies are necessary to find the effect of nutritional support with omega-3 fatty acids over low-fat diets in this population.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Simultaneous irradiation grafting by gamma ray was performed. A 40-µm thick LDPE sheet submerged in the acrylonitrile (AN): methacrylic acid (MAA) solution of 60: 40 v/v% with the optimal gamma ray dose of 40 kGy showed the highest cografting degree of 85.28% and the highest amidoxime group density of 4.38 mol/kg. The field study was performed along the coastal area of the Gulf of Thailand. After 56 days of soaking, the highest adsorption capacity reached 1.79 g-U/kg-adsorbent. The reusability study for up to 6 cycles revealed about 20% of the adsorption capacity remaining in the last cycle. The study demonstrated that recycled LDPE sheets can be utilized as a substrate to synthesize uranium absorbers. It showed an acceptable uranium loading with good reusability in natural seawater environment. This method of reusing discarded LDPE sheets also helps alleviate environmental issues of non-degradable plastic wastes.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, physics, energy","Nuclear and High Energy Physics, Nuclear Energy and Engineering"

The recommended treatment for this is hamate hook excision. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hand grip strength after hamate hook resection at different levels. Six cadaver forearm flexor digitorum profundus tendons were loaded with 5- to 15-kilograms force and grip strength was subsequently measured. The same measurements were performed in five hamate hook conditions: normal, one-third, two-thirds, total hamate excision, and after perihamate ligament reconstruction. Multilevel mixed-effect models were used to calculate the scaling ratios after each surgical intervention and compared them to a normal hamate hook. A 25%, 36%, 47% reduction, and 7% increase (107% of baseline) in grip strength was found after one-third, two-thirds, total bone was resected, and after perihamate ligament reconstruction, respectively. The study shows an association between grip strength reduction and the level of hamate hook resection. Perihamate ligament reconstruction is recommended as it restores grip strength to normal.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, medical, engineering","Biophysics, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Rehabilitation"

Molecular international prognostic scoring system (M-IPSS) has been recently developed combining somatic mutations and clinical information being used in the revised international prognostic scoring system (R-IPSS). Objective: We aimed to explore the performances of M-IPSS and R-IPSS in Thai patients with MDS. Method: MDS patients were stratified into risk categories using R-IPSS and M-IPSS scores. The performance of both models were evaluated for prognostic prediction. Results: One hundred and sixty-two MDS patients were recruited from the multicenter study. Survival analysis revealed that both R-IPSS and M-IPSS were good prediction models with the Concordance Index (C-index) of 0.71 (95% Confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.78) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.69–0.80), respectively (p = 0.22). Comparing the two, 13 of 162 (8%) cases were re-staged between lower and higher risks which would have affected treatment decisions. Conclusion: Our study showed that R-IPSS score can be used for risk stratification in most Thai patients. A prediction model using somatic mutations specifically in Asian patients should be formulated in the future.",medical,Hematology
Inflammation and Nitro-oxidative Stress as Drivers of Endocannabinoid System Aberrations in Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia,"Morris G., Sominsky L., Walder K.R., Berk M., Marx W., Carvalho A.F., Bortolasci C.C., Maes M., Puri B.K.",2022-06-01,"Amidohydrolases, Depressive Disorder, Major, Endocannabinoids, Humans, Inflammation, MicroRNAs, Monoacylglycerol Lipases, Oxidative Stress, Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Cannabidiol, Dimethyl fumarate, Endocannabinoid system, Major depressive disorder, Schizophrenia","The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of the endocannabinoid ligands anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylgycerol (2-AG), their target cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in their synthesis and metabolism (N-acyltransferase and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the case of AEA and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) in the case of 2-AG). The origins of ECS dysfunction in major neuropsychiatric disorders remain to be determined, and this paper explores the possibility that they may be associated with chronically increased nitro-oxidative stress and activated immune-inflammatory pathways, and it examines the mechanisms which might be involved. Inflammation and nitro-oxidative stress are associated with both increased CB1 expression, via increased activity of the NADPH oxidases NOX4 and NOX1, and increased CNR1 expression and DNA methylation; and CB2 upregulation via increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, binding of the transcription factor Nrf2 to an antioxidant response element in the CNR2 promoter region and the action of miR-139. CB1 and CB2 have antagonistic effects on redox signalling, which may result from a miRNA-enabled negative feedback loop. The effects of inflammation and oxidative stress are detailed in respect of AEA and 2-AG levels, via effects on calcium homeostasis and phospholipase A2 activity; on FAAH activity, via nitrosylation/nitration of functional cysteine and/or tyrosine residues; and on 2-AG activity via effects on MGLL expression and MAGL. Finally, based on these detailed molecular neurobiological mechanisms, it is suggested that cannabidiol and dimethyl fumarate may have therapeutic potential for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neuroscience (miscellaneous), Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Traction-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection reduces procedure time and risk of serious adverse events: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Lopimpisuth C., Simons M., Akshintala V.S., Prasongdee K., Nanavati J., Ngamruengphong S.",2022-03-01,"Dissection, Endoscopic Mucosal Resection, Humans, Traction, Treatment Outcome, Endoscopic resection, Endoscopic submucosal dissection, Superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms, Traction","Background and aims: Conventional endoscopic submucosal dissection (C-ESD) is a technically demanding procedure with prolonged procedure times and higher risk of adverse events. To overcome the procedural difficulty of ESD, several traction-assisted techniques (T-ESD) have been developed to improve visualization of the submucosa in hopes to facilitate safe and effective dissection. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis that compares short-term outcomes (30-day) of T-ESD to C-ESD. Methods: Clinical studies published up to April 2020 comparing the efficacy and safety of T-ESD and C-ESD were identified using electronic bibliographic searches. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Outcomes of interests were procedure time, rates of en bloc and R0 resection, and rates of adverse events. Fixed effect and random effect model were used to calculate pooled mean difference for continuous variables and risk differences (RDs) for categorical variables. Results: Twenty-three studies with 2574 patients were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 2582 lesions (1292 T-ESD and 1290 C-ESD). Pooled estimates of T-ESD showed shorter procedure times (weighted mean difference = −20.35 min, 95% CI −27.51 to −13.19, p < 0.001), higher R0 resection rates (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.06, p = 0.004) and lower perforation rates (RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.04 to −0.01, p = < 0.0001). No significant differences were seen in en bloc rates and bleeding risk between the two groups. Conclusions: Traction-assisted ESD results in shorter procedure time, improved R0 resection rates and lower risk of perforation as compared to conventional ESD.",medical,Surgery

We studied the efficacy of methylene blue–mediated antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (MB-aPDT) for the reduction of extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PS) and multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-KP) isolated in a university hospital setting in Thailand. Method: Two isolates of each selected bacterium were collected, XDR-AB1 and AB2, XDR- PS1 and PS2, and MDR-KP1 and KP2. Three triplicate experiments using various MB concentrations alone, various red light fluences alone, as well as the selected non-toxic doses of MB and fluences of red light combined as MB-aPDT were applied on each selected isolate. The colonies were counted [colony forming units (CFU)/ml]. Estimation of the lethal treatment dose defined as reduction of > 2 log10 in CFU/ml compared with untreated bacteria. Result: There were generally negligible changes in the viable counts of the bacterial suspensions treated with all the MB concentrations (p > 0.05). In the second experiment with the only red light treatments, at fluences higher than 2 J/cm, reduction trend in viable counts across all the isolates was observed. Only for MDR-KP1, however, the lethal dose was achieved with the highest fluence of red light (80 J/cm). With the concentration of MB, 50 and 150 mg/L in the third experiment (MB-aPDT), the greater bacterial reduction was observed in all clinical isolates leading to their lethal viable cell reduction when escalating the light fluence to 80 J/cm. Conclusions: MB-aPDT evidently killed the selected XDR and MDR-gram negative bacteria. In highly drug-resistant crisis era, MB-aPDT could be a promising option, particularly for local infections and infection complicating chronic wounds.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Only two bovine hemoplasma species, Mycoplasma wenyonii and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobos, have been described in several countries. Hemoplasmas induce acute hemolytic anemia or chronic infection, leading to production loss. Bovine hemoplasma DNA was also detected in blood-sucking arthropods, suggesting vector transmission in farms. To date, no studies of the molecular detection of bovine hemoplasmas in Thai buffaloes and arthropod vectors have been reported. This study aimed to study the 1-year diversity of hematophagous flies in a buffalo farm located in Chachoengsao province, Thailand, and to investigate the molecular occurrence of bovine hemoplasmas in those flies using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and sequence analyses. A total of 1,488 mosquitoes, 867 stable flies, and 312 tabanid flies were collected during this study. The most abundant mosquitoes, stable flies, and tabanid flies were Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Stomoxys calcitrans, and Tabanus megalops, respectively. A total of 249 genomic DNA samples of flies were tested using a PCR assay based on the 16S rRNA gene; 23.69% (59/249) of the insect samples were positive in this assay. Positive samples (n = 8) were subjected to bidirectional sequencing. The BLAST results showed that only three samples from Stomoxys calcitrans and two samples from Tabanus megalops showed 99.90% and 99.17% similarities to the M. wenyonii isolate B003 (MG948626/Water buffalo/Cuba) and the M. wenyonii isolate C124 (MG948625/Cattle/Cuba), respectively. This molecular occurrence of bovine hemoplasmas in blood-sucking flies suggested that those flies are the mechanical vectors for bovine hemoplasmas in Thailand. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, the sequences of M. wenyonii were likely classified into two subgroups (A and B), suggesting closely related bovine hemoplasma species. Finally, the genetic analysis of the 23S rRNA gene from these two subgroups revealed that subgroup A could be M. wenynoii and subgroup B may be a subspecies of M. wenyonii or another putative novel species. However, further investigation should be conducted in buffaloes, cattle, and blood-sucking flies to gain more 16S rRNA and 23 rRNA gene sequences of bovine hemoplasmas.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) is an alternative method for clipping intracranial aneurysms. No analysis has been conducted to anatomically compare approaches with respect to treating paraclinoid aneurysms. The surgical anatomical exposures of the paraclinoid region during transcranial extradural anterior clinoidectomy (EAC) and the endoscopic endonasal transplanum-cavernous approach (EETC) are described and quantitatively assessed. Method: Seven cadaveric heads underwent EAC and EETC. Measurements included the area of exposure, volume of surgical freedom, angle of attack, ophthalmic artery (OphA) origin, and coronal exposure angle of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Results: The EETC provided a larger area of exposure than the EAC (100.1±24.9 vs 76.1±12.9 mm2, p = 0.04). The EAC provided a higher volume of surgical freedom and greater angle of attack than the EETC in all neurovascular parameters, including the OphA, superior hypophyseal artery (SHA), distal ICA, and distal dural ring (all p < 0.001). The OphA origin was intradural in 85.7% and extradural in 14.3% of specimens. With regard to the coronal angle of exposure, the EAC exposed the OphA and SHA in the upper lateral quadrant (67.9±7.8° and 80.6±4.5°, respectively) and the distal ICA in the upper medial and upper lateral quadrants (92±7.5°). The EEA exposed the OphA, SHA, and distal ICA in the upper medial and lower medial quadrants (130.4±10.7°, 68.4±10.8°, and 58±11.4°, respectively). Conclusions: The EAC and EETC each offer specific advantages for paraclinoid region exposure. The EAC is appropriate for paraclinoid aneurysms that occur at the dorsolateral surface of the paraclinoid ICA. The EETC is an alternative approach for aneurysms that occur along medial surface of the paraclinoid ICA (e.g., carotid cave and SHA aneurysms). The EETC provides greater surgical exposure to the medial aspect of the paraclinoid ICA.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

Since using current anti-influenza drugs targeting neuraminidase (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and the proton M2 channel (amantadine and rimantadine) leads to drug resistance, it is essential to seek new anti-viral agents that act on additional viral targets. Hemagglutinin (HA), a glycoprotein embedded in the viral surface and playing a critical role in influenza the viral replication cycle has become an attractive target. This work investigates the molecular binding mechanism of HA H3N2 of influenza virus complexed with the fusion inhibitor, arbidol and its derivative (der-arbidol), by means of molecular dynamics simulation. The result showed that the arbidol derivative could form many and strong hydrogen bonds with the HA surrounding amino acids comprising GLU1032(1), LYS3071(1) and LYS3102(1) while arbidol makes this type of interaction with only LYS582(1). The introduction of hydroxyl group at the meta-position of the thiophenol ring was detected to replace the nearby water molecule, thus allowing the direct hydrogen bond formation between der-arbidol and GLU1032(1) of HA residue. Furthermore, the salt bridge networks established among residues GLU572(1)···ARG542(1)···GLU972(2) were considerably more stable in HA-Der-arbidol than that found in HA-Arbidol. The predicted protein-ligand binding free energies were in agreement with experimental data indicating that der-arbidol exhibits higher inhibitory potency against HA H3N2 of influenza virus. Detailed information could be useful for further designing and optimizing HA fusion inhibitors with improved efficiency.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry, Mathematics","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Computational Mathematics"

In this work, a combination of comprehensive molecular modeling and in vitro kinase inhibition assay was used to unravel the mutational effects of EGFR on the susceptibility of three generations of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and osimertinib) in comparison with the wild-type EGFR. The binding affinity of all studied inhibitors towards the double and triple EGFR mutations was in good agreement with the experimental data, ranked in the order of osimertinib > afatinib > dacomitinib > erlotinib > gefitinib. Three hot-spot residues at the hinge region (M790, M793, and C797) were involved in the binding of osimertinib and afatinib, enhancing their inhibitory activity towards mutated EGFRs. Both double and triple EGFR mutations causing erlotinib and gefitinib resistance are mainly caused by the low number of H-bond occupations, the low number of surrounding atoms, and the high number of water molecules accessible to the enzyme active site. According to principal component analysis, the molecular complexation of osimertinib against the two mutated EGFRs was in a closed conformation, whereas that against wild-type EGFR was in an open conformation, resulting in drug resistance. This work paves the way for further design of the novel EGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance mechanisms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, medical","Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics"

Normal skin, scalp skin lesion (SL) and non-lesion sites (SNL) samples were collected using a tape stripping method and next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA for microbiome analysis. Although bacterial diversity in all sample groups was not statistically different, a population of bacteria commonly found on skin of scalp showed signs of dysbiosis. Apart from the reduction of Corynebacterium spp., SD-specific microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes at taxa level and Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Micrococcus spp. at genus level. The dysbiosis of the skin microbiota in SD was specifically described as an alteration of bacteria populations commonly found on scalp skin, implying that managing and controlling the cutaneous bacterial microbiome can alleviate and prevent SD and pave the way for the development of new SD treatments.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"

The objective of this paper is to investigation the post-treatment mechanical properties and shrinkage cracking characteristics of soft Bangkok clays treated with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and FA. Unconfined compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and shrinkage cracking after 7 and 28 days of mixture curing were measured. The effects of wet/dry cycling on the durability of mixtures were examined. Microstructures of treated soft clays were examined using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDX) techniques. Test results showed that strength and stiffness improvements of stabilised soft clays increased with OPC content but decreased with FA content, while the extent of sample shrinkage decreased with increasing FA content. Based on these results, we propose the preliminary guideline of applying 15% replacement of OPC with FA to obtain the optimal mixture ratios that allows FA to act as a shrinkage-reducing agent for deep soil mixing purposes. By adding OPC and 15% FA at a binder-per-water ratio (B/wc) of 0.4, the stabilised soft clay satisfied both strength and shrinkage cracking criteria for deep soil mixing purposes. SEM/EDX analyses further supported these experiment results.

It is considered to be highly difficult for recharging sensor devices under adverse situations. The main drawbacks of WSNs concern to the issue of network lifetime, coverage area, scheduling and data aggregation. In particular, prolonging network lifetime confirms the success together with the energy conservation of sensor nodes, data transmission reliability and scalability of their operation in data aggregation. Clustering schemes are considered to be highly suitable for effectively utilising the resources with lower overhead, such that energy consumption is enhanced for upgrading the network lifespan. In this paper, a Hybrid Modified Artificial Bee Colony and Firefly Algorithm (HMABCFA) -Based Cluster Head Selection is proposed for ensuring energy stabilisation, delay minimisation and inter-node distance reduction for improving the network lifetime. This proposed HMABCFA integrates the benefit of the Firefly optimisation algorithm for generating a new position that which has the capability of replacing the position, which is not updated in the scout bee phase of ABC. This incorporation of Firefly optimisation algorithm into the ABC algorithm prevents the limitations of premature convergence, slow convergence and the possibility of being trapped into the local point of optimality in the clustering process. The modified ABC-based clustering process is phenomenal in improving the feasible dimensions for enhancing the process of exploitation and exploration. The results of the HMABCFA, on an average are confirmed to enhance the network lifetime by 23.21%, energy stability by 19.84% and reduce network latency by 22.88%, compared to the benchmarked approaches.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence"

On the other hand, the global energy demand is projected to rise by almost 28% by 2040 compared to current levels. Thus, there is a dire need for developing the alternatives to meet these energy needs. Biomass is seen as a significant alternative energy source to fossil fuels from this standpoint. The main bottle neck in utilizing the biomass for this purpose is the lack of an efficient conversion or pretreatment technology which prompted scientists to delve into novel stepwise biomass conversion technologies. This review article encompasses various methods for the processing the algal biomass to generate potential biobased products such as algal crude oil, biogas, and fuel alcohols. Among the various techniques of thermochemical conversion of algal biomass, hydrothermal liquefaction and gasification are the most sustainable ones. Furthermore, anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass is the commercially workable technique providing biogas and biohydrogen. Future generations may find algal biofuels to be low-cost and ecologically benign alternative to fossil fuels. This review is a connotative illustration of the conversion technologies for algal biomass, which includes both thermochemical and biochemical processes. It also highlights the salient features along with the limitations of each of these technologies and bearing in mind the expansion of a superstructure depiction to capture the various biomass feedstocks and employment techniques for the generated bioenergy through various biomass conversion technologies.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

The resulting semi-IPNs CS/PHEMA structure shows the presence of the two polymeric components in the polymer structure. The crosslinking results in the morphological structure, high porosity and pore structure, as well as interconnected pores on the surface, indicating that a semi-IPNs hydrogel structure formed after polymerization. Moreover, the degree of swelling is excellent in different media ranging from 140 to 220%. The semi-IPNs CS/PHEMA samples exhibit highly enhanced mechanical strength with crosslinking and show features of brittle materials in the dry state and rubber-like materials in the wet state. Compressive structure exhibits retaining after stress removal. The polymeric decomposition occurs, corresponding to linear CS and PHEMA networks. The degradation behavior of semi-IPNs CS/PHEMA promotes enzymatic biodegradation under simulated physiological conditions. Therefore, these CS/PHEMA semi-IPNs materials can be suitable for use as biodegradable polymers and engineering scaffold materials.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging detect abnormal LNs. Despite its low contrast and variety in nodal size and form, LN segmentation remains a challenging task. Deep convolutional neural networks frequently segment items in medical photographs. Most state-of-the-art techniques destroy image's resolution through pooling and convolution. As a result, the models provide unsatisfactory results. Keeping the issues in mind, a well-established deep learning technique UNet++ was modified using bilinear interpolation and total generalized variation (TGV) based upsampling strategy to segment and detect mediastinal lymph nodes. The modified UNet++ maintains texture discontinuities, selects noisy areas, searches appropriate balance points through backpropagation, and recreates image resolution. Collecting CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP public dataset, a dataset was prepared with the help of experienced medical experts. The UNet++ was trained using those datasets, and three different data combinations were utilized for testing. Utilizing the proposed approach, the model achieved 94.8% accuracy, 91.9% Jaccard, 94.1% recall, and 93.1% precision on COMBO_3.

In MDD/MDE, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies discovered a new endophenotype class, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), a new pathway phenotype, namely reoccurrence of illness (ROI), and a new model of the phenome of depression. The aim of the present study is to examine the association between ROI, the phenome of depression, and MDMD’s features and IRS, CIRS, macrophages (M1), T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, T regulatory, and growth factor (GF) profiles. Culture supernatants of unstimulated and stimulated (5 µg/mL of PHA and 25 µg/mL of LPS) diluted whole blood of 30 MDD/MDE patients and 20 controls were assayed for cytokines/GF using the LUMINEX assay. MDMD was characterized by increased M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, IRS, CIRS, neurotoxicity, and GF profiles. Factor analysis shows that ROI features and immune-GF profiles may be combined into a new pathway phenotype (an extracted latent vector). ROI, lifetime and recent suicidal behaviors, and severity of depression are significantly associated with immunotoxicity and GF profiles. Around 80.0% of the variance in the phenome is predicted by ROI and neurotoxicity or the IRS/CIRS ratio. The molecular pathways underpinning ROI-associated sensitization of immune/growth networks are transmembrane receptor protein kinase-triggered STAT protein phosphorylation, TLR/NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the main proliferation/survival PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, MDMD’s heightened immune responses are the consequence of ROI-associated sensitization combined with immunostimulatory triggers.",medical,Medicine (all)

Therefore, to investigate the compressive stress-strain behavior and detailed analysis and assessment of masonry structures made of CCI bricks is imperative. Axial compressive results of 10 hollow cement-clay interlocking (CCI) bricks made masonry walls are presented. 10 masonry walls were tested under concentric compressive load in 2 groups. Bricks of each group had different compressive strength. Five walls in each group comprised of 1 control wall (ungrouted), 1 wall grouted with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), 1 wall grouted with non-shrink (NS) cement, 1 wall grouted with OPC and strengthened by steel bars, and 1 wall grouted with NS and strengthened with steel bars. Among 5 walls in each group, control wall created the lower bound in terms of the peak load sustained. While the upper bound was created by the wall grouted with NS cement and further strengthened by steel bars. It was found that the addition of grout (irrespective of its type) significantly improved the peak compressive load. However, increase in peak load over that of the control wall was associated to the grout type. Walls grouted with NS cement attained higher peak loads as compared to those grouted with OPC. It was observed that the addition of cement grout does not guarantee a ductile post-peak behavior. Addition of steel bars not only increased the peak loads, but it also improved the post peak behavior. Accuracy of existing compressive load analytical models was assessed, and it was found that none of the analytical models considered were able to predict close approximations. A linearly regressed model is proposed to predict compressive strength of CCI brick masonry walls with good accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

The compounds were examined for their antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 main protease activities. The new 2,5-dimethoxy-substituted phenyl piper-amide 5 exhibited the most robust biological activities with no cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines, Vero and Vero E6, as compared to the other compounds in this series. Its half-maximal inhib-itory concentration (IC50) for antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense was 15.46 ± 3.09 μM, and its antimalarial activity against the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum was 24.55 ± 1.91 μM, which were fourfold and fivefold more potent, respectively, than the activities of piperine. Interestingly, compound 5 inhibited the activity of 3C-like main protease (3CLPro) toward anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at the IC50 of 106.9 ± 1.2 μM, which was threefold more potent than the activity of rutin. Docking and molecular dynamic simulation indicated that the potential binding of 5 in the 3CLpro active site had the improved binding interaction and stability.

In experimental challenge, pAh6.2TG treatments significantly improved survivability of Nile tilapia exposed to a lethal dose of the pathogenic MDR A. hydrophila, with relative per cent survival (RPS) of 73.3% and 50% for phage multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1.0 and 0.1, respectively. Phage treatment significantly reduced the concentration of A. hydrophila in both water and fish body. Interestingly, the surviving fish from A. hydrophila challenged groups provoked specific antibody (IgM) against this bacterium. In summary, the findings suggested that the lytic phage pAh6.2TG is an effective alternative to antibiotics to control MDR A. hydrophila in tilapia and possibly other freshwater fish.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Exosomes serve as a liquid biopsy tool for clinical and translational research. Although many techniques have been used to isolate exosomes, including ultracentrigation, size-exclusion chromatography, and immunocapturing-based techniques, these techniques are not convenient, they require expensive instrumentation, and they are unhandy for clinical samples. Precipitation techniques from available commercial kits that contain polyethelene glycol (PEG) are now widely used, but these kits are expensive, especially if a large number of biological samples are to be processed. OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this study is to compare and optimize the efficacy of different concentrations of PEG with two commercial kits ExoQuick (SBI) and Total Exosome Isolation (TEI) from Invitrogen in human plasma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: we determined exosome quantity, size distribution, marker expression, and downstream application. RESULTS: among the precipitation methods, we found the size of particles and concentrations with 10-20% PEG are similar to ExoQuick and better than TEI. Interestingly, we detected cfDNA with ExoQuick and 10-20% PEG but not TEI and 5% PEG. Moreover, 10% PEG detection of miR-122 and miR-16 expression was superior to ExoQuick and TEI. Furthermore, in proteomics results it also found the identified proteins better than commercial kits but there was a high level of contamination of other proteins in serum. CONCLUSIONS: together, these findings show that an optimal concentration of 10% PEG serves as a guide for use with clinical samples in exosome isolation for downstream applications.",medical,Medicine (all)

Spreng. It was characterized taxonomically using a polyphasic approach. It grew at 25–37 °C, at pH 5–10 and with 6% (w/v) NaCl. It contained ll-diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Ribose and glucose were detected in its whole-cell hydrolysate. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0, C16:0, iso-C14:0 and iso-C15:0. Detected polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphati-dylinositol mannosides, unidentified phospholipids and unidentified amino lipids. Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, strain JA03T showed highest similarity to Streptomyces filipinensis NBRC 12860T (98.76%), Streptomyces fodineus TW1S1T (98.69%) and Streptomyces shenzhennensis 172115T (98.68%). Strain JA03T has a genome size of 9092851 bp with DNA G+C content of 71.28 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI)-blast and ANI-MUMmer values of strain JA03T and related type strains were 79.6–89.2 and 86.7–92.5%, respectively, and the digital DNA–DNA hybridization values were 27.3–46.4%. Ethyl acetate extract of JA03T exhibited total phenolic content (33.4±0.6 µg mg−1 gallic acid equivalent), ferric reducing power value (70.8±1.8 µg mg−1 ascorbic acid equivalent) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (IC50 =67.0±21.1 µg ml−1). Intracellular reactive oxygen species and NO production in RAW264.7 macrophage cells induced by H2 O2 and lipopolysaccharide were inhibited with IC50 of 67.40 and 16.95 µg ml−1, respectively. Based on the taxonomic results, it has been concluded that strain JA03T represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces barringtoniae sp. nov., is proposed.

Enhancing the yield of seasonal influenza viruses through manipulation of microRNAs in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells,"Saengchoowong S., Nimsamer P., Khongnomnan K., Poomipak W., Praianantathavorn K., Rattanaburi S., Poovorawan Y., Zhang Q., Payungporn S.",2022-08-01,"Animals, Dogs, Humans, Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype, Influenza Vaccines, Influenza, Human, Kidney, Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells, MicroRNAs, Seasons, Virus Replication, enhancing the yield, Madin–Darby canine kidney, microRNA, Seasonal influenza viruses","Annual influenza vaccine is recommended to reduce the occurrence of seasonal influenza and its complications. Thus far, Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line has been used to manufacture cell-based influenza vaccines. Even though host microRNAs may facilitate viral replication, the interaction between MDCK cells-derived microRNAs and seasonal influenza viruses has been less frequently investigated. Therefore, this study highlighted microRNA profiles of MDCK cells to increase the yield of seasonal influenza virus production by manipulating cellular microRNAs. MDCK cells were infected with influenza A or B virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, and microRNA collections were then subjected to MiSeq (Illumina) Sequencing. The validated profiles revealed that cfa-miR-340, cfa-miR-146b, cfa-miR-197, and cfa-miR-215 were the most frequently upregulated microRNAs. The effect of candidate microRNA inhibition and overexpression on viral replication was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The hybridization pattern between candidate miRNAs and viral genes was performed using miRBase and RNAhybrid web-based programs. Moreover, the predicted microRNA-binding sites were validated by a 3’-UTR reporter assay. The results indicated that cfa-miR-146b could directly target the PB1 gene of A/pH1N1 and the PA gene of B/Yamagata. Furthermore, cfa-miR-215 could silence the PB1 gene of A/pH1N1 and the PB1 gene of B/Victoria. However, the PB2 gene of the A/H3N2 virus was silenced by cfa-miR-197. In addition, the HA and NA sequences of influenza viruses harvested from the cell cultures treated with microRNA inhibitors were analyzed. The sequencing results revealed no difference in the antigenic HA and NA sequences between viruses isolated from the cells treated with microRNA inhibitors and the parental viruses. In conclusion, these findings suggested that MDCK cell-derived microRNAs target viral genes in a strain-specific manner for suppressing viral replication. Conversely, the use of such microRNA inhibitors may facilitate the production of influenza viruses.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Thus, patients must apply pressure and use absorbable wound dressings to stop bleeding and prevent blood loss. This method stops bleeding and causes clotting of blood. However, some people have bleeding disorders or cannot stop bleeding with applied pressure after oral surgery. Therefore, haemostatic foam dressing is an interesting material that can be used to stop bleeding without hindering blood clotting in the wound site. In this study, foam was prepared using a blend of starch with carboxymethyl chitosan and glyoxal as a crosslinking agent. The foam was formed by freeze-drying. Carboxymethyl chitosan/starch foam absorbed water rapidly and held it, as analysed by a blood clotting assay and maximum swelling. Thus, carboxymethyl chitosan/starch foam (CM/starch foam) made with a 1:4 ratio and with 1% glyoxal also absorbed blood very well and exhibited suitable properties. Cytotoxic studies using human dermal fibroblast cells, as determined by MTT assay, confirmed that CM/starch foam was non-toxic and had good mechanical properties in a wet environment.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, Materials Science","Environmental Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Therefore, we determined the incidence of active TB and mortality among 9179 adult PLWH who attended and received ART from 15 tertiary care hospitals across Thailand. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 2018 using follow-up data from 1999 to 2018. The primary endpoint was incident TB disease after ART initiation. Factors associated with TB incidence were analysed using competing risk regression. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate mortality after ART initiation. Results: During a median of 5.1 years of ART (IQR 2.2–9.5 years), 442 (4.8%) PLWH developed TB (TB/HIV), giving an overall incidence of 750 (95% CI 683–823) per 100,000 persons-year of follow up (PYFU). In multivariate analysis, lower CD4 at ART initiation (≤100 cells/mm3, adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]: 2.08, 95% CI, 1.47–2.92; 101–200 cells/mm3, aSHR: 2.21, 95% CI, 1.54–3.16; 201–350 cells/mm3, aSHR: 1.59, 95% CI, 1.11–2.28 vs. >350 cells/mm3), male sex (aSHR: 1.40, 95% CI, 1.11–1.78), lower body weight (<50 kg, aSHR: 1.52, 95% CI, 1.17–1.95) and prior TB event (aSHR: 3.50, 95% CI, 2.72–4.52) were associated with TB incidence. PLWH with HIV RNA ≥50 copies/ml had 5–9 times higher risk of active TB disease higher than those with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at the same CD4 level. The risk for developing TB was remarkably high during the initial period of ART (175,511 per 100,000 PYFU at<3 months) and was comparable to the general population after 10 years of ART (151 per 100,000 PYFU). TB/HIV had higher mortality (10% vs. 5%) and poorer HIV treatment outcomes: HIV RNA <50 copies/ml (63.8% vs. 82.8%), CD4 cells count (317 vs. 508 cells/mm3) at the most recent visit. Conclusions: In this high TB burden country, TB incidence was remarkably high during the first few years after ART initiation and thereafter decreased significantly. Rapid ART initiation and appropriate TPT can be potential key interventions to tackle the TB epidemic and reduce mortality among PLWH in TB/HIV high burden settings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Therefore, this study aimed to provide evidence on a heterologous booster strategy to overcome the waning immunity against Omicron variants. Methods: Participants who completed the Oxford/AstraZeneca (hereafter AZD1222) vaccine dose for 5-7 months were enrolled. The reactogenicity and persistence of immunogenicity in both humoral and cellular response after a homologous or heterologous booster with the AZD1222 and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (BNT162b2, full, or half-dose mRNA-1273) administered 6 months after primary vaccination were determined. Results: A total of 229 individuals enrolled, and waning of immunity was observed 5-7 months after the AZD1222-primed vaccinations. Total receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, anti-RBD IgG, and focus reduction neutralization test against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and T cell response peaked at 14-28 days after booster vaccination. Both the full and half dose of mRNA-1273 induced the highest response, followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222. At 90 days, the persistence of immunogenicity was observed among all mRNA-boosted individuals. Adverse events were acceptable for all vaccines. Conclusion: A heterologous mRNA booster provided a significantly superior boost of binding and NAbs levels against the Omicron variant compared with a homologous booster in individuals with AZD1222-primed vaccinations.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

However, muscle responses to anterior bite planes of different harnesses may vary. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate masticatory muscle activity, muscle balance and maximum bite force (MBF) responses to anterior bite planes fabricated from acrylic resin (ABP) or bi-laminate thermoplastic (TBP) over 6 months in children with a deep bite. Methods: Sixty-six children were randomly assigned to the ABP, TBP or untreated control groups. Masticatory muscle activity, activity index (AC) and percentage overlapping coefficient (POC) were assessed by surface electromyography; MBF, using a custom-made bite force sensor. Data were collected before, immediately after appliance insertion and after 2 weeks and 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment. Within- and between-group differences were analysed using the one-way ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests (α =.05); Friedman's tests were used to assess within-group differences over time (α =.08). Results: At rest, no dependent variables changed throughout the study. At maximum clenching, masticatory muscle activity immediately dropped significantly but returned to baseline values and was equal to the control group at 1–3 months. The ABP group had significantly lower masseter activity and AC than the TBP group after insertion. Neither POC nor MBF were significantly different within or between groups. Conclusion: Masticatory muscle activity reduced after anterior bite plane insertion but returned to baseline after 1–3 months. Masseter activity decreased significantly more in the ABP group than TBP group. Neither appliance significantly affected POC or MBF.

Although the plastic wastes can be converted to alternative liquid fuels through pyrolysis process, the compositions in the pyrolysis oil depended on the chemical structure of raw materials and pyrolysis condition affect its quality. Thus, this research aimed to comparatively investigate the production of alternative liquid fuels obtained from mixed plastics containing polystyrene (PS)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) at 20/5/35/40 (w/w) via non-catalytic cracking (under N2 atmosphere), non-catalytic hydrocracking (under H2 atmosphere), and catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst conducted at an atmospheric pressure and 650 °C for 1 h. The product yields and chemical compositions (paraffins, olefins, aromatics and PAHs) in the liquid products generated from these processes were investigated and also compared to ones obtained from the non-catalytic processes of each plastic. Herein, the characteristics of 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was analyzed by N2-adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The results indicated that the non-catalytic processes of PS provided the highest content of oil and wax product (ca. 92 wt%). Whereas, the non-catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics gave the lowest one (ca. 69 wt%). However, the catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst (2.5 – 10.0 wt% based on the mixed plastics) could suppress the cracking and yielded the higher amount of oil and wax to ca. 76–80 wt%. To consider the chemical compositions in the liquid phase, the PAHs formation was relied on the aromatic structure in the feedstocks. The liquid product derived from the non-catalytic processes of PS contained the highest amount of PAHs compounds (2622–2926 ppm) followed by the mixed plastics. When the 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was applied to the catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics, the amount of PAHs in the liquid product decreased from 1621 ppm to ca. 1000 ppm (30 – 40% PAHs reduction) without the reduction of heating value when compared to one obtained from the non-catalytic processes.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The CYP3A5 6986 A > G, ABCB1 3435 C > T, ABCB1 2677 G > T, SLCO1B1 521 T > C, and NR1I2 63396 C > T were genotyped. A population pharmacokinetic model was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effect model (NONMEM®). Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to compare the percentages of patients achieving the therapeutic range of ATV through concentrations (Ctrough). Results: The apparent oral clearance of ATV (CL/FATV) without RTV was 7.69 L/h with interindividual variability (IIV) of 28.7%. Patients with CYP3A5 6986 GG had a 7.1% lower CL/FATV than those with AA or AG genotype. The CL/FATV decreased by 10.8% for females compared with males. Simulation results showed higher percentages (~70%) of patient receiving doses of 200/100 or 200/50 mg achieved the target ATV Ctrough, while more patients (~40%) receiving a standard dose (300/100 mg) had ATV Ctrough above this target. Conclusions: Both CYP3A5 6986 A > G and female decreased CL/FATV in Thai HIV-infected patients.

Levenberg Marquardt based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based optimization techniques have been adopted for systematic parametric analysis of MXene Ionanofluids thermophysical properties using experimental data. ANN and RSM have predicted the thermophysical behavior of MXene ionanofluids at optimized conditions. The experimental data were used to train, test, and validate the ANN model. The neural network could correctly predict the outcomes for the four properties based on the numerical performance with R2 values close to 1, and a prediction error is 2%. The performance of the proposed LM-based back-propagation algorithm demonstrates that the error involved has been minimal and acceptable. RSM has developed correction among input parameters and thermophysical properties of MXene Ionanofluids. The comparison between experimental results and the proposed correlations revealed excellent practical compatibility.

This study presents an approach to pro-ducing the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps over the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB), Thailand. An integrated numerical model and spatial analysis tool were utilized in this study. The Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was first used to simulate both river discharge and inundation depth. Then, the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps with different return periods were estimated using a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. The results illustrate that the flood inundation areas were spread out, starting from Nakhon Sawan Province, which is located in the central part of the basin. The maximum flood inundation depth could reach up to approximately 7.71, 8.28, and 8.78 m for the flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, re-spectively. The results also indicate that the inundation areas over the CPRB could cover approximately 21,837, 23,392, and 24,533 km2 for flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, respectively. The longest flood durations for return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years were approximately 159, 177, and 198 days, respectively. The longest flood duration occurred in the vicinity of the Nakhon Sawan. This study sug-gests that flood inundation areas and duration mapping could provide supporting information regarding the impacts caused by varying degrees of flood hazards and can be used to enhance comprehensive disaster risk management planning.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

Methods: Medical records and radiographs of patients who underwent genioplasty were reviewed. The demographic data, characteristics of operation, and treatment outcomes were gathered to analyze the causes that required reoperation. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were computed to evaluate the study. Results: Of the 157 patients included, there were 12 patients (7.6%) who needed reoperation after genioplasty. Age ≤ 25 years significantly decreased the likelihood for the need for reoperative genioplasty compared with age > 35 years. However, the need for reoperative genioplasty was not directly associated with gender, simultaneous orthognathic operation, direction and amount of movement, method of fixation, or bone graft interposition. Fixation failure, esthetic problems, residual obstructive sleep apnea, and palpable step at the inferior border of the mandible were the causes that required a second operation by reposition and re-fixation with rigid fixation, recontouring, or reoperation by genioplasty.

Ethanol can be produced from various feedstocks. First-generation ethanol is mainly produced from sugar-and starch-containing feedstocks. For second-generation ethanol, lignocellulosic biomass is used as a feedstock. Typically, ethanol production contains four major steps, including the conversion of feedstock, fermentation, ethanol recovery, and ethanol storage. Each feedstock requires different procedures for its conversion to fermentable sugar. Lignocellulosic biomass requires extra pretreatment compared to sugar and starch feedstocks to disrupt the structure and improve enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency. Many pretreatment methods are available such as physical, chemical, physicochemical, and biological methods. However, the greatest concern regarding the pretreatment process is inhibitor formation, which might retard enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. The main inhibitors are furan derivatives, aromatic compounds, and organic acids. Actions to minimize the effects of inhibitors, detoxification, changing fermentation strategies, and metabolic engineering can subsequently be conducted. In addition to the inhibitors from pretreatment, chemicals used during the pretreatment and fermentation of byproducts may remain in the final product if they are not removed by ethanol distillation and dehydration. Maintaining the quality of ethanol during storage is another concerning issue. Initial impurities of ethanol being stored and its nature, including hygroscopic, high oxygen and carbon dioxide solubility, influence chemical reactions during the storage period and change ethanol’s characteristics (e.g., water content, ethanol content, acidity, pH, and electrical conductivity). During ethanol storage periods, nitrogen blanketing and corrosion inhibitors can be applied to reduce the quality degradation rate, the selection of which depends on several factors, such as cost and storage duration. This review article sheds light on the techniques of control used in ethanol fuel production, and also includes specific guidelines to control ethanol quality during production and the storage period in order to preserve ethanol production from first-generation to second-generation feedstock. Finally, the understanding of impurity/inhibitor formation and controlled strategies is crucial. These need to be considered when driving higher ethanol blending mandates in the short term, utilizing ethanol as a renewable building block for chemicals, or adopting ethanol as a hydrogen carrier for the long-term future, as has been recommended.","energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Since aporphine alkaloids isolated from S. pierrei tubers exhibit diverse pharmacological characteristics, we aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of crude extracts and alkaloids isolated from S. pierrei tubers against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 macrophages. Notably, the n-hexane extract strongly suppressed nitric oxide (NO) while exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity. Among the five alkaloids isolated from the n-hexane extract, the aporphine alkaloid oxocrebanine exerted considerable anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NO secretion. Oxocrebanine also significantly suppressed prostaglandin E2, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression by inactivating the nuclear factor κB, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inflammatory signalling pathways. Molecular docking analysis further revealed that oxocrebanine has a higher affinity for toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation primary response 88 signalling targets and the COX-2 protein than native ligands. Thus, our findings highlight the potential anti-inflammatory effects of oxocrebanine and suggest that certain alkaloids of S. pierrei could be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","Immunology, pharmacology, medical","Immunology, Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"
Longitudinal Assessment of Body Composition and Its Association With Survival Among Participants of the ACTIVE/ADIPOSE Study,"Delgado C., Chiang J.M., Kittiskulnam P., Sheshadri A., Grimes B., Segal M., Kaysen G.A., Johansen K.L.",2022-07-01,"Adipose Tissue, Adult, Body Composition, Body Mass Index, Body Water, Electric Impedance, Humans, Water, Body Composition, Hemodialysis, Obesity Paradox, Survival","Objectives: The importance of muscle wasting as a predictor of mortality in the hemodialysis population is not clear. Lack of association of muscle mass with survival in some studies could be related to reliance on single measures or to incorporation of excess extracellular water (ECW) into estimates of muscle mass. We examined changes in body composition over a 2-year period and the association of body composition with survival. Design and Methods: We analyzed data from 325 adults receiving hemodialysis in the Bay Area. We estimated ECW, intracellular water (ICW), and fat mass by whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) at 0, 12, and 24 months from enrollment. We used linear mixed modeling to examine changes in body mass index and BIS-derived estimates of body composition and Cox modeling with BIS-derived estimates as time-varying independent variables to examine associations between body composition and survival in multivariable analyses. Results: Body mass index declined over time. Considering individual components of body composition, ICW declined (-0.09 kg/m2 per year, 95% confidence interval -0.14 to -0.04), but fat mass and ECW did not change significantly. There were 120 deaths over a median of 5.2 years. The relationship between ICW and mortality was not linear such that the association was steeper at low values of ICW, whereas higher ICW was associated with better survival that was relatively stable above 9 kg/m2. Higher ECW was associated with higher mortality, and fat mass was not associated with survival. These associations were independent of markers of inflammation and nutritional status. Conclusions: ICW declined over 2 years in this cohort, whereas fat mass and ECW remained relatively stable. Higher ICW was associated with better survival, but higher fat mass was not. Higher ECW was associated with worse survival. These results suggest that muscle mass may predict survival among patients on hemodialysis.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics, Nephrology"
Optimal Size of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Distribution System with Consideration of Bus Voltage and Line Capacity Limits,"Teawnarong A., Angaphiwatchawal P., Sompoh C., Chaitusaney S.",2022-01-01,"Bus voltage, Bus voltage limit, Capacity limit, Charging station, Distribution systems, Electric vehicle charging, Electric vehicle charging station, Line capacity, Line capacity limit, Optimization problems, Voltage limits, Bus Voltage Limit, Distribution System, Electric Vehicle Charging Station, Line Capacity Limit, Optimization Problem","Currently, the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in a distribution system has rapidly increased to encourage the electric vehicle usage of a customer. However, this may inevitably cause the technical issues concerning the distribution system operation criteria, i.e., bus voltage and line capacity limits. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for determining the optimal size of each EVCS without violating the bus voltage limit and the line capacity limit. The proposed method is based on the iterative technique to solve the optimization problem where six patterns of EVCS installation are investigated during off-peak and peak time periods of residential loads. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a typical low-voltage distribution system in Thailand is selected to be a test system. Moreover, the fairness of all customers is considered by supposing that the EVCSs are equally installed at each bus, and the loads are equally distributed in the distribution system. The simulation results show that the optimal size of the EVCS during off-peak and peak time periods is mostly limited by the line capacity limit and the bus voltage limit, respectively. This implies that the behavior of customers to charge their electric vehicle should occur during off-peak time period instead of peak time period.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, its accumulation in the environment is a health risk to humans and animals. Polyethylene vanillate (PEV) is a bio-based material with topological, mechanical, and thermal properties similar to PET, allowing it to be used as a PET replacement or blending material. This study aimed to investigate some structural and dynamical properties as well as the estimated glass transition temperature (Tg) of PET/PEV blended polymers by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an all-atom force field model. Four blended systems of PET/PEV with different composition ratios (4/1, 3/2, 2/3, and 1/4) were investigated and compared to the parent polymers, PET and PEV. The results show that the polymers with all blended ratios have Tg values around 344–347 K, which are not significantly different from each other and are close to the Tg of PET at 345 K. Among all the ratios, the 3/2 blended polymer showed the highest number of contacting atoms and possible hydrogen bonds between the two chain types. Moreover, the radial distribution results suggested the proper interactions in this system, which indicates that this is the most suitable ratio model for further experimental studies of the PET/PEV polymer blend.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

However, a specific treatment for this condition is still lacking. Genistein, with its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, could possibly be used to tackle the underlying pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of genistein on oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in acute pancreatitis induced by L-arginine in mice. Methods: Twenty-four male ICR mice were equally divided into 4 groups: Control (Con); Acute pancreatitis (AP) group: Two doses of i.p. 350 mg/100 g body weight (BW) of L-arginine were administered 1 h apart; AP and low-dose genistein (LG) group: mice were given i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg genistein 2 h prior to L-arginine injection followed by once-daily dosing for 3 days; and AP and high-dose genistein (HG) group: mice were given 100 mg/kg genistein with the similar protocol as the LG group. Pancreatic tissue was evaluated for histopathological changes and acinar cell apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kB), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Serum levels of amylase (AMY), c-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured. Results: Significant increases in the degree of acinar cell apoptosis, pancreatic MDA, serum IL-6 and amylase, MPO, NF-kB and 4-HNE positivity were observed in the AP group. All these parameters declined after low- and high-dose genistein treatment. Severe pancreatic inflammation, edema, and acinar cell necrosis were observed in the AP group. Significant improvement of histopathological changes was seen in both low- and high-dose genistein groups. There were no significant differences in any parameters between low and high doses of genistein. Conclusion: Genistein could attenuate the severity of histopathological changes in acute pancreatitis through its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

We herein report the summarized data. Methods: National bariatric/metabolic surgery data, which included the data of 2010 and 2020, were collected from the representatives using a questionnaire that consisted of 10 general questions. At the congress, the data were calculated and summarized. Results: Thirteen of the 14 national societies responded to the survey. From 2010 to recent years, the populations of individuals with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and individuals with diabetes both significantly increased. Eight countries and regions expanded the lower limit of criteria for bariatric surgery by 2–5 kg/m2 (BMI), and 5 countries newly established criteria for metabolic surgery in the last ten years. Sixty-nine percent of the countries currently run public health insurance systems, which doubled from 2010. The number of bariatric surgeons and institutions increased more than threefold from 2010. In 2010, 2019, and 2020, surgeons in IFSO-APC societies performed 18,280, 66,010, and 49,553 bariatric/metabolic surgeries, respectively. Due to the COVID pandemic, restriction policies significantly reduced access to surgery in South and Southeast Asian countries. The biggest changes included increased numbers of bariatric surgeons and institutions, operation numbers, public insurance coverage, raising awareness, and national registry systems. Conclusion: For the last 10 years, bariatric/metabolic surgery has rapidly grown in the Asia–Pacific region.","medical, Nursing","Surgery, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Cyanate and cyanide are often found as co-contaminants in the environment. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of photocatalytic cyanate degradation. This study aims to assess the environmental impacts of cyanate degradation by nano-TiO2/FeCl3 photocatalysis and compare the life cycle impacts of UV-A-, visible-, and solar-driven photocatalysis. The functional unit of the LCA involves “the degradation of 98% cyanate from 1 L wastewater by nano-TiO2/FeCl3.” In the synthesis of TiO2 photocatalysts, the IMPACT 2002+ LCA method reveals that aquatic ecotoxicity, non-renewable energy, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and global warming are the main contributors to total environmental damage through cyanate removal by nano-TiO2/FeCl3 photocatalysis. Ethanol and electricity consumption generates higher environmental impacts than other inputs. The results of endpoint analysis highlight that climate change associated with electricity contributes the greatest environmental impact across the entire photocatalysis life cycle for cyanate removal under all different irradiation sources. This study provides deeper insight into the life cycle environmental hotspots of photocatalytic cyanate degradation by nano-TiO2, potentially enabling mining operators and stakeholders to achieve resource efficiency and cleaner production.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Case presentation: A 77-year-old Thai female farmer with kidney failure presented with peritonitis and PD catheter obstruction from fungal biofilms. The potential root cause of infection was associated with exposure to biocontrol-agent fumes containing pathogen during agricultural work in her garden. This source of infection has not been mentioned previously. Showering and changing clothes right after outdoor activity with a high density of fungal matters or dust should be added to the routine aseptic technique before performing PD bag exchange to prevent the system contamination. Although the patient received early treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, itraconazole, and catheter removal, according to the ISPD Guideline 2016 and the Global Guideline 2021, the outcome was unfavorable. Antifungal susceptibility testing later revealed that the pathogen was only susceptible to voriconazole. Thus, antifungal susceptibility should be tested if the patient fails or slowly responds to the primary antifungal regimen. Conclusions: T. flavus peritonitis is reported here after exposure to biocontrol-agent fumes containing the pathogen. This work also alerts and reiterates nephrology peers to be aware of this overlooked source of peritonitis, the exposure to dusty environments, specifically containing biocontrol-agent fumes.",medical,Nephrology

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among Thai women aged 20–45 years in Bangkok. The vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were matched according to baseline years. HPV/Pap test results were collected from the medical records and/or obtained by cervical sample collection at the study sites. Adjusted hazard ratios were measured using multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: A total of 993 participants (493 vaccinated and 500 unvaccinated) were enrolled from 2018 to 2019. The median ages at baseline of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27–38) and 34 years (IQR 30–38), respectively. The median follow-up periods were 7.3 years (IQR 6.1–8.6) and 7.2 years (IQR 5.8–8.9) for the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group, respectively.

An epidemiology-based model for the operational allocation of COVID-19 vaccines: A case study of Thailand,"Jarumaneeroj P., Dusadeerungsikul P.O., Chotivanich T., Nopsopon T., Pongpirul K.",2022-05-01,"Case-studies, COVID-19, Epidemiological modeling, Pandemic, Thailand, Transmission dynamics, Vaccination strategy, Vaccine administration, Vaccine allocation, Vaccine supplies, COVID-19, Epidemiological model, Pandemic, Vaccine administration, Vaccine allocation","This paper addresses a framework for the operational allocation and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in Thailand, based on both COVID-19 transmission dynamics and other vital operational restrictions that might affect the effectiveness of vaccination strategies in the early stage of vaccine rollout. In this framework, the SIQRV model is first developed and later combined with the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Problem (CVAP) to determine the optimal allocation/administration strategies that minimize total weighted strain on the whole healthcare system. According to Thailand's second pandemic wave data (17th January 2021, to 15th February 2021), we find that the epicenter-based strategy is surprisingly the worst allocation strategy, due largely to the negligence of provincial demographics, vaccine efficacy, and overall transmission dynamics that lead to higher number of infectious individuals. We also find that early vaccination seems to significantly contribute to the reduction in the number of infectious individuals, whose effects tend to increase with more vaccine supply. With these insights, healthcare policy-makers should therefore focus not only on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines at strategic levels but also on the allocation and administration of such vaccines at operational levels for the best of their limited vaccine supply.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

SiO2-layer thicknesses ranging from 3.6 to 27.3 nm were obtained through varying tetraethyl orthosilicate dosages of 0.001–1 M. The crystallinity, surface chemical composition, and physicochemical properties were evaluated for their effects on synergetic degradation mechanisms, dehalogenation, hydrolysis, and adsorption. At a thickness of 3.6 nm, the SiO2 layer offered the highest observed pseudo-first-order rate (kobs) and higher rates of IAcAm degradation were maintained under pH fluctuations (pH 5–7) and aerobic conditions compared to pristine nZVI. At this SiO2-layer thickness (3.6 nm), the rate of iron oxide-layer formation was reduced and the migration of reactive iron species (Fe0 and Fe2+) for the dehalogenation and hydrolysis reactions was enabled. In a single-solute solution, IAcAm elimination was greater than bromoacetamide and chloroacetamide elimination due to the weak ionic I–C bond. In mixed solute conditions, the hydrophobicity of chloroacetamide played a more significant role in competitive degradation through greater adsorption. The proportion of dehalogenation relative to hydrolysis during IAcAm degradation by pristine nZVI and SiO2-coated nZVI was approximately 0.6:0.4. Iodoacetic acid and acetic acid were detected as intermediates in the degradation pathway of IAcAm by pristine nZVI. In contrast, the SiO2 layer on nZVI can accelerate the transformation of IAcAm to acetamide and iodoacetic acid. The electrolyte background of tap water exhibited a slight inhibitory effect on the degradation of IAcAm for both nZVI and SiO2-coated nZVI.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Among the reported predictive factors, it is unclear whether prosthesis design affects postoperative hyperextension. Hence, our objectives were to (1) compare time-dependent changes of the extension angle following multi-radius (MR) and single-radius (SR) TKA and (2) assess predictive factors for the hyperextension. Methods: In this study, consecutive 136 MR TKAs and consecutive 71 SR TKAs performed by a single surgeon were reviewed. The extension angle was evaluated by digitized full-extension lateral radiographs at preoperative, 3 months and at 1 and 2 years after TKA. A positive value was defined as hyperextension. A multiple regression analysis was used to determine predictive factors for the extension angle and the risk of hyperextension > 5°. Results: The postoperative extension angle of both groups gradually increased during the first 2 years and the SR group finally progressed with 4.04° greater extension than the MR group (p < 0.01). The incidence of hyperextension > 5° in the SR group was 18.3% and for the MR group, 7.4% (p = 0.02). However, the Oxford knee scores was nonsignificant different between the groups (p = 0.15). Preoperative extension angle, sagittal femoral component angle (SFA) and SR prosthesis were predictive factors for the extension angle at 2 years after TKA and were also associated with hyperextension > 5°. Conclusions: The extension angle of the SR group became significantly more extended than that of the MR group during the first two years after TKA. Hence, ideal extension position immediately after SR TKA may be different from that of the MR TKA prosthesis. The preoperative extension angle, SFA and SR prosthesis were factors that were associated with postoperative hyperextension.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

Residence in the proximity of the lignite-fired power plant appeared to have more chance to have higher risks of health problems. This study aimed to assess associations of residential proximity to the lignite-fired power plant on depression, sleep quality, and morning salivary cortisol among the elderly. The distance of residential proximity to the power plant was categorized into three groups (units in kilometer): <10 km, 10–15 km, and >15 km. The coefficients of log (morning salivary cortisol) was −0.320 (95%CI: −0.460, −0.179; p-value < 0.001) for those living <10 km compared to those living >15 km. Coefficients of sleep quality score were 1.350 (95%CI: 0.265, 2.436; p-value = 0.015) for those living <10 km compared to those living >15 km. Residential proximity to the lignite-fired power plant was not associated with depression. Our study concluded that living within 10 km to the lignite-fired power plant was related to negative health outcomes among the elderly. Policymakers need to reconsider the distance of the buffer zone to the power plant.","fluidex; related topics, pollution, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"
Pediatric Prediction Model for Low Immunoglobulin G Level Based on Serum Globulin and Illness Status,"Suratannon N., Tantithummawong P., Hurst C.P., Chongpison Y., Wongpiyabovorn J., van Hagen P.M., Dik W.A., Chatchatee P.",2022-02-21,"Agammaglobulinemia, Child, Humans, Immunoglobulin G, Mass Screening, Retrospective Studies, Serum Globulins, globulin, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunoglobulin G, prediction model, screening test","Hypogammaglobulinemia is a condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) measurements are not widely accessible in numerous developing countries. Serum globulin is potentially the best candidate for screening of low IgG level (IgGLo) due to its high availability, low cost, and rapid turnover time. However, multiple factors may influence the probability of prediction. Our study aimed to establish a simple prediction model using serum globulin to predict the likelihood of IgGLo in children. For retrospective data of patients who were suspected of having IgGLo, both serum IgG and globulin were simultaneously collected and measured. Potential factors interfering with serum globulin and IgG levels were investigated for their impact using bivariate binary logistic regression. A multivariate binary logistic regression was used to generate a formula and score to predict IgGLo. We obtained 953 samples from 143 pediatric patients. A strong positive correlation between serum globulin and IgG levels was observed (r=0.83, p < 0.001). A screening test model using serum globulin and illness status was constructed to predict IgGLo. The formula for predicting IgGLo was generated as follows; Predicted score = (2 x globulin (g/dl)) – illness condition score (well=0, sick=1). When the score was <4, the patient has the probability of having IgGLo with a sensitivity of 0.78 (0.71, 0.84), a specificity of 0.71 (0.68, 0.74), PPV of 0.34 (0.29, 0.40) and NPV of 0.94 (0.92, 0.96). This formula will be useful as rapid and inexpensive screening tool for early IgGLo detection, particularly in countries/locations where serum IgG measurement is inaccessible.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Hence, we sought to assess the IOA, intra-observer reliability (IOR), and diagnostic performance of EUS-nCLE using a large cohort of patients with histopathological diagnosis amongst a broad panel of international observers. Methods: EUS-nCLE videos (n = 76) of subjects with PCLs [intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), serous cystadenoma (SCA), pseudocyst, and cystic-neuroendocrine tumors/solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (cystic-NET/SPN)], simulating clinical prevalence rates were obtained from 3 prospective studies. An international panel of 13 endosonographers with nCLE experience, blinded to all PCL data, evaluated the video library twice with a two-week washout for PCL differentiation (mucinous vs. non-mucinous) and subtype diagnosis. Results: The IOA (κ = 0.82, 95% CI 0.77–0.87) and IOR (κ = 0.82, 95% CI 0.78–0.85) were “almost perfect” to differentiate mucinous vs. non-mucinous PCLs. For PCL subtype, IOA was highest for SCA (almost perfect; κ = 0.85), followed by IPMN (substantial, κ = 0.72), and cystic-NET/SPN (substantial, κ = 0.73). The IOA was moderate for MCN (κ = 0.47), and pseudocyst (κ = 0.57). Compared to histopathology, observers differentiated mucinous vs. non-mucinous PCLs with high accuracy (94.8%, 95% CI 93.3–96.1). For detecting specific PCLs subtypes, EUS-nCLE was highly accurate in diagnosing non-mucinous cysts (SCA: 98%; cystic-NET/SPN: 96%; pseudocyst: 96%) and slightly less accurate for mucinous lesions (IPMN: 86%; MCN: 84%). Conclusion: Diagnosis of PCLs by EUS-nCLE guided virtual biopsy is very accurate and reliable for the most prevalent pancreatic cysts in clinical practice.",medical,"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

Hence, the spent coffee grounds (SCG) was employed as the support material, proffering alimentation, and platform for Chlorella vulgaris sp. microalgae, to populate its surface. The SCG dosage of 8 g L−1 was revealed as optimum in enhancing the attached microalgal growth, i.e., achieving the microalgae density of 2.43 ± 0.04 g g-SCG−1 under continuous illumination. The introduction of a 20:4 photoperiod regime with the dark period cycle of 4 h day−1 and the remaining 20 h day−1 of illumination yielded a maximum microalgal density of 3.970 ± 0.8 g g-SCG−1. In this regard, the dark period had allowed the attached microalgae to strengthen their mixotrophic growth, i.e., assimilating more carbon from SCG effectively amidst heterotrophic mode. Besides, the extension of the dark period to 20 h day−1 had been identified as the threshold requirement to stress the attached microalgae in accumulating a significant amount of lipid which was about fivefold more productive than the attached microalgae growing under the continuous illumination. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profile derived from harvested attached microalgal biomass was loaded primarily with alkyl chains of C12 to C18. Also, the high saturation degree of FAME had indicated the stability of biodiesel produced from attached microalgae growing onto SCG feedstock.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The approach overcomes the challenges associated with local optima pitfalls in processing the mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and hence determines the accurate solutions at modest computing efforts. In essence, the first-phase ESO design incorporates the constraint relaxations to fast eliminate the ineffective (infeasible) sections from initial discrete variable domains. This advantageously provides a significant reduction in the search spaces performed in the second-phase CLPSO scheme. The comprehensive learning technique enhances a standard particle swarm optimization algorithm by enabling the cooperative responses among swarm populations. The learning probability function defines the comprehensive cross-positions between the sets of best particles constructed from the reducing sets of steel sections specified in the preliminary ESO phase leading to the computation of optimal solutions. Various benchmarks (subjected to infinite design combinations) illustrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed design method (viz., generating the smaller number of particles) as compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Engineering (all)"

In the extraction process using SC-CO2, the effects of three independent variables–temperature (40‒80°C), pressure (10‒30 MPa), and the ratio of ethanol as a modifier (0%‒10% v/v), on dependent variables: extraction yield and total diterpene content–were investigated using the response surface methodology and Box–Behnken design. The optimal conditions for the extraction yield and total diterpene content were predicted to be 40°C/30 MPa/10% v/v of ethanol and 80°C/25 MPa/6% v/v of ethanol, respectively. Notably, the predicted maximum total diterpene content was 15 times the amount obtained by the Soxhlet method using n-hexane, thereby confirming the selectivity of ethanol-modified SC-CO2 toward diterpenes. Subsequently, based on the supercritical antisolvent crystallization process, the SCG extract was successfully encapsulated into polyvinylpyrrolidone particles with an average particle size of 140 nm, and the water dispersibility of the SCG extract was enhanced by this encapsulation process. The encapsulation of SCG extract with water-soluble polymers enables the further use of SCG extract in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) are the major gut microbial molecules of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, respectively, and can induce inflammation in several organs. Here, the fibrosis in the kidney, liver, and heart was investigated in oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomized (Candida-5/6 Nx) mice. At 20 weeks post 5/6 Nx, Candida-5/6 Nx mice demonstrated increased 24 h proteinuria, liver enzymes, and serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), but not weight loss, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, serum creatinine, or gut-derived uremic toxins (TMAO and indoxyl sulfate), compared to in 5/6 Nx alone. The gut leakage in Candida-5/6 Nx was more severe, as indicated by FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, and serum BG. The areas of fibrosis from histopathology, along with the upregulated gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and Dectin-1, the receptors for LPS and BG, respectively, were higher in the kidney, liver, and heart. In vitro, LPS combined with BG increased the supernatant IL-6 and TNF-α, upregulated the genes of pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic processes, Dectin-1, and TLR-4 in renal tubular (HK-2) cells and hepatocytes (HepG2), when compared with LPS or BG alone. This supported the pro-inflammation-induced fibrosis and the possible LPS–BG additive effects on kidney and liver fibrosis. In conclusion, uremia-induced leaky gut causes the translocation of gut LPS and BG into circulation, which activates the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways, causing internal organ fibrosis. Our results support the crosstalk among several organs in CKD through a leaky gut.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In this study, 5-O-(N-Boc-L-alanine)-renieramycin T (OBA-RT) was demonstrated to suppress CSC signals and induce apoptosis. OBA-RT exerted cytotoxic effects with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of approximately 7 µM and mediated apoptosis as detected by annexin V/propidium iodide using flow cytometry and nuclear staining assays. Mechanistically, OBA-RT exerted dual roles, activating p53-dependent apoptosis and concomitantly suppressing CSC signals. A p53-dependent pathway was indicated by the induction of p53 and the depletion of anti-apoptotic Myeloid leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins. Cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Cleaved-PARP) was detected in OBA-RT-treated cells. Interestingly, OBA-RT exerted strong CSC-suppressing activity, reducing the ability to form tumor spheroids. In addition, OBA-RT could induce apoptosis in CSC-rich populations and tumor spheroid collapse. CSC markers, including prominin-1 (CD133), Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), and Nanog Homeobox (Nanog), were notably decreased after OBA-RT treatment. Upstream CSCs regulating active Akt and c-Myc were significantly decreased; indicating that Akt may be a potential target of action. Computational molecular modeling revealed a high-affinity interaction between OBA-RT and an Akt molecule.

To sustainably manage these sites, a geochemical audit coupled with numerical simulation to predict AMD flow paths and heavy metal migration are valuable. In this study, a 40-year-old TSF in Hokkaido, Japan was investigated. Tailings in this historical TSF contain pyrite (FeS2) while its copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) contents were 1400–6440 mg/kg and 2800–22,300 mg/kg, respectively. Copper and Zn were also easily released in leaching tests because they are partitioned with the exchangeable phase (29% of Zn; 15% of Cu) and oxidizable fraction (25% of Zn; 33% of Cu). Kinetic modeling results attributed AMD formation to the interactions of pyrite and soluble phases in the tailings with oxygenated groundwater, which is supported by the sequential extraction and leaching results. Calibrations of groundwater/AMD flow and solute transport in the 2D reactive transport model were successfully done using hydraulic heads measured on-site and leaching results, respectively. The model forecasted the quality of AMD to deteriorate with time and AMD formation to continue for 1000 years. It also predicted ~24% AMD flux reduction, including lower Zn release with time when recharge reduction interventions are implemented on-site.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Given the presence of organosulfurous compounds in WTPO, this research was consisted of two steps. First, the hydrogenation of naphthalene, a model PAH compound, was used to screen for suitable promoters [molybdenum (Mo), tungstate (W), and platinum (Pt)] for nickel-supported gamma-alumina (Ni/γ-Al2O3) catalyst to provide a high sulfur tolerance and high PAH hydrogenation efficiency. Second, the obtained suitable catalysts were applied for the hydrogenation of 50 wt% WTPO solution in decane containing 15 982 ppm PAHs and a 0.75 wt% sulfur content. Although the NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest performance with 83.8% naphthalene conversion under 40 bar initial H2 pressure at 350°C for 6 hours, it was less tolerant to the presence of thiophene, one of the organosulfurous compounds found in WTPO. Thus, the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiW/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were selected for WTPO hydrogenation. The PAHs hydrogenation and hydrodesulfurization occurred simultaneously in both catalytic systems. Under 50 bar initial H2 pressure at 350°C, the NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst had a higher ability for hydrodesulfurization (98.4% maximum sulfur removal) than hydrogenation of PAHs (66.0% removal of PAHs), whereas NiW/γ-Al2O3, with lower acidity, showed a preference for hydrogenation of PAHs (71.1% removal of PAHs) with a lower hydroisomerization efficiency (74.2% sulfur removal). Moreover, the chemical structure of PAHs affected the ability to be eliminated by hydrogenation. PAHs having unsubstituted rings could be easily hydrogenated, while the removal of PAHs containing alkyl substituents in both aromatic rings required severe reaction conditions due to their high steric hindrance for adsorption onto the catalyst active sites.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The effect of three-part breathing exercise on smoking cessation: A 6-month cluster-randomized clinical trial,"Klinsophon T., Thaveeratitham P., Janwantanakul P.",2022-10-01,"Breathing Exercises, Cotinine, Humans, Nicotine, Quality of Life, Smoking Cessation, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Thailand, Affect, Cigarette cravings, Nicotine withdrawal symptoms, Quality of life, Respiratory muscle training","Introduction: Negative affect was identified as an important barrier to smoking cessation. Three-part breathing exercise showed a significant effect on decreasing negative affect immediately after being practiced. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of three-part breathing exercise on smoking cessation. Methods: A 6-month cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Forty-three participants recruited from 8 companies in Bangkok Metropolitan areas were randomly assigned at the cluster level into either the intervention or control groups. Control group (n = 23) received counseling for smoking cessation once a week for 12 weeks. Intervention group (n = 20) received counseling for smoking cessation plus a three-part breathing exercise program once a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were 7-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence rate as validated by saliva cotinine. The secondary outcomes were cigarette cravings, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, affect and quality of life. Results: The results revealed no significant difference in smoking abstinence rate between the three-part breathing exercise and control group. Participants demonstrated significant pre-post improvement in cigarette cravings, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, affect, and quality of life within each group. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, the improvement in abstinence rate from the three-part breathing exercise was deemed clinically relevant. Thus, it may be recommended to smokers interested in smoking cessation and more research is needed on this topic.","Health Professions, medical","Complementary and Manual Therapy, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"
Machine learning-based normal tissue complication probability model for predicting albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade increase in hepatocellular carcinoma patients,"Prayongrat A., Srimaneekarn N., Thonglert K., Khorprasert C., Amornwichet N., Alisanant P., Shirato H., Kobashi K., Sriswasdi S.",2022-12-01,"Albumins, Bilirubin, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Machine Learning, Retrospective Studies, Albumin-bilirubin grade, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Machine learning, Normal tissue complication probability model, Radiation-induced liver toxicity","Purpose:: The aim of this study was to develop a normal tissue complication probability model using a machine learning approach (ML-based NTCP) to predict the risk of radiation-induced liver disease in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Materials and methods:: The study population included 201 HCC patients treated with radiotherapy. The patients’ medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain the clinical and radiotherapy data. Toxicity was defined by albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade increase. The normal liver dose-volume histogram was reduced to mean liver dose (MLD) based on the fraction size-adjusted equivalent uniform dose (2 Gy/fraction and α/β = 2). Three types of ML-based classification models were used, a penalized logistic regression (PLR), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosted tree (GBT) model. Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Internal validation was performed by 5-fold cross validation and external validation was done in 44 new patients. Results:: Liver toxicity occurred in 87 patients (43.1%). The best individual model was the GBT model using baseline liver function, liver volume, and MLD as inputs and the best overall model was an ensemble of the PLR and GBT models. An AUROC of 0.82 with a standard deviation of 0.06 was achieved for the internal validation. An AUROC of 0.78 with a standard deviation of 0.03 was achieved for the external validation. The behaviors of the best GBT model were also in good agreement with the domain knowledge on NTCP. Conclusion:: We propose the methodology to develop an ML-based NTCP model to estimate the risk of ALBI grade increase.",medical,"Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
Control of parturition in hyperprolific sows by using altrenogest and double administrations of PGF2α,"Taechamaeteekul P., Dumniem N., Sang-Gassanee K., Tummaruk P.",2022-03-15,"Animals, Colostrum, Dinoprost, Female, Parturition, Pregnancy, Swine, Trenbolone Acetate, Backfat, Farrowing, IgG, Pig, Prostaglandin","The aim of the present study was to develop a protocol to reduce the variation in gestation length and synchronise the onset of parturition in sows by using altrenogest in combination with double administrations of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2α). In total, 188 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows with parity numbers 3.1 ± 1.6 were included in the experiment. The sows were classified into two groups: CONTROL (n = 94) and TREATMENT (n = 94). CONTROL sows were allowed to farrow naturally, and TREATMENT sows were orally administered 20 mg/day of altrenogest starting when they entered the farrowing house (107.0 ± 2.0 days) until 113 (TREAT–113, n = 18), 114 (TREAT–114, n = 29) and 115 (TREAT–115, n = 47) days of gestation. The altrenogest-treated sows were administered PGF2α twice 6 h apart at 24 h after the withdrawal of altrenogest. The litters were randomly selected (25 and 26 litters from CONTROL and TREATMENT groups, respectively) to determine individual body weight at birth and at 24 h after birth. Gestation length of sows that farrowed naturally averaged 115.1 days (range 111–118), whereas gestation length of altrenogest-treated sows averaged 115.1–116.3 days (range 114–118). The colostrum yield of sows averaged 4.25 ± 1.19 kg and was not affected by the treatment (P > 0.05). Colostrum IgG in the CONTROL group was higher than in the TREAT–114 and TREAT–115 groups (P < 0.05) but did not differ significantly compared to the TREAT–113 group. The proportion of sows that farrowed during working hours (0700–1700 h) in the TREAT–113 group (72.3%) tended to be higher than in the CONTROL (46.4%, P = 0.053). The interval from the last altrenogest treatment until farrowing in the TREAT–113 group was longer than in the TREAT–114 and TREAT–115 groups (62.8, 40.7 and 34.6 h, respectively, P < 0.05). Similarly, the intervals from the first PGF2α administration to the onset of parturition in the TREAT–113 group (38.8 ± 3.8 h) was longer than TREAT–114 (21.9 ± 3.5 h, P = 0.002) and TREAT–115 (25.5 ± 3.7 h, P = 0.016) groups. However, the incidence of stillbirths in the TREAT–113, TREAT–114 and TREAT–115 groups was higher than in the CONTROL (16.4, 17.2, 11.8 and 5.8%, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, altrenogest supplementation in combination with double administrations of PGF2α can reduce the variation in gestation length and synchronise the onset of parturition in sows. However, its side effects on the incidence of stillbirths should be considered.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"
Development of high-throughput lacrimal gland organoid platforms for drug discovery in dry eye disease,"Rodboon T., Yodmuang S., Chaisuparat R., Ferreira J.N.",2022-04-01,"Animals, Bioprinting, Drug Discovery, Dry Eye Syndromes, Lacrimal Apparatus, Mice, Organoids, Swine, Bioprinting, Drug discovery, Dry eye disease, Lacrimal gland, Organoids, Xerophthalmia","Dysfunction and damage of the lacrimal gland (LG) results in ocular discomfort and dry eye disease (DED). Current therapies for DED do not fully replenish the necessary lubrication to rescue optimal vision. New drug discovery for DED has been limited perhaps because in vitro models cannot mimic the biology of the native LG. The existing platforms for LG organoid culture are scarce and still not ready for consistency and scale up production towards drug screening. The magnetic three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting (M3DB) is a novel system for 3D in vitro biofabrication of cellularized tissues using magnetic nanoparticles to bring cells together. M3DB provides a scalable platform for consistent handling of spheroid-like cell cultures facilitating consistent biofabrication of organoids. Previously, we successfully generated innervated secretory epithelial organoids from human dental pulp stem cells with M3DB and found that this platform is feasible for epithelial organoid bioprinting. Research targeting LG organogenesis, drug discovery for DED has extensively used mouse models. However, certain inter-species differences between mouse and human must be considered. Porcine LG appear to have more similarities to human LG than the mouse counterparts. We have conducted preliminary studies with the M3DB for fabricating LG organoids from primary cells isolated from murine and porcine LG, and found that this platform provides robust LG organoids for future potential high-throughput analysis and drug discovery. The LG organoid holds promise to be a functional model of tearing, a platform for drug screening, and may offer clinical applications for DED.",medical,Medicine (all)

Methods: Studies were identified from PubMed and Scopus up to February 2022. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trial (RCT), conducted in spastic cerebral palsy children with equinus deformity, aged less than 18 years, compared any conservative treatments (Botulinum toxin A; BoNT-A, casting, physical therapy, and orthosis), and evaluated gait improvement (Physician Rating Scale or Video Gait Analysis), Observational Gait Scale, Clinical Gait Assessment Score, ankle dorsiflexion (ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact, and passive ankle dorsiflexion), or Gross Motor Function Measure. Any study with the participants who recently underwent surgery or received BoNT-A or insufficient data was excluded. Two authors were independently selected and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. I2 was performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Risk ratio (RR), the unstandardized mean difference (USMD), and the standardized mean difference were used to estimate treatment effects with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: From 20 included studies (716 children), 15 RCTs were eligible for meta-analysis (35% had low risk of bias). BoNT-A had higher number of gait improvements than placebo (RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.71, 4.07, I2 = 0). Its combination with physical therapy yielded better passive ankle dorsiflexion at knee extension than physical therapy alone (USMD = 4.16 degrees; 95% CI 1.54, 6.78, I2 = 36%). Casting with or without BoNT-A had no different gait improvement and ankle dorsiflexion at knee extension when compared to BoNT-A. Orthosis significantly increased ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact comparing to control (USMD 10.22 degrees, 95 CI% 5.13, 15.31, I2 = 87%). Conclusion: BoNT-A and casting contribute to gait improvement and ankle dorsiflexion at knee extension. BoNT-A specifically provided gait improvement over the placebo and additive effect to physical therapy for passive ankle dorsiflexion. Orthosis would be useful for ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact. Trial registration PROSPERO number CRD42019146373.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

The CeO2 promoter was found to enhance the selectivity of the ZrO2 catalyst towards the main product owing to an increase in the surface acidity and total Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the theoretical aspect of such an increase in acidity was confirmed by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which revealed a strong interaction between the NH3 probe molecule and the Ce4O4/ZrO2 catalyst surface model, where all catalyst surface models were constructed based on their X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy profiles. Various promoters were tested; for instance, although the conversion was high in the case of the Ba4O4/ZrO2 catalyst, the selectivity was suppressed. This was due to the two parameters that were found from the DFT calculations to be low for the BaO-promoted catalysts, which confirmed the weak interaction of the NH3 probe molecule in such a system. Thus, when ZrO2–based catalysts are prepared, their (i) surface acidity and (ii) total Lewis acid sites should be considered, and a promoter that improves these parameters would be beneficial.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

To solve this, the potential of STW for butanol production, which has never been evaluated for use in ABE fermentation, is reported. Clostridium beijerinckii CUEA02, the strain producing the highest butanol level in this study, was isolated from natural sources in Thailand. Isolate CUEA02 was closely related to C. beijerinckii with an average nucleotide identity of 95.14% and could grow and produce butanol from various carbon sources. The butanol production was 8.32 ± 0.08 g/L in flask fermentation under an initial pH of 6.5, 35 °C, 10% (v/v) inoculum size, and 50 g/L of glucose. To evaluate the potential of STW, it was diluted 0.1x, 0.2x, 0.3x, and 0.4x for ABE production by CUEA02, with the 0.1x dilution giving the highest butanol yield (0.23 g/g). To improve the butanol production, the initial pH was adjusted from 4.75 to 6.5, resulting in a 2.13-fold enhanced butanol yield (0.49 g/g). Moreover, the addition of yeast extract at 2 g/L increased the butanol production by up to 29% in STW using C. beijerinckii CUEA02.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, wastewater and other effluent/liquid waste engineeringn., biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, environmental, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Biomedical Engineering"

The detection of alkB and CYP153 genes in the genome of OPK members supports its phenotypic ability to effectively degrade a broad range of saturated hydrocarbons in crude oil. Zeolite-immobilized OPK was developed as a ready-to-use bioproduct and it exhibited 74% removal of 1000 mg L−1 crude oil within 96 h in sterilized seawater without nutrient supplementation and maintained high crude oil-removal activity under a broad range of pH values (5.0–9.0), temperatures (30–40 °C) and salinities (20–60‰). In addition, the immobilized OPK retained a high crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments and showed reusability for at least 5 cycles. Remarkably, bioaugmentation with zeolite-immobilized OPK in sandy soil microcosms significantly increased crude oil (10,000 mg kg−1 soil) removal from 45% to 80.67% within 21 days compared to biostimulation and natural attenuation. Moreover, bioaugmentation with exogenous immobilized OPK stimulated an increase in the relative abundances of Alcanivorax genus, indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, which in turn enhanced removal efficiency of crude oil contamination from sandy soil microcosms. The results indicate positive interactions between the bioaugmented immobilized consortium, harboring Mycolicibacterium as a key player, and indigenous Alcanivorax, which exhibited crucial functions for improving crude oil removal efficacy. The knowledge obtained forms an important basis for further synthesis and handling of a promising bio-based product for enhancing the in situ bioremediation of crude oil-polluted marine environments.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, petroleum engineeringneering, pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The present study investigated the influence of BIO on the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). hDPSCs were treated with 200, 400, or 800 nM BIO, and the effects on hDPSC responses and osteogenic differentiation were assessed. BIO-mediated Wnt activation was confirmed by β-catenin nuclear translocation detected by immunofluorescence staining. BIO attenuated colony formation and cell migration determined by in vitro wound-healing assay. BIO increased early apoptotic cell population evaluated using flow cytometry. For osteogenic induction, BIO promoted alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralisation in a dose-dependent manner. ALP, RUNX2, OCN, OSX, ANKH, DMP1, and DSPP mRNA expression were significantly upregulated. The OPG/RANKL expression ratio was also increased. Further, BIO attenuated adipogenic differentiation as demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation and adipogenic-related gene expression. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing data from the BIO-treated hDPSCs revealed that BIO modulated pathways related to autophagy and actin cytoskeleton regulation. These findings demonstrated that BIO treatment promoted hDPSC osteogenic differentiation. Therefore, this small molecule is a strong candidate as a bioactive molecule to enhance dentin repair.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Long-term (~70 years) and short-term (~10 years) shoreline movement rates were analysed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Results of this analysis indicate that the shoreline along the western coast (WBK) of the Bang Pakong River mouth has undergone severe coastal degradation, with a land loss of about 980 ha over the last seven decades. Meanwhile, the eastern coastline (EBK) has developed continuously over this time span, resulting in a land growth of about 552 ha. Based on historical shorelines recorded since 1954, the shoreline recession along the WBK coast accelerated over five decades. The average shoreline change rate reached approximately −9 m/year in 2002 and is shown to be related to land subsidence, which was due to groundwater withdrawals. The WBK coastline stabilized in 2009 and became an accretionary coast after 2016 due to the introduction of engineered coastal protection measures. In addition, the construction of major dams on the Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong rivers did not result in severe shoreline recession along the WBK coast. A significant reduction in sediment supply to the coastal zone due to damming was not observed. In contrast, the EBK coastline has advanced continuously since 1953, with average growth rates between 0.5 and 7.6 m/year over 50 years as a result of increased riverine sediment supply. Our results also indicate that mangrove deforestation was not a major factor causing shoreline retreat, and mangrove reforestation was not a successful coastal protection approach in this coast.","sociology, earth sciences","Geography, Planning and Development, Earth-Surface Processes, Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Herein, our results show that cH/cG = 5/4 is energetically stable. Subsequently, the incommensurate host–guest structure is found to be thermodynamically and dynamically stable within harmonic level. The hybridization of spd explains the stability of the host–guest structure under high pressure conditions. The distributions of electrons between the host and guest atoms indicate the strong and weak electron localizations of spd bonds. This findings suggest that the host–guest structure is more likely to be achieved experimentally in this metallic element at moderate pressure.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering, physics, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computational Mathematics"

Case presentation: A 29-year-old woman recently immunized with inactivated viral vaccine—BBIBP32-CorV (Sinopharm) presented with alteration of consciousness. Her body temperature was 37° Celsius, blood pressure 42/31 mmHg, heart rate 130 bpm, respiratory rate 20 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Respiratory examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed stupor but preserved brainstem reflexes. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the brain showed symmetrical hypodense lesions involving bilateral thalami and cerebellar hemispheres characteristic of ANE. No pulmonary infiltration was found on chest radiograph. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR; whole genome sequencing later confirmed the Delta variant. RANBP2 gene analysis revealed heterozygous Thr585Met mutation. Serum IL-6 was 7390 pg/mL. Urine examination showed pyelonephritis. Her clinical course was complicated by seizure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and acute hepatic failure. She later developed coma and passed away in 6 days. Conclusions: ANE is caused by cytokine storm leading to necrosis and hemorrhage of the brain. IL-6 was deemed as a prognostic factor and a potential treatment target of ANE in previous studies. RANBP2 missense mutation strongly predisposes this condition by affecting mitochondrial function, viral entry, cytokine signaling, immune response, and blood–brain barrier maintenance. Also, inactivated vaccine has been reported to precipitate massive production of cytokines by antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). The true incidence of COVID-19 associated ANE is not known as were the predictors of its development. We proposed these potential two factors (RANBP2 mutation and ADE) that could participate in the pathogenesis of ANE in COVID-19 apart from SARS-CoV2 infection by itself.

Electromechanical responses of agarose ionogels as highly soft and compliant actuators,"Rotjanasuworapong K., Thummarungsan N., Lerdwijitjarud W., Sirivat A.",2022-03-15,"1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, Actuation, Agarose, Compliant actuator, Dielectrophoresis force, Electroactive material, Electromechanical property, Electromechanical response, Ionogels, Soft actuators, Actuation, Agarose, Electromechanical properties, Ionic liquid, Ionogel","Ionogels have been of interest as an alternative electroactive material for soft actuator applications, as they can maintain the shape and size under ambient conditions. Herein, the physically cross-linked agarose ionogels were fabricated via a solvent casting method by using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]) as the ionic liquid. The electro-actuation responses were investigated in terms of agarose contents and electric field strengths. For the electromechanical responses, the electrostriction shows two distinct behaviors dependent on agarose contents: at the high agarose content of 12.0%v/v, the storage modulus relative response (ΔG'/G'0) was the positive value of 0.06, known as the positive electrostriction; at the low agarose contents of 4.0%v/v and 8.0%v/v, the ΔG'/G'0 were negative definite at −0.11 and −0.06, respectively. These behaviors occurred from the plasticizing [Bmim][Cl] molecules which were able to hinder the agarose intermolecular interactions. For the electro-induced bending behaviors, the AG-[Bmim][Cl] Ionogel_4.0%v/v revealed the highest deflection distance and dielectrophoresis force (Fd) due to its lower initial rigidity and the polarizations from the [Bmim][Cl], moisture, and agarose structures, respectively. Comparing with other bio-polymeric hydrogels and ionogels, the present AG-[Bmim][Cl] Ionogels are shown here to possess relatively low electrostrictive stresses but high dielectrophoresis force density; both are essential features for utilizing in soft actuator applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science, chemistry","Physics and Astronomy (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Neuroprotective effects of ergosterol against TNF-α-induced HT-22 hippocampal cell injury,"Sillapachaiyaporn C., Mongkolpobsin K., Chuchawankul S., Tencomnao T., Baek S.J.",2022-10-01,"Antioxidants, Ergosterol, Glutamic Acid, Hippocampus, N-Methylaspartate, Neuroprotective Agents, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Akt signaling, Antioxidation, Auricularia polytricha, Ergosterol, Neuroprotective effect, NMDA receptor","Neuroinflammation is a brain pathology that involves the expression of high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). An excessive TNF-α expression could result in neuronal cell death and subsequently lead to neurodegeneration. Auricularia polytricha (AP; an edible mushroom) has been reported as a rich source of ergosterol with several medicinal benefits. The current study reports on the neuroprotective effects of AP extracts and ergosterol against the TNF-α-induced HT-22 hippocampal cell injury. The hexane extract of AP (APH) demonstrated a neuroprotective effect against the TNF-α-induced HT-22 cell toxicity, taking place through the activation of the antioxidant pathway. Ergosterol, a major component of APH, could attenuate the toxicity of TNF-α on HT-22 cells, by increasing the expression of a major antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase-1) and by facilitating the scavenging of reactive oxygen species through antioxidant signaling. Moreover, an antibody array was performed to screen the possible molecular targets of ergosterol in HT-22 cells exposed to TNF-α. Based on the antibody array, the phospho-Akt was activated in the presence of ergosterol, and this finding was also supported by Western blotting analysis. Furthermore, ergosterol inhibited the transcriptional expressions of the glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type subunit 2B gene (Grin2b) through an early growth response-1 (EGR-1) overexpression in TNF-α-treated HT-22 cells. Our findings suggest that a novel therapeutic effect of AP and ergosterol against neuroinflammation, that it is mediated by an NMDA gene modulation occurring through the overexpression of the EGR-1 transcription factor.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Probiotic viability, physicochemical properties, phytochemicals, antioxidant activity, volatile flavor compounds, and sensory acceptability of fermented GJ were investigated. A decrease in pH value and sugar content with an increase in organic acids (lactic and acetic acid) and probiotic viability were detected after GJ fermentation. Interestingly, the β-carotene content, DPPH radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity of fermented GJ were all higher than those of non-fermented GJ. Furthermore, fermented GJ at 10 g/100 g showed a remarkable ability to disrupt cholesterol micellization formation and increase bile acid binding activity. The fermentation of GJ introduced various volatile compounds without affecting sensory acceptability. The findings suggest that GJ might be a promising ingredient for developing a non-dairy probiotic beverage with increased bioactive phytochemicals and functional properties.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Current investigations focus on neural component which may overlook other important factors such as the vascular cause. The optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging has been developed and provided quantitative parameters that showed good diagnostic accuracy to detect glaucoma. However, those parameters are based on image processing of observed clinical findings, therefore, some image information can be lost. Convolutional neural network has been successfully applied for automatic feature extraction and object classification. In this study, the glaucoma diagnosis network, namely GlauNet, has been proposed. GlauNet consists of two sections: the feature-extraction section and the classification section. The feature-extraction section has three convolutional layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by rectified linear unit and maximum pooling layer. The classification section contains five fully connected layers. GlauNet was trained with 258 glaucomatous and 439 non-glaucomatous eyes. The visualization of the feature-extraction section showed the highlight in the area of optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer in the superotemporal and inferotemporal regions. It was then tested on 27 glaucomatous and 48 non-glaucomatous eyes. Its sensitivity and specificity were 88.9% with 89.6%, respectively. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve of GlauNet was 0.89. GlauNet was robust against the artifacts. Its sensitivity and specificity were still higher than 80% (82.4% and 80.3%, respectively) when tested on 88 poor-quality images.","mixing and separation, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The social force model is used to simulate the movement of evacuee and leader crowd evacuation with leader in an experimental area. The a-star algorithm is used to find the evacuation routes of each evacuee from the initial location to the exit. In this paper, we proposed the application of reinforcement learning to train the agent to become an evacuation leader via the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit. This model is tested in three scenarios: an evacuation without a leader, an evacuation with a leader, and an evacuation with randomly located agent. They are considered for comparison purposes to show the impact of an agent that tries to tell an exit to all evacuees in the experimental area. The experimental results show that the proposed crowd evacuation agent could effectively evacuate all evacuees in the experimental area.","artificial intelligence, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

In this work, we present the use of ion diffusion in the simulation of the 2D ion flow field for reduced and full models of monopolar transmission lines. The simulation includes a ground zone and utilized a high diffusion coefficient for the zone. The charge density, potential, and flow problems are simulated by using a fluid dynamic software with the upwind finite volume method (FVM). The purpose is to investigate the ion charge density near the ground surface. Our results show that the artifact accumulation of charge and the higher current density near the air-ground surface can be mitigated by using the high diffusion coefficient of the ground zone. At a small height above the ground plane, the stabilized diffusion current density is observed and used to evaluate the magnitude of ground level current density. The simulated ground level current density agrees well with that in a reference for both reduced-scale and full-scale models where our values are slightly higher. The simulation with the presence of wind shows the wind effect on the ion current density profile as the position of peak current density shifts and the peak magnitude decreases. Compared with the no wind condition, the ion current also takes a wider area under the HV conductor.","computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Results: Wheat ingestion was significantly associated with more frequent TLESR after lunch than rice (5.0 ± 0.7 vs. 1.9 ± 0.3 times/2 h, p = 0.01). After lunch, wheat ingestion was significantly associated with higher H2 and CH4 levels compared to rice ingestion (p < 0.05), while H2 and CH4 levels before lunch were similar (p > 0.05). The area under curve of H2 concentration until 2 h after lunch significantly correlated with the TLESR number (r = 0.69, p = 0.04). Postprandial regurgitation (2.9 ± 1.2 vs. 0.4 ± 0.2), bloating (7.0 ± 0.4 vs. 3.1 ± 0.9), satiety (7.7 ± 0.4 vs. 3.5 ± 0.9), and belching (3.8 ± 1.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.6) symptom scores were significantly greater after wheat compared to rice noodle ingestion (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Wheat noodle meals, part of a high FODMAP diet, induced a higher frequency of TLESRs, a higher GERD, and higher upper-GI symptom scores than rice noodle meals, part of a low FODMAP diet, in patients with overlapping IBS-GERD. These effects were associated with more intestinal gas production.

Methods: Study participants included 44 patients who underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion at L4-5 level. Radiographic parameters at adjacent segments (L3-4 and L5-S1) and clinical parameters were reviewed. Results: Postoperative dural sac area significantly increased in upper (mean change 8.05 mm2, P < 0.001) and lower (14.08 mm2, P < 0.001) adjacent segments. Significant increases in SAPD were seen in upper (0.85 mm, P < 0.001) and lower (0.66 mm, P < 0.001) adjacent segments. Ligamentum flavum thickness significantly decreased in lower adjacent segments (−0.37 mm, P = 0.006). For every 1-mm increase in fused level disc height, lower SAPD increased 0.22 mm (P = 0.04), and lower segmental angle increased 0.91° (P = 0.04). For every 1° increase in fused level segmental angle, lower dural sac area increased 1.25 mm2 (P = 0.03), and lower SAPD increased 0.12 mm (P = 0.003).

The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory describes the beam-section kinematics and the Winkler-foundation model represents interaction between the beam and its underlying substrate medium. The reformulated strain-gradient elasticity theory possessing three non-classical material constants is employed to address the beam-bulk material small-scale effect. The first and second constants is associated with the strain-gradient and couple-stress effects, respectively while the third constant is related to the velocity-gradient effect. The Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory is adopted to account for the surface-free energy. To obtain the system governing equation as well as corresponding boundary conditions, Hamilton’s principle is called for. Three numerical simulations are presented to characterize the influences of the material small-scale effect, the surface-energy effect, and the surrounding substrate medium on bending, buckling, and free vibration responses of nanobeam-substrate medium systems. The first simulation focuses on the bending response and shows the ability of the proposed model to eliminate the paradoxical characteristic inherent to nanobeam models proposed in the literature. The second and third simulations perform the sensitivity investigation of the system parameters on the buckling load and the natural frequency, respectively. All analytical results reveal that both material small-scale and surface-energy effects consistently stiffen the system response while the velocity-gradient effect weakens the system response. Furthermore, these sized-scale effects are more pronounced when the underlying substrate medium becomes softer.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Strain induced by sample inhomogeneity is believed to be a trigger to the behaviors. In agreement with previous predictions and reports, a mixed phase of 1 T ′ and 2H structures was also detected in Se-rich samples.

Materials and methods: Twelve different centers provided SFOFs determined with various detectors. Various linac models using the beam qualities 6 MV and 10 MV with flattening filter and without flattening filter were utilized to generate square fields down to a nominal field size of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The detectors were positioned at 10 cm depth in water. Depending on the local situation, the source-to-surface distance was either set to 90 cm or 100 cm. The SFOFs were normalized to the output of the 10 cm × 10 cm field. The spread of SFOFs measured with different detectors was investigated for each individual linac beam quality and field size. Additionally, linac-type specific SFOF curves were determined for each beam quality and the SFOFs determined using individual detectors were compared to these curves. Example uncertainty budgets were established for a solid state detector and a micro ionization chamber. Results: The spread of SFOFs for each linac and field was below 5% for all field sizes. With the exception of one linac-type, the SFOFs of all investigated detectors agreed within 10% with the respective linac-type SFOF curve, indicating a potential inter-detector and inter-linac variability. Conclusion: Quality assurance on the SFOF measurements can be done by investigation of the spread of SFOFs measured with multiple detectors and by comparison to linac-type specific SFOFs. A follow-up of a measurement session should be conducted if the spread of SFOFs is larger than 5%, 3%, and 2% for field sizes of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm, 1 cm × 1 cm, and field sizes larger than 2 cm × 2 cm, respectively.

Methods: PD patients from 22 PD centres in Thailand were prospectively followed in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study during 2016–2017. Patients receiving assisted PD performed by caregivers were matched 1:1 with self-PD patients using propensity scores calculated by logistic regression. The associations between assisted PD and risk of mortality, peritonitis and permanent transfer to haemodialysis (HD) were assessed by multivariable competing risk regression. Results: Of 778 eligible patients, 447 (57%) required assisted PD performed by caregivers. Most of the caregivers were family members (98%), while the rest were non-family paid caregivers (2%). Patient factors associated with assisted PD were older age, female gender, lower educational level, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, automated PD modality, poorer functional status and lower blood chemistries (albumin, creatinine, sodium, potassium and phosphate). After 1:1 matching, the baseline characteristics were adequately matched, and 269 patients in each group were analysed. Compared with self-PD, assisted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted sub-hazard ratio: 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.24–3.74). There were no differences in the occurrences of peritonitis and permanent HD transfer between the groups. Conclusions: Assisted PD was required by more than half of Thai PD patients and was independently associated with a higher mortality risk.

Hydrophobic DNRL was blended with either hydrophilic hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol polymer, and either glycerin or dibutylphthalate as plasticizer, and the RCLs were made by plating technique. These RCLs were more hydrophilic compared to the original DNRL film. Nicotine was filled into the reservoir compartment between commercial backing layer and DNRL blended RCL, and was then heat sealed to ensure there was no leak from the R-NTPs. In vitro release and permeation studies of nicotine from the R-NTPs, drug stability, and irritation of the R-NTP devices were evaluated. DNRL blends provided a suitable controlled release and permeation rate for R-NTPs. The release and permeation rates of nicotine from the R-NTPs depended on types of polymer and plasticizer blends that increased the hydrophilicity of DNRL. The addition of an adhesive layer slightly decreased the nicotine release and permeation rates. The release and permeation behaviors of nicotine were described by first and zero order kinetics, respectively. Furthermore, these R-NTPs were stable when stored in a tight container for up to 90 d, and safe to apply to the skin without producing any irritation.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, Materials Science","Environmental Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The minor pathway was independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis [HR=2.64; 95%CI=1.07–6.55; P = 0.036] and [HR=14.84; 95%CI=3.15–70.01; P= 0.001] in original and validation datasets, respectively. Whereas, the major pathway was statistically non-significant. Further validation showed that the minor pathway had the highest HR for distant metastases with both the EMBRACE (HR=6.05; 95% CI=1.30–28.08; P = 0.022) and the FIGO 2018 (HR=7.43; 95% CI=2.94–18.78; P<0.001) in the original dataset. A similar result was found with the validation dataset: EMBRACE, HR=30.91; 95% CI=2.78–343.62; P = 0.005; and FIGO 2018, HR=42.41; 95% CI=8.83–203.60; P<0.001.This is the first clinical study to validate that the minor lymphatic pathway was predominantly associated with distant metastases in cervical cancer. This finding should be validated in larger cohort to further integrate in standard staging for prediction of distant metastases.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"
Association between Internalized Stigma and Depression among People Living with HIV in Thailand,"Thapinta D., Srithanaviboonchai K., Uthis P., Suktrakul S., Wiwatwongnawa R., Tangmunkongvorakul A., Wannachaiyakul S., Sripan P.",2022-04-01,"Depression, Depressive Disorder, Major, HIV Infections, Humans, Social Stigma, Thailand, depression, internalized stigma, people living with HIV, Thailand","Internalized stigma and depression are among the most common mental health problems in people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study aimed to examine the association between depression and overall internalized stigma, as well as different aspects of internalized stigma in PLHIV. The study included 400 PLHIV receiving care in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Thailand. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman correlation coefficients. The results indicated the PLHIV with mild depression had lower median scores for the social relationship internalized stigma subscale than PLHIV with major depressive disorder (p = 0.009). Total HIV internalized stigma scores were significantly correlated with PHQ-9 scores in the mild depression group (r = 0.327, p = 0.004). Depression and internalized stigma were prevalent and associated, especially in the area of social relationships. Health personnel should be aware of possible depression in PLHIV who have internalized stigma. Intervention to promote understanding and social support for PLHIV is warranted.","environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Unlocking collective cooperation in the midst of COVID-19: The role of social support in predicting the social class disparity in cooperation,"Tanjitpiyanond P., Alvarez B., Jetten J., Bentley S., Casara B.G.S., Crimston C., Ionescu O., Jarukasemthawee S., Krug H., Selvanathan H., Steffens N.K., Wang Z., Wibisono S.",2022-07-01,"Communicable Disease Control, COVID-19, Government, Humans, Pandemics, Social Support, behavioural adherence, cooperation, COVID-19, social class, social support","We examined whether (the lack of) social support can explain why researchers have found lower rates of adherence to follow public health guidelines amongst people who perceived themselves as coming from lower social class backgrounds during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do this, we surveyed 5818 participants from 10 countries during the first wave of lock-down. Contrary to previous findings, social class was not related to general adherence to COVID-19 regulations or desire to engage in citizenship behaviours (e.g., showing initiatives to help others during the pandemic). However, we found evidence of an indirect effect whereby those who perceived themselves as higher social class were more likely to be both the recipient and provider of social support which in turn predicted greater adherence and desire to engage in citizenship behaviours during the earlier wave of the pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of social support in unlocking potential for collective cooperation (i.e., adherence to COVID-19 rules and desire to engage in citizenship behaviours). They suggest that instead of enforcing strict regulations, government authorities need to address existing social support barriers within lower income communities to facilitate cooperation from everyone in the community.",psychology,Social Psychology

Probable Flood Inundation Depth and Extent in the Chao Phraya River Basin for Different Return Periods,"Shakti P.C., Miyamoto M., Kakinuma D., Misumi R., Sriariyawat A., Visessri S.",2022-10-01,"Chao phraya, Chao phraya river basins, Extreme rainfall, Flood inundation, Hydrological simulations, Hyetograph, Rainfall data, Return period rainfall, Return periods, River basins, Chao Phraya, flood inundation, hydrological simulation, hyetograph, return period rainfall","Understanding the potential flood inundation depth and extent over river basins can provide a reference for understanding and mitigating the flood risk. However, the development of design hyetographs for the evaluation of flood inundation under extreme rainfall is challenging. We evaluated the flood inundation depth and extent in the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the largest river basins in Asia, which is often vulnerable to water-related disasters. Rainfall data from 119 stations within the basin were collected for a frequency analysis. After processing the 36-year daily rainfall data, a frequency analysis of the maximum monthly rainfall was performed at each station using the Gumbel distribution. The maximum monthly rainfall for various return periods varied substantially among stations. For an inundation analysis over the entire river basin, we produced design hyetographs by integrating extreme rainfall values for each month according to the return period. These design hyetographs were included in a rainfall-runoffinundation model to simulate the maximum inundation depth profile over the basin for different return periods. The Maximum inundation depths were 8.3, 9.0, 9.7, and 10.5 m for return periods of 50, 100, 200, and 500 years, respectively, over the Chao Phraya River Basin. Similarly, approximately 16.3%, 17.1%, 17.8%, and 18.6% of the basin area was inundated (depth > 0.5 m) over the return periods, respectively. The results of this study provide a good reference for risk analyses and evaluations of the Chao Phraya River Basin.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"
Automatic Speech Discrimination Assessment Methods Based on Event-Related Potentials (ERP),"Charuthamrong P., Israsena P., Hemrungrojn S., Pan-Ngum S.",2022-04-01,"Automatic speech, Condition, Event related potentials, Hearing loss, Mismatch negativity, P3 components, Positive potential, Speech discrimination, Test sequence, Word meaning, Acoustic Stimulation, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Humans, Machine Learning, Speech Perception, classifier, EEG, ERP, speech discrimination","Speech discrimination is used by audiologists in diagnosing and determining treatment for hearing loss patients. Usually, assessing speech discrimination requires subjective responses. Using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that is based on event-related potentials (ERPs), could provide objective speech discrimination. In this work we proposed a visual-ERP-based method to assess speech discrimination using pictures that represent word meaning. The proposed method was implemented with three strategies, each with different number of pictures and test sequences. Machine learning was adopted to classify between the task conditions based on features that were extracted from EEG signals. The results from the proposed method were compared to that of a similar visual-ERP-based method using letters and a method that is based on the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) component. The P3 component and the late positive potential (LPP) component were observed in the two visual-ERP-based methods while MMN was observed during the MMN-based method. A total of two out of three strategies of the proposed method, along with the MMN-based method, achieved approximately 80% average classification accuracy by a combination of support vector machine (SVM) and common spatial pattern (CSP). Potentially, these methods could serve as a pre-screening tool to make speech discrimination assessment more accessible, particularly in areas with a shortage of audiologists.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Interactions Among Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Neuroimmune Pathways Are Key Components of the Major Psychiatric Disorders,"Mehterov N., Minchev D., Gevezova M., Sarafian V., Maes M.",2022-08-01,"Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Humans, Mental Disorders, Neurons, Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, Signal Transduction, Biomarkers, Inflammation, Major depression, Neuroimmune, Pathways, Psychiatry, Schizophrenia","The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge regarding the reciprocal associations between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and immune-inflammatory pathways and how these links may explain the involvement of this neurotrophin in the immune pathophysiology of mood disorders and schizophrenia. Toward this end, we delineated the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network centered around BDNF and searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science Direct for papers dealing with the involvement of BDNF in the major psychosis, neurodevelopment, neuronal functions, and immune-inflammatory and related pathways. The PPI network was built based on the significant interactions of BDNF with neurotrophic (NTRK2, NTF4, and NGFR), immune (cytokines, STAT3, TRAF6), and cell–cell junction (CTNNB, CDH1) DEPs (differentially expressed proteins). Enrichment analysis shows that the most significant terms associated with this PPI network are the tyrosine kinase receptor (TRKR) and Src homology region two domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) pathways, tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways, positive regulation of kinase and transferase activity, cytokine signaling, and negative regulation of the immune response. The participation of BDNF in the immune response and its interactions with neuroprotective and cell–cell adhesion DEPs is probably a conserved regulatory process which protects against the many detrimental effects of immune activation and hyperinflammation including neurotoxicity. Lowered BDNF levels in mood disorders and schizophrenia (a) are associated with disruptions in neurotrophic signaling and activated immune-inflammatory pathways leading to neurotoxicity and (b) may interact with the reduced expression of other DEPs (CTNNB1, CDH1, or DISC1) leading to multiple aberrations in synapse and axonal functions.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of early HA-330 hemoperfusion in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a single center, prospective cohort study on patients who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 patients and admitted to ICU. Patients in hemoperfusion group (defined as patients who were treated with hemoperfusion therapy at least 3 sessions in combination with standard therapy) were compared with the control group (defined as patients who received standard treatment alone or received less than 3 sessions of hemoperfusion therapy). The primary outcome was daily sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, mechanical ventilator-free day, daily C-reactive protein (CRP), oxygenation (defined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio), and severity score of lung infiltration on the chest X-ray (CXR RALE score). All outcomes were adjusted by regression analysis to reduce the confounders due to some difference in baseline characteristics. Results: A total number of 29 severe and critical COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled. Fifteen patients were defined as hemoperfusion group and 14 were control group. The median of CRP and SOFA score at the baseline (the day after severe pneumonia diagnosis or before hemoperfusion) in hemoperfusion and control groups were comparable, 96.79 mg/L and 87.3 mg/L, p = 0.53, 3.53 ± 0.99 versus 4.3 ± 1.89, p = 0.15, respectively. Clinical improvement associated with decreased SOFA score and improvement of CXR RALE score were found in hemoperfusion group compared to control group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.005, respectively). The 28-day mortality rate was significantly lower in hemoperfusion group compared to control group (6.67% vs. 85.71%, p < 0.001) and the adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.017 (95% confidence interval = 0.008-0.351, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The addition of early HA-330 hemoperfusion to standard therapy improved severity of organ failure and might reduce the mortality rate. However, the results were affected by the baseline confounders and limited sample size.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"

Methods: In this multicenter study, patients between 1 month and 18 years of age with DRE treated with PER between January 2020 and June 2021 were selected. The study outcome was effectiveness of PER treatment reported as reduction in seizure frequency and seizure freedom rate. Effectiveness was assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days after initiation of PER. Tolerability profiles were reported as adverse events according to the observations of the patients’ family members and physician. Results: Eighty-five patients treated with PER were included in the study. The mean initial dose and mean maximum dose of adjunctive PER was 2 mg/day and 5.8 mg/day, respectively. The mean seizure frequency (rate/week) was 41.3, 25.4, 18.9, 14.3, 11.2, 11.1 and 8.9 seizures at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days, respectively; the reduction in the mean seizure frequency at all timepoints was significant compared at the baseline (p<0.001). At 180 days, ≥75% seizure reduction was seen in 64.9% (37/57) of the patients and seizure freedom was achieved in 36.8% (21/57). Drowsiness, ataxia, and behavioral changes were the common adverse events observed, and these improved after the dose of PER was reduced. No discontinuation of PER was required due to side effects or intolerance. Conclusion: In real-world settings, PER is well tolerated and effective in seizure control in pediatric and adolescent patients with DRE.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Non-ionic surfactants containing different hydrophobic tail structures and their optimal concentrations were evaluated for effectiveness in biohydrogen production. By adding the surfactants at their critical micelle concentration in synthetic oily wastewater, the maximal H2 yield was increased by 2.2 and 3.5 times for Triton X-100 and Tergitol 15-S-9, respectively, compared to the control. Using real POME, the supplemental Tergitol 15-S-9 resulted in a 56.4 % improvement in H2 production. For continuous digestion studies, pure POME and Tergitol 15-S-9 supplemented POME (sPOME) were fed to thermophilic anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) under hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 32–12.5 days. Optimally at HRT 19 days, H2 content in the biogas from sPOME-fed ASBR was noticeably higher, which gave a superior yield of 203.4 mLH2/gCODremoved (+15 %).","geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

Charm+, Detector systems, Fitting method, Heavy flavours, Large detector-system performance, Large detectors, Pattern recognition, cluster finding, calibration and fitting method, Proton proton collisions, Systems performance, Large detector-systems performance, Pattern recognition, cluster finding, calibration and fitting methods","Many measurements at the LHC require efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom (b) or charm (c) quarks. An overview of the algorithms used to identify c jets is described and a novel method to calibrate them is presented. This new method adjusts the entire distributions of the outputs obtained when the algorithms are applied to jets of different flavours. It is based on an iterative approach exploiting three distinct control regions that are enriched with either b jets, c jets, or light-flavour and gluon jets. Results are presented in the form of correction factors evaluated using proton-proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb−1 at √s = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2017. The closure of the method is tested by applying the measured correction factors on simulated data sets and checking the agreement between the adjusted simulation and collision data. Furthermore, a validation is performed by testing the method on pseudodata, which emulate various mismodelling conditions. The calibrated results enable the use of the full distributions of heavy-flavour identification algorithm outputs, e.g. as inputs to machine-learning models. Thus, they are expected to increase the sensitivity of future physics analyses.","numerical methods, fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"
Enhancing the properties of graphene oxide/natural rubber nanocomposite-based strain sensor modified by amino-functionalized silanes,"Woraphutthaporn S., Pattananuwat P., Hayichelaeh C., Kobayashi T., Boonkerd K.",2022-10-01,"Cross-link densities, Electrical conductivity, Filler rubber interaction, Functionalized silane, Graphene oxides, Mechanical and electrical properties, Property, Rubber nanocomposites, Silane modification, Strain sensors, electrical conductivity, graphene oxide, natural rubber, silane modification, strain sensor","This work investigates the influence of modified graphene oxide (mGO) on the properties of natural rubber (NR) nanocomposites. GO was modified by amino-functionalized silane coupling agents, that is, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and [3-(2-aminoethyl amino)propyl]trimethoxysilane (TMPES), hereafter referred to as AGO and TGO, respectively. The use of silane-mGOs had a positive effect on the properties of the NR nanocomposites compared with unmodified GO, that is, a faster cure time, increased crosslink density, strengthened filler–rubber interaction, improved filler dispersion, and enhanced mechanical and electrical properties. Among the different types of silanes, the TGO/NR nanocomposite showed better mechanical and electrical properties than the AGO/NR nanocomposite because of its high crosslink density and strong filler–rubber interaction. To ascertain the potential for application as a strain sensor, the electrical resistance of nanocomposites during finger motion was determined. An increase in electrical resistance of the nanocomposites containing mGOs during finger motion was observed, which strongly supports the finding that NR nanocomposites containing silane-mGOs are a potentially suitable material to produce a strain sensor.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

For this purpose, establishing explicit correlations between surface tension of oils and surface wettability of absorbent is crucial. In this study, we modified common low-cost cellulose sponges with various organosilanes to achieve a range of hydrophobicity/oleophilicity and then assessed their oil uptake selectivity and capability. Oil uptake was followed as mass uptake versus time and analyzed based on the spreading coefficient (S) of a liquid over a solid surface. The results showed that sponges needed to be hydrophobic, not necessarily superhydrophobic, to selectively absorb oil from an oil/water mixture. To achieve a fast uptake and a high uptake capacity, an S ≥ 0 was necessary, that is, when the sponges were completely wet by the oil. Increasing the porosity of cellulose sponge led to a slight increase in oil uptake capacity, and a greater increase resulted when bacterial cellulose sponges that consisted of smaller and more uniform voids/pores were used. S ≥ 0 could be used as a criterion for evaluating effective and rapid oil uptake for porous absorbents, especially for those containing heterogeneous pore structures, such as common cellulose sponges.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, chemistry, engineering, medical","Biomaterials, Chemistry (all), Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry (medical)"

Incorporation of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as photothermal fillers into the copolymers provided shape memory properties under near-infrared (NIR) light actuation. The effects of GNP content on photothermal, thermal, dynamic mechanical, morphology, and shape memory properties of the bio-based benzoxazine/epoxy copolymers (V-fa/ECO copolymers) were investigated. The results showed that the addition of GNPs significantly improved the photothermal, thermal, and dynamic mechanical properties of the copolymers. The uniform dispersion of 3 wt% GNPs in the V-fa/ECO copolymers resulted in the highest shape memory performance with shape fixity of 92% and shape recovery of 99% upon NIR light actuation. The recovery time decreased with the increment of GNP content, and the V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs displayed good execution in the repeated fold-deploy, in which the shape fixity and shape recovery values were close to the original specimen. Therefore, the outstanding properties of V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs had a potential to be excellent SMPs under NIR actuation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanical Engineering"
Structural Characterization of Titanium–Silica Oxide Using Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy,"Teamsinsungvon A., Ruksakulpiwat C., Amonpattaratkit P., Ruksakulpiwat Y.",2022-07-01,"Methylene Blue, Mixed oxide, Silica oxide, Sol- gel methods, Sol-gel technique, Structural characteristics, Ti atoms, Titania, Titania-silica, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, mixed oxide, silica, sol–gel method, titania, XAS","In this study, titania–silica oxides (TixSiy oxides) were successfully prepared via the sol– gel technique. The Ti and Si precursors were titanium (IV), isopropoxide (TTIP), and tetraethylor-thosilicate (TEOS), respectively. In this work, the effects of pH and the Ti/Si atomic ratio of titanium– silicon binary oxide (TixSiy) on the structural characteristics of TixSiy oxide are reported.29Si solid-state NMR and FTIR were used to validate the chemical structure of TixSiy oxide. The structural characteristics of TixSiy oxide were investigated using X-ray diffraction, XRF, Fe-SEM, diffraction particle size analysis, and nitrogen adsorption measurements. By applying X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) obtained from synchrotron light sources, the qualitative characterization of the Ti-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti bonds in Ti-Si oxides was proposed. Some Si atoms in the SiO2 network were replaced by Ti atoms, suggesting that Si-O-Ti bonds were formed as a result of the synthesis accom-plished using the sol–gel technique described in this article. Upon increasing the pH to alkaline conditions (pH 9.0 and 10.0), the nanoparticles acquired a more spherical shape, and their size distribution became more uniform, resulting in an acceptable nanostructure. TixSiy oxide nanoparticles were largely spherical in shape, and agglomeration was minimized. However, the Ti50Si50 oxide particles at pH 10.0 become nano-sized and agglomerated. The presence of a significant pre-edge feature in the spectra of Ti50Si50 oxide samples implied that a higher fraction of Ti atoms occupied tetrahedral symmetry locations, as predicted in samples where Ti directly substituted Si. The pro-portion of Ti atoms in a tetrahedral environment agreed with the value of 1.83 given for the Ti-O bond distance in TixSiy oxides produced at pH 9.0 using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. Photocatalysis was improved by adding 3% wt TiO2, SiO2, and TixSiy oxide to the PLA film matrix. TiO2 was more effective than Ti50Si50 pH 9.0, Ti50Si50 pH 10.0, Ti50Si50 pH 8.0, and SiO2 in degrading methylene blue (MB). The most effective method to degrade MB was TiO2> Ti70Si30 > Ti50Si50> Ti40Si60 > SiO2. Under these conditions, PLA/ Ti70Si30 improved the effectiveness of the photocatalytic activity of PLA.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

EMT is linked with cancer, and it is believed to be an important factor facilitating the motility and invasive activity of solid tumor cells. EMT facilitates the capability of cancer cells to metastasize because it promotes cell survival in detached conditions and facilitates the establishment of new tumors. In lung cancer, EMT has garnered considerable attention because of its importance in metastasis and has been recognized as an important target for anticancer drug therapy. Several studies have pointed out the promising activities of natural product-derived compounds and other agents that have EMT-suppressive activities and may facilitate the development of novel strategies for lung cancer management. In this review, we discuss the recent discoveries regarding the fundamental signaling regulating EMT and identify molecular targets for anti-EMT activities of the natural product-derived compounds. We also highlight the anti-EMT effect of natural compounds with their molecular targets and mechanisms of action that may benefit the understanding of and support the development of EMT targeting therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

In the current study, we developed the Importance of Religion in Couple Relationships Scale (IRCRS) with the aim of having a scale suitable for use across different cultural and religious groups. The IRCRS was administered to three samples: 354 Pakistani residents (178 females, 176 males) who identified as Muslim; 274 Thai residents (157 females, 117 males) who identified as Buddhist; and 165 Westerners (resident in Australia or the United States, 60 males, 105 females) who identified as either not religious (n = 74) or Christian (n = 91). We developed a 13-item measure with a two level structure yielding an overall importance of religion score. The items in the IRCRS had acceptable cross-cultural structural invariance in a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis of the Pakistani Muslims, Thai Buddhists, and Westerners. Pakistani Muslims endorsed IRCRS standards most strongly, Western Christians next most strongly, Thai Buddhists next, and Westerners with no religion least strongly. There were no gender differences, and only very small differences by relationship status. The IRCRS can be used in future research to investigate the association of religious relationship standards with couple relationship satisfaction and might be a useful clinical tool to assess the importance of religion to couples.","psychology, sociology","Social Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Social Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Here, we aimed to determine whether endometrial epithelial barrier function and viability were altered following PRRSV type 1 or type 2 infection. PRRSV inoculation was examined at the apical or basolateral side of porcine glandular endometrial epithelial cell cultures isolated from 4- to 6-month-old PRRSV-free herd gilts (n = 7 pigs). On the apical side, four days postinfection (4 dpi) with type 2 PRRSV, transepithelial electrical resistance decreased by 31% ± 5%, and paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (4 kDa) increased by 10-fold as compared with the mock and type 1 infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction results revealed that both PRRSV types upregulated the mRNA expression of the barrier builder tight junction protein (TJ) Cldn5, but downregulated pore-forming TJ Cldn7. Additionally, the expression of other TJ genes, i.e., Cldn3 and Cldn8, was differentially increased by PRRSV type 1 and that of zonula occludens-1 was increased by PRRSV type 2. MTT assays indicated an increase in porcine glandular endometrial epithelial cell culture at 2–6 dpi following type 2 infection. Analysis of apoptosis using Annexin/propidium iodide staining combined with flow cytometry showed that the percentage of viable cells decreased, accompanied by a significantly higher dead cell population following PRRSV type 2 infection at 2–4 dpi. PRRSV type 1 infection also induced dead cells (>4%) at 2 dpi; however, the cell population recovered at 4 dpi. In conclusion, PRRSV type 2 infection caused more severe TJ barrier dysfunction and reduced cell viability compared with PRRSV type 1 infection in the porcine endometrium. Impairment in the membrane integrity of the maternal glandular endometrium may be the underlying mechanism of PRRSV-induced reproductive failure in pregnant sows.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Our cross-section study evaluated the correlation between polypharmacy and frailty among Thai 324 virally suppressed PLWH and 132 uninfected patients aged ≥50 between March 2016 and April 2017. The primary predictor was the number of patient-reported non-antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications. The outcome was having additional domain of the five Fried frailty phenotype domains (0 = normal, 1-2 = prefrail, >3 = frail). Most participants were male (63% PLWH, 67% uninfected) with few comorbidities (1.4 PLWH, 0.9 uninfected) and small median number of non-ART medications (2 PLWH, 1 uninfected). Frailty was uncommon (8.6% PLWH, 3.8% uninfected). Each additional non-ART medication correlated with 6% increased likelihood of having additional frailty domain among PLWH (95% CI: 0.002-0.11, p = .04) but not statistically significant among the uninfected. The association between polypharmacy and frailty is more pronounced in Thai PLWH than in participants without HIV. Further study is warranted to confirm this association in other resource-limited settings and explore potential deprescribing practices.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Here, TiO2 coating on CsPbBr3 QDs by ex-situ and in-situ methods was performed to prevent the agglomeration of the nanocrystals and to improve the stability of CsPbBr3 QDs without heat treatment at high temperature. By focusing on the in-situ coating method, this work also reported the effects of injection temperature of titanium precursor into the QDs solution from 25 °C to 170 °C on the morphological, structural, and optical properties of the obtained TiO2-coated CsPbBr3 QDs. The in-situ coated samples were non-agglomerated and remained the original shape and crystal structure of CsPbBr3 QDs, whereas the ex-situ coated samples were completely agglomerated. The in-situ samples exhibited a significant stability improvement against toluene, ultrasonication treatment in water, and light illumination (all with the photoluminescence intensity greater than 50%). Furthermore, the in-situ TiO2-coated CsPbBr3 QDs were proved to use as a good charge transport material in the photoelectrochemical cell. The results demonstrated the remarkable enhancement of photocurrent, owing to a suitable alignment of energy levels of TiO2 and CsPbBr3 and a stable structure of QDs, when compared to that of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 QDs. The present study provides a new perspective to utilize stable TiO2-coated CsPbBr3 QDs in various photoelectrochemical applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

They were towed at speeds of 2.7 – 3.3 knots for between 133.9 and 205.4 km before being placed on the seafloor at an artificial reef site. Sixteen species of fish were observed both before and after jacket towing. We believe these species have sought refuge in the complex structures out of the current and have remained with the jackets. Ten species of fish were observed before towing, but not after. A further seven species of fish were only observed after the jackets were relocated onto the seafloor and were assumed to be early colonisers to the structures. The paper provides empirical evidence of a much-discussed paradigm that fish can swim great distances following moved structures, and further evidence of the ability of fish to rapidly colonise reefed structures.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, petroleum engineeringneering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

Summary Background Data: Negative surgical margins (R0) are a key predictor of long-term outcomes in PDAC. Methods: Patients undergoing pancreatic resection with curative intent for PDAC were identified. Using the CT scans from the time of diagnosis, the 2019 NCCN borderline resectability criteria were compared to novel criteria: presence of any alteration of the superior mesenteric-portal vein (SMPV) and perivascular stranding of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Accuracy of predicting R status was evaluated for both criteria. Patient baseline characteristics, surgical, histopathological parameters, and long-term overall survival (OS) after resection were evaluated. Results: A total of 593 patients undergoing pancreatic resections for PDAC between 2010 and 2018 were identified. Three hundred and twenty-five (54.8%) patients underwent upfront surgery, whereas 268 (45.2%) received neoadjuvant therapy. In upfront resected patients, positive SMA stranding was associated with 56% margin positive resection rates, whereas positive SMA stranding and SMPV alterations together showed a margin positive resection rate of 75%. In contrast to these criteria, the 2019 NCCN borderline criteria failed to predict margin status. In patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, only perivascular SMA stranding remained a predictor of margin positive resection, leading to a rate of 33% R+ resections. Perivascular SMA stranding was related to higher clinical T stage (P = 0.003) and clinical N stage (P = 0.043) as well as perineural invasion (P = 0.022). SMA stranding was associated with worse survival in both patients undergoing upfront surgery (36 vs 22 months, P = 0.002) and neoadjuvant therapy (47 vs 34 months, P = 0.050). Conclusions: The novel criteria were accurate predictors of R status in PDAC patients undergoing upfront resection. After neoadjuvant treatment, likelihood of positive resection margins is approximately halved, and only perivascular SMA stranding remained a predictive factor.",medical,Surgery

The production can be upgraded more with the water flooding and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. However, in this area, the suitable technologies have not been studied for commercial production yet. SiO2 nanoparticle is another pattern of chemical EOR (CEOR) to reduce the limitation of traditional CEOR techniques. The utilization of nanotechnology can provide the potential for producing more petroleum. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate ability of nanosilica flooding in Fang oilfield and compare oil production with the conventional water flooding and natural flow by using simulation results with ECLIPSE. Also, the more parameters like injection rate and injection period have been studied. The results show that nanosilica can provide the highest recovery compared to both conventional techniques. Besides, the injection rates at 159 m3/day gives the highest oil production for 35.2%. For the injection period of nano-fluid, at low-injection rate, the result of different injection period is insignificant. But for higher injection rate, the difference in injection period can be observed with less than 1% difference. Therefore, the shorter injection period can be the better choice for field development for the future production. Moreover, this study can be used as a reference for the SiO2 nanoparticle application in this oilfield in future.","engineering, coastal engineering","Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

Adults with grade ≥2 steatosis, defined by an MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) of ≥11%, were randomly assigned to receive either oligonol or placebo for 24 weeks. The alteration in the MRI-PDFF and gut microbiota composition assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were examined. There were 38 patients enrolled (n = 19 in each group). A significant reduction in the MRI-PDFF between week 0 and week 24 was observed in the oligonol group, while there was a non-significant decrease in the placebo group. A significant improvement in alpha-diversity was demonstrated in both of the groups. The oligonol-induced microbiota changes were characterized by reduced abundance of pathogenic bacteria, including Dorea, Romboutsia, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Agathobacter, as well as increased abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, such as Akkermansia, Lachnospira, Dialister and Faecalibacterium. In summary, this study is the first to provide evidence that supports that oligonol improves steatosis through the modulation of gut bacterial composition.

In this study, phytochemical analyses of mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, quercetin, and rutin were performed in kratom extracts. The effects on α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase activities were investigated in kratom extracts and mitragynine. The LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the mitragynine, quercetin, and rutin contents from kratom extracts were different. The ethanol extract exhibited the highest total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total alkaloid content (TAC). Additionally, compared to methanol and aqueous extracts, the ethanol extract showed the strongest inhibition activity against α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. Compared with the anti-diabetic agent acarbose, mitragynine showed the most potent α-glucosidase inhibition, with less potent activity of pancreatic lipase inhibition. Analysis of α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase kinetics revealed that mitragynine inhibited noncompetitive and competitive effects, respectively. Combining mitragynine with acarbose resulted in a synergistic interaction with α-glucosidase inhibition.

Barostat or syringe-assisted sensory biofeedback training for constipation with rectal hyposensitivity: A randomized controlled trial,"Rao S.S.C., Yan Y., Erdogan A., Coss-Adame E., Patcharatrakul T., Valestin J., Nag Ayyala D.",2022-03-01,"Biofeedback, Psychology, Constipation, Defecation, Humans, Manometry, Rectum, Syringes, anorectal function, barostat sensory training, biofeedback therapy, constipation, rectal hyposensitivity","Background: Rectal hyposensitivity (RH) is a well-known pathophysiological dysfunction in chronic constipation. Whether biofeedback training improves RH and restores bowel function is unknown. Aim: To investigate the efficacy of barostat-assisted sensory training (BAST) with syringe-assisted sensory training (SAST) in patients with RH in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients with RH and chronic constipation (Rome III) were randomized to receive 6 biweekly sessions of BAST or SAST. Verbal/visual feedback was provided during repeated rectal distensions to improve defecation desire/urge and first sensations with either 10-cm balloon connected to barostat (BAST) or 4-cm balloon connected to syringe and manometry probe (SAST). Sensory thresholds, bowel symptoms, and therapist and patient's rating of treatments were compared. The primary outcome (responders) was the improvement in ≥2 sensory thresholds. Results: Sixty-six patients were enrolled: 32 received BAST, 34 received SAST, and 56 completed study. There were significantly more responders in BAST group than SAST (78% vs. 53%, p = 0.0320). Rectal sensation normalized in 81% with BAST compared to 56% with SAST (p = 0.0270). When compared to baseline, desire and urge to defecate thresholds and bowel satisfaction improved with BAST (p = 0.0013; p = 0.0002; p = 0.0001) and SAST (p = 0.0012; p = 0.0001; p < 0.0001) and number of complete spontaneous bowel movements with BAST (p = 0.0029) but without inter-group differences. Therapists rated BAST as superior to SAST (p < 0.0001), but patients rated both equally. Conclusions: Sensory biofeedback training was effective and significantly improved rectal sensation and constipation symptoms. Although both techniques were useful, the novel BAST was more efficacious and easier to administer for treating RH.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience, medical","Physiology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Gastroenterology"
Two-stage acid-alkali pretreatment of vetiver grass to enhance the subsequent sugar release by cellulase digestion,"Huong V.T.T., Atjayutpokin T., Chinwatpaiboon P., Smith S.M., Boonyuen S., Luengnaruemitchai A.",2022-08-01,"Alkali, Alkali pretreatment, Biofuels and biochemicals, C 60, Chemical compositions, Lignocellulosic biomass, Potential feedstock, Pre-treatments, Two-stage pretreatment, Vetiver grass, Acid, Alkali, Enzymatic hydrolysis, Lignocellulosic biomass, Two-stage pretreatment, Vetiver grass","Vetiver grass (VG; Chrysopogon zizanioides) can be used as a potential feedstock for biofuels and biochemical production due to its chemical composition, which is rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. However, the complex and recalcitrant nature of a lignocellulosic biomass requires a pretreatment process to disrupt the lignin seal in the cell wall in order to increase the accessibility for enzymatic hydrolysis and to liberate the sugars contained within the cellulose. The sequential acid-base pretreatment of VG using dilute sulphuric acid (H2SO4) followed by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was found to be optimal when using a 5% (w/v) VG loading in 0.5% (v/v) H2SO4 at 120 °C, 60 min in the first stage followed by 4% (w/v) NaOH at 120 °C, 60 min in the second stage. This gave the highest yield of total reducing sugars (32.6 g/L as 22.0 and 10.6 g/L of hexose and pentose, respectively) in the subsequent cellulase digestion, which was 10.3% and 46.1% higher than that obtained with the single-stage alkali (24.1 g/L) or acid (13.5 g/L) pretreatment, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Owing to the limited aqueous solubility of FE, it may hamper ocular bioavailability and result in low efficiency to treat such diseases. To enhance the solubility of FE, water-soluble FE/cyclodextrin (CD) complex formation was determined by a phase-solubility technique. Randomly methylated-β-CD (RMβCD) exhibited the best solubility and the highest complexation efficiency (CE) for FE. Additionally, water-soluble polymers (i.e., hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol [PVA]) enhanced the solubility of FE/RMβCD complexes. Solid- and solution-state characterizations were performed to elucidate and confirm the formation of inclusion FE/RMβCD complex. FE-loaded Eudragit® nanoparticle (EuNP) dispersions and suspensions were developed. The physicochemical properties (i.e., pH, osmolality, viscosity, particle size, size distribution, and zeta potential) were within acceptable ranges. Moreover, in vitro mucoadhesion, in vitro release, and in vitro permeation studies revealed that the FE-loaded EuNP eye drop suspensions had excellent mucoadhesive properties and sustained FE release. The hemolytic activity, hen’s egg test on chorioallantoic membrane assay, and in vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the FE formulations had low hemolytic activity, were cytocompatible, and were moderately irritable to the eyes. In conclusion, PVA-stabilized FE/RMβCD-loaded EuNP eye drop suspensions were successfully developed, warranting further in vivo testing.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This study was conducted to compare the impact of mobile health education messages verses face-to-face consultation on weight reduction among overweight female university students. Methods: This Quasi-experimental study comprised three groups: a control group, a group receiving mobile health education, and a group receiving face-to-face consultation. Each group contained 26 participants taking part over a period of 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up thereafter. The data analysis used two-way repeated measures ANOVA with least significant difference testing. The study was ethically approved at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Results: The results revealed that the intervention found significant results in weight reduction among the respondents ( p < 0.05). In addition, both intervention groups significantly improved their health belief, social support, and health behavior scores in comparison to the control group ( p < 0.001). The results show that the average scores for social support for eating and exercise at baseline were significantly lower than at post-intervention or follow-up ( p < 0.001). In addition, the results of both aspects of social support showed that the average social support score at post-intervention was significantly higher than at follow-up. Furthermore, the health behavior score measured post-intervention was higher than at follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in average metabolism during physical activity ( p < 0.001) but no statistical difference in average eating behavior score. Conclusion: The study found that the use of mobile health education to deliver health programs facilitates communication between the healthcare provider and individual, and can empower adolescent females in their pursuit of weight loss by improving their attitudes and knowledge, leading to better health behavior.

We initially identified the FeMV-1 from the lung of a necropsied dog with severe pulmonary disease by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thereafter, we investigated FeMV-1 in nasal and oral swab samples from 73 healthy and 113 dogs with respiratory illnesses. We found polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive FeMV-1 from only 14/113 (12.39%) dogs with respiratory disease (p =.001). Of these 14 dogs, six were co-infected with other canine respiratory viruses (6/14; 42.86%). Two independent immunohistochemistry procedures, using antibodies against matrix and phosphoprotein of FeMV-1, confirmed the presence of FeMV-1 in lung tissues of two necropsied dogs (out of a total of 22 dogs, 9.09%) that died from respiratory disease. This finding corresponded to transmission electron microscopy findings that paramyxoviral particles exist in lung epithelia. FeMV-1 antigen localization was also evident in the kidney, lymphoid and brain tissues of two deceased dogs. FeMV-1 was successfully isolated from a necropsied dog and from two living dogs, all with respiratory illnesses, which supports FeMV infection in dogs. The detection of FeMV-1 in dog tissues expands the known tropism of this virus to a non-felid host. Our findings indicate that FeMV-1, alone or in co-infection with other viral pathogens, might contribute to respiratory illness and death in dogs.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Although numerous patients have been described, a direct genotype– phenotype correlation for RUNX2 has been difficult to establish. Further cases must be studied to understand the clinical and genetic spectra of CCD. Objectives: To characterize detailed phenotypes and identify variants causing CCD in five unrelated patients and their family members. Methodology: Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed. Genetic variants were identified by exome and Sanger sequencing, data were analyzed by bioinformatics tools. Results: Three cases were sporadic and two were familial. Exome sequencing successfully detected the heterozygous pathogenic RUNX2 variants in all affected individuals. Three were novel, comprising a frameshift c.739delA (p.(Ser247Valfs*)) in exon 6 (Patient-1), a nonsense c.901C>T (p.(Gln301*)) in exon 7 (Patient-2 and affected mother), and a nonsense c.1081C>T (p.(Gln361*)) in exon 8 (Patient-3). Two previously reported variants were missense: the c.673C>T (p.(Arg225Trp)) (Patient-4) and c.674G>A (p.(Arg225Gln)) (Patient-5) in exon 5 within the Runt homology domain. Patient-1, Patient-2, and Patient-4 with permanent dentition had thirty, nineteen, and twenty unerupted teeth, respectively; whereas Patient-3 and Patient-5, with deciduous dentition, had normally developed teeth. All patients exhibited typical CCD features, but the following uncommon/ unreported phenotypes were observed: left fourth ray brachymetatarsia (Patient-1), normal clavicles (Patient-2 and affected mother), phalangeal malformations (Patient-3), and normal primary dentition (Patient-3, Patient-5). Conclusions: The study shows that exome sequencing is effective to detect mutation across ethnics. The two p.Arg225 variants confirm that the Runt homology domain is vital for RUNX2 function. Here, we report a new CCD feature, unilateral brachymetatarsia, and three novel truncating variants, expanding the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of RUNX2, as well as show that the CCD patients can have normal deciduous teeth, but must be monitored for permanent teeth anomalies.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: n = 26 and TBI: n = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls.

Many methods have been proposed that aim to model sequential recommendations. One of these is BERT4Rec, which applies the bidirectional-encoder-representations-from-transformers (BERT) technique to model user behavior sequences by considering the target user's historical data, i.e., a content-based filtering (CBF) approach. Despite BERT4Rec's effectiveness, we argue that considering only this historical data is insufficient to provide the most accurate recommendation. We believe that if BERT were to consider other users' interactions in its analysis, it would increase the model accuracy. Therefore, we propose a new method called HybridBERT4Rec, which applies BERT to both CBF and collaborative filtering (CF). For CBF, we want to extract the characteristics of the target user's interactions with purchased items. (We implement this in the same way as in BERT4Rec, with our model generating a target user profile.) For CF, we want to find neighboring users who are similar to the target user. Here, we extract the target item's characteristics using all other users who rated the target item as a second input to BERT. This generates a target item profile. After obtaining both profiles, we use them to predict a rating score. We experimented with three datasets, finding that our model was more accurate than the original BERT4Rec.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The change in its nanostructure has been associated with nephrotic syndromes. Effects of physiological and hemodynamic factor alterations associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) on glomerular permselectivity are examined through a mathematical model employing low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics and hindered transport theory. Methods: Glomerular capillaries are represented as networks of cylindrical tubes with multilayered walls. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a fibrous medium with bimodal fiber sizes. Epithelial slit fiber spacing follows a lognormal distribution based on reported electron micrographs with the highest resolution. Endothelial fenestrae are filled with fibers the size of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Effects of fiber-macromolecule steric and hydrodynamic interactions are included. Focusing on diabetic nephropathy, the physiological and hemodynamic factors employed in the computation are those reported for healthy humans and patients with early-but-overt diabetic nephropathy. The macromolecule concentration is obtained as a finite element solution of the convection-diffusion equation. Results: Computed sieving coefficients averaged along the capillary length agree well with ficoll sieving coefficients from studies in humans for most solute radii. GBM thickening and the loss of the slit diaphragm hardly affect glomerular permselectivity. GAG volume fraction reduction in the endothelial fenestrae, however, significantly increases macromolecule filtration. Increased renal plasma flow rate (RPF), glomerular hypertension, and reduction of lumen osmotic pressure cause a slight sieving coefficient decrease. These effects are amplified by an increased macromolecule size. Conclusion: Our results indicate that glomerular hypertension and the reduction in the oncotic pressure decreases glomerular macromolecule filtration. Reduction of RPF and changes in the glomerular barrier structure associated with DN, however, increase the solute sieving. Damage to GAGs caused by hyperglycemia is likely to be the most prominent factor affecting glomerular size-selectivity.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Molecular Biology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

For cryoprotective performance, UV–vis spectroscopy reveals the potential of all cryoprotectants for preventing citrate-capped AuNPs (cit-AuNPs) from irreversible aggregation under freezing. While sucrose, PVP, and pectin were more suitable than Tween 20 and PVA as cryoprotectants for lyophilization of AuNPs with the maintained redispersability. For storage and further use, Luria–Bertani agar plate, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicate impacts of the cryoprotectant coexisted with AuNPs after resuspension and imply that washing of the restored AuNPs is encouraged. Otherwise, running the restored AuNPs through applications, such as functionalization, protein conjugation, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), without washing the cryoprotectant could lead to inaccurate results.

About half (50.32%) of Bangkok’s total area was defined as high flood hazard area. A total of 736 questionnaires were distributed in flood‐prone areas and in the areas with the highest percentage of elderly population. The results of both SWOT and survey analysis found that many senior citizens have low digital and media literacy and limited experience in using information technology for flood preparedness. Lack of integration of disaster risk reduction and aging population policy, ineffective warning system, and lack of access to disaster preparedness training were the key barriers in reducing vulnerability to flood hazard. The survey revealed that the majority of elderly respondents (75%) have neither used online applications for their flood hazard management both before and during flood disaster nor shared/communicated information via online platforms. Some respondents (13%) used Facebook and Line applications to obtain information before a flood event. Very few of the elderly respondents (<2%) accessed the national/provincial web‐based platform to find out floodrelated information. Almost all respondents, especially who are living in high‐risk flood zones, had never participated in the community training of flood preparedness and management. Therefore, effective strategies in enhancing social engagement of the elderly and their literacy skills in flood risk preparedness and management are urgently needed.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"
Dynamic Slicing of Time Petri Net Based on MTL Property,"Chariyathitipong P., Vatanawood W.",2022-01-01,"Dependency graphs, Dynamic slicing, Firing, Global firing dependency graph, Heuristics algorithm, Metric temporal logic, Models checking, Real - Time system, Slicing for verification, State-space reduction, Structural reduction, Time Petri nets, Dynamic slicing, global firing dependency graph, metric temporal logic, real-time systems, slicing for verification, state space reduction, structural reduction, time Petri net","The time Petri net (TPN) is a powerful tool for modeling, simulating, and verifying real-time systems. Unfortunately, the state spaces of the time Petri net grow exponentially due to the complexity of real-time systems. The enormous size of the state spaces could also cause state explosion problems in model checking. This paper proposes an alternative dynamic slicing algorithm written as a metric temporal logic (MTL) formula to reduce the size of the time Petri net model by considering specific criteria. Our algorithm proposes an alternative dependency graph representing the global firing time interval of the transition to remove the transitions that are never fired and do not affect the state space. The dynamic slicing algorithm involves the initial marking and the properties of the target metric temporal logic formula. Unlike the unsliced time Petri net, the result preserves all necessary execution paths for the model checking of a particular metric temporal logic formula. Therefore, model checking can generate sufficient state space to conduct verification equivalent to the unsliced time Petri net but may take less time, including if the unsliced time Petri net causes state space explosion.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Recycling Waste Nonmetallic Printed Circuit Boards for Polyvinyl Chloride Composites,"Moe A.K., Chungprempree J., Preechawong J., Sapsrithong P., Nithitanakul M.",2022-09-01,"Environmental threats, Interfacial adhesions, Landfilling, Non-metallic, Nonmetallic printed circuit board, Polyvinyl chloride composite, PVC composites, PVC matrix, Recycling wastes, Silane-coupling agents, nonmetallic printed circuit board, polyvinyl chloride composite, silane coupling agent","To reduce environmental threats, such as land filling, incineration and soil pollution, which are associated with the improper waste management of waste printed circuit boards, the utilization of NMPCBs from waste PCBs as a filler in composites was pursued. Untreated and treated NMPCBs in varying ratios, 10–30 wt.%, were blended with PVC to produce NMPCB/PVC composites, using the melt-mixing method via an internal mixer, in order to solve the remaining NMPCB waste problem after the valuable metals in PCBs were recovered. The incorporation of the NMPCB with PVC resulted in an increase in the tensile modulus and the thermal stability of the resulting composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated improved interfacial adhesion between the treated NMPCB and the PVC matrix. The FTIR results of the NMPCB treated with 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) revealed the formation of Si-O-Si bonds. The densities of the composites were found to increase with an increase in the content of the treated NMPCB, and compatibility improved. The tensile properties of the treated NMPCB/PVC composites were higher than those of the untreated NMPCB/PVC composites, suggesting improved compatibility between the treated NMPCB and PVC. The PVC composite with 10 wt.% of the treated NMPCB showed the optimum tensile properties. It was observed that the tensile modulus of the treated NMPCB/PVC composite increased by 47.65% when compared to that of the neat PVC. The maximum thermal degradation temperature was 27 °C higher than that of the neat PVC. Dynamic mechanical analysis results also support the improved interfacial adhesion as a result of the improvement in the storage modulus at the glassy region, and the loss factor (tan δ) peak shifted to a higher temperature range than that of the PVC and the untreated NMPCB/PVC composite. These studies reveal that the NMPCB was successfully modified with 1 wt.% of GPTMS, which promoted the dispersion and interfacial adhesion in the PVC matrix, resulting in better tensile properties and better thermal stability of the PVC composite.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The government attempts to improve the efficiency of an integrated e-waste management system, but baseline data of e-waste stream in informal sectors are insufficient. This research aimed to investigate the inflow and outflow of the materials throughout the informal e-waste dismantling processes at the well-known second-largest community in Buriram province during 2017–2018. To describe the quantities of dismantled materials, a material flow analysis was performed. The overall amount of e-waste taken to the community was estimated to be in the range of 1593–12,943 tonnes year−1. Valuable materials could be recovered at more than 90% (by mass) from fans, refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves and air conditioners. The amount of e-waste residue that the local administrative organization had to handle was up to 1144 tonnes year−1. The quantitative data retrieved from this study could provide a satisfactory equation for estimating the amount of separated valuable and non-valuable materials. Recyclable materials from dismantling have an economic incentive, e-waste dismantlers in a small and large household group that can earn approximately 798 and 1262 USD month−1 income, respectively. The notable e-waste characterization and quantification of recovered materials would be useful for improving the potential circular flow of e-waste in Thailand.","heat exchange, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

In some cases, they have shared biological mechanisms, while in others dystonia and tremor are two comorbid conditions. The term “dystonic tremor” is used to describe tremor in those who have dystonia. Two mutually exclusive definitions of “dystonic tremor” were proposed. According to one definition, dystonic tremor is the tremor in the dystonic body part. An alternate definition of dystonic tremor entails irregular and jerky oscillations that have saw tooth appearance with or without overt dystonia. This paper outlines the differences in two definitions of dystonic tremor and identifies their limitations. Given the diverse views defining “dystonic tremor”, this paper will use the term “tremor in dystonia”. In addition, we will outline different ways to separate the subtypes of tremor in dystonia.

GBM is associated with an abnormal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, consisting of two distinct kinase complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The complexes play critical roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration, metabolism, and DNA damage response. This study investigated the aberrant mTORC2 signaling pathway in GBM cells by performing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of U87MG cells under different drug treatment conditions. Interestingly, a functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed that mTORC2 inhibition might be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. We further characterized the relationship between mTORC2 and BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 1 (BABAM1). We demonstrated that pBABAM1 at Ser29 is regulated by mTORC2 to initiate DNA damage response, contributing to DNA repair and cancer cell survival. Accordingly, the inactivation of mTORC2 significantly ablated pBABAM1 (Ser29), reduced DNA repair activities in the nucleus, and promoted apoptosis of the cancer cells. Furthermore, we also recognized that histone H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 (?H2AX) could be controlled by mTORC2 to repair the DNA. These results provided a better understanding of the mTORC2 function in oncogenic DNA damage response and might lead to specific mTORC2 treatments for brain cancer patients in the future.","chemistry, biochemistryistry","Chemistry (all), Biochemistry"

The standard deviation (SD) and skewness of the PSD also influenced Umf variation. Furthermore, the Umf decreased with increasing bed inventory and bed temperature. The influencing parameters were recast into a dimensionless group and included in a new correlation for predicting Umf. The proposed correlation estimated an average absolute deviation of 14.6% between the experimental data and predicted values.

A high concentration of protease inhibitors was observed in the Thai people living with HIV (PLWH). Thus, dose reduction of LPV/r may be possible. However, the pharmacokinetics and dose optimization of LPV/r have never been investigated. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of LPV/r and provide dosage optimization in Thai PLWH. Methods: LPV and RTV trough concentrations from Thai PLWH were combined with intensive data. The data were analyzed by the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The influence of RTV concentration on LPV oral clearance (CL/F) was investigated. Results: Rifampicin (RIF) use increased LPV and RTV CL/F by 2.16-fold and 1.99-fold, respectively. The reduced dose of 300/75 and 200/150 mg twice daily provided a comparable percentage of patients achieving LPV target trough concentration to the standard dose for PI-naïve patients. For HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving RIF who could not tolerate the recommended dose, the reduced dose of 600/150 mg twice daily was recommended. Conclusion: The population pharmacokinetic model was developed by integrating the interaction between LPV and RTV. The reduced LPV/r dosage offers sufficient LPV exposure for Thai PLWH.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Pharmacology (medical)"

We evaluated predictors of novel aging markers, phenotypic age (PhenoAge) and phenotypic age acceleration (PAA) and their association with comorbidities, frailty, and NCI. Methods: In a cohort of PLWH and age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls, we calculated PhenoAge using chronological age and 9 biomarkers from complete blood counts, inflammatory, metabolic-, liver- and kidney-related parameters. PAA was calculated as the difference between chronological age and PhenoAge. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with higher (>median) PAA. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was used to assess model discrimination for frailty. Results: Among 333 PLWH and 102 HIV-negative controls (38% female), the median phenotypic age (49.4 vs. 48.5 years, p = 0.54) and PAA (− 6.7 vs. -7.5, p = 0.24) was slightly higher and PAA slightly less in PLWH although this did not reach statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 1.68 [95%CI = 1.03–2.73]), current smoking (2.74 [1.30–5.79]), diabetes mellitus (2.97 [1.48–5.99]), hypertension (1.67 [1.02–2.72]), frailty (3.82 [1.33–10.93]), and higher IL-6 levels (1.09 [1.04–1.15]), but not HIV status and NCI, were independently associated with higher PAA. PhenoAge marker discriminated frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.75 [0.66–0.85] vs. 0.65 [0.55–0.77], p = 0.04). In the analysis restricted to PLWH, PhenoAge alone predicted frailty better than chronological age alone (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6499, P = 0.09) and VACS index (AUROC: 0.7412 vs. 0.6811, P = 0.34) despite not statistically significant. Conclusions: While PLWH did not appear to have accelerated aging in our cohort, the phenotypic aging marker was significantly associated with systemic inflammation, frailty, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. This simple aging marker could be useful to identify high-risk PLWH within a similar chronological age group.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology

This study is a preliminary assessment of the geological CO2 storage potential of the onshore Khorat Plateau. A potential geological formation is screened and ranked in terms of its suitability as a CO2 storage site (storage optimization, risk minimization and feasibility). The results of this screening and ranking indicate that, among the tested sites in this study, the Khorat Permian carbonate is the most suitable for geological CO2 storage, followed by the Khorat Group sandstone, and Khorat evaporite. However, the Khorat Cenozoic basalts are not suitable for geological CO2 storage in the Khorat Plateau. The results from this study should advance the understanding of petroleum exploration and carbon capture and storage technology in Thailand, especially in the Khorat area.

This treated rubberwood was additionally prepared by simple surface sanding prior to jointing. The highest wettability was found on surfaces sanded with the largest grit sandpaper. Consequently, glueline thickness increased with progressively larger grit (smaller grit number) sandpaper. In addition, the maximum shear strength for the joint made from the densified rubberwood was greater than that of that made from the original one, by 40%. Surprisingly, with the optimal sanding treatment, the shear strength of the wooden joint gradually increased with an increase in the density of the densified rubberwood from 1.05 to 1.30 g/cm3. Moreover, the rate of wood failure also increased throughout the stated density range.","wood and wood products, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Novel antidiarrheal agents are needed to reduce epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-associated diarrhea to improve the quality of life and treatment outcome in cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the anti-diarrheal activity of chitosan oligosaccharide against afatinib-induced barrier disruption and chloride secretion in human intestinal epithelial cells (T84 cells). Chitosan oligosaccharide (100 μg/mL) prevented afatinib-induced barrier disruption determined by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran flux in the T84 cell monolayers. In addition, chitosan oligosaccharide prevented afatinib-induced potentiation of cAMP-induced chloride secretion measured by short-circuit current analyses in the T84 cell monolayers. Chitosan oligosaccharide induced the activation of AMPK, a positive regulator of epithelial tight junction and a negative regulator of cAMP-induced chloride secretion. Moreover, chitosan oligosaccharide partially reversed afatinib-induced AKT inhibition without affecting afatinib-induced ERK inhibition via AMPK-independent mechanisms. Collectively, this study reveals that chitosan oligosaccharide prevents the afatinib-induced diarrheal activities in T84 cells via both AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms. Chitosan oligosaccharide represents a promising natural polymer-derived compound for further development of treatment for afatinib-associated diarrheas.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The teeth were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Bioceramic sealer group, canals were obturated with gutta-percha and BioRoot sealer; (2) Calcium hydroxide group, canals were medicated with UltraCal XS; (3) Control group, canals were left empty. Thirty specimens were used for evaluation of pH at 7, 14, and 28 days (n = 10 per group) and the other 30 specimens were used for evaluation of calcium ion diffusion at 28 days (n = 10 per group). Results: Calcium hydroxide group showed the highest median pH value at all time points (7, 14, and 28 days). Both calcium hydroxide and bioceramic sealer groups showed significantly higher median pH values compared with control (p <.001). Comparing within groups, both bioceramic sealer group and calcium hydroxide group showed significantly decreased median pH over time, while the median pH of the control did not show any significant difference among Days 7, 14, and 28. Both calcium hydroxide and bioceramic sealer groups had significantly higher calcium ion release than control. Notably, bioceramic sealer group showed significantly higher calcium ion release than the calcium hydroxide group (p <.01). Conclusions: Root canals obturated with gutta-percha and bioceramic sealer showed high calcium ion levels at the simulated external root resorption cavities but did not show an extended period of alkaline pH.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Explainable natural language processing with matrix product states,"Tangpanitanon J., Mangkang C., Bhadola P., Minato Y., Angelakis D.G., Chotibut T.",2022-05-01,"Arithmetic circuit, Entanglement entropy, Entanglement spectrum, Information propagation, Matrix product state, Minimal model, Quantum machine learning, Sentiment analysis, Single layer, Spectra's, entanglement entropy, entanglement spectrum, matrix product state, natural language processing, quantum machine learning, recurrent neural networks","Despite empirical successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), theoretical understanding of RNNs is still limited due to intrinsically complex non-linear computations. We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state. Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves 1/499% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics.","fluidex; related topics, physics",Physics and Astronomy (all)

In order to simplify the process, in the present study we report the first example of a recombinant levansucrase-inulosucrase fusion protein and investigate its impact on LFOS production. Sequences for levansucrase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KK9 and inulosucrase from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 were fused genetically with a flexible eighteen residue glycine-serine peptide linker. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular weight of obtained fusion protein is approximately of 120 kDa, corresponding to the expected fusion protein molecular weight. Kinetic analysis revealed that after protein combination, the kinetic parameters of both enzymes are slightly changed. Biochemical characterization revealed that fusion did not affect the optimum pH and temperature for catalysis, but significantly change the stability of the enzyme. HPAEC-PAD analysis and enzymatic hydrolysis assays demonstrated that the fusion enzyme produced the desired higher yield of LFOS compared to those of individual levansucrases.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, environmental, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Biomedical Engineering"

The exact pathophysiology of the affective, chronic fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms (labelled as “physio-affective phenome”) of LC has remained elusive. Objective: The current study aims to delineate the effects of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature during the acute phase on the physio-affective phenome of LC. Method: We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3–4 months later. Results: Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7% of the LC patients and is characterised by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. Conclusion: The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

We show that Transmorphic Phage/AAV (TPA) particles provide superior delivery of transgenes over current phage-derived vectors through greater diffusion across the extracellular space and improved intracellular trafficking. We used TPA to target the delivery of cytokine-encoding transgenes for interleukin-12 (IL12), and novel isoforms of IL15 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF (Formula presented.)) for tumour immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate selective and efficient gene delivery and immunotherapy against solid tumours in vivo, without harming healthy organs.

Achieving a CE closer to unity (1.0) is thus highly desirable and also a critical challenge due to the unfavorable splitting of water at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces. Here we report a urea-containing-WiSE that enables the aqueous LIBs with a high CE of 99.1% at low rate of 0.15 C, higher than typical WiSE-based LIBs operated at similar low current density. Robust water-resistant interphases with organic-inorganic hybrid amorphous microstructure were grown on both anode and cathode, which are responsible for the high CE in low rate. Such advanced interfacial chemistry with functional additives may open the way for designing cheaper but more durable aqueous batteries.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Materials Science","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all), Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This paper explores the effect of ESG activities on brand image and customers’ purchase intentions. The moderating effects of a range of sociological factors are also investigated. Based on 168 samples of Thai participants, survey research with an online questionnaire tool was employed to collect the data with structural equation modelling (SEM) to test hypotheses and verify the conceptual framework of this study. The results showed that all environmental, social, and governance activities significantly affect brand image and customers’ purchase intentions. For brand image as a consequence of ESG activities, social activities (b = 0.511) play the strongest role, followed by environmental (b = 0.482) and governance (b = 0.434) activities. On the other hand, environmental activities (b = 0.420) of the ESG concept strongly influence customers' purchase intentions, followed by social (b = 0.395) and governance activities (b = 0.309). Additionally, the moderation analysis found that the effects of ESG activities on brand image and purchase intentions vary depending on gender, age, and education level. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the ESG concept for both academics and practitioners.

Plasma glucose, serum insulin, and subjective appetite were evaluated postprandially over 180 min. In Phase II, 22 participants consumed one serving/day of ONS for 12 weeks. Blood glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and body composition were evaluated. Gastrointestinal tolerability was evaluated in both the acute and long-term period. During phase I, TRM30 decreased in area under the curve of serum insulin by 33.12%, compared to the original formula (2320.71 ± 570.76 uIU × min/mL vs. 3470.12 ± 531.87 uIU × min/mL, p = 0.043).

Assistive devices present a possible solution to bridge the gap between symptom burden and current therapies, offering safe and effective tremor suppression. Although not yet considered as an option in most therapeutic guidelines for tremor disorders, assistive technologies (AT) offer a unique opportunity as adjunctive interventions utilising new portable technologies at lower cost, with minimal adverse effects. Here, the clinical concept of Human Activity Assistive Technology model via two groups of AT (limb weights and handheld devices; orthoses and exoskeletons) in patients with tremor is reviewed, supported by clinical evidence on reduction of tremor severity or improved functional performance. Although most devices are prototypes with limited clinical evidence, many are approved as medical devices and are commercially available. However, despite increased availability of these devices, there are still barriers to their adoption, mostly influenced by perceptions on privacy, trust, and functionality/added value. Long-term adherence to these devices is also unknown. In order to promote accessibility and usability of AT for tremor, an evaluation consensus by an interdisciplinary team (users, prescribers, and technicians) is required to identify those in need and to offer device recommendations. Future developments of AT for tremor should improve user comfort by incorporating softer, lightweight materials and explore new mechanisms to enhance wearability and long-term efficacies.

The usage of Social Internet of Things (SIoT) applications increases day-to-day, which makes social platforms very popular and simultaneously requires an effective computation system to achieve high service reliability. In this regard, offloading high required computational social service requests (SRs) in a time slot based on directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an NP-complete problem. Most state-of-art methods concentrate on the energy preservation of networks but neglect the resource sharing cost and dynamic subservice execution time (SET) during the computation and resource sharing. This article proposes a two-step deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based service offloading (DSO) approach to diminish edge server costs through a DRL influenced resource and SET analysis (RSA) model. In the first level, the service and edge server cost is considered during service offloading. In the second level, the R-retaliation method evaluates resource factors to optimize resource sharing and SET fluctuations. The simulation results show that the proposed DSO approach achieves low execution costs by streamlining dynamic service completion and transmission time, server cost, and deadline violation rate attributes. Compared to the state-of-art approaches, our proposed method has achieved high resource usage with low energy consumption.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, sociology, computer science","Modeling and Simulation, Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Human-Computer Interaction"

Strength anisotropy is an important aspect of clay behavior, but it is mostly neglected in practical stability analyses. In this study, the effects of undrained strength anisotropy and strength nonhomogeneity on the stability of unlined circular tunnels in clays are investigated. The static approach of lower-bound (LB) analysis using finite-element and second-order cone programming is employed to examine the aforementioned effects. The anisotropic shear strength of clay is modeled by employing an elliptical yield function under plane strain conditions. A complete set of dimensionless parameters covering the cover depth ratios of tunnels, normalized overburden pressure ratios, normalized strength gradient ratios of clays, and anisotropic strength ratios, are systematically investigated. The new LB solutions indicate that the stability load factor of the problem has a nonlinear relationship with the cover depth ratio and the anisotropic strength ratio, and there exists a linear relationship with the normalized overburden pressure and the normalized strength gradient. Their influence on the predicted failure mechanism is parametrically evaluated. A statistically approximate stability equation of unlined circular tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clay is proposed for the first time, which contains four new stability factors, namely, constant undrained strength, linearly increasing strength gradient, undrained strength anisotropy, and soil unit weight, and it can serve as a fast and accurate tool for predicting the undrained stability of this problem in practice.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Because OSA-induced chronic intermittent hypoxia is well-known, the hypoxia might worsen peritoneal membrane. Objective: We tested the influence of chronic intermittent hypoxia upon peritoneal membrane in a Sprague-Dawley rat model. Methods: Normal saline or 3.86% glucose peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) were intra-peritoneally administered twice a day as negative (NSS group) and positive controls (PDF group), respectively. Intermittent hypoxia was induced by using a hypoxic chamber with 10% O2 for 8 hours a day plus twice-daily NSS injection (IH group). Results: At 12 weeks of the experiments, high serum TNF-α and IL-6 (but not IL-10) with normal renal and liver functions were demonstrated in the IH group (but not the PDF group). In parallel, local cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in peritoneal membrane) and peritoneal membrane thickness were increased whereas peritoneal membrane hypoxia (hypoxyprobe™ and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; HIF-1α) was induced in both PDF and IH groups (more prominent in the PDF group). However, the increased vascular density in submesothelial area was established only in the PDF group. Conclusion: Intermittent hypoxia model induced local peritoneal membrane inflammation and enhanced peritoneal membrane thickness, at least in part, through a mechanism of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α. Although peritoneal membrane alterations from PDF were more prominent than intermittent hypoxia, the combination between intermittent hypoxia with PDF utilization might facilitate peritoneal membrane failure, which will need more study.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Cytokine Profiling and Intra-Articular Injection of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma in Knee Osteoarthritis,"Riewruja K., Phakham S., Sompolpong P., Reantragoon R., Tanavalee A., Ngarmukos S., Udomsinprasert W., Suantawee T., Dechsupa S., Honsawek S.",2022-01-01,"Aged, Biomarkers, Cell Movement, Cell Proliferation, Chondrocytes, Cytokines, Disease Management, Disease Susceptibility, Female, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Male, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Platelet-Rich Plasma, Treatment Outcome, Chondrocytes, Cytokines, Knee, Osteoarthritis, Platelet-rich plasma","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease leading to joint pain and stiffness. Due to lack of effective treatments, physical and psychological disabilities caused by OA have a detrimental impact on the patient’s quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that intra-articular injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may provide favorable results since PRP comprises not only a high level of platelets but also a huge amount of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. However, the precise mechanism and standardization method remain uncertain. This study aimed to examine cytokine profiling in both PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) of knee OA patients and to determine the effects of PRP on OA chondrocytes and knee OA patients. PRP contained a wide variety of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and autologous intra-articular PRP injection resulted in favorable outcomes in knee OA patients. Significant increases in levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, TNF-α, IL-17, PDGF-BB, bFGF, and MIP-1β were detected in PRP compared to PPP (p < 0.001). An in vitro study showed a marked increase in proliferation in OA chondrocytes cultured with PRP, compared to PPP and fetal bovine serum (p < 0.001). In a clinical study, knee OA patients treated with PRP showed improvement of physical function and pain, assessed by physical performance, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and visual analog scale. Our findings from both in vitro and clinical studies suggest that intra-articular PRP injection in knee OA patients may be a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating knee pain and delaying the need for surgery.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Selective adsorption mechanisms of iodinated trihalomethanes onto thiol-functionalized HKUST-1s in a mixed solute,"Induvesa P., Ratanatawanate C., Wongrueng A., Punyapalakul P.",2022-08-01,"Adsorption, Metal-Organic Frameworks, Solutions, Sulfhydryl Compounds, Trihalomethanes, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification, HKUST-1, Iodinated DBPs, Iodinated trihalomethane, Selective adsorption mechanism, Thiol functionalization","The selective adsorption mechanisms involved in the competitive adsorption of five iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) onto dithiolglycol and (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxy functionalized HKUST-1 (HK-SH and HK-MPTS, respectively) were investigated by single- and mixed-batch adsorption. HK-SH had the highest adsorption rates and capacities for the five I-THMs, followed by HK-MPTS and pristine HKUST-1, even though the porosity and surface area decreased after modification. The primary adsorptive mechanism of HK-SH consists of ion-dipole interactions of I-THMs with the protonated hydroxyl and thiol groups at the metal (Cu) node, which is supported by Lewis acid-base reactions via Cu–Cu complex and π−π interactions. In a mixed solute, bromodiiodomethane, which was the most hydrophobic and had the smallest molecular size, exhibited the most competitive adsorption on HK-SH. In contrast, the selective adsorption of I-THMs onto HK-MPTS was affected by their log Kow values, causing hydrophobic partitioning onto the alkyl chain of the mercaptopropyl group. Iodinated haloforms tend to achieve a higher adsorption rate and capacity than chlorinated and brominated haloforms via hydrophobic partitioning. Moreover, dithiolglycol grafted onto HK-SH can better promote the excellent selective adsorption performance of iodoacetamide than dichloroiodomethane and iodoacetic acid in both single- and mixed-solute solutions due to hydrogen bonding via the –NH2 group of diiodoacetamide.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Candida Worsens Klebsiella pneumoniae Induced-Sepsis in a Mouse Model with Low Dose Dextran Sulfate Solution through Gut Dysbiosis and Enhanced Inflammation,"Panpetch W., Phuengmaung P., Hiengrach P., Issara-Amphorn J., Cheibchalard T., Somboonna N., Tumwasorn S., Leelahavanichkul A.",2022-07-01,"Animals, beta-Glucans, Caco-2 Cells, Candida, Colitis, Cytokines, Dextran Sulfate, Disease Models, Animal, Dysbiosis, Humans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Sepsis, Toll-Like Receptor 2, Candida administration, dysbiosis, dysbiosis, gut leakage, inflammation, inflammatory cytokine, Klebsiella pneumoniae, microbiome","Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and a commensal organism that is possibly enhanced in several conditions with gut dysbiosis, and frequently detectable together with Candida overgrowth. Here, K. pneumoniae with or without Candida albicans was daily orally administered for 3 months in 0.8% dextran sulfate solution-induced mucositis mice and also tested in vitro. As such, Candida worsened Klebsiella-DSS-colitis as demonstrated by mortality, leaky gut (FITC-dextran assay, bacteremia, endotoxemia, and serum beta-glucan), gut dysbiosis (increased Deferribacteres from fecal microbiome analysis), liver pathology (histopathology), liver apoptosis (activated caspase 3), and cytokines (in serum and in the internal organs) when compared with Klebsiella-administered DSS mice. The combination of heat-killed Candida plus Klebsiella mildly facilitated inflammation in enterocytes (Caco-2), hepatocytes (HepG2), and THP-1-derived macrophages as indicated by supernatant cytokines or the gene expression. The addition of heat-killed Candida into Klebsiella preparations upregulated TLR-2, reduced Occludin (an intestinal tight junction molecule), and worsened enterocyte integrity (transepithelial electrical resistance) in Caco-2 and enhanced casp8 and casp9 (apoptosis genes) in HepG2 when compared with heat-killed Klebsiella alone. In conclusion, Candida enhanced enterocyte inflammation (partly through TLR-2 upregulation and gut dysbiosis) that induced gut translocation of endotoxin and beta-glucan causing hyper-inflammatory responses, especially in hepatocytes and macrophages.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Lactiplan-tibacillus plantarum and Enterococcus faecium were tested in high fat-induced obesity mice and in vitro experiments. After 16 weeks of probiotics, L. plantarum dfa1 outperforms E. faecium dfa1 on the anti-obesity property as indicated by body weight, regional fat accumulation, serum cholesterol, inflammatory cytokines (in blood and colon tissue), and gut barrier defect (FITC-dextran assay). With fecal microbiome analysis, L. plantarum dfa1 but not E. faecium dfa1 reduced fecal abundance of pathogenic Proteobacteria without an alteration in total Gram-negative bacteria when compared with non-probiotics obese mice. With palmitic acid induction, the condition media from both probiotics similarly attenuated supernatant IL-8, improved enterocyte integrity and down-regulated cholesterol absorption-associated genes in Caco-2 cell (an enterocyte cell line) and reduced supernatant cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) with normalization of cell energy status (extracellular flux analysis) in bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the condition media of both probiotics on palmitic acid-activated enterocytes was neutralized by amylase, the active anti-inflammatory molecules might, partly, be exopolysaccharides. As L. plantarum dfa1 out-performed E. faecium dfa1 in anti-obesity property, possibly through the reduced fecal Proteobacteria, with a similar anti-inflammatory exopolysaccharide; L. plantarum is a potentially better option for anti-obesity than E. faecium.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Research to understand the high-risk behaviors associated with disease transmission at the human-animal interface is limited, and few consider regional and local contexts. Objective: This study employed an integrated behavioral–biological surveillance approach for the early detection of novel and known zoonotic viruses in potentially high-risk populations, in an effort to identify risk factors for spillover and to determine potential foci for risk-mitigation measures. Method: Participants were enrolled at two community-based sites (n = 472) in eastern and western Thailand and two hospital (clinical) sites (n = 206) in northeastern and central Thailand. A behavioral questionnaire was administered to understand participants’ demographics, living conditions, health history, and animal-contact behaviors and attitudes. Biological specimens were tested for coronaviruses, filoviruses, flaviviruses, influenza viruses, and paramyxoviruses using pan (consensus) RNA Virus assays. Results: Overall 61/678 (9%) of participants tested positive for the viral families screened which included influenza viruses (75%), paramyxoviruses (15%), human coronaviruses (3%), flaviviruses (3%), and enteroviruses (3%). The most salient predictors of reporting unusual symptoms (i.e., any illness or sickness that is not known or recognized in the community or diagnosed by medical providers) in the past year were having other household members who had unusual symptoms and being scratched or bitten by animals in the same year. Many participants reported raising and handling poultry (10.3% and 24.2%), swine (2%, 14.6%), and cattle (4.9%, 7.8%) and several participants also reported eating raw or undercooked meat of these animals (2.2%, 5.5%, 10.3% respectively). Twenty four participants (3.5%) reported handling bats or having bats in the house roof. Gender, age, and livelihood activities were shown to be significantly associated with participants’ interactions with animals. Participants’ knowledge of risks influenced their health-seeking behavior. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is a high level of interaction between humans, livestock, and wild animals in communities at sites we investigated in Thailand. This study highlights important differences among demographic and occupational risk factors as they relate to animal contact and zoonotic disease risk, which can be used by policymakers and local public health programs to build more effective surveillance strategies and behavior-focused interventions.",medical,Infectious Diseases

The mechanical response to externally applied loads of tooth restored with glass fiber-reinforced polybenzoxazine composite posts is also simulated by finite element analysis of a tridimensional model and compared with the response to that of a natural tooth. The reinforcing of glass fiber can help improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the polybenzoxazine influenced by the interfacial adhesion between the glass fiber and polybenzoxazine matrix, except for the relatively high mechanical property of the glass fiber. The mechanical data, i.e., elastic modulus under flexure load or flexural modulus by three-point bending test of the glass fiber-reinforced polybenzoxazine composites are agreed with the elastic modulus of dentin and then used in the finite element model. The restoration using the glass fiber-reinforced polybenzoxazine composite post provided the maximum von Mises equivalent stress at the cervical third area of the endodontically treated tooth model as similarly observed in the natural tooth. In addition, the maximum von Mises equivalent stress of the tooth restored with the glass fiber-reinforced polybenzoxazine composite post is also quietly like that of the natural tooth.

However, sepsis-induced immune alterations related to fungal susceptibility have not been well characterized. Objective: To determine kinetic changes in the immune phenotype by determining the proportion of T cells, B cells and macrophages, and especially the expression of an immune exhaustion marker PD-1, in murine sepsis. In addition, sepsis-induced alterations of these immune cells were assessed in relation to susceptibility to secondary fungal infec-tion. Methods: Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used as a mouse sepsis model, with Candida albicans as the secondary systemic fungal infection. Splenic T cells, B cells and macrophages were assessed by flow cytometry. Results: Alterations in T cell and B cell numbers and the proportion of PD-1 expressing T cells and B cells in CLP mice were not clearly related to susceptibility to secondary Candida infection. By contrast, changes in levels of CD86+-activated macrophages, and the proportion of the PD-1+ population among the CD86+ macrophages in CLP mice were found to be related to secondary fungal infection susceptibility. Conclusion: Macrophage activation and exhaustion might be a significant determinant in susceptibility to fungal in-fection, and outcomes of infection. This study provided more comprehensive knowledge pertinent to patient evaluation and therapeutics design in restoring host defenses against secondary fungal infection in those with sepsis.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with childhood glaucoma who visited the glaucoma clinics at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health and the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2008 and January 2018. The diagnosis was based on the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network classification. We recorded their clinical characteristics and requirement of any glaucoma interventions. Results: A total of 691 eyes from 423 patients were included in this study. The patients predominantly comprised boys. The average follow-up duration was 71.3±63.8 months. The mean age at presentation was 3.9±4.4 years. Most patients presented with a high initial intraocular pressure (IOP). The average intial IOP of all patients was 28.5±11.2 mmHg. Glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies (22.9%) was the most common subtype, followed by primary congenital glaucoma (20.8%). We recorded a family history of glaucoma in 6.4% of patients of the 234 patients with an available family history. Most patients had bilateral glaucoma (63.4%) and required at least one intervention (51.5%). The average IOP at the latest follow-up visit was 19.1±10.8 mmHg. All glaucoma types had significantly lower IOP, compared to that at their baselines (all p<0.001). Moreover, most patients had an unfavourable visual acuity (49.5%) at their latest visit. Conclusions: Secondary glaucoma associated with non-acquired ocular anomalies is the most common subtype of glaucoma. The majority of patients had unfavourable visual outcomes.

The SPR effect between the core guided mode and the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of the DDC is used to evaluate the sensing response with respect to different analytes. The sensing performance, coupling characteristics, and the fabrication tolerance of the sensor are numerically analyzed and characterized by using a full-vectorial Finite Element Method (FEM). The designed sensor shows a minimum sensitivity of 3150 nm/RIU for refractive index (RI) = 1.310. While, the sensor exhibits an extremely high sensitivity varying from 10250 nm/RIU to 90500 nm/RIU for RI varied over the range of 1.370 to 1.400.

Typical examples are chemical reactors, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, deaerators, condensers, etc. The numerical simulation of gas-liquid two-phase flows, which is crucial for efficient, safe, and optimized apparatus design, requires an accurate model developed based on the physics of the two-phase fluid dynamics. The two-fluid model is considered the most accurate two-phase conservation equations used in computer simulation codes to predict the thermal-hydraulic behavior of two-phase flows. The drift-flux parameters, such as the distribution parameter and drift velocity in the drift-flux model, are utilized in formulating the interfacial drag force in the two-fluid model-based simulation codes. The drift-flux model is an insightful model considering the difference between gas and liquid velocities. The effect of phase and velocity distributions on the void fraction is considered through the two drift-flux parameters. The distribution parameter and drift velocity are critical parameters in the two-phase flow formulation through the two-fluid model, which are the backbone of thermal-hydraulic analysis codes. The constitutive equations for the distribution parameter and drift velocity developed for medium-size channels reach a mature level but do not apply to industrial-size channels or large-size channels. The complicated two-phase flow dynamics in large-size channels affect the distribution parameter and drift velocity significantly. The distribution parameter in a large-size channel increases at low pressure and low liquid flow conditions due to induced secondary flow in the large-size channel. The drift velocity also increases due to cap bubbles formed by the surface instability of large bubbles. Multi-dimensional two-phase flow dynamics observed in large-size channels complicate the distribution parameter and drift velocity modeling. Thus, the drift-flux modeling in large-size channels is a much more subtle task than that in medium-size channels. This fact has driven the research to establish the drift-flux type correlations by modeling the distribution parameter and drift velocity in large-size channels. The current paper aims to provide state-of-the-art knowledge of the current status of the recent development of the drift-flux type correlations in large-size channels. The discussed items cover the formulation of the one-dimensional drift-flux model, typical drift-flux correlations developed for medium-size channels, distribution parameters for subcooled and saturated boiling flows, unique two-phase flow dynamics in large-size channels, critical size at the boundary between medium and large-size channels, and existing drift-flux correlations for large-size channels. The flow channel geometries discussed in the current paper are circular, annulus, rectangular, square, vertical rod bundle, and horizontal tube bundle.

The composite with optimal ratios of g-C3N4 to Ag-TiO2 at 2 to 1 (2CN:1ST) exhibited photocatalytic efficiencies for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB, cationic dye) and methyl orange (MO, anionic dye) of 95.01 % and 98.13 % and 72.92 % and 92.82 % under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. The results suggested that Ag-TiO2 is a predominantly UV-responsive photocatalyst, whereas g-C3N4 can effectively promote photocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation. Therefore, the synergy of the synthesized g-C3N4 and Ag-TiO2 photocatalysts results in high-performance cationic and anionic dye degradation under both UV and visible light irradiation. In addition, the ability of Ag0/Ag+ to switch oxidation states under irradiation is advantageous to the suppression of recombination.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"
Use of qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA leader for the therapeutic plan: a preliminary report on 10 patients,"Petcharat S., Virojanapirom P., Putcharoen O., Wacharapluesadee S., Hemachudha T.",2022-04-01,"COVID-19, Humans, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Guide, RNA, Viral, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, qRT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2, sgRNA leader","Introduction: Duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding is important for infection control. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) leader indicates that the virus is replicative. This study examined the shedding duration of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA leader and genomic RNA (gRNA) in diverse respiratory specimens. Methodology: One hundred and eleven respiratory specimens collected sequentially from 10 COVID-19 patients with real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 orf1ab gene confirmed positive admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were examined for SARS-CoV-2 E sgRNA leader and E gRNA by using Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). These specimens included nasopharyngeal swab and throat swabs, nasal swab and throat swabs, sputum, and endotracheal aspirate, and were collected from the first day of admission until the time of orf1ab real-time RT-PCR negative of at least 2-4 consecutive days. Results: E sgRNA leader could only be detectable in specimens with ≥ 1E+05 virus E gene copies per ml within the first 15 days after hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA leader was undetectable from one to 15 days earlier than that of gRNA in all patients. Re-shedding of sgRNA was evident in 2 cases, both on a single occasion after being undetectable for 3-10 days. Conclusions: Assessment of the presence of sgRNA leader may be useful for therapeutic planning.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Infectious Diseases, Virology"

This leads to a shortage of hand sign angklung music experts in the city. This musical group activity is not widely utilized. The 'Angklung Smart Band' is an IoT-based solution designed to assist angklung music experts or nursing home caregivers in Thailand in supporting angklung music group activities for the elderly. The system consists of a web application, Internet of Things devices, and angklung musical instruments linked through a wireless network. In this study, we evaluated the use of the angklung smart band to facilitate music group activities for the elderly in nursing homes. We compared the outcomes to the conventional hand sign method for promoting music group activities. We assessed the use of a smart band system with two groups of the elderly: a home group and a bedridden group. The results revealed that this approach is more appropriate for the home group than the bedridden group, since they can independently participate in music group activities. Consequently, the expert can focus on interaction with other elderly in order to ensure that all the elderly are always engaged in activities. A statistical analysis of the playing accuracy percentage showed that the smart band system can execute angklung music group activities as well as the hand sign method.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Modeling and Simulation, Numerical Analysis"
Extracellular adenosine triphosphate induces IDO and IFNγ expression of human periodontal ligament cells through P2X7 receptor signaling,"Kyawsoewin M., Limraksasin P., Ngaokrajang U., Pavasant P., Osathanon T.",2022-08-01,"Adenosine Triphosphate, Cells, Cultured, Egtazic Acid, Humans, Interferon-gamma, Osteogenesis, Periodontal Ligament, RNA, Messenger, RNA, Small Interfering, extracellular adenosine triphosphate, IDO, IFNγ, P2X7 receptor, periodontal ligament cells","Background: Mechanical stimuli induce the release of adenosine triphosphate into the extracellular environment by human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) plays the role in both inflammation and osteogenic differentiation. eATP involves in immunosuppressive action by increasing immunosuppressive molecules IDO and IFNγ expression on immune cells. However, the role of eATP on the immunomodulation of hPDLCs remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of eATP on the IDO and IFNγ expression of hPDLCs and the participation of purinergic P2 receptors in this phenomenon. Methods: hPDLCs were treated with eATP. The mRNA and protein expression of indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) were determined. The role of the purinergic P2 receptor was determined using calcium chelator (EGTA) and PKC inhibitor (PKCi). Chemical inhibitors (KN62 and BBG), small interfering RNA (siRNA), and P2X7 receptor agonist (BzATP) were used to confirm the involvement of P2X7 receptors on IDO and IFNγ induction by hPDLCs. Results: eATP significantly enhanced mRNA expression of IDO and IFNγ. Moreover, eATP increased kynurenine which is the active metabolite of tryptophan breakdown catalyzed by the IDO enzyme and significantly induced IFNγ protein expression. EGTA and PKCi reduced eATP-induced IDO and IFNγ expressions by hPDLCs, confirming the role of calcium signaling. Chemical P2X7 inhibitors (KN62 and BBG) and siRNA targeting the P2X7 receptor significantly inhibited the eATP-induced IDO and IFNγ production. Correspondingly, BzATP markedly increased IDO and IFNγ expression. Conclusion: eATP induced immunosuppressive function of hPDLCs by promoting IDO and IFNγ production via P2X7 receptor signaling. eATP may become a promising target for periodontal regeneration by modulating immune response and further triggering tissue healing.",dentistry,Periodontics

The control input in the controller design problem must be within a certain range to prevent the system from exhibiting undesirable traits such as bifurcation. To address this practical challenge, we present a new condition for state feedback design for nonlinear systems that includes guaranteed constraints on the cost functions as well as bounds on the input magnitudes in this study. The nonlinear bioreactor system is transformed into a polynomial system by the Taylor's series expansion. By exploiting polynomial structure of the systems, the proposed design condition is convex in the decision variables, and hence can be cast as a specific convex optimization so called a sum-of-squares programming which can be efficiently solved via the existing software tools. In addition, the proposed approach allow extension to robust state-feedback design of the bioreactor system affected by parametric uncertainty. Numerical experiments evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","process equipment, engineering, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Control and Optimization"

In this study, we introduce a versatile method for fine tuning the properties of polydiacetylene (PDA) materials by incorporating CuZnFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles. The resultant PDA/CuZnFe2O4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) exhibit multi-reversible thermochromism with different shades of color transition. The MNCs also response to both acid and base. In addition, the sensitivity can be tuned by varying CuZnFe2O4 ratio. The PDA/CuZnFe2O4-MNCs are localizable via the application of magnetic field. These multifunctional MNCs show potential in various advanced technologies such as smart paints, anti-counterfeiting labels, electro-thermochromic displays and localizable acid/base sensors. The preparing process of MNCs is rather simple, making it suitable for industrial utilization.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The development of PDA as an acid sensor often requires structural modification of the headgroup, involving time-consuming synthetic processes. In this study, we have found a versatile route for achieving acid response of PDA materials via a sol-gel method. Simple mixing of sodium hydroxide and a commercial diacetylene monomer, 5,7-hexadecadiynoic acid (HDDA), in an aqueous solution leads to supramolecular assembly to form nanoribbons and consequently gelation under ambient conditions. Interestingly, solid-state sensors of poly(HDDA-Na+) fabricated from the gels exhibit a colorimetric response to hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas. The red-to-orange color transition takes place at an HCl gas concentration as low as 400 ppm. The response time at 1300 ppm of HCl gas, the lowest lethal concentration causing fatality of a human, is within 1 min. The quick response of the poly(HDDA-Na+) sensor allows visual detection of HCl gas and provides sufficient time to take safety precautions. This sol-gel process is simple, showing potential for large-scale production. Our study also offers a development path for PDA materials that expands their applications as acid sensors.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

In this work, κ-Carrageenan (κC) was used as the drug matrix material. The porous κC matrices were fabricated by dissolving the κC in deionized water to obtain hydrogels and then using the freeze-dryer to obtain cryogels. The porous (κC) matrices showed interconnected pore sizes varying between 6.05 to 25.8 nm. In the drug release experiments, the drug diffusion coefficient increased and the drug release duration was reduced with decreasing κC concentration due to the larger κC pore sizes. The diffusion coefficient increased with a shorter release time under the applied electric strength of +1.0 V due to the electro-repulsive force between the Metformin and the anode. For the drug release-permeation of the κC 0.8 % v/v cryogel through the pig skin under applied positive electrical potentials, the amounts of drug release-permeation and diffusion coefficients were enhanced with shorter durations relative to without electrical potential.

The secondary aim was to study the profiles of miRNA expressions in CHMs. Methods: A case-control study was conducted on GTN moles and remission moles. We quantitatively assessed the expression of 800 human miRNAs from molar tissues using Nanostring nCounter. Results: From a pilot study, 21 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in GTN moles compared to the remission moles. Five of them (miR-566, miR-608, miR-1226-3p, miR-548ar-3p and miR-514a-3p) were downregulated for >4 folds. MiR-608 was selected as a candidate for further analysis on 18 CHMs (9 remission moles and 9 GTN moles) due to its striking association with malignant formation.

An anonymised consensus-based platform may enable discussion and collaboration on the challenges faced. Our aim was to identify where to focus improvement for future responses. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study by email of clinicians' experiences of leading during terrorist mass casualty incidents. An initial survey identified features that worked well, or failed to, during terrorist mass casualty incidents plus ongoing challenges and changes that were implemented as a result. A follow-up, quantitative survey measured agreement between responses within each of the themes using a Likert scale. Results: Thirty-three participants responded from 22 hospitals that had received casualties from a terrorist incident, representing 17 cities in low-middle, middle and high income countries. The first survey identified themes of sufficient (sometimes abundant) human resource, although coordination of staff was a challenge. Difficulties highlighted were communication, security, and management of blast injuries. The most frequently implemented changes were education on specific injuries, revising future plans and preparatory exercises. Persisting challenges were lack of time allocated to training and psychological well-being. The follow-up survey recorded highest agreement amongst correspondents on the need for re-triage at hospital (90% agreement), coordination roles (85% agreement), flexibility (100% agreement), and large-scale exercises (95% agreement). Conclusion: This survey collates international experience gained from clinicians managing terrorist mass casualty incidents.

The ultrafiltration permeate fraction (UFP), non-fractionated hydrolysate (RH), and ultrafiltration retentate fraction (UFR) were foam-mat dried at two temperatures 60 and 70 °C. The content of each phenolic composition in dried RH samples decreased with increasing drying temperature particularly gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillin, rutin, and, quercetin dropped by 27, 24, 21, 35 and 33%, however the kind of phenolic compositions identified in dried samples was unaffected by drying temperature. Dried UFR and dried UFP had different chromatograms. When the dried UFP and dried UFR chromatograms were examined, it was discovered that the intensity of the peaks in the dried UFR chromatogram was much lower. The majority of phenolics can pass through ultrafiltration membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa, according to this finding. Individual phenolic compound levels in dried UFP samples were similar to RH, implying that the majority of phenolic components in dried rice bean protein hydrolysate were smaller than 3 kDa. With increasing drying temperature, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, catechol, epicatechin and naringenin levels in dried UFP samples were decreased. The antioxidant capacity of dried rice bean hydrolysate was discovered to be due to phenolic components (gallic acid, epicatechin, catechol, ferulic acid, and rutin), which were found to be more prevalent than peptide fractions. As a result, rice bean hydrolysates could bring novel health advantages, which could lead to the development of nutraceuticals and food products.","mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

However, the poor aqueous solubility of ED limits its significant usage in practical applications. β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and its derivatives have been extensively utilized to enhance the water solubility and stability of lipophilic guest molecules by acting as a molecular shield through host–guest encapsulation. In this work, the structural dynamics details of inclusion complexation of ED with βCD and its two derivatives: 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD), were studied using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA)-based binding free energy (ΔGbind) calculations. The 500-ns MD simulations revealed that ED is able to form inclusion complexes with βCDs in two possible orientations: resorcinol ring insertion (R-form) and m-cresol ring insertion (C-form) mainly driven by van der Waals interaction. The ED/SBEβCD inclusion complex showed the highest number of atom contacts and the lowest solvent accessibility at the hydrophobic cavity, in line with the ΔGbind results ranked in the order of ED/SBEβCD (−6.18 ± 1.15 kcal/mol) > ED/HPβCD (−3.81 ± 0.65 kcal/mol) > ED/βCD (0.11 ± 0.51 kcal/mol). All findings suggested that βCD derivatives, especially SBEβCD, could be the appropriate host for ED in the potential development of ED into pharmaceutical applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In this paper, we propose a non linear optimisation model to determine an effective distribution of protective resources among facilities in service and supply systems so as to reduce the probability of failure to which facilities are exposed in case of external disruptions. The failure probability of protected assets depends on the level of protection investments and the ultimate goal is to minimise the expected facility-customer transport or travel costs to provide goods and services. A linear version of the model is obtained by exploiting a specialised network flow structure. Furthermore, an efficient GRASP solution algorithm is developed to benchmark the linearised model and resolve numerical difficulties. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated using the Toronto hospital network. Protection measures within this context correspond to capacity expansion investments and reduce the likelihood that hospitals are unable to satisfy patient demand during periods of high hospitalisation (e.g. during a pandemic). Managerial insights on the protection resource distribution are discussed and a comparison between probabilistic and worst-case disruptions is provided.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, Business, decision sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Strategy and Management, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Management Science and Operations Research"

The fibrosis-8 (FIB-8) score, recently developed by incorporating four additional variables into the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, showed better performance in predicting significant fibrosis in NAFLD. AIM To validate the FIB-8 score in a biopsy-proven NAFLD cohort and compare the diagnostic performance of the FIB-8 and FIB-4 scores and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) for predicting significant fibrosis. METHODS We collected the data of biopsy-proven NAFLD patients from three Asian centers in three countries. All the patients with available variables for the FIB-4 score (age, platelet count, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels) and FIB-8 score (the FIB-4 variables plus 4 additional parameters: The body mass index (BMI), albumin to globulin ratio, gamma-glutamyl transferase level, and presence of diabetes mellitus) were included. The fibrosis stage was scored using nonalcoholic steatohepatitis CRN criteria, and significant fibrosis was defined as at least fibrosis stage 2. RESULTS A total of 511 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and complete data were included for validation. Of these 511 patients, 271 (53.0%) were female, with a median age of 51 (interquartile range: 41, 58) years. The median BMI was 29 (26.3, 32.6) kg/m2, and 268 (52.4%) had diabetes. Among the 511 NAFLD patients, 157 (30.7%) had significant fibrosis (≥ F2). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the FIB-8 and FIB-4 scores and NFS for predicting significant fibrosis were 0.774, 0.743, and 0.680, respectively. The FIB-8 score demonstrated significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis than the NFS (P = 0.001) and was also clinically superior to FIB-4, although statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.073). The low cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 0.88 showed 92.36% sensitivity, and the high cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 1.77 showed 67.51% specificity. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the FIB-8 score had significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis in NAFLD patients than the NFS, as well as clinically superior performance vs the FIB-4 score in an Asian population. A novel simple fibrosis score comprising commonly accessible basic laboratories may be beneficial to use for an initial assessment in primary care units, excluding patients with significant liver fibrosis and aiding in patient selection for further hepatologist referral.",medical,Gastroenterology
Electrodeposition of the manganese-doped nickel-phosphorus catalyst with enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activity and durability,"Liu X., Niu J., Rajendran S., Lei Y., Qin J., Zhang X.",2022-12-30,"Catalytic performance, Coral-like structures, Hydrogen evolution reactions, Hydrogen-evolution, Nickel phosphorus, Ni–mn–P catalyst, Overpotential, Polyvalent manganese, Small coral-like structure, ]+ catalyst, Electrodeposition, HER, Ni–Mn–P catalyst, Polyvalent manganese, Small coral-like structures","Hydrogen technology is widely considered a novel clean energy source, and electrolysis is an effective method for hydrogen evolution. Therefore, efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts are urgently needed to replace precious metal catalysts and meet ecological and environmental protection standards. Herein, Ni–Mn–P electrocatalysts are synthesized using facile electrodeposition technology. The influence of the Mn addition on the catalytic behavior is studied by the comprehensive analysis of catalytic performance and morphology of the catalysts. Among them, the Ni–Mn–P0.01 catalyst exhibits small coral-like structures, greatly improving the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen ions and reducing the overpotential hydrogen evolution. Consequently, overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 electric current density is 113 mV, and the value of the Tafel slope achieves 74 mV/dec. Furthermore, the Ni–Mn–P catalyst shows long-time (20 h) stability at current densities of 10 and 60 mA/cm2. The results confirm that the synergistic effect of Ni, Mn, and P accelerates the electrochemical reaction. Meanwhile, the addition of manganese element can change the micromorphology of the catalyst, thereby exposing more active sites to participate in the reaction, enhancing water ionization, improving the catalytic performance. This study opens a new way toward improving the activity of the catalyst by adjusting Mn concentration during the electrodeposition process.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The extract showed antioxidant efficacy of 30-65% in reducing power assay and 55% inhibition in nitric oxide scavenging assay against ascorbic acid positive control. The plant extract exhibited modest inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungal strain, Echinodontium tinctorium. The IC50 value of the extract was 100 μg/mL against MCF-7 breast cancer cells in MTT assay. The extract yielded 22-65% inhibition at 100-800 μg/mL concentration range in RBC membrane stabilization assay. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of several classes of primary and secondary metabolites. Quantitative analysis revealed a high content of phenolic and flavonoid molecules. GC-MS profile of the plant extract revealed the presence of 44 bioactive compounds. Network analysis of key breast cancer proteins from differentially expressed genes aided in selecting the key proteins involved in breast cancer pathophysiology. ADMET-SAR analysis was done to assess the potential bioactivity of selected compounds. From the molecular docking results, coprostanol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrocatechol and indole were found to act as ligands of breast cancer target proteins. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns), the receptor-ligand complexes were stable for 50 nanoseconds. The results indicate that coprostanol is the principal component for binding to the selected breast cancer receptor proteins. Together, the results suggest that the phytochemicals explored herein exert the beneficial biological activities of A. cymosa.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

In fact, these moments can be directly calculated by applying the transition probability density function (PDF), which is often unknown or unavailable in closed form; the formulas for the conditional moments of the SDE may be unavailable in closed form, as well. In this work, we studied an extended case of Pearson diffusion processes, which are a class of diffusions that have squared diffusion coefficients with time-dependent parameter functions. A complete investigation was carried out for both light- and heavy-tailed Pearson diffusion processes, including Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, Cox–Ingersoll–Ross, Fisher–Snedecor, reciprocal gamma, and Student. We introduce a simple but novel approach to closed-form formulas for conditional moments of inhomogeneous Pearson diffusion processes. The approach does not require any knowledge of eigenfunctions or the transition PDF. In each class of stationary distributions reduced from Pearson diffusions, the formula is explored and presented in a concise form. The closed-form formulas obtained are also numerically validated by MC simulations.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Numerical Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

Experimental Procedure: From November 2016 to December 2017, 98 participants were included in this clinical trial, and they were randomly assigned to the experimental and control arms according to blocks of four. The intraoperative findings did not significantly differ between the two groups. The experimental group received one tablet of curcuminoid extract 250 mg four times a day on postoperative days 1-3. Pain was evaluated at 24 and 72 h postoperatively using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Results and Conclusion: The mean VAS scores at 24 h after surgery were 4.9 in the experimental group and 4.3 in the control group. Hence, the results did not significantly differ (p = 0.129). The mean VAS scores at 72 h after surgery were 1.8 in the experimental group and 2.8 in the control group (p = 0.001). The side effects in both groups were similar.

The density functional theory (DFT) and experiments were used to study the promotional effects of third metals promoters: Re, Rh, and Nb in WOx doped Pt-based catalysts that withstand deactivation via metal leaching, sintering, and coking. The third metal promoter improves catalytic activity and 1,3PDO selectivity due to increased electron density at the Pt active site confirmed by DFT. However, improved stability was found only on re- and Rh-promoted systems, evident from sustained activity and selectivity of spent catalysts. The deactivation study revealed that Pt leaching was negligible in all cases. Still, W leaching is more concerned and can be reduced only by Re and Nb promoters, whereas Pt sintering can be prevented only in the case of Re promoter. Mitigation of coking can be realized from DFT that only the Re promoter has comparable electron donor property to Pt and can prevent active site blockage by shifting the preferable coke adsorption site from Pt to a promoter atom, as also confirmed by the lowest amount of type I coke measured by the thermal gravimetric analysis leading to a high product yield.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Objective: This study analyzed health risks due to As exposure through rice consumption, focusing on both bioaccessible (bAs) and total (tAs) As levels. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were applied to determine health risk uncertainties and to analyze factors influencing health risks. Results: Cooked white and brown rice contained lower tAs and bAs than FAO/WHO standards of 0.20 and 0.35 mg/kg, respectively. As became less bioaccessible after cooking (14.0% in white rice and 18.5% in brown rice). Non-carcinogenic effects (MOS < 1) were found in 5% of children. Carcinogenic effects (MOE<100), especially lung cancer, were found in 75% of adults, with a probable incidence of 7 in 1,000,000. The lowest and highest annual cancer cases were 18 in 10,000,000 adolescents and 15 in 1,000,000 adults, respectively. The risks were mainly affected by body weight and bAs concentration. Significance: The results identified a certain risk level of non-carcinogenic effects in children and adolescents as well as carcinogenic effects in adults. The per capita consumption of rice in Thai adults should be reduced to prevent incidences of lung cancer.

The effects of Ag@Fe3O4 content on properties of coated paper were investigated. The overall properties of coated paper improved when the Ag@Fe3O4 content increased up to 0.15%w/v. An increase in tensile strength of 154.01% and a decrease in water vapor permeability of 48.50% were found in coated paper with 0.15%w/v Ag@Fe3O4. Furthermore, the coated paper also exhibited the synergistic effect on antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The release of metal ions in food simulants and kinetic release parameters were also studied. The release of silver ions and ferrous ions in food simulants met the requirement of overall migration limit of the European Standard. The paper coated with 0.15%w/v Ag@Fe3O4 had better capabilities to maintain quality and extend shelf-life of tomatoes. The obtained Ag@Fe3O4 coated paper is promising for bioactive food packaging to retain food freshness.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

When the obtained composite was extruded below the melting point of PVA, the fibers became oriented toward the flow direction. The PVA demonstrated marked nucleating activity with regard to PP crystallization, which was further promoted by enlargement of the surface area by fibrillization. As a result, there was virtually no orientation relaxation of the PP chains with an increase in crystallinity, which explains the improvement in rigidity of the reinforced composite.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The application of natural compounds that can increase the ability of dermal fibroblasts to counteract oxidative stress is a promising approach to promote skin health and beauty. Eriodictyol is a flavonoid that exerts several pharmacological actions through its antioxidant properties. However, its protective effects on dermal fibroblasts have not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether eriodictyol protects human dermal fibroblasts (BJ fibroblasts) from the harmful effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Eriodictyol pretreatment significantly prevented necrotic cell death caused by H2O2 exposure. In addition, the level of 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein oxidation was decreased, and that of glutathione was maintained, indicating that the beneficial effects of eriodictyol against H2O2 were closely associated with oxidative-stress attenuation. Eriodictyol mediates its antioxidant effects on dermal fibroblasts against H2O2 through (i) the direct neutralization of reactive oxygen species; (ii) the enhancement of the activities of H2O2-detoxifying enzymes, including catalase and glutathione peroxidase; and (iii) the induction of the expressions of catalase and glutathione peroxidase 1 via the activation of the Nrf2 signaling system.

In this study, we investigated the effects of COS on the prevention of obesity-related complications and its ability to confer renoprotection in a prediabetic model. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and kidney dysfunction. COS intervention successfully ameliorated these conditions (p < 0.05) by attenuating intestinal lipid absorption and the renal inflammation-autophagy-apoptosis axis. A novel anti-inflammatory effect of COS had been demonstrated by the strengthening of intestinal barrier integrity via calcium-sensing receptor (p < 0.05).

While a few studies have shown associations between AKD and the risk of adverse outcomes, there is still a lack of evidence from resource-limited settings. Methods: All hospitalized patients at the study hospital during 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis of AKI, AKD, and CKD was based on the diagnostic algorithm proposed by KDIGO. Patients were followed up for 2 years to determine their risks of mortality, development of CKD, and progression of pre-existing CKD. Results: A total of 9800 patients were included in the analysis, 26.1% of whom had pre-existing CKD, while AKD without AKI was found in 8% and 7% of individuals with and without pre-existing CKD, respectively.

An Integrated Reinforcement Learning and Centralized Programming Approach for Online Taxi Dispatching,"Liang E., Wen K., Lam W.H.K., Sumalee A., Zhong R.",2022-09-01,"Adaptive explorations, Markov Decision Processes, Scalable approach, State-value functions, Stochastic traffic, System constraints, Temporal difference learning, Vehicle dispatching, Deep reinforcement learning (RL), multiagent system, online vehicle routing, stochastic network traffic, vehicle dispatching","Balancing the supply and demand for ride-sourcing companies is a challenging issue, especially with real-time requests and stochastic traffic conditions of large-scale congested road networks. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a robust and scalable approach that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and a centralized programming (CP) structure to promote real-time taxi operations. Both real-time order matching decisions and vehicle relocation decisions at the microscopic network scale are integrated within a Markov decision process framework. The RL component learns the decomposed state-value function, which represents the taxi drivers' experience, the off-line historical demand pattern, and the traffic network congestion. The CP component plans nonmyopic decisions for drivers collectively under the prescribed system constraints to explicitly realize cooperation. Furthermore, to circumvent sparse reward and sample imbalance problems over the microscopic road network, this article proposed a temporal-difference learning algorithm with prioritized gradient descent and adaptive exploration techniques. A simulator is built and trained with the Manhattan road network and New York City yellow taxi data to simulate the real-time vehicle dispatching environment. Both centralized and decentralized taxi dispatching policies are examined with the simulator. This case study shows that the proposed approach can further improve taxi drivers' profits while reducing customers' waiting times compared to several existing vehicle dispatching algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence"
Electrospun Poly(lactic acid) and Silk Fibroin Based Nanofibrous Scaffold for Meniscus Tissue Engineering,"Promnil S., Ruksakulpiwat C., Numpaisal P.-O., Ruksakulpiwat Y.",2022-06-01,"Cell viability, Degradability, Electrospuns, Genes expression, In-vitro, PLLA, Pure PLLA, Silk fibroin, Solution viscosity, Tissues engineerings, cell viability, electrospinning, gene expression, PLA, silk fibroin, tissue engineering","Biopolymer based scaffolds are commonly considered as suitable materials for medical application. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most popular polymers that has been used as a bioscaffold, but it has poor cell adhesion and slowly degrades in an in vitro environment. In this study, silk fibroin (SF) was selected to improve cell adhesion and degradability of electrospun PLA. In order to fabricate a PLA/SF scaffold that offered both biological and mechanical properties, related parameters such as solution viscosity and SF content were studied. By varying the concentration and molecular weight of PLA, the solution viscosity significantly changed. The effect of solution viscosity on the fiber forming ability and fiber morphology was elucidated. In addition, commercial (L-lactide, D-lactide PLA) and medical grade PLA (pure PLLA) were both investigated. Mechanical properties, thermal properties, biodegradability, wettability, cell viability, and gene expression of electrospun PLA and PLA/SF based nanofibrous scaffolds were examined. The results demonstrated that medical grade PLA electrospun scaffolds offered superior mechanical property, degradability, and cellular induction for meniscus tissue regeneration. However, for commercial non-medical grade PLA used in this study, it was not recommended to be used for medical application because of its toxicity. With the addition of SF in PLA based scaffolds, the in vitro degradability and hydrophilicity were improved. PLAmed50:SF50 scaffold has the potential to be used as biomimetic meniscus scaffold for scaffold augmented suture based on mechanical properties, cell viability, gene expression, surface wettability, and in vitro degradation.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Medial thickening of the pulmonary artery is a common histopathological change in PH. The cause of medial thickening could be a decrease in apoptosis of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This study aimed to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the pulmonary artery of dogs with PH secondary to DMVD (DMVD+PH) compared with DMVD without PH (DMVD) and healthy dogs (control). Lung samples were collected from three groups, including the control (n = 5), DMVD (n = 7) and DMVD+PH (n = 7) groups. Masson trichrome, α-SMA and apoptotic proteins including Bax, Bcl2 and caspase-3 and -8 were stained. The results showed that the percentage of medial thickness (%MT) and the average number of pulmonary arterial SMCs were greater in the DMVD and DMVD+PH groups than in the control group, and they were greatest in the DMVD+PH group. Bax, Bcl2, and caspase-3 and -8 were mainly expressed in the medial layer of the pulmonary artery. The percentage of Bax and caspase-3 and -8 positive cells was higher in the DMVD group than in the DMVD+PH group, whereas the percentage of Bcl2 positive cells was increased in the DMVD+PH group. These results suggested that the pro-apoptotic activity of pulmonary arterial SMCs occurred mainly in the DMVD group and decreased dramatically in the DMVD+PH group. In conclusion, an increase in medial thickness in dogs with PH secondary to DMVD may relate to a decrease in pro-apoptotic activity of pulmonary arterial SMCs.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

The high-temperature and ambient extractions with a shaker provided no difference (p ≥ 0.05) in phenolic and flavonoid content. The HPLC analysis of SCS extracts illustrated gallic acid as the main component. The extract demonstrated a bactericidal effect against Escherichia coli at 6.25 mg ml−1. Mint leaves were found to carry high number of total viable count (TVC) and E. coli. The leaves soaked in acetic acid (AA) demonstrated a reduction of microbial number, but dark spot defect was found. Soaking in the mixture of 4.68 mg ml−1 SCS extract and 0.39 mg ml−1 AA caused the number of TVC and E. coli to reduce by 1.8 and 1.3 log10 CFUg−1, respectively, while black spot was not detected. Nine day storage leaves showed satisfactory level of microbial quality and fresh-liked appearance. This demonstrated the potential application of SCS extract with AA as a synthetic substitute for microbial control on fresh leaf vegetables.","mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Potential associations between body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL were also investigated. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 110 older adults who received prosthodontic treatment at the Dental Faculty Clinics at Chulalongkorn University. Participants were categorized according to their dental prostheses: complete denture (CD), removable partial denture (RPD) and fixed partial denture (FPD). Retention and stability of the RPD and CD were evaluated using the CU-modified Kapur and the modified NHANES III criteria to classify denture quality into acceptable and unacceptable. Dental status including posterior occluding pairs and number of remaining natural teeth were assessed intraorally. Dependent variables were body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL. Body composition, including muscle mass (kg), bone mass (kg), basal metabolic rate (kcal) and visceral fat (%) were determined through a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Masticatory performance was assessed using a multiple sieve method of peanut mastication. OHRQoL was assessed using the validated Thai version of Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (Thai-OIDP) index. After adjusting for covariates, including age and sex, the associations between oral and dental prosthesis status and body composition, masticatory performance as well as OIDP score were analyzed using multivariable linear and negative binomial regression analyses. Spearman’s correlation was used to determine the potential associations between body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL. Results: The presence of fewer natural teeth or wearing an unacceptable removable denture were factors associated with lower bone mass, muscle mass and basal metabolic rate, and with a higher visceral fat. Similar dental and removable denture status were also associated with larger peanut particle size and higher OIDP score. Masticatory performance and OHRQoL variables were moderately correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.44). However, body composition was not correlated with masticatory performance or OHRQoL. Conclusions: In individuals wearing dental prostheses, factors such as severity of tooth loss, types, and quality of dental prostheses, particularly retention and stability, negatively impacted not only masticatory function and OHRQoL, but also their overall body composition and health.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the impact of acemannan in guided bone regeneration (GBR) with simultaneous implant placement. Twenty patients were randomly allocated to a test group (deproteinized bovine bone with particulate acemannan (mean size 32.45 μm)) and a control group (deproteinized bovine bone only). Twenty implants were placed with simultaneous GBR. Radiographic measurements were conducted on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans immediately post-surgery and at 3 and 6 months. Vertical and horizontal dimensions of the buccal bone were measured at the implant platform (0) and at points 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm apically. The dimensional reduction of vertical and horizontal buccal bone was significantly smaller in the test group at 3 months postoperative (P < 0.05) at every position measured (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 mm), but the difference was not statistically significant at 6 months. Acemannan was found to be a safe and predictable biomaterial for GBR, which resulted in enhanced dimensional stability of the regenerated tissue at 3 months. However, these results were not replicated at 6 months. Further studies are required to document the long-term efficacy and potential of acemannan use as a supplement in bone regeneration.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

The T1-Al3+ complex was studied as a Cu2+ selective sensor due to its highly efficient capacibility of paramagnetic quenching. The results showed that the T1-Al3+ complexed sensor possesses remarkable sensitivity and selectivity for Cu2+ ion in 8% propylene glycol in 10 mM HEPES pH 5.5 as compared with other tested analytes. Notably, this sensor has a broad linear detection range of 10–110 µM for Cu2+ ion and a detection limit level of 0.62 µM, which is lower than the Cu2+ concentration threshold in drinking water designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Additionally, it was detectable for the presence of Cu2+ ion in mineral water and tap water samples. The selectivity of T1-Al3+ complexed sensor with Cu2+ ion could be explained by the basis of computation with Gaussian software complied with the basis sets of B3LYP/6-31 G(d,p)/LANL2DZ.

The results showed that HMGB1 and DKK1 are higher in T2DM irrespective of hypertension. A large part of the variance in the β-cell index and glucose toxicity was explained by the combined effects of HMGB1 and DKK1. In conclusion, both HMGB1 and DKK1 may contribute to increased atherogenicity in T2DM. Moreover, both biomarkers may cause more deficits in β-cell function and increase glucose toxicity leading to the development of more inflammation and diabetic complications.

In gait rehabilitation, active body weight support systems are often needed to guarantee the safety of patients. These support systems are required to operate at two distinct operation points: A high-force operating mode to hold a patient and prevent falls and, conversely, a ""transparent mode""that reduces the mechanical impedance of high-force actuators to enable patients, even those who are weak or paralyzed, to easily express movement. However, the ability to deliver high forces and easily manipulate robots is a key challenge in improving the force-based interaction control. Force feedback is an effective approach to reduce the inertia and friction of robots, but stability is paramount particularly when interacting with humans. By modeling the environment as a second-order spring-mass-damper system and considering the phase response, we derived the control parameter gains required to guarantee a stable human-robot interaction. The design of actuators with intrinsically adjustable mechanical properties is a complementary strategy. For instance, the stiffness of actuators can be modulated by adjusting the unsupported length of a cantilever leaf spring. To model the spring stiffness under deflection, an ideal cantilever support model cannot be assumed for a conventional design of a slider with dual roller pairs, particularly with a soft spring. We proposed a beam deflection model considering the non-zero slopes at the contact points between the rollers and spring. The spring parameters were determined to attain the desired range of stiffness with a short traveling distance of the adjuster. For a single degree-offreedom (DOF) linear motion, we investigated a macro-mini actuation concept using an electrorheological-fluid brake. Balancing these conflicting requirements between the driving force generated from the non-backdrivable high-force unit and the low-inertia and low-friction unit was achieved by controlling the electrical field affecting the fluid yield stress between the rotor and stator electrodes of the brake. One of the limitations of the feedback control scheme was noisy force sensors. We discuss our novel proximity and force sensor using optical techniques and conclude with a description of low-profile 3-DOF flat motor.","fluid mechanics, engineering, energy","Automotive Engineering, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

DESIGN: For the study of efficacy, mice were divided into seven groups: sham; inflammation; and cannabidiol 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg. For the study of mechanisms of cannabidiol, mice were divided into six groups: sham, inflammation, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist with and without cannabidiol, and vanilloid receptor 1 antagonist with and without cannabidiol. Spontaneous pain-like behaviors, trigeminal nociception, and trigeminal modulating activity were investigated. RESULTS: CFA injected in the right masseter muscle significantly induced spontaneous pain-like behaviors and the trigeminal nociceptive pathway. This effect was inhibited by injection of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg of cannabidiol. The 50 % inhibitory concentration of cannabidiol on antinociception was found to be 3 mg/kg. In addition, there was no difference in spontaneous pain-like behaviors with vanilloid receptor 1 antagonist injected before treatment with cannabidiol compared to saline control. Reduced c-fos expression was observed in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and periaqueductal gray in the group injected with CGRP antagonist before treatment with cannabidiol. CONCLUSION: The antinociceptive effects of cannabidiol induced by acute orofacial nociception is mediated by vanilloid receptor 1 but not by CGRP. Cannabidiol can act with peripheral nonpeptidergic neurons and can be used as an alternative drug or as a synergistic medication in pain treatment.","medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

The use of 3D printing is presented in relation to laboratory testing of controlled substrate variables including the impact of ceramic firing temperature, component wall thickness, three types of geometry for exploring cell growth, surface patterns to investigate cell migration, internal chamber subdivisions and clay type. The experiments reveal the benefits and limitations of creating micro-ecologies for algae growth through the introduction of geometry variation. In this study, the natural organismal sensing abilities are explored as a means for cell distribution.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Architecture
Shear Stress Enhances the Paracrine-Mediated Immunoregulatory Function of Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells via the ERK Signalling Pathway,"Suwittayarak R., Klincumhom N., Ngaokrajang U., Namangkalakul W., Ferreira J.N., Pavasant P., Osathanon T.",2022-07-01,"Cell Differentiation, Cell Proliferation, Cells, Cultured, Humans, Kynurenine, Osteogenesis, Periodontal Ligament, Stem Cells, IDO, immunosuppression, mechanotransduction, periodontal ligament stem cells, shear stress, T cells, TGF-β1","Relevant immunomodulatory effects have been proposed following allogeneic cell-based therapy with human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs). This study aimed to examine the influence of shear stress on the immunosuppressive capacity of hPDLSCs. Cells were subjected to shear stress at different magnitudes (0.5, 5 and 10 dyn/cm2). The expression of immunosuppressive markers was evaluated in shear stress-induced hPDLSCs using qRT-PCR, western blot, enzyme activity and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effects of a shear stress-derived condition medium (SS-CM) on T cell proliferation were examined using a resazurin assay. Treg differentiation was investigated using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis. Our results revealed that shear stress increased mRNA expression of IDO and COX2 but not TGF-β1 and IFN-γ. IDO activity, kynurenine and active TGF-β1 increased in SS-CM when compared to the non-shear stress-derived conditioned medium (CTL-CM). The amount of kynurenine in SS-CM was reduced in the presence of cycloheximide and ERK inhibitor. Subsequently, T cell proliferation decreased in SS-CM compared to CTL-CM. Treg differentiation was promoted in SS-CM, indicated by FOXP3, IL-10 expression and CD4+CD25hi CD127lo/− subpopulation. In conclusion, shear stress promotes kynurenine production through ERK signalling in hPDLSC, leading to the inhibition of T cell proliferation and the promotion of Treg cell differentiation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

These include increased balance between generation and demand, improvement in power quality, flattening PV intermittence, frequency, and voltage regulation in Microgrid (MG) operation. Ideally, HESS has one storage is dedicated for high energy storage (HES) and another storage for high power storage (HPS) purpose. HES is used to fulfill long-term energy demand, while HPS is used to handle power transients and fast load fluctuations. This paper examines HESS comprehensively for PV power generation and focuses on its ability to combine two storage technologies. The two storage technologies include high energy and high power. This paper also analyzes the important aspects of advance HESS in PV power generation in the context of capacity sizing, power converter topology and strategies management energy. Several capacity sizing methods were critically reviewed and tabulated. Power converter (PC) topologies are classified and briefly discussed regarding their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, energy management strategies with various control techniques are critically classified and evaluated for better future direction. In addition, the implementation of HESS on PV power generation in current real projects is presented and evaluated. Finally, this paper can be considered as useful guide for the use of HESS in PV power generation including features, limitations, and real applications.","power genergyation and power plants, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Effect of the composition stoichiometry and salt on the ammonia sensing properties of curcumin-loaded polyelectrolyte complex membranes,"Saikaew R., Dubas S.T.",2022-06-01,"Colorimetric indicator, Non-stoichiometric, Optical detection, Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate), Polyelectrolyte complexes, Reversible colors, Sensing applications, Ammonia (NH3) indicator, Curcumin, Moisture content, Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs), Stoichiometry","Nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) membranes loaded with natural colorimetric indicator 1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (curcumin, Cur) were used as visual detectors for ammonia (NH3) vapors. PEC membranes were fabricated by the co-precipitation of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and anionic poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) using NaCl as a plasticizer followed by centrifugation and compression molding into 120-micron sheets. The polymer complex (PEC) was prepared using various molar ratios of PDADMAC and PSS [P+]/[P−] of [2:1], [1:1] and [1:2] which color response when exposed to ammonia vapor shifted from yellow to orange-red. The fast color change was clearly observed by naked eyes and confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. The main finding of this paper is that the PDADMAC-rich membrane with a [P+]/[P−] of [2:1] displayer better NH3 sensing and that different salts used in the processing of the PEC can improve the sensitivity of the sensors by increasing the moist content in the membranes. The reversible color change to yellow was possible at ambient temperature when the ammonia vapor was removed making these sensors reusable. These Cur-PEC membranes could be used in sensing applications to monitor the release of NH3 gas from industrial sites by optical detection.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine-bed PICUs at university referral hospital. PATIENTS: Children (30 d to 15 yr) with septic shock and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)-2 score greater than or equal to 10 or Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) 3 score greater than or equal to 15, who were also receiving at least one inotrope. INTERVENTION: Patients received 2-4 hour treatment with PMX-DHP 20R column on 2 consecutive days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We enrolled six children aged 21-167 months old (median, 99-mo old), with a body weight of 10-50 kg (median, 28 kg). All six patients had both PELOD-2 greater than or equal to 10 and PRISM-3 greater than or equal to 15, required invasive mechanical ventilation, and received standard treatment for septic shock before enrollment. We observed significant improvement in PELOD-2 score from baseline to 72 hours after the start of PMX-DHP (mean [95% CI] from 14.3 [12.2-16.5] to 6.0 [0.3-11.7]; p = 0.006). The vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) and lactate concentration also significantly decreased from baseline to 72 hours (VIS, 60 mmol/L [25-95 mmol/L] to 4.0 mmol/L [44.1-12 mmol/L]; p = 0.003; lactate, 2.4 mmol/L [1.0-3.8 mmol/L] to 1.0 mmol/L [0.5-1.5 mmol/L]; p = 0.01). Five of six patients survived. There was no device-related adverse event in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of treatment with PMX-DHP as adjunctive therapy in children with refractory septic shock and high baseline severity, we have shown that patient recruitment is feasible. We have also found that clinical hemodynamic and severity of illness scores at 72 hours may be potential end points for testing in future randomized controlled trials.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

These led to the approach using immunosuppressive agents. It is intriguing whether certain biomarkers can aid the proper administration of such drugs. Methods: Plasma specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients with differing severity, from very mild illness (group A), mild (group B), moderate (group C), and severe/critical illness (group D) were assayed for cyto-chemokines and terminal complement complex (SC5b-9) during the course of diseases. None received anti-IL-6 therapy, there was no mortality in this cohort. Results: IP-10 and RANTES levels were dominant cytokines. IP-10 levels increased significantly in all groups when compared between pre-nadir and nadir phases (group A, p =0.428; group B =0.034; group C =0.159; group D <0.001) and in groups B and D when compared between nadir and recovery phases (p <0.001). RANTES levels were elevated in all groups across all phases with no significant differences. SC5b-9 levels increased significantly as compared to healthy controls [pre-nadir- group A versus healthy, p =0.122; group B-D versus healthy, p =0.021); nadir-group A versus healthy, p =0.003; group B-D versus healthy, p <0.001; recovery phase (p <0.001)] but not between groups A and B-D at pre-nadir (p=0.606). Conclusion: The absence of significant pro-inflammatory responses and early elevation of IP-10 levels and complement activation may be favorable and necessary for viral elimination in COVID-19 patients. Expression of distinct cyto-chemokines during each clinical phase may be useful for guiding proper therapeutic interventions on alleviating thrombo-inflammation responses to COVID-19 infection.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

The selective catalytic oxidation of H2S to S is the most promising way to eliminate H2S from biogas due to the lack of effluents, therefore can be considered a green technology. The most extensively used catalysts for H2S selective oxidation can be classified in two groups: metal oxide-based catalysts, including vanadium and iron oxides, and carbon-based catalysts. Numerous studies have been devoted to studying their different catalytic performances. For industrial applications, the most suitable catalysts should be less sensitive to the operating parameters like the temperature, O2/H2S ratio, and H2O content. More specifically, for metal oxides and carbon-based catalysts, the temperature and O2/H2S ratio have a similar effect on the conversion and selectivity, but carbon-based catalysts are less sensitive to water in all operating conditions.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The results show that they spent most of their time in the sit/stand posture; they tossed and turned during naps and sleep. Both groups showed a similar pattern of activities: the higher level of sedentary behavior is related to a longer sleep duration. Sedentary behavior and naps increased the number of toss-and-turns at night; toss-and-turns did not affect sleep duration.

Therefore, healthcare systems utilize the convergence power and traffic analysis of sensors that cannot be satisfactorily handled by the IoT. In this article, a novel mutation operator is devised and incorporated with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Two tests have been conducted in the validation process. Firstly, the newly dual adaption-based operators incorporated with the differential evolution algorithm are being proposed. The proposed approach provides sufficient diversity and enhances the search speed of nature's local and global search environments in the problem. The proposed method incorporates the application of IoT-based smart healthcare. Second, an application-based test has been conducted, in which the proposed approach is applied to the application in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, IoT sensor deployment is an optimization problem to minimize service time, delay, and energy loss by considering the communication constraint between sensors(objects). The proposed algorithm is applied in this article to solve this optimization problem. Further, in the experimentation and comparative study, the proposed method is superior to the standard evolutionary algorithms in IoT applications concerning the minimum number of function evaluations and minimization of traffic services. The proposed approach also achieves efficiency in the minimum loss of energy in each service and reduces load and delay.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

Ground cornsilk (CS) was classified into sizes ranging from smaller than 45 to 300 µm and was added to rice flour (RF) at different concentrations (5 to 20% by weight). The RF-CS composite samples were analyzed for chemical, physical, and functional properties. The RF-CS composite flour samples had higher protein and fiber contents and showed higher water-binding capacity than the RF sample but lower swelling power at 90 °C. Lower solubility was observed when CS particles smaller than 125 µm were added. Adding large CS particles (>150 µm) caused the average pasting temperature of RF-CS to increase but reduced peak viscosity, breakdown, and setback significantly at all addition levels. The addition of smaller-sized CS particles (<125 µm) reduced peak viscosity significantly from the 10% addition level onwards but tended to increase the breakdown and setback viscosity. RF-CS composite paste had decreasing gel strength with increasing CS addition level. Lower gel syneresis after several freeze-thaw cycles was noted when adding CS. A more significant reduction in flour gel syneresis was observed with the addition of CS smaller than 75 µm. Cornsilk particle is a potential flour additive to increase protein and fiber content. Due to the ability to reduce syneresis, cornsilk particles could be used to produce a high amylose flour gel that can withstand freeze-thaw cycles.","chemistry, Materials Science","Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics"

We aimed to determine the impact of VET-guided strategy on postprocedural bleeding, periprocedural transfusion rates and quantities, transfusion-related adverse events (TRAEs), lengths of stay (LOS) and mortality from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cirrhotic patients. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for RCTs comparing VET-guided with SCT-guided transfusion in cirrhotic adults undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy, liver transplantation or other invasive interventions. Using random-effects models, the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and/or mean differences (MDs) of postprocedural bleeding-free events and the other outcomes were estimated alongside 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of seven included RCTs (n = 421; 72.2% men; mean age 49.1 years), VET-guided transfusion did not change postprocedural bleeding-free statuses (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94–1.17). However, VET-based algorithms decreased the rates of fresh frozen plasma (FFP; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35–0.77) and platelet transfusions (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.16–0.73), the quantities of transfused FFP (MD −1.39 units; 95% CI −2.18 to −0.60), platelets (MD −1.06 units; 95% CI −2.01 to −0.12) and cryoprecipitate (MD −7.13 units; 95% CI −14.20 to −0.07) and the risk of TRAEs (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.27–0.65).

The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) increases with age. This study examined the impact of MSDs and NCDs on work ability, using the work ability index (WAI), among aging office workers (between 45 and 60 years old) and determined factors associated with WAI scores. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in office workers from 27 government offices in Bangkok and nearby provinces using an online questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test and a multivariable logistic regression model. Results. Of 689 workers (452 females and 237 males), 34, 13, 12 and 41% reported MSDs, NCDs, MSDs + NCDs and no MSDs/NCDs, respectively, in the past year. Median scores (interquartile range) of WAI were 37.0 (6) for MSDs, 37.0 (4) for NCDs, 34.5 (6) for MSDs + NCDs and 40.0 (4) for no MSDs/NCDs. Significant difference in WAI scores was found between the MSDs and MSDs + NCDs groups (p = 0.005); and between the NCDs and MSDs + NCDs groups (p < 0.001). Female, high work experience and low job control were significantly associated with reduced WAI scores (WAI ≤ 36). Conclusion. The presence of MSDs or NCDs reduced work ability among aging office workers compared to their healthy counterparts.

In Avicennia alba plantations in central Thailand, we investigated the vegetation structures (trees, seedlings, pneumatophores, and belowground roots), sedimentation rates, and elevation changes over one year across the shore. The results showed a heterogeneous vegetation structure with an increasing tree basal area (BA) and seedling density towards the interior. The pneumatophore quantitative characteristics decreased towards the interior in association with the topographic gradient and inundation period. The sedimentation rates, which were greater in the plantation than on the mudflat, showed a negative correlation with the height, total surface area, and total volume of the pneumatophores. This indicates that the pneumatophores facilitated the transportation of fine sediments into the interior. Our results suggest that an optimal complexity of the aboveground vegetation structure might enhance the sedimentation rates. According to the gradient of tree BA and seedling density, the fine root density increased towards the interior. The monthly elevation changes in the plantation showed less fluctuation than those on the mudflat. The net elevation changes indicated sediment accretion within the plantation and erosion on the mudflat. Our results demonstrate the synergetic roles of mangrove plantations in which the aboveground structures facilitate sediment redeposition and the belowground roots stabilize sediment accretion in coastal areas.","wetlands and estuaries, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Forestry

The PVA-added methanogenic reactor exhibited stable operation performance and offered a relatively low volatile fatty acid concentration effluent with a higher COD removal than the system without PVA addition. The predominant microbial communities in both methanogenic reactors were similar and were assigned to the genus Methanosaeta, followed by Clostridia, which was the predominant genus in the hydrolytic reactor. Ultrafiltration in the PVA-added system offered higher effluent quality and lower fouling resistance. The system was able to operate with hydraulically removable fouling, without any chemical cleaning requirements; however, an elevated flux caused the system to suffer from hydraulically irreversible fouling. PVA beads exhibit their structural stability over long-term operation.","geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

However, it remains to be understood how systematic these findings are. Studies often lack homogeneity in the sample selection, target discontinuous areas with inhomogeneous sensitivities, and suer from modest uv coverage coming from single array configurations. GOODS-ALMA is a 1.1mm galaxy survey over a continuous area of 72.42 arcmin2 at a homogeneous sensitivity. In this version 2.0, we present a new low resolution dataset and its combination with the previous high resolution dataset from the survey, improving the uv coverage and sensitivity reaching an average of = 68:4 Jy beam 1. A total of 88 galaxies are detected in a blind search (compared to 35 in the high resolution dataset alone), 50% at S=Npeak 5 and 50% at 3:5 S=Npeak 5 aided by priors. Among them, 13 out of the 88 are optically dark or faint sources (H- or K-band dropouts). The sample dust continuum sizes at 1.1mm are generally compact, with a median eective radius of Re = 0: 0010 0: 0005 (a physical size of Re = 0:73 0:29 kpc at the redshift of each source). Dust continuum sizes evolve with redshift and stellar mass resembling the trends of the stellar sizes measured at optical wavelengths, albeit a lower normalization compared to those of late-type galaxies. We conclude that for sources with flux densities S 1:1mm > 1 mJy, compact dust continuum emission at 1.1mm prevails, and sizes as extended as typical star-forming stellar disks are rare. The S 1:1mm < 1 mJy sources appear slightly more extended at 1.1 mm, although they are still generally compact below the sizes of typical star-forming stellar disks.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

A suitable hydrogel material was fabricated by thoroughly mixing bacterial cellulose-chitosan slurry (BCC) with the mixed solution of alginate and gelatin (AG) at the weight ratio of BCC:AG at 80:20 and crosslinking in the aqueous solution of 1% (w/v) calcium chloride (CaCl2). Results from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed some interactions among bacterial cellulose, chitosan, alginate and gelatin. The composite scaffolds exhibited good three-dimensional (3D) architecture with the average pore diameter of the outer surface and interior at 45.0 and 326.6 µm, respectively. The BCC-AG scaffolds presented many desirable properties, such as good compressive strength, stability and excellent biocompatibility. For the study of tissue engineered constructs, the mixture of mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the hydrogel was transferred into 24-well plate, cross-linked with 1% (w/v) CaCl2 and cultured in chondrogenic medium. The hydrogel scaffold was shown to support the cell proliferation, with the accumulation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen at 6.26% and 6.71%ww, respectively after 42 days of incubation. The results indicated that BCC-AG scaffolds have the potential use as scaffolds for application in cartilage tissue engineering.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, environmental, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Biomedical Engineering"
Extracellular Matrix Derived From Dental Pulp Stem Cells Promotes Mineralization,"Nowwarote N., Petit S., Ferre F.C., Dingli F., Laigle V., Loew D., Osathanon T., Fournier B.P.J.",2022-01-27,"Cell differentiation, Decellularization, Dental pulp stem cells, Extracellular matrices, Extracellular matrix protein, Gingival fibroblasts, Growth medium, Mineralisation, Osteogenic differentiation, Physiological process, decellularization, dental pulp stem cells, extracellular matrix, gingival fibroblasts, osteogenic differentiation","Background: Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in many physiological processes. ECM macromolecules and associated factors differ according to tissues, impact cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Dental pulp ECM may differ from other oral tissues and impact mineralization. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the matrisome of ECM proteins derived from human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and its ability to regulate mineralization even in cells which do not respond to assaults by mineralization, the human gingival fibroblasts (GF). Methods: ECM were extracted from DPSCs cultured in normal growth medium supplemented with L-ascorbic acid (N-ECM) or in osteogenic induction medium (OM-ECM). ECM decellularization (dECM) was performed using 0.5% triton X-100 in 20 mM ammonium hydroxide after 21 days. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis identified and quantified matrisome proteins. Results: The dECM contained ECM proteins but lacked cellular components and mineralization. Interestingly, collagens (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) and elastic fibers (FBN1, FBLN2, FN1, and HSPG2) were significantly represented in N-ECM, while annexins (ANXA1, ANXA4, ANXA5, ANXA6, ANXA7, and ANXA11) were significantly overdetected in OM-ECM. GF were reseeded on N-dECM and OM-dECM and cultured in normal or osteogenic medium. GF were able to attach and proliferate on N-dECM and OM-dECM. Both dECM enhanced mineralization of GF at day 14 compared to tissue culture plate (TCP). In addition, OM-dECM promoted higher mineralization of GF than N-dECM although cultured in growth medium. Conclusions: ECM derived from DPSCs proved to be osteoinductive, and this knowledge supported cell-derived ECM can be further utilized for tissue engineering of mineralized tissues.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"
HMGB1 mediates invasion and PD-L1 expression through RAGE-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,"Amornsupak K., Thongchot S., Thinyakul C., Box C., Hedayat S., Thuwajit P., Eccles S.A., Thuwajit C.",2022-12-01,"B7-H1 Antigen, Breast Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Movement, Female, HMGB1 Protein, Humans, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products, Signal Transduction, Breast cancer, HMGB1, Invasion, Migration, PD-L1, PI3K-AKT, RAGE","Background: High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is increased in breast cancer cells as the result of exposure to the secreted substances from cancer-associated fibroblasts and plays a crucial role in cancer progression and drug resistance. Its effect, however, on the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in breast cancer cells has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of HMGB1 through receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on cell migration/invasion and PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cells. Methods: A 3-dimensional (3-D) migration and invasion assay and Western blotting analysis to evaluate the function and the mechanism under recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) treatment with knockdown of RAGE using shRAGE and PI3K/AKT inhibitors was performed. Results: The results revealed that rHMGB1 induced MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion. The knockdown of RAGE using shRAGE and PI3K/AKT inhibitors attenuated 3-D migration and invasion in response to rHMGB1 compared to mock cells. PD-L1 up-regulation was observed in both parental MDA-MB-231 (P) and MDA-MB-231 metastasis to bone marrow (BM) cells treated with rHMGB1, and these effects were alleviated in RAGE-knock down (KD) breast cancer cells as well as in PI3K/AKT inhibitor-treated cells. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings indicate that HMGB1-RAGE through PI3K/AKT signaling promotes not only breast cancer cell invasion but also PD-L1 expression which leads to the destruction of the effector T cells. The attenuating HMGB1-RAGE-PI3K/AKT pathway may help to attenuate breast cancer cell aggressive phenotypes.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Genetics, Cancer Research"

Among several attempts, the promising nanoaggregate formation by γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) complexation of drugs in aqueous solution with or without water-soluble polymers was investigated. According to phase solubility studies, Soluplus® showed the highest complexation efficiency (CE) of drug/γCD complexes among the polymers tested. The aqueous solubility of IRB and CAC was markedly increased as a function of Soluplus® concentrations. The binary drug/γCD and ternary drug/γCD/Soluplus® complex formations were supported and confirmed by solid-state characterizations, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The true inclusion mode was also proved by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. The nanoaggregate size and morphology of binary and ternary systems were observed using dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The size of these nanocarriers depends on the concentration of Soluplus®.

The ICFB reactor column is separated into two sections (riser and downer) by baffles and is linked together via connecting ports. The solid particles are circulated in the ICFB reactor by unequal fluidizing velocities in the riser and downer sections. The solid particles in the downer section are operated with low fluidizing velocity in the bubbling fluidization regime. In the riser section, the solid particles are transferred to the downer section because of the high fluidizing velocity. In this study, the carbon dioxide reforming or dry reforming reaction of methane was investigated. Dry reforming is a reaction between carbon dioxide and methane, which are the major greenhouse gases, for producing syngas, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The hydrodynamics and dry reforming reaction with different reactor designs were explored using two-dimensional Eulerian–Eulerian computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD). The ICFB reactor with no elevation gas distributor, 90 cm of draft tube height, 2 cm of loop-seal length and 1 cm of gas outlet diameter gave the highest methane conversion of 15.4%. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the length of loop-seal and the gas outlet diameter gave substantial negative and positive effects on methane conversion, respectively. The interaction between length of loop-seal and gas outlet diameter also had a significant effect on the methane conversion. Although the ICFB reactor in this study gave the methane conversion slightly lower than referenced literature conventional CFB reactor, the ICFB reactor is the reactor that can reduce construction cost and simplify complex reactor operation.",energy,Energy (all)

PCBs consist of organic epoxy resins overlaid with valuable metals. The first step in recovering metals from waste PCBs is the removal of these resins. In this paper, autoclave-assisted alkaline pretreatment employing NaOH was used to remove resins from the PCBs. The process is shown to remove epoxy efficiently when conducted at 350 °C for 18 h using 0.8 mol·L−1 NaOH, 18 bar, and a liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 18 mL·g−1. After autoclaving, the solid-phase sample (autoclaved powder) was treated with a mixture of FeCl3 and HCl solutions – a process known as “FeH extraction” – to remove industrial metals. Under the optimal conditions (0.8 mol·L−1 FeCl3, 0.6 mol·L−1 HCl, L/S 24 mL·g−1, 50 °C, 100 min, 300 rpm), this process proved highly efficient in removing industrial metals. Following this treatment, a KClO3-HCl-CaCl2 extraction system was employed to extract gold from the FeH-extracted sample. With this system, a 99.5% gold extraction efficiency was achieved under the optimal conditions (0.55 mol·L−1 KClO3, 1.2 mol·L−1 HCl, 1.5 mol·L−1 CaCl2, 60 °C, 80 min, L/S 12 mL·g−1, 350 rpm). Gold ions (AuCl4−) in the extracted solution were subsequently recovered by using hydroquinone as a reducing agent to form gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with the assistance of NaOH. Finally, the AuNPs were stabilized using benzoquinone (an oxidized product of hydroquinone).","mixing and separation, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Further, tremor can appear in the same or a different body part than the dystonia. The aim of the current study was to better understand the differential pathophysiology of these tremors. We designed a cross-sectional case-control study and recruited 16 patients with essential tremor, 16 patients with dystonic tremor, and 17 age-matched healthy volunteers. We used multi-modal imaging combining resting-state functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We measured functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI to assess connectivity in the tremor network, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity with diffusion tensor imaging, and GABA+, Glutamate/Glutamine, Choline, and N-Acetylaspartate with spectroscopy (adjusted to Creatine). Our results showed reduced functional connectivity of resting-state fMRI between the cerebellum and dentate nucleus bilaterally for the essential tremor group, but not the dystonic tremor group, compared to healthy volunteers. There was higher fractional anisotropy in the middle cerebellar peduncle bilaterally for the dystonic tremor group compared to the essential tremor group as well as for essential tremor group compared to healthy volunteers. There was also higher fractional anisotropy in the red nucleus and corticospinal tract for essential tremor and dystonic tremor groups compared to healthy volunteers. We also showed reduced mean diffusivity in the cerebellum of both essential tremor and dystonic tremor groups compared to healthy volunteers. Finally, we found elevated GABA+/Cr in the cerebellum of the essential tremor and dystonic tremor groups compared to healthy volunteers, but no difference emerged between essential tremor and dystonic tremor groups. We did not find group differences in the other metabolites. Our results indicate cerebellar alterations in essential tremor and dystonic tremor patients compared to healthy volunteers, and further changes in the cerebellum network for the dystonic tremor patients. suggesting that the cerebellum is affected differently in both tremors.","medical, neuroscience","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Cognitive Neuroscience"

However, it is very challenging to recover biosurfactants from fermented broth as they are temperature-sensitive and present at dilute concentrations. This study aims to develop an alternative process that uses cloud point extraction (CPE) to recover lipopeptides biosurfactant from cell-free broth of Bacillus sp. GY19. The nonionic surfactant, Triton X-100, was selected as the aqueous-based solvent for CPE. Under the optimal conditions lipopeptides concentration in Triton X-100 was 23,000 mg/L, which is 14.8-folds higher than that in cell-free broth. Lipopeptides and Triton X-100 exerted a positive synergistic effect in reducing the critical micelle concentration of mixed micelles with a β value of −1.9. This could be considered a co-benefit of using CPE for biosurfactant recovery. Two techniques for back extraction of lipopeptides after the CPE process were proposed. Silica gel 60 selectively adsorbed Triton X-100 with 44% removal, while maintaining lipopeptides recovery at 86%. Cold acetone precipitation could remove 99% of Triton X-100 by precipitating lipopeptides. However, a 1%(w/v) SDS solution had to be used to re-solubilize the dehydrated lipopeptide.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the influence that business continuity narratives have had on how decisions and actions are undertaken to continue business after a flood disaster, and what long-term influence this has had, in turn, on the industrial complex area from integrated perspectives, especially applying the lessons learned. This research drew on insights from in-depth studies of Japanese enterprises to maximize the findings based on abundant field data: (1) disaster responses in the flood risk situation; (2) the challenges faced by enterprises in the area before, during and following the 2011 floods; and (3) lessons that led to new consideration for the flood risk in the areas following the 2011 flood. This study identified alternative narratives on the purpose and means of business continuity with implications for flood risk by constructing scenarios for practical use.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram‐negative bacteria and (1à3)‐β‐D‐glucan (BG) of fungi are the two most abundant gut microbial molecules. Due to limited data on the impact of intestinal fungi in CKD mouse models, the influences of gut fungi and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) on CKD were investigated using oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. At 16 weeks post‐5/6Nx, Candida‐5/6Nx mice demonstrated an increase in proteinuria, serum BG, serum cytokines (tumor necrotic factor‐α; TNF‐α and interleukin‐6), alanine transaminase (ALT), and level of fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria on fecal microbiome) when compared to non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. However, serum creatinine, renal fibrosis, or gut barrier defect (FITC‐dextran assay and endotoxemia) remained comparable between Candida‐ versus non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. The probiotics L34 attenuated several parameters in Candida‐5/6Nx mice, including fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria and Bacteroides), gut leakage (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐dextran), gut‐derived uremic toxin (trimethylamine‐N‐oxide; TMAO) and indoxyl sulfate; IS), cytokines, and ALT. In vitro, IS combined with LPS with or without BG enhanced the injury on Caco‐2 enterocytes (transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC‐dextran permeability) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (supernatant cytokines (TNF‐α and interleukin‐1 β; IL‐1β) and inflammatory genes (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and nuclear factor‐κB)), compared with non‐IS activation. These injuries were attenuated by the probiotics condition media. In conclusion, Candida administration worsens kidney damage in 5/6Nx mice through systemic inflammation, partly from gut dysbiosis‐induced uremic toxins, which were attenuated by the probiotics. The additive effects on cell injury from uremic toxin (IS) and microbial molecules (LPS and BG) on enterocytes and macrophages might be an important underlying mechanism.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This letter presents an alternative novel concept of linear actuator which uses a rotary ER-fluid brake to engage the highly backdrivable unit to the high force unit. The end effector driven by a mini motor is connected to the brake rotor. Since the brake rotation allows the relative translation between the endpoint and the high-force actuator, the mechanical impedance can be modulated by controlling the brake friction through the applied voltage. The ER-fluid brake using multiple concentric cylinders for high torque-to-inertia ratio was characterized experimentally. The macro-mini linear actuator with an intrinsic failsafe can be applied for active body weight support systems requiring antigravity high force.","engineering, computer science, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence"

One of the complex steps of plaque assay is the counting of the number of viral plaques in multiwell plates to study and evaluate viruses. Manual counting plaques are time-consuming and subjective. There is a need to reduce the workload in plaque counting and for a machine to read virus plaque assay; thus, herein, we developed a machine-learning (ML)-based automated quantification machine for viral plaque counting. The machine consists of two major systems: hardware for image acquisition and ML-based software for image viral plaque counting. The hardware is relatively simple to set up, affordable, portable, and automatically acquires a single image or multiple images from a multiwell plate for users. For a 96-well plate, the machine could capture and display all images in less than 1 min. The software is implemented by K-mean clustering using ML and unsupervised learning algorithms to help users and reduce the number of setup parameters for counting and is evaluated using 96-well plates of dengue virus. Bland-Altman analysis indicates that more than 95% of the measurement error is in the upper and lower boundaries [±2 standard deviation].

In this study we aimed to assess the effectiveness of the newly established transition clinic for emerging adults with T1D. Methods: We conducted an observational study of emerging adults with T1D treated in a transition clinic jointly operated by a pediatric and adult multidisciplinary care team during 2019–2021. A retrospective chart review of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), frequency of clinic attendance, acute diabetes-related complications, assessment of gaps in knowledge and behavior, and psychosocial outcomes was analyzed. Results: A total of 21 patients with T1D were included. Median age at the transfer to the transition clinic was 24 years (range 21–34). Fifteen patients (71%) were successfully transferred to adult services; mean duration of follow-up at the transition clinic was 9.2 months (SD 3.9). None of the patients was lost to follow-up or experienced serious diabetes related complications. Mean (95% confidence interval) HbA1c levels decreased from 8.97% (7.87–10.07) at baseline to 8.25% (7.45–9.05) at the most recent visit (p = 0.01). A proportion of patients achieving the glycemic target (HbA1c < 7.5%) was increased from 24% at the first visit to 38% at the most recent visits. Patients' HbA1c levels at the adult clinic continued a favorable trend. Seven patients (33%) were identified as having symptoms of depression. Knowledge and behavioral gaps were identified and counselled by clinical care team. Conclusion: The multidisciplinary transition clinic has shown to be beneficial in terms of improving glycemic control, maintaining continuity of care and clinic attendance.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Bacterial cell attachment and biofilm formation is considered to cause health and environmental risks from plastic waste accumulation. In water, plastic waste could serve as a new substrate for bacteria. In our study, the attachment of Escherichia coli K12, to four types of plastic shopping bags (biodegradable polylactic acid and the non-biodegradable polypropylene, polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride) was investigated. The change in physicochemical phenomena of each plastic, such as reduced hydrophobicity and higher exopolysaccharide concentrations (total extractable protein and carbohydrate) resulted in increased biofilm content on the plastic surfaces. The bacterial colonization of different plastic surfaces controls the ionic strength of the nutrition sources. The adhesion of Escherichia coli K12 cells on the surfaces were revealed by SEM images. The finding shows that increases surface roughness, besides favor for adhesion of bacterial cells due to hydrophobicity leading to a rapid attachment of Escherichia coli K12 on the surfaces. In addition, we used Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory to predict the attachment of Escherichia coli K12, which gave result of adhesion due to the high energy barrier. This present study added to our knowledge of the possible consequences of plastics acting as a new habitat for microbes in different aquatic condition.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

We explored the effects of L34 on kidney fibrosis and levels of gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUTs) in 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. Methods: At 6 weeks post-5/6Nx in mice, either L34 (1 × 106 CFU) or phosphate buffer solution (as 5/6Nx control) was fed daily for 14 weeks. In vitro, the effects of L34-conditioned media with or without indoxyl sulfate (a representative GDUT) on inflammation and cell integrity (transepithelial electrical resistance; TEER) were assessed in Caco-2 (enterocytes). In parallel, the effects on proinflammatory cytokines and collagen expression were assessed in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Results: At 20 weeks post-5/6Nx, L34-treated mice showed significantly fewer renal injuries, as evaluated by (i) kidney fibrosis area (P < 0.01) with lower serum creatinine and proteinuria, (ii) GDUT including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) (P = 0.02) and indoxyl sulfate (P < 0.01) and (iii) endotoxin (P = 0.03) and serum TNF-α (P = 0.01) than 5/6Nx controls. Fecal microbiome analysis revealed an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes in 5/6Nx controls. After incubation with indoxyl sulfate, Caco-2 enterocytes had higher interleukin-8 and nuclear factor κB expression and lower TEER values, and HK2 cells demonstrated higher gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and collagen (types III and IV). These indoxyl sulfate-activated parameters were attenuated with L34-conditioned media, indicating the protective role of L34 in enterocyte integrity and renal fibrogenesis.

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has proved to be a useful method to enhance the capacity of radio link systems in 4G and beyond networks. Similarly, Visible Light Communication (VLC) is considered to be an environmental-friendly complementing technology for 6G networks. In this work, we have investigated the suitability of flexible transmitters and receivers for MIMO-based Visible Light Communication System for next-generation-networks. We created a channel state information (CSI) matrix based on random, Exponential, Rayleigh, and Gaussian distribution. Our results show that the randomly generated CSI matrix without diagonal maximization yields the worst performance whereas if the CSI matrix follows Gaussian distribution, VLC based MIMO system executes the best performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) against signal to noise ratio (SNR). Based on our results, we introduced the concept of flexible transmitters and receivers which can orient themselves at the physical layer based on the feedback received from the channel. We further extend our investigations by considering a square network of MIMO transmitters and receivers. Simulation results show that as the number of transmitters increases, BER performance deteriorates for independent data streams.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture"

Here, the phase transformation of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 after phase segregation and probe an irreversible phase reconstruction of MAPbBr3 is investigated. The photoluminescence imaging microscopy technique is introduced to in situ record the whole process. It is proposed that the type-I band alignment of segregated I-rich and Br-rich domains can enhance the emission of the I-rich domains by suppressing the nonradiative recombination channels. At the same time, the charge injection from Br-rich to I-rich domains drives the expulsion of iodide from the lattice, and thus triggers the reconstruction of MAPbBr3. The work highlights the significance of ion movements in mixed-halide perovskites and provides new perspectives to understand the property evolution.","mixing and separation, medical, coastal engineering, Materials Science, biochemistryistry, engineering, physics","Medicine (miscellaneous), Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous), Engineering (all), Physics and Astronomy (all)"

Hydroxypropyl cellulose was used in various ratios to obtain printable filaments in combination with various drugs (indomethacin or theophylline), polymers and disintegrants. The complex viscosity, shear thinning behavior and viscoelastic properties were affected by the drug load, polymer composite, disintegrant type, temperature and shear rate applied. Larger windows of processing viscosity were revealed. The viscosity of the printable blends could be as low as the range 10–1000 Pa·s at 100 rad/s angular frequency. All formulations showed shear thinning behavior with a broad slope of complex viscosity from −0.28 to −0.74. The addition of 30–60% drug or disintegrant tended to have greater viscosity values. While microcrystalline cellulose was found to be an alternative additive to lower the storage and loss modulus among disintegrants.

The objective of this study was to identify the genes responsible for salt tolerance in Thai rice populations. We performed a genome‐wide association study with growth traits, relative water content, and cell membrane stability at the seedling stage, and predicted 25 putative genes. Eleven of them were located within previously reported salt‐tolerant QTLs (ST‐QTLs). OsCRN, located outside the ST‐QTLs, was selected for gene characterization using the Arabidopsis mutant line with T‐ DNA insertion in the orthologous gene. Mutations in the AtCRN gene led to the enhancement of salt tolerance by increasing the ability to maintain photosynthetic pigment content and relative water content, while the complemented lines with ectopic expression of OsCRN showed more susceptibility to salt stress detected by photosynthesis performance. Moreover, the salt‐tolerant rice varieties showed lower expression of this gene than the susceptible rice varieties under salt stress conditions. The study concludes that by acting as a negative regulator, OsCRN plays an important role in salt tolerance in rice.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The temperature (>110°C) of carbamate breakdown in amine regeneration requires large energy consumption. In this work, we report a novel, stable, efficient, and inexpensive Ni-HZSM-5 catalyst to improve the CO2 desorption rate and reduce the heat duty. The impregnation method was applied for varying nickel content in the catalysts from 2.16 to 9.80 wt% in HZSM-5. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The catalytic performance was evaluated by CO2 desorption of rich amine solvent at 90°C. It was found that the introduction of nickel increased the acid sites of catalysts compared with parent HZSM-5. This phenomenon plays a key role on improving the CO2 desorption rate. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations successfully explain the catalytic performance. The catalytic activity associates with the combined properties of MSA × B/L × Ni2+. The 7.85-Ni-HZ catalyst presents an excellent catalytic activity for the CO2 desorption: it increases the amount of desorbed CO2 up to 36%, reduces the relative heat duty by 27.07% with the same reaction time, and possesses high stability during five cyclic tests. A possible catalytic mechanism for the Ni-HZSM-5 catalysts through assisting carbamate breakdown and promoting CO2 desorption is proposed based on experimental results and theoretical calculations. Therefore, the results present that the 7.85-Ni-HZ catalyst significantly accelerates the protons transfer in CO2 desorption and can potentially apply in industrial CO2 capture.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, environmental, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering (all)"

One of the problems that cause project failure is that the project does not consider risks that result from low-quality user stories from the beginning and hence does not prepare for such risks. That causes an impact on both software development and project management. This paper presents a user story risk prioritization model to raise the project awareness on user story risks and risk prioritization for better responses to the risks. The model describes 10 user story risks and 2 main criteria for risk prioritization, i.e. impact of occurrence that consists of 10 subcriteria and probability of occurrence that consists of 1 subcriterion. The model has been evaluated by members of agile teams who have experiences in agile software development. To prioritize user story risks, the model can be used with other methods, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) or weighted scoring method, to rank the user story risks by the criteria and determine priorities of the risks. In this research, the AHP has been applied with the proposed model to prioritize user story risks of an agile software project. The experiment shows that the risk prioritization results from the model are consistent with the actual risk situation of the experimental project. The proposed model therefore can be used as a supporting tool for risk management in an agile software project.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Software, Information Systems, Information Systems and Management, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

This system employs a unique detection scheme based on the combination of ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)6]3−) and methylene blue (MB) for signal amplification without the need for any electrode surface modifications. Measurements of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were performed as proof of concept using disposable electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (ePADs) as detection platforms. The quantification of albumin is accomplished by using an indirect detection strategy. In the absence of BSA, electron transfer via EC redox cycling process occurs readily between the redox species and the electrode surface, resulting in a large electrochemical signal. The redox species solution containing BSA, on the other hand, provides a low signal current due to the hindrance of BSA on the electrode surface, which impedes the electron transfer of the proposed redox probe. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range was 1–500 mg dL−1 with a detection limit of 0.072 mg dL−1. This finding leads to the development of a powerful method for the direct detection of albumin at a low concentration and no requirement for correction by creatinine. The proposed devices were successfully used to detect albumin in real urine samples with satisfactory results, demonstrating good agreement with the standard method and the reliability. Aside from the ease and rapidity, the proposed method is inexpensive, sensitive, and a promising tool for clinical diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and suitable for point-of-care testing in developing countries.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

The film coating formulations comprised blends of zein and methacrylic acid copolymer (Eudragit® L100–55), with and without the addition of the plasticizer, polyethylene glycol 1000. The rheology parameters (loss modulus (G'), storage modulus (G"") and loss tangent (tan δ, G""/G')) of the film coating solution were measured to investigate the processability. Central composite design was used to investigate the main, interaction and quadratic effects of the proportion of methacrylic acid copolymer, solid content of the film formers and level of polyethylene glycol 1000 on the capsule wall thickness and mechanical strength. Multiple response optimization was further conducted, and the design space was established. The in vitro drug release in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids of three different formulations in the design space was compared. The results showed that the tan δ value after the gelation point should be < 0.9 in order to form a thin and sturdy capsule shell. The gelation time and viscosity of the coating solution were related to the thickness of the capsule shell. The study showed that drug release from the capsule with a specified thickness and mechanical strength can be modulated by varying the ratio of zein to methacrylic acid copolymer.

Four distinct polymorphisms of the VEGFA gene were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism: −2578C/A (rs699947), −1154G/A (rs1570360), −634C/G (rs2010963), and +936C/T (rs3025039). Plasma VEGFA levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The most common nucleotides in both knee OA subjects and healthy controls were CC for −2578C/A, GG for −1154G/A, CG for −634C/G, and CC for +936C/T in the VEGFA gene. Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of VEGFA −2578C/A, −1154G/A, −634C/G, and +936C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ between OA patients and the controls. Plasma VEGFA levels showed no difference between OA patients and the controls. In contrast, plasma VEGFA levels of −634C/C genotype were significantly higher in OA patients than in the controls (P = 0.035). According to the −2578A/A genotype, patients with early stage OA had a higher odds ratio than those with advanced stage OA (P = 0.023). Conclusions: VEGFA −2578C/A (rs699947), −1154G/A (rs1570360), −634C/G (rs2010963), and +936C/T (rs3025039) polymorphisms may not be responsible for OA susceptibility in the Thai population. However, the OA patients with A/A genotype at the −2578C/A seemed to have a lower potential risk of developing severe OA than those with the C/A and C/C genotypes. These findings would help elucidate and facilitate a better understanding of the genetic fundamentals of OA.",medical,Medicine (all)

Exogenously induced change in developmentally imprinted excitatory neurotransmitter phenotypes of these neurons to inhibitory has not yet been achieved. Here, we use a subpial dorsal horn-targeted delivery of AAV (adeno-associated virus) vector(s) encoding GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesizing-releasing inhibitory machinery in mice with neuropathic pain. Treated animals showed a progressive and complete reversal of neuropathic pain (tactile and brush-evoked pain behavior) that persisted for a minimum of 2.5 months post-treatment. The mechanism of this treatment effect results from the switch of excitatory to preferential inhibitory neurotransmitter phenotype in dorsal horn nociceptive neurons and a resulting increase in inhibitory activity in regional spinal circuitry after peripheral nociceptive stimulation. No detectable side effects (e.g., sedation, motor weakness, loss of normal sensation) were seen between 2 and 13 months post-treatment in naive adult mice, pigs, and non-human primates. The use of this treatment approach may represent a potent and safe treatment modality in patients suffering from spinal cord or peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Ketogenic diet (KD) has been increasingly used for SRSE treatment. Enteral ketosis induction in SRSE is sometimes unfeasible, leading to the use of parenteral KD which has limited data among children. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of KD and compare parenteral and enteral ketosis induction as treatment options in pediatric SRSE patients. Methods: This study is a retrospective medical record review of children < 15 years old diagnosed with SRSE who received KD as one of the treatment modalities during 2007–2021 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Results: KD was used in 14 (77.8%) of the 18 pediatric SRSE cases whose age ranged from 2 months to 13.5 years. The leading etiologies of SRSE were immune-mediated encephalitis, infectious encephalitis, and epilepsy. Ketosis was induced via enteral route (kEN) in 8/14 and parenteral route (kPN) in 6/14 cases. The median time from the onset of SRSE to KD initiation was 6 days (IQR 4.8–9.3) with no demonstrable difference between groups. The median time to achieve significant ketosis was significantly shorter in the kPN (2 days; IQR 1.8–4) compared to the kEN group (5 days (3.3–7.8)). Nonetheless, the median time after ketosis induction to SRSE termination when anesthetic infusion was stopped was not statistically difference between the kPN (14 days; IQR 8.5–18) and the kEN group (10.5 days (5.5–15.3)). Hypertriglyceridemia was found more in the kPN (6/6, 100%) compared to the kEN group (3/8, 37.5%). All survivors (12/14) were seizure free at discharge. Conclusion: Parenteral ketosis induction achieved the target ketosis quicker than enteral induction but showed no difference in efficacy and duration for SRSE termination in our study. The adverse effects were minimal and controllable. Both parenteral and enteral KD could be considered early during SRSE treatment.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Alterations of the bacterial community from respiratory viral infections could increase the susceptibility to secondary infections and disease severities. We compared the upper respiratory bacterial profiles among Thai patients with influenza or COVID-19 by using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform. The Chao1 richness was not significantly different among groups, whereas the Shannon diversity of Flu A and Flu B groups were significantly lower than Non-Flu & COVID-19 group. The beta diversity revealed that the microbial communities of influenza (Flu A and Flu B), COVID-19, and Non-Flu & COVID-19 were significantly different; however, the comparison of the community structure was similar between Flu A and Flu B groups. The bacterial classification revealed that Enterobacteriaceae was predominant in influenza patients, while Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were significantly enriched in the COVID-19 patients. These implied that respiratory viral infections might be related to alteration of upper respiratory bacterial community and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. Moreover, the bacteria that observed in Non-Flu & COVID-19 patients had high abundance of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Fusobacterium. This study provides the basic knowledge for further investigation of the relationship between upper respiratory microbiota and respiratory disease which might be useful for better understanding the mechanism of viral infectious diseases.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

As comfort with AF ablation increases, the procedure is increasingly used in patients that are older and in those with more comorbidities. However, it is not well established whether AF ablation in the elderly, especially those >75 years old, has comparable safety and efficacy to younger populations. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety profiles in patients older than 75 years undergoing AF ablation with younger patients. Methods: Databases from EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane, were searched from inception through September 2021. Studies that compared the success rates in AF catheter ablation and all complications rates between patients who were older vs under 75 years were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Twenty-seven observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 363,542 patients who underwent AF ablation. Comparing patients older than 75 years old to younger patients, there was no difference in the success of ablation rates between elderly and younger patients (pooled OR 0.85: 95% CI:0.69–1.05, p =.131). On the other hand, AF ablation in the elderly was associated with higher complication rates (pooled OR 1.42: 95% CI:1.21–1.68, p <.001). Conclusion: As AF ablation is expanded to elderly populations, our study found that AF ablation success rates were similar in both elderly and younger patients. However, older patients experience higher rates of complications that should be considered when offering the procedure and as a means to improve outcomes with future innovations.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

According to the California compost quality council process, tests were carried out for different sample data of vermicomposting as a function of composting time, moisture content, and initial C:N ratio. The composting time and initial C:N ratio were found to be significant influencing factors. The second-order polynomial models obtained using a response surface methodology were employed to explain the responses of the maturity indices according to changes in the vermicomposting factors.

This risk assessment comprises four steps: hazard identification, dose–response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. We used probabilistic models for prevalence, concentration, and oyster consumption. HEV dose–response (DR) model based on HEV dosing in chimpanzees and used to perform a dose–response assessment of HEV was proposed. Both HAV and HEV were simultaneously enumerated by real-time PCR to determine viral doses. The probabilistic prevalences of HAV and HEV were in the ranges of 8–20% and 8–40%, respectively. The best-fit DR model was the beta-Poisson with alpha and N50 equal to 216.9 and 3.03 × 107, respectively. After running the Monte Carlo simulation, the annual cases of foodborne hepatitis A and hepatitis E from raw oyster consumption from farms were 9,264–17,526 and 1–604, respectively, while those at retail were 7,694–14,591 and 1–204, respectively. This study suggested that consuming farm oysters poses a significantly higher risk of hepatitis A than hepatitis E. The best-fit DR model for HEV developed in this study could determine risks of hepatitis E from raw oyster consumption in Thailand.","fluidex; related topics, medicalcal geography, engineering, medical","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Physiology (medical)"

Methods: Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and FLAIR and DWI MRIs to assess WMHs and acute infarct volumes, respectively, were assessed in 47 patients (≥55 years) with acute ischemic stroke and 17 normal controls. The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MDRS) was assessed three months after the stroke. Results: The MADRS score was significantly increased in stroke patients as compared with normal controls. The MADRS scale is not unidimensional and cannot be used as an accurate indicator of depression severity in stroke patients. Three months after stroke, key depressive (sadness and inability to feel) and concentration-tension symptoms, and lassitude are significantly predicted by the infarct volume. Right side infarction strongly predicts key depressive symptoms and left side infarction strongly predicts concentration-tension and lassitude scores. Total WMHs significantly predict key depressive and concentration-tension symptoms, and lassitude, with these effects being mediated by right and left DWI stroke volumes and associated disabilities. Conclusions: Interactions between age, hypertension, a chronic atherosclerotic process, and acute stroke account for the onset of key depressive symptoms three months after the acute infarct. Chronic and acute neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative stress pathways associated with the formation of WMHs and acute stroke may explain the incidence of post-stroke key depressive and concentration-tension symptoms, and lassitude.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The use of GNSS data allows for all-weather PWV tracking 24 h a day, 7 days a week. The weighted mean temperature (Tm) is an important variable in deriving GNSS-PWV values with high accuracy, especially in tropical zones. Unfortunately, the usual method of obtaining Tm is through expensive meteorological instruments such as radiosondes which are not available in every region of Thailand. This current research derives empirical models of Tm based on two data sets: one provided by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS/Aqua platform, and one provided in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ (ECMWF) ERA5 Reanalysis. GNSS-PWV was calculated for 76 GNSS CORS around Thailand using Tm values calculated by the developed models in conjunction with GipsyX software. Results were validated against AIRS-PWV values, and compared against other existing Tm models. Results based on the developed AIRS-Tm and ERA5-Tm models, as well as the existing Suwantong, Bevis, Mendes, Schueler, and GPT3 models, showed mean biases in PWV difference against AIRS-PWV values of 0.3, 0.2, − 0.3, 1.0, 0.8, 1.8, and 1.1 mm, respectively. These results conclude that the mean bias of GPS-PWV estimations can be reduced when a more localized countrywide Tm model is used versus a global model.","fluidex; related topics, applications; atmosphere, engineering, earth sciences","Building and Construction, Geophysics, Geology"

Methods: Serum samples were collected from 302 mothers and 291 children between 2015 and 2021. Maternal and cord blood were collected at birth. Serial serum samples of children were collected at the ages of 2, 7, 18, 19, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months and the presence of anti-RSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The cord: maternal serum antibody ratio was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.11). Although >90% of babies at birth were seropositive through transplacental transfer, antibody levels gradually declined, with the highest seronegative rate (91.9%) at 7 months of age. Subsequently, anti-RSV IgG levels increased with age, most likely due to natural infection. One-third of the children showed evidence of reinfection as determined by seroconversion of anti-RSV IgG or increased titers of at least 50 relative units/ml. Conclusion: Waning of RSV antibodies in infants is rapid, and RSV infection subsequently increases anti-RSV IgG titers.

However, it is possible that unique words may be counted differently for various languages. This study focuses on Thai as a language that differs from English in terms of word combinations. We applied various automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques to develop an assisted scoring system for the MoCA language fluency test with Thai language support. This was a challenge because Thai is a low-resource language for which domain-specific data are not publicly available, especially speech data from patients with MCIs. Furthermore, the great variety of pronunciation, intonation, tone, and accent of the patients, all of which might differ from healthy controls, bring more com-plexity to the model. We propose a hybrid time delay neural network hidden Markov model (TDNN-HMM) architecture for acoustic model training to create our ASR system that is robust to environmental noise and to the variation of voice quality impacted by MCI. The LOTUS Thai speech corpus was incorporated into the training set to improve the model’s generalization. A prepro-cessing algorithm was implemented to reduce the background noise and improve the overall data quality before feeding data into the TDNN-HMM system for automatic word detection and language fluency score calculation. The results show that the TDNN-HMM model in combination with data augmentation using lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) objective function provides a word error rate (WER) of 30.77%. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop an ASR with Thai language support to automate the scoring system of MoCA’s language fluency as-sessment.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Zwitterion mechanism was applied to describe the reaction and the k0 was well fitted by the corresponding kinetic model with average absolute relative deviation (AARD) in a range of 1.08%-3.89%. Apparent second-order reaction rate constant KA revealed that the reaction rate is simultaneously controlled by steric hindrance and pKa of amines. Additional alkyl groups increase the steric hindrance of amines and accelerate the decomposition of zwitterions. As a result, the reaction rate decreases with stronger steric hindrance effect. The larger pKa is conducive to a better proton receiving of amine. This leads to an acceleration of the deprotonation reaction of zwitterion intermediate. In addition, the relative influence of steric hindrance and pKa on the reaction kinetics is also related to the solvent environment.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

This study used tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a primary metabolite of curcumin with enhanced antioxidant and anticancer properties, as a model compound to prepare NLCs. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize THC-loaded Ch-coated NLCs (THC-Ch-NLCs) fabricated by high-shear homogenization. The optimized THC-Ch-NLCs had particle size of 244 ± 18 nm, zeta potential of −17.5 ± 0.5 mV, entrapment efficiency of 76.6 ± 0.2% and drug loading of 0.28 ± 0.01%. In vitro release study of THC-Ch-NLCs showed sustained release following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion at pH 7.4 and 5.5, respectively. THC-Ch-NLCs demonstrated significantly enhanced in vitro skin permeation, cell uptake, and remarkable cytotoxicity toward MD-MBA-231 breast cancer cells compared to the unencapsulated THC, suggesting Ch-NLCs as potential transdermal nanocarriers of THC for triple-negative breast cancer treatment.","Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Candida Administration Worsens Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Renal Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Mice: An Impact of Gut Fungi on Acute Kidney Injury,"Saithong S., Saisorn W., Dang C.P., Visitchanakun P., Chiewchengchol D., Leelahavanichkul A.",2022-01-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Animals, Candida, Extracellular Traps, Humans, Inflammation, Lipopolysaccharides, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neutrophils, Reperfusion Injury, Beta-glucan, Gut fungi, Lipopolysaccharide, Neutrophil extracellular traps, Renal ischemia reperfusion injury","Because of gut-barrier defect (gut-leakage) after acute kidney injury (AKI) and higher abundance of Candida albicans in human intestines compared with mouse guts, Candida administration in renal ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) mice possibly more closely resemble patients with AKI than non-Candida model. Fungi in feces were detectable only in mice with Candida administration. Candida renal-I/R mice, when compared with non-Candida I/R, demonstrated more profound injuries, including (i) gut-leakage; FITC-dextran assay and serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), (ii) systemic inflammation (serum cytokines), and (iii) neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); gene expression of peptidyl arginase 4 (PAD4) and IL-1β, nuclear morphology staining by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and co-staining of myeloperoxidase (MPO) with neutrophil elastase (NE) in peripheral blood neutrophils. Although renal excretory function (serum creatinine) and renal histology score were nondifferent between renal-I/R mice with and without Candida, prominent renal NETs (PAD4 and IL-1β expression with MPO and NE co-staining) was demonstrated in Candida renal-I/R mice. Additionally, neutrophil activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus BG (LPS + BG), when compared with LPS alone, caused (i) NETs formation; dsDNA, DAPI-stained nuclear morphology and MPO with NE co-staining, (ii) inflammatory responses; Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and NFκB expression, and (iii) reduced cell energy status (maximal respiratory capacity using extracellular flux analysis). Also, LPS + BG-activated NETs formation was inhibited by a dectin-1 inhibitor, supporting an impact of BG signaling. In conclusion, Candida-renal I/R demonstrated more prominent serum BG and LPS from gut translocation that increased systemic inflammation and NETs through TLR-4 and dectin-1 activation. The influence of gut fungi in AKI should be concerned.",medical,Immunology and Allergy

Efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) thus becomes an interesting alternative to handle the drug-resistant bacteria. Conessine, a natural steroidal alkaloid from Holarrhena antidysenterica, previously exhibited efflux pump inhibitory potential. Our molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) studies provided atomistic information as well as the interaction of conessine with bacterial MexB efflux pump in phospholipid bilayer membrane to further the previous experimental report. Herein, the binding site and proposed mode of action of conessine were identified compared to known/commercial EPIs such as PAβN or designed-synthetic P9D. Our results explained conessine binding mode of action as an effective agent against the MexB efflux pump. The MD simulation also suggested that conessine was able to affect glycine loop (G-loop) flexibility, and the reduced G-loop flexibility due to conessine could hinder an antibiotics extrusion. In addition, our study suggested the conessine core structure buried in a hydrophobic region in the efflux pump similar to other known EPIs. Our finding could cope as a key for the design and development of the conessine derivative as novel EPI against P. aeruginosa. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Objectives: To determine the relationship between CMV infection/serostatus and IFIs in allo-HSCT populations. Data sources: A systematic literature search was conducted from existence until 11 July 2021 using Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science databases. Study eligibility criteria: Cross-sectional, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort and case–control studies that reported allo-HSCT recipients with CMV and without CMV who developed or did not develop IFIs after CMV infection. Participants: Allo-HSCT recipients. Interventions: Not applicable. Methods: A systematic search, screening, data extracting and assessing study quality were independently conducted by two reviewers. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias. data were analysed using the pooled effect estimates of a random-effects model. Results: A total of 18 and 12 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Post-transplant CMV infection significantly increased the risk of IFIs with a pooled hazard ratio (pHR) of 2.58 (1.78, 3.74), I2 = 75%. Further subgroup analyses by timing of IFIs, CMV definitions, study continents, study design and adjustment of effect estimates showed that post-transplant CMV infection consistently increased the risk of subsequent IFIs. High-risk CMV serostatus (D–/R+) increased the risk of IFIs with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.33 (1.04, 1.71), I2 = 0%, but low-risk CMV serostatus (D–/R–) decreased the risk of IFIs with a pOR of 0.69 (0.55, 0.87), I2 = 0%. Conclusions: Post-transplant CMV infection and high-risk CMV serostatus increased the risk of IFIs, but low-risk CMV serostatus decreased risk of IFIs among allo-HSCT recipients. Further studies are needed to identify at-risk allo-HSCT recipients as well as to focus on fungal diagnostics and prophylaxis to prevent this fungal-after-viral phenomenon.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Transition metal (TM) atom doping to 2-dimensional layer material has been studied for CRR, but compared to studies on TM doped single vacancy (TM-SV) sites, those on double vacancies (TM-DV) sites are minor. In this research, we investigated the doping of 26 (3d-, 4d-, and 5d-groups) TM atoms to the DV of boron nitride nanosheets (BN) using the dispersion-corrected density functional theory method for the complete CRR mechanism. We analyzed the limiting potential of the reactions of different TM-DVBN using the integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian partition (ICOHP) of TM–O binding, universal descriptor, charge, and the number of valence electrons. We found the volcano plot model which suggests that a moderate OH binding energy of around −0.50 eV, the universal descriptor value around 9.40, and the ICOHP descriptor around −0.20 will provide the lowest limiting potential for CRR. From these studies, we find Ni-DVBN is the most reactive and can produce CH3OH at −0.48 V. This is much better than Ni-SVBN, which requires −1.0 V to produce HCOOH also lower than Fe-SVBN (−0.52 V), which was the best catalyst in the previous study of TM-SVBN. This shows that Ni doping to DVBN is more effective for CRR compared to doping to SVBN.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

However, face masks use noticeably soared due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. As a result, an unprecedented influx of discarded face masks is ending up in the environment. This review paper delves into face masks in the environment using the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses) framework to simplify and communicate the environmental indicators. Firstly, the historical, and briefly the economic trajectory of face masks are discussed. Secondly, the main driving forces of face masks use with an emphasis on public health are explored. Then, the pressures exerted by efforts to fulfill the human needs (driving forces) are investigated. In turn, the state of the environment due to the influx of masks along with the impacts are examined. Furthermore, the upstream, and downstream societal responses to mitigate the environmental damages of the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts are reviewed. In summary, it has been shown from this review that the COVID-19 pandemic has been causing a surge in face mask usage, which translates to face masks pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This implies proper usage and disposal of face masks is paramount to the quality of human health and the environment, respectively. Moreover, further research on eco-friendly face masks is indispensable to mitigating the environmental damages occurring due to the mass use of surgical masks worldwide.","medicalcine and pharmacologymacology, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Indoor fungal richness is dominated by outdoor fungi and is geographically patterned, but the influence of natural landscape is unclear. We aimed to elucidate the relationship between indoor fungal spore richness and natural landscape by examining the amount of surrounding forest cover. Passive sampling of airborne fungal spores was conducted in 24 schools in Taiwan during hot and cool seasons, and amplicon sequencing was used to study fungal spore (genus) richness targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. In total, 693 fungal genera were identified, 12 of which were ubiquitous. Despite overall similarity of fungal spore richness between seasons, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota richness increased during the hot and cool seasons, respectively. Fungal spore richness in schools had a strong positive correlation with the amount of surrounding forest cover during the cool season, but not during the hot season. Fungal assemblages in schools were more similar during the hot season due to the increased ubiquity of Agaricomycetes genera. These observations indicate dispersal limitation at the kilometer scale during the cool season and increased long-distance dispersal during the hot season. Several allergenic fungi were commonly identified in schools, including some previously overlooked by conventional methods, which may be targeted as sensitizing agents in future investigations into atopic conditions. More generally, the relative importance of fungal spore richness in the development, chronicity, and severity of atopic conditions in children requires investigation.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Ecology, Soil Science"

Recently, carbon-based metal-free materials have played a crucial role in electrochemical devices. Carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts have been recognized as proper alternatives for the replacement of frequently used Pt in these devices. Carbon nanotubes-graphene (CNTs-G) hybrids are three-dimensional (3D) carbonaceous structures that have attracted researchers’ interest in the last decade. Because of the unique properties of sp2-hybridized carbon nanostructures viz. superb mechanical, electrical, and catalytic performances, plus recent extensive applications in various aspects, CNTs and graphene families are considered prospective heterostructure materials for next-generation technologies. Moreover, carbon-based materials have demonstrated excellent performance in key reactions like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that occur on the surface of catalysts or electrodes in electrochemical energy conversion/storage devices. The ability to accept functional groups and dopants, create defects, present a large surface area, high porosity, and superior electrolyte penetration, facilitate ion transport, accelerate charge transfer, and capability to form robust attachments between CNTs and graphene have made the CNTs-G hybrid materials suitable candidates in energy-related areas. This review discusses the recent achievements of 3D CNTs-G hybrid heterostructures from synthesis and theoretical concepts to developments and applications in oxygen- and hydrogen- involving electrocatalysts and energy-related devices such as batteries and supercapacitors.

White (n=154) and brown (n=54) rice samples were collected over three crop years. The concentrations of As (total, bioaccessible and inorganic) were determined. The total As concentrations in white (0.088–0.295 mg/kg) and brown (0.119–0.517 mg/kg) rice were approximately 58.8% and 57.4% higher than the Codex standards, respectively. However, the bioaccessible and inorganic As in both types of rice were lower than the standards for both rice types. Regarding the classifications of As accumulation (low, normal, high and unusually high), the actual As concentrations found in the rice samples were either in the normal range or a high concentration of As.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, pharmacology, medical","Food Science, Toxicology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"
Overexpression of fatty acid synthesis genes in Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803. The biomass and lipid contents were evaluated in both the wild type and the engineered strains after copper treatment. The maximum lipid production of 0.981 g/L with the productivity of 81.75 mg/L/d was obtained from the copper treated ΔglgC + A-OX strain, which showed a 3.3-fold increase compared to the untreated wild type with satisfactory biodiesel properties. After copper treatment the knockout strain improved the unsaturated fatty acids level contributing to the increase of the saturated and mono-unsaturated ratio with improvement of the fuel quality. Copper induced oxidative stress also improved the photosynthetic pigments in engineered strains leading to increased tolerance against oxidative stress in the engineered strains. The copper treatment increased the antioxidant enzyme activities in the engineered strains especially in ΔglgC + A-OX strain. The carbon flux to lipid synthesis was enhanced by the engineered strains particularly with the knockout-overexpression strains. The Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 engineered with ΔglgC + A-OX showed high potential for fuel production after the copper treatment.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Morphologically Normal-Appearing Adrenal Glands as a Prevalent Source of Aldosterone Production in Primary Aldosteronism,"Parksook W.W., Yozamp N., Hundemer G.L., Moussa M., Underhill J., Fudim T., Sacks B., Vaidya A.",2022-06-01,"Adrenal Glands, Adrenalectomy, Aldosterone, Humans, Hyperaldosteronism, Retrospective Studies, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, adrenal gland, adrenal venous sampling, aldosterone, blood pressure, hypertension, primary aldosteronism","Background: Normal-appearing adrenal glands on cross-sectional imaging may still be the source of aldosterone production in primary aldosteronism (PA). Methods: We evaluated the prevalence of aldosterone production among morphologically normal-appearing adrenal glands and the impact of this phenomenon on interpretations of localization studies and treatment decisions. We performed a retrospective cohort study of PA patients with at least 1 normal adrenal gland and reanalyzed contemporary studies to assess interpretations of imaging and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) at the individual patient and adrenal levels. Results: Among 243 patients, 43 (18%) had bilateral normal-appearing adrenals and 200 (82%) had a unilateral normal-appearing adrenal, for a total of 286 normal-appearing adrenal glands. 38% of these normal-appearing adrenal glands were a source of aldosteronism on AVS, resulting in discordance between imaging and AVS findings in 31% of patients. Most patients with lateralizing PA underwent curative unilateral treatment (80%); however, curative treatment was pursued in 92% of patients who had concordant imaging-AVS results but in only 38% who had discordant results (P < 0.05). In young patients, imaging-AVS discordance was detected in 32% of those under 45 years and 21% of those under 35 years. Among 20 contemporary studies (including 4,904 patients and 6,934 normal-appearing adrenal glands), up to 64% of normal-appearing adrenals were a source of aldosteronism resulting in 31% of patients having discordant results. Conclusions: Morphologically normal-appearing adrenal glands are commonly the source of aldosterone production in PA, even among young patients. The lack of awareness of this issue may result in inappropriate treatment recommendations.",medical,Internal Medicine
Adverse childhood experiences combined with emotional and physical abuse by the partner predict antenatal depression,"Abe Y., Sirichokchatchawan W., Sangkomkamhang U., Satthapisit S., Maes M.",2022-02-01,"Adverse Childhood Experiences, Child, Depression, Female, Humans, Intimate Partner Violence, Physical Abuse, Pregnancy, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Thailand, Adverse childhood experiences, Antenatal depression, Intimate partner violence, Social support","Background: Few studies examined the contributions of childhood adversities, intimate partner violence and social support to antenatal depression (AD). This study aims to 1) evaluate association of these psychosocial factors with AD symptoms in pregnancy; and 2) examine the mediating effect of social support on the relationship between psychosocial stressors and AD symptoms. Methods: Participants were 120 pregnant women aged from 18 to 49 in less than 16 gestational weeks and attending at Antenatal Care Center at Khon Kaen hospital, Thailand. AD symptoms were assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Childhood adversities, intimate partner violence and social support were measured using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACE questionnaire), Abuse Assessment Screen (AAS), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results: We found that the EPDS score was significantly and positively associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negatively with social support. Partial Least Square analysis showed that 49.1% of the variance in the depressive subdomain of the EPDS score was predicted by ACEs, namely psychological and physical abuse and neglect, emotional or physical abuse by the partner, unplanned pregnancy, and no satisfaction with their relationship. The effects of adverse childhood experience due to neglect on the EDPS score was mediated by social support by friends. Limitations: ACEs were assessed retrospectively and, therefore, may be susceptible to recall bias. Conclusion: Prenatal depression scores are to a large extent predicted by psychological distress as indicated by early lifetime trauma, abuse by partner, relation satisfaction, and implications of unintended pregnancy.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The kinetic parameters of the FCC and coke burning reactions for predicting the reactant conversion and product yield percentages were applied. To increase the reactant conversion level and product yield, the effect of the pulsating flow operating parameters was considered using a 2k statistical experimental design with four factors (amplitude, frequency, types of the waveform, and amplitude ratio). The 3D-CFD simulation was successfully validated from the experimental literature data. The frequency and type of the waveform were found to be the significant operating parameters. The expression of the fitted regression model and response surface contour were derived and revealed that the pulsating flow provides a higher reactant conversion level and product yield percentages compared to a non-pulsating or steady flow.","coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

The system assists authorities in wildfire incident management and control with focus on the residential areas. The features include the ability to predict wildfire spread, detect community areas in danger, assess damages, and simulate firebreaks. We utilized Rothermel fire spread equation and the opensource Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS GIS) while retrieving the most recent hotspot and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). We fetch wind data from external data providers, extract land cover data relevant to Thailand from Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers (CGLS) to calculate fuel models specific to Thailand based on 13 standard fuel behavior models from Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE). The users can observe the areas where fire may damage in various time frames. It also detects any community buildings in danger by a deep learning model to detect structures in the satellite images. We are able to identify temples and schools from OpenStreetMap.org because temples and schools are usually set up as shelters when it is necessary to evacuate people from the affected areas. One of the most important features of the ThaiWDSS is the capability to allow the authorities to simulate firebreaks and visualize the risks of fire spread prediction in real time. This assessment is an essence of the planning process before they make the final decision to manage such incidents. We allowed the users to experiment our proposed system using two case studies from actual fire incidents in Thailand. Preliminary comments from experts and authorities from the Royal Thai Army Air Defense Command suggest that ThaiWDSS will be a great asset during the operation as well as in the training process.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Information Systems

MEA and PZ are two promoters used to facilitate several individual aqueous single solvents including BEA, AMP, BDEA, and MDEA. In order to check the altered performance of absorption and desorption, the solvents were specified at 2.5 M. The initial desorption rate was evaluated by varying the temperature, weight of the solid catalyst, and initial rich CO2 loading. The experimental results were then taken to compare with the obtained data of the benchmark solution (2.5 M MEA). The comparison results revealed that all the selected blank solvent blends can provide better absorption and desorption performance than the blank benchmark solution. The results also indicated that the performance of catalyst-aided CO2 desorption could be strongly affected by the rich loading and operating temperature. Meaning that the activation of proton donation by HZSM-5 was patently affected by the above two conditions, which eventually affect the CO2 separation from the rich solvent.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Particularly, nursing students experience greater stress as their normal curriculum is interrupted and some of them face the risk of being infected as frontline workers. Nursing faculty members may face similar struggles, in addition to developing teaching materials for online learning. Thus, it is important to examine the faculty members' and students' views on their ability to adapt during the pandemic to obtain a holistic view of how learning and training has been affected. Design: The descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design was used. Settings: Data were collected from Southeast and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network (SEANERN) affiliated nursing institutions from January 2021 to August 2021. Participants: A total of 1897 nursing students and 395 faculty members from SEANERN-affiliated nursing institutions in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were recruited for this study. Methods: Quantitative surveys were used to explore the satisfaction levels in education modalities, confidence levels, psychosocial well-being, sense of coherence and stress levels of nursing students and faculty members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Participants were mostly satisfied with the new education modalities, although most students felt that their education was compromised. Both groups showed positive levels of psychosocial well-being, despite scoring low to medium on the sense of coherence scale and experiencing great stress. The participants' sense of coherence was positively correlated with their psychosocial well-being and negatively correlated with stress levels. Conclusions: While the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the lives of nursing students and faculty members, most of them had a healthy level of psychosocial well-being. Having a strong sense of coherence was associated with better psychosocial health and lower stress levels. As such, it may be helpful to develop interventions aimed at improving the sense of coherence of nursing students and staff to help them manage stressors better.","Nursing, sociology","Nursing (all), Education"

Limited study has focused on patients with upper GI bleeding (UGIB). This study aimed to identify the risk factors of patients who were hospitalized from COVID-19 infection and developed UGIB as well as the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis in those patients. Methods: This study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was the retrospective enrollment of patients who were admitted due to COVID-19 infection and developed UGIB between April and August 2021 to evaluate the associated factors of active UGIB. The second phase was a retrospective analysis after PPI prophylaxis protocol from September – October 2021 to assess the benefit of PPI use in those patients. Results: Of 6,373 patients hospitalized, 43 patients (0.7%) had evidence of UGIB. The majority were male 28 (65.1%) with a mean age of 69.1 ± 11.8 years. Twenty-four of 43 patients (55.8%) needed mechanical ventilation, 35 patients (81.4%) received systemic corticosteroids, and 10 patients (23.3%) were taking anticoagulants for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis. Seven of 43 patients (16%) had active UGIB. There was no significant difference in the number of patients taking antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or steroids and the severity of COVID-19 infection between the two groups. An emergency endoscopy or endoscopic hemostasis were performed in 6/7 (85.7%) patients. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed two significant factors associated with active UGIB including higher of Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS) per point (OR = 7.89; 95%CI 1.03–72.87; p = 0.04) and an absence of PPI use (OR 4.29; 95%CI 1.04–19.51; p = 0.04). After prescribing PPI as a prophylaxis, there was a slightly lower incidence of UGIB (0.6% vs 0.7%) in addition to an absence of active UGIB (0% vs 16%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the absence of PPI and higher GBS were significant risk factors for active UGIB which required therapeutic endoscopy in patients with COVID-19 infection. We suggest that short-term PPI prophylaxis should be prescribed in those patients once they need hospitalization regardless of the severity of COVID-19 infection to minimize the severity of UGIB.",medical,Gastroenterology
"Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the Water, Food, and Energy Sectors in Sittaung River Basin, Myanmar","Ghimire U., Piman T., Shrestha M., Aryal A., Krittasudthacheewa C.",2022-11-01,"Climate change impact, Energy, Energy sector, Food production, Myanmars, River basins, Sittaing river basin, Water evaluation and planning, Water sector, Water–food–energy, climate change, Myanmar, Sittaung river basin, water–food–energy, WEAP","The Sittaung river basin (SRB) remains one of the least studied basins of Myanmar in terms of the assessment of the impact of climate change. As several reservoirs already exist in the basin, much research is needed to understand how projected climate change impacts rainfall, temperature, flows, domestic and agricultural demands, and hydropower generation. Given the limitation in observed data on the ground, a combination of satellite-derived meteorological data and digital elevation data is used to generate inputs to a Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. Five CMIP5 GCMs are used in the WEAP to assess the impact of climate change on the water, food, and energy production of the SRB for the baseline (BL: 1985–2014), near future (NF: 2021–2050), and far future (FF: 2051–2080) periods. The results indicate that the average temperature and rainfall are likely to increase in the future for the SRB. December and January are expected to be drier and warmer, whereas rainy months are expected to be wetter and warmer in the future. The BL flows (1091 m3/s) are expected to increase by 7–10% during NF and by 16–19% during FF at the basin outlet. Meanwhile, the unmet domestic demand during BL (1.3 MCM) is expected to decrease further by approximately 50% in the future. However, the unmet agricultural demand (667 MCM) for food production is estimated to increase from the BL by 11–15% during NF and by 14–19% during FF. Similarly, the total energy generation of nine hydropower projects (4.12 million MWh) is expected to increase by 9–11% during NF and by 16–17% during FF. Thus, the riverine flows are expected to increase in the future, thus positively impacting the domestic and hydropower sectors, whereas the unmet demands in the agricultural sector likely remain unsatisfied. These results will help the water, agriculture, and energy sectors to develop strategies to maximize benefits and cope with the impacts of climate change in the near and long-term future.","nature - sociologyety relations, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

In order to improve the bioactivity of the anodized films, the two-step anodization was performed to produce the films. The steps were performed at 0.2 mA/cm2 for 30 min in electrolytes containing H3PO4/C2H5OH and H3PO4/C2H5OH/NH4F, respectively. The anodized films were soaked in a simulated body fluid (SBF). The effects of surface roughness, hydroxyl groups, fluoride, and hydrophilicity groups on the bioactivity were investigated and were found on the anodized films formed under two-step anodization using 1 M H3PO4 + 80% V/V C2H5OH + 0.75 wt% NH4F. The bioactivity evaluation showed that the combination of two-step anodization in NH4F as an electrolyte induced a formation of apatite on the anodized films. The surface roughness, hydroxyl groups, and fluoride formed on the hydrophilic anodized films are found to be responsible for the rapid formation of hydroxyapatite during SBF soaking. This will be useful in various biomedical applications especially in dental implant procedures.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"
Nonoperative treatment for pain sensitization in patients with low back pain: protocol for a systematic review,"Nopsopon T., Suputtitada A., Lertparinyaphorn I., Pongpirul K.",2022-12-01,"Databases, Factual, Humans, Low Back Pain, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Neuralgia, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Low back pain, Nonoperative, Quantitative sensory testing, Systematic review","Background: Low back pain is a disability that occurs worldwide. It is a heterogeneous disorder that affects patients with dominant nociceptive, neuropathic, and central sensitization pain. An important pathophysiology of low back pain involves pain sensitization. Various nonoperative interventions are available for treatment, but there is inconclusive evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions for pain sensitization, leading to arbitrary nonoperative treatments for low back pain. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of nonoperative treatment for pain sensitization in patients with low back pain. The primary outcomes will be static quantitative sensory testing, dynamic quantitative sensory testing, and pain algometry. The secondary outcome will be adverse events. We will search the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Library databases. Two independent authors will screen the titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract data, assess the risk of bias, and evaluate the quality of evidence. We will qualitatively and quantitatively synthesize the results using a random effects model for meta-analysis. Discussion: This systematic review aims to provide evidence regarding which treatment, if any, provides the greatest benefit for pain sensitization and safety among patients with low back pain. Evidence synthesized from this systematic review will inform clinical practice and further research.

Effects of chronic mild stress on GABAergic system in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus associated with cardiac autonomic activity,"Bangsumruaj J., Kijtawornrat A., Kalandakanond-Thongsong S.",2022-08-26,"Animals, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Hypothalamus, Male, Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, RNA, Messenger, Cardiac autonomic activity, Chronic mild stress, GABAergic system, Paraventricular nucleus, Rat","Stress is associated with cardiovascular diseases. One possible mechanism is the reduction in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission at the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which contributes to the disinhibition of sympathoexcitatory circuits and activates sympathetic outflow. At present, the mechanism of chronic mild stress (CMS) on GABAergic transmission at the PVN and cardiac autonomic activity is not yet fully clarified. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of CMS on the GABAergic system at the PVN and on the cardiac autonomic activity. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control (left undisturbed in their home cage) or CMS (subjected to various mild stressors for 4 weeks). Cardiac autonomic activities were determined by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, and GABAergic alterations at the PVN were determined from GABA levels and mRNA expression of GABA-related activities. Results showed that the CMS group had decreased HRV as determined by the standard deviation of all R–R intervals (SDNN). The low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) powers of the CMS group were higher than those of the control. Hence, the LF/HF ratio was consequently unaffected. These findings indicated that despite the increase in sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, the autonomic balance was preserved at 4 weeks post CMS. For the GABAergic-related parameters, the CMS group had decreased mRNA expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD-65), the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, and increased mRNA expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter-1 (GAT-1). Moreover, the GAD-65 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with LF. In conclusion, 4-week CMS exposure in male rats could attenuate GABAergic transmission at the PVN and alter cardiac autonomic activities.",neuroscience,Behavioral Neuroscience

An indigenous berry of Thailand, Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala (CNP), has been recognized for its robust antioxidants. We investigated the effects and mechanisms of CNP fruit extracts on antioxidant-related survival pathways against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. The extract showed strong antioxidant capability and had high total phenolic and flavonoid contents, particularly resveratrol. Next, the protective effects of the CNP extract or resveratrol on the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity were examined in HT22 hippocampal cells. Our investigation showed that the pretreatment of cells with the CNP extract or resveratrol attenuated glutamate-induced neuronal death via suppression of apoptosis cascade by inhibiting the levels of cleaved- and pro-caspase-3 proteins. The CNP extract and resveratrol suppressed the intracellular ROS by increasing the mRNA expression level of antioxidant enzymes (SODs, GPx1, and CAT). We found that this extract and resveratrol significantly increased SIRT1 expression as a survival-related protein. Moreover, they also promoted the activity of the Nrf2 protein translocation into the nucleus and could bind to the promoter containing the antioxidant response element, inducing the expression of the downstream GPx1-antioxidant protein. Our data illustrate that the CNP extract and resveratrol inhibit apoptotic neuronal death via glutamate-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in HT22 cells through the activation of the SIRT1/Nrf2 survival mechanism.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been considered the standard radiation technique. However, patients suffer from treatment-related toxicities, and most die from disease progression or recurrence. With emerging technological advancement, proton therapy has theoretical advantages over IMRT because it offers apparent dosimetric benefits to allow dose escalation to the target while better sparing surrounding tissues such as the lungs, heart, liver, and spinal cord. The purpose of this study protocol is to investigate the survival benefit of proton therapy using modern intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) compared to standard IMRT for esophageal cancer. Methods: This is a two-arm open phase II/III multi-institution randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients will have histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus with no evidence of tracheoesophageal/esophagobronchial fistula or distant metastasis. After stratification according to resectability status (resectable vs. borderline resectable/unresectable), a total of 232 patients will be randomized to receive IMPT or IMRT using a 1:1 allocation ratio. In resectable cases, surgical resection following concurrent chemoradiation will be attempted for the patients who are medically fit at the time of surgery. In those with initially borderline resectable/unresectable disease, definitive concurrent chemoradiation will be performed. The phase II study will assess safety (toxicity and postoperative complications) and feasibility (recruitment rate and chemoradiation dose modification) in 40 patients into each arm. The study will then continue into phase III, further recruit 76 patients into each arm, and compare progression-free survival between IMPT vs IMRT groups. The secondary endpoints will be overall survival, local and distant control, toxicities, health-related quality of life, and cost-utility. This protocol describes a detailed radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Discussion: This randomized clinical trial will demonstrate the clinical benefit of IMPT in esophageal cancer treatment in terms of survival and toxicity outcomes which will further establish high-level evidence for radiation modality in squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.

Lignin-first biorefining of Nordic poplar to produce cellulose fibers could displace cotton production on agricultural lands,"Adler A., Kumaniaev I., Karacic A., Baddigam K.R., Hanes R.J., Subbotina E., Bartling A.W., Huertas-Alonso A.J., Moreno A., Hakansson H., Mathew A.P., Beckham G.T., Samec J.S.M.",2022-08-17,"Biorefining, Blue water, Climate-adapted poplar, Dissolving pulp, Landuse change, Life cycle assessment, Reductive catalytic fractionation, Regenerated cellulose, Saving in blue water, Short-rotation forestries, climate-adapted poplar, dissolving pulp, land use change, life cycle assessment, lignin, reductive catalytic fractionation, regenerated cellulose, savings in blue water, short rotation forestry, textile fibers","Here, we show that lignin-first biorefining of poplar can enable the production of dissolving cellulose pulp that can produce regenerated cellulose, which could substitute cotton. These results in turn indicate that agricultural land dedicated to cotton could be reclaimed for food production by extending poplar plantations to produce textile fibers. Based on climate-adapted poplar clones capable of growth on marginal lands in the Nordic region, we estimate an environmentally sustainable annual biomass production of ∼11 tonnes/ha. At scale, lignin-first biorefining of this poplar could annually generate 2.4 tonnes/ha of dissolving pulp for textiles and 1.1 m3 biofuels. Life cycle assessment indicates that, relative to cotton production, this approach could substantially reduce water consumption and identifies certain areas for further improvement. Overall, this work highlights a new value chain to reduce the environmental footprint of textiles, chemicals, and biofuels while enabling land reclamation and water savings from cotton back to food production.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, energy",Energy (all)
Urinary phthalate concentrations are associated with total fat mass in Thai children,"Nakaviroj E., Aroonparkmongkol S., Kunjan S., Sarutipaisarn N., Supornsilchai V.",2022-07-01,"Child, Cross-Sectional Studies, Environmental Exposure, Environmental Pollutants, Humans, Male, Obesity, Phthalic Acids, Thailand, body composition, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, phthalate","Objectives: Phthalate is one of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in many daily consumer products. Chronic exposure to phthalate may associate with obesity and metabolic abnormalities. However, there is limited information showing a direct relationship between phthalate and body compositions. The aim of the study was to determine the association between urinary phthalate concentration and body composition measure among Thai children. Methods: A cross-sectional analytic study on urinary phthalate concentrations and body composition in elementary school children, aged 6-13 years in Bangkok, was conducted during October 2019 to 2020. Urinary phthalate metabolites; (mono-methyl phthalate-MMP, mono-ethyl phthalate- MEP, mono-buthyl phthalate-MBP, and mono-ethylhexyl phthalate-MEHP), in early morning spot urine samples were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) with a quantitation limit of 1 ng/mL. Phthalate exposures were identified through questionnaires. Body composition was measured by Tanita BC-418®. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine significant associations. Results: A total of 364 children were enrolled in the study (boy 51.4%). After adjusting for confounders (sex, caregiver educations, family income, BMI-SDS: Body mass index-standard deviation score, TV watching, and exercise frequency), total urinary phthalate concentrations were associated with fat mass 8.24 (0.94, 15.53), trunk percent fat 7.69 (3.26, 12.12), arm percent fat 3.69 (0.47, 6.91), arm fat mass 72.88 (1.08, 144.67), and leg fat mass 17.79 (2.37, 33.22). Conclusions: Higher urinary phthalate concentrations were significantly associated with elevated total fat mass among Thai school-aged children. These findings were not mediated through the degree of obesity defined by BMI. These finding emphasized to be careful when being use phthalate-containing products.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

In this work, polybenzoxazine (PBZ) was synthesized and carbonized at 1173 K for use as a CO2 capture material and a catalytic support for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The effect of cationic, anionic, and non-ionic surfactants on the morphology of PBZ-derived carbon was investigated, and it was determined that the type of surfactant had a major impact on the morphology of the PBZ-derived carbon. Moreover, using a higher surfactant concentration led to a larger pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area. The high efficiency of the PBZ-derived carbon for CO2 adsorption was confirmed by CO2-TPD, FT-IR, and SEM. Notably, the carbon modified by the P123 surfactant delivered a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.59 mmol g−1, which was 2 times higher than that of unmodified carbon.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"
High Frequency Impedance Spectroscopy of Water-Filled Single Well in a Flat-Bottom Plate,"Oo T.P., Jeamsaksiri W., Pimpin A., Chalermwisutkul S.",2022-01-01,"Bottom cells, Bottom plate, Case-studies, Cell culture plates, Circular electrodes, Electrode pairs, High frequency impedance spectroscopy, Impedance spectroscopy, Sensing platforms, Single well, Cell culture plate, Electrode, Impedance spectroscopy, Sensor","This paper proposes the concept of high frequency impedance spectroscopy applied to a single water-filled well in a flat-bottom cell culture plate. A ring-circular electrode pair is attached at the well bottom to generate the electric field. Geometrical parameters including the radius of the circular electrode and the gap between the center and the surrounding electrode are studied to investigate the sensitivity of the sensing platform. In addition, the thickness of the well bottom was also varied with the values of 1.24 mm, 0.5 mm and 0.1 mm. The frequency responses including reflection coefficient, conductance and susceptance are simulated and compared for all case studies. The result shows that the electrode pair with narrower gap and larger radius of the center electrode provides more sensitive frequency responses in the presence of water in the well. Well base thickness also has a direct influence on the frequency response. A thin well base leads to high sensitivity of the impedance spectroscopy. The proposed design can be applied for monitoring of biological cells cultivated in cell culture plates in the future.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Computer Science Applications, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Research on characteristics and extent to which screen media are used in hospitalized children in addition to associated factors is scarce. This study aims to examine the duration and factors associated with screen media use in hospitalized children. From February to November 2020, a cross-sectional study was conducted in hospitalized children (age range 1–194 months, median age 44.5 (IQR 14–123.5) months) and their caregivers at a single tertiary care hospital using a media questionnaire combined with a thorough interview. Of 254 participants who were enrolled, 239 (94%) had been exposed to screen media in the hospital with a median duration of exposure of 6 (IQR 2–11) h/day. Children who used more than one screen media device (standardized beta (β) = 0.16, p < 0.001), having difficulty stopping media use (β = 0.16, p < 0.001), having lower numbers of positive discipline techniques over media use (β = 0.16, p = 0.001), and less media co-viewing with verbal interaction with their caregivers (β = 0.12, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with longer screen media use in a hospital setting. Conclusion: Hospitalized children spent 6 h/day on screen media. Fostering positive discipline over media use and co-viewing with verbal interaction during screen time may minimize screen media overuse in hospitalized children.What is Known:• Screen media use in hospitalized children is often observed during ward rounds.• Hospitalized children had increased access to screen media in hospital rooms compared to their homes.What is New:• Difficulty stopping media use, having lower numbers of positive discipline techniques over media use, and less media co-viewing with caregivers were associated with longer screen media use in hospitalized children.• Fostering positive discipline over media use and verbal interaction from caregivers during media co-viewing may minimize screen media overuse in hospitalized children.","pediatrics and pediatric surgery, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Its unregulated spectrum capacity is vastly greater than that of its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. Despite having numerous applications for both outdoor and indoor environments, FSO's widespread use is limited by weather factors. A severe weather impairment that could result in link drop is fog. The existence of skip-zones in the selected locations is one of the main issues communication systems encounter. In order to address signal loss caused by obstructions like atmospheric or weather conditions, buildings and mountains, the fifth generation mobile network is being deployed. The skip-zone issue in terrestrial area over FSO systems is addressed in this paper. We conduct a performance analysis in the terrestrial area over FSO links impacted by pointing errors and turbulence errors, taking into account link distances and jitter ratios at various positions. The alpha-mu distribution is used to model turbulence. The moment generating function and probability density function are precisely expressed in closed-form after our model analysis. Through the outage probability, average bit error rate and ergodic channel capacity for particular binary modulation schemes, we assess the system performance. The module operates more effectively for FSO when it is placed close to the transmitter, according to numerical results that were verified through simulations and obtained for various positions and link distance ratio values.","Mathematics, computer science, decision sciences","Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems and Management"

Extravasation of the solution can cause cutaneous complications. In this study, we described a 66-year-old man with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and a 32-year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic NET who developed cutaneous lesions caused by the extravasation of an amino acid solution (25 g of lysine and 25 g of arginine in 1 L of normal saline) during PRRT with [177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Both were treated conservatively, and these cutaneous lesions gradually improved. The patient with metastatic pancreatic NET rejected the amino acid infusion in subsequent cycles of PRRT and therefore received [177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE alone, and her serum creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained normal for 2 months after the last treatment. These two cases revealed cutaneous complications resulting from high-concentrated amino acid solution during PRRT because of hyperosmolarity. Health care providers should be aware of this complication to ensure its prevention and appropriate management.

In recent years, the documented genetic diversity of CDV has expanded, with new genotypes identified in India, the Caspian Sea, and North America. However, no quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) that has been validated for the detection of all genotypes of CDV is currently available. We have therefore established and characterized a pan-genotypic probe-based RT-qPCR assay based on the detection of a conserved region of the phosphoprotein (P) gene of CDV. This assay has been validated using virus strains representative of six genotypes of CDV in different sample types, including frozen tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, and virus isolates. The primers and probe target sequences were sufficiently conserved to also enable detection of the phocine distemper virus strains responsible for epizootics in harbor seals in the North Sea in 1988 and 2002. Comparison with two recently published RT-qPCR assays for CDV showed that under equivalent conditions the primers and probe set reported in this study were more sensitive in detecting nucleic acids from an Asia-4 genotype, which displays sequence variation in primer and probe binding sites. In summary, this validated new pan-genotypic RT-qPCR assay will facilitate screening of suspected distemper cases caused by novel genotypes for which full genome sequences are unavailable and have utility in detecting multiple CDV strains in geographical regions where multiple genotypes cocirculate in wildlife.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, medical",Microbiology (medical)

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of chilled semen extender with green tea polyphenols together with α-tocopherol would provide synergistic effects to prolong sperm survival and maintain IZUMO1 protein stability in cat spermatozoa. Sperm samples were collected from the cat epididymis before being diluted with semen extender containing various concentrations of α-tocopherol (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 µg/ml) and 0.75 mg/ml green tea polyphenols and cooled to 4 °C. One sample without antioxidants served as a control. Sperm characteristics and IZUMO1 protein expression were investigated before and after chilling at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days. Using α-tocopherol at 5 µg/ml together with 0.75 mg/ml green tea polyphenols in the semen extender is the most suitable condition to retain the sperm characteristics up to nine days of preservation. Cat IZUMO1 proteins, 17 kDa, were identified at the equatorial segment of acrosome reacted sperm. Without antioxidant, cold storage can gradually degrade the IZUMO1 protein level. Sperm IZUMO1 protein was markedly conserved by supplementation of 5 µg/ml α-tocopherol together with 0.75 mg/ml green tea polyphenols up to 12 days in cold storage. These findings indicate that green tea polyphenols and α-tocopherol have protective effects on the preservation of sperm characteristics and IZUMO1 protein integrity of cat epididymal sperm during long-term chilling.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

Beside overall rating, multi-criteria recommender systems let users rate on multiple aspects of items with multi-criteria ratings. Most methods in recommender systems are based on collaborative filtering, which makes recommendations by exploiting ratings from neighbor users. However, most of them ignore the fact that rating behaviors of users vary due to their personal preference biases. Thus, exploiting ratings from neighbors directly might result in a poor recommendation. To solve this, the rating conversion techniques have been applied in some single criterion recommendations. For multi-criteria ratings, converting each criterion rating independently might result in loss of relation among criteria ratings. We propose a novel method that simultaneously converts all criteria ratings between users to maintain their implicit relations. The multi-criteria ratings are first normalized by variances of users and principle component analysis is applied to extract user preference patterns. Such patterns are then used for multi-criteria rating conversion. The experiment results show that our method outperforms both current single and multi-criteria rating conversion techniques with RMSEs of 1.1082 and 3.5574 on TripAdvisor and Yahoo datasets respectively, while maintaining considerably high level of prediction coverages.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design"

The highest H2 production rate of 55.80 ± 0.50 μmol H2 g dry weight−1 h−1 was obtained when the cells were incubated in BG110 medium containing 0.189 mmol C-atom L−1 glucose under dark anaerobic condition. This rate was 1.5 folds higher than that without glucose. Among ten reducing agents tested, β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, L-cysteine and sodium sulfide had high potential as an effective reducing agent to increase H2 production by A. halophytica. Cells treated with 50 mM sodium sulfide showed the highest H2 accumulation with 4815.59 ± 194.78 μmol H2 g dry weight−1 after 24 h of dark anaerobic incubation. An increase in H2 production was ascribed to an increase of hydrogenase activity and a decrease of O2 production rate. This H2 production yield was approximately 20 folds higher than that without reducing agent. Furthermore, 50 mM sodium sulfide appeared to be non-toxic to A. halophytica cells, since the IC50 of sodium sulfide was higher than 100 mM. The reduced ferredoxin at 1.5 μM-1.5 mM, NADH and NADPH at 0.15–1.5 mM could support in vitro [NiFe]-H2ase activity, demonstrating the ability of these compounds to provide electrons towards [NiFe]-H2ase in A. halophytica.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"

Key technical challenges such as balancing microalgae and bacteria species, pH regulation, light distribution, biomass harvesting, and biomass conversion are also discussed. From the data comparisons among different cultivation systems, it has been suggested that immobilisation appears to require less amount of operational light compared to the suspended and biofilm-based systems for similar nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies.","biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Effects of organic based heat stabilizer on properties of polyvinyl chloride for pipe applications: A comparative study with pb and cazn systems,"Jubsilp C., Asawakosinchai A., Mora P., Saramas D., Rimdusit S.",2022-01-01,"Calcium-zinc, Color changes, Comparatives studies, Dehydrochlorination, Fusion time, Organic Based Stabilizers, Organics, Processing cycles, Property, Thermal degradation', Activation energy, Color change, Fusion time, Gelation, Mechanical property","In this paper, the effects of organic based stabilizers (OBS) are investigated and compared with traditional lead (Pb) and calcium zinc (CaZn) heat stabilizers regarding their processability, mechanical property, and thermal degradation behaviors in rigid PVC pipe applications. In addition, the effects of repeated processing cycles on the degree of gelation and the impact strength of the PVC/OBS, PVC/CaZn, and PVC/Pb are also examined. A repeated processing cycle of those three types of the heat stabilizers up to four cycles was found to increase the degree of gelation and proved no significant effect on the impact strength and heat resistance of the resulting PVC samples. The OBS showed a positive effect on preventing the autocatalytic-typed thermal degradation of the PVC samples. This leads to a longer retention time for the initial color change of the PVC/OBS compared to PVC/Pb or PVC/CaZn systems. This characteristic was related to a more uniform fusion behavior of the PVC/OBS, i.e., the lowest gelation speed and the longest fusion time. The non-isothermal kinetic parameter determined by the Kissinger and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa methods of the dehydrochlorination stage of the PVC/OBS was in satisfactory agreement and continued to compare with the PVC/Pb and PVC/CaZn systems. The results indicated that the OBS might decrease the dehydrochlorination rate of PVC, implying that PVC/OBS was more stable than PVC/Pb and PVC/CaZn systems.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

How Does Ambient Light Affect the Image Quality of Phosphor Plate Digital Radiography? A Quantitative Analysis Using Contemporary Digital Radiographic Systems,"Sampaio-Oliveira M., Marinho-Vieira L.E., Wanderley V.A., Ambrosano G.M.B., Pauwels R., Oliveira M.L.",2022-11-01,"Ambient light, Contrast-to-noise ratio, Dental radiography, Digital dental radiography, Digital radiography, Exposure-time, Images processing, Light exposure, Phosphor plate, X-ray exposure, digital dental radiography, image processing, light","The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the influence of the duration of ambient light exposure on the image quality of digital radiographs obtained with contemporary phosphor plate (PSP)-based systems. Radiographs of an aluminum step-wedge were obtained using VistaScan and Express systems at five X-ray exposure times: 0.10, 0.20, 0.32, 0.40, and 0.50 s; the resulting dose-area products were, respectively, 21.93, 43.87, 70.19, 87.75, and 109.6 mGycm2. Before PSP read-out, half of the sensitive surface of the PSP plates was exposed to ambient light for 5, 10, 30, 60, and 90 s. The effect of light exposure on brightness, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and image saturation was compared using ANOVA with the Tukey test (α = 0.05). Ambient light exposure increased brightness and contrast and reduced CNR and SNR in PSP-based radiographs of contemporary digital systems. At the longest X-ray exposure times, ambient light exposure reduced the dark saturation (mean gray values ≤ 1) observed in Express. In conclusion, the negative effects of ambient light observed on the image quality of PSP-based radiographs are directly proportional to the duration of exposure. Clinicians should be aware of such harmful effects when handling and scanning PSP plates in bright environments.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Here, 12 weeks of oral administration of S. cerevisiae protected cGAS-/- mice from azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancers, partly through dysbiosis attenuation (fecal microbiome analysis). In parallel, a daily intralesional injection of a whole glucan particle (WGP; the beta-glucan extracted from S. cerevisiae) attenuated the growth of subcutaneous tumor using MC38 (murine colon cancer cell line) in cGAS-/- mice. Interestingly, the incubation of fluorescent-stained MC38 with several subtypes of macrophages, including M1 (using Lipopolysaccharide; LPS), M2 (IL-4), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM; using MC38 supernatant activation), could not further reduce the tumor burdens (fluorescent intensity) compared with M0 (control culture media). However, WGP enhanced tumoricidal activities (fluorescent intensity), the genes of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization (IL-1β and iNOS), and Dectin-1 expression and increased cell energy status (extracellular flux analysis) in M0, M2, and TAM. In M1, WGP could not increase tumoricidal activities, Dectin-1, and glycolysis activity, despite the upregulated IL-1β. In conclusion, S. cerevisiae inhibited the growth of colon cancers through dysbiosis attenuation and macrophage energy activation, partly through Dectin-1 stimulation.

Objective: We determined the prevalence of skin diseases among community-based primary school-age children and identified demographic characteristics in relation to particular skin conditions. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive survey study of a subproject school cohort in children aged 5-14 years of 2 community-based primary schools. Demographic data and whole-body skin examination were collected. The association of individual skin conditions was analysed by using bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression. Results: A total of 556 children were enrolled in this study. Of these, 90.2% had at least 1 skin disease. The most common skin disease was postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) (58.3%), followed by nevus/mole (40.1%), insect bite reaction (28.0%), acanthosis nigricans (20.0%), acne (13.7%), and pityriasis alba (12.9%). There was an increase of body mass index (BMI) in PIH and acanthosis nigricans with the adjusted odds ratios of 2.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-2.87, P < 0.001) and 1.93 (95% CI 1.49-2.49, P < 0.001), respectively. Insect bite reaction was related to PIH with the adjusted odds ratio of 5.66 (95% CI 3.15-10.17, P = 0.001). Conclusions: The most common skin disease in community-based primary school-age children is PIH which related to acanthosis nigricans and insect bite reaction. A decrease of BMI may lower the risk for PIH and acanthosis nigricans. Education on common skin diseases is recommended for both community-based schools and school-age children.",medical,Medicine (all)

To assist rapid genetic identification of species, we sampled mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA barcodes (N=78) from 40 species of Culicoides biting midge from Thailand, including 17 species for which DNA barcodes were previously unavailable. The DNA barcodes were assigned to 39 Barcode Identification Numbers (BINs) representing terminal genetic clusters at the Barcode of Life Data systems (BOLD). BINs assisted with comparisons to published conspecific DNA barcodes and allowed partial barcodes obtained from seven specimens to be associated with BINs by their similarity. Some taxonomic issues were revealed and attributed to the possible misidentification of earlier reported specimens as well as a potential synonymy of C. elbeli Wirth & Hubert and C. menglaensis Chu & Liu. Comparison with published BINs also revealed genetic evidence of divergent population processes and or potentially cryptic species in 16 described taxa, flagged by their high levels of COI sequence difference among conspecifics. We recommend the BOLD BIN system to researchers preparing DNA barcodes of vouchered species for public release. This will alert them to taxonomic incongruencies between their records and publicly released DNA barcodes, and also flag genetically deep and potentially novel diversity in described species.",medical,Medicine (all)

Materials and Methods Human coronal dentin disks with a standardized smear layer were deproteinized with 100 ppm HOCl solution for 0 s (control), 15 s or 30 s. After rinsing with water for 30 s and air drying, half of the speci mens were treated with a sulfinate agent (Scotchbond Universal Dual Cure Activator; SDA) prior to the application of a 1-SEA (Bond Force II [Tokuyama Dental] or Clearfil Universal Bond Quick [Kuraray Noritake]). Microtensile bond strength (μTBS) was measured after 24 h or 10,000 thermal cycles (TC). The data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests and t-tests at the 0.05 significance level. Results The 24-h μTBS of both adhesives increased statistically significantly with the HOCl pretreatment for 15s or 30 s (p< 0.05), but it was not statistically significantly affected by the application of SDA (p>0.05). However, after TC, the groups treated with the combination of HOCl and SDA maintained their μTBS (p>0.05), as opposed to un treated dentin and dentin treated with either HOCl or SDA, whose μTBS decreased significantly (p<0.05). Conclusion The application of the sulfinate agent did not statistically significantly affect the immediate bond strength of 1-SEAs, and it could not prevent a significant decrease in the bond strength to untreated dentin after thermocycling. How ever, the sulfinate agent significantly improved the bonding durability of 1-SEAs to HOCl smear-layer deproteinized dentin.",dentistry,"Orthodontics, Oral Surgery, Periodontics"

Our aim is to treat a sample having high concentration of cells to realize high throughput and to prevent the clogging of the microchannel with the use of the discrete DEP. The discrete DEP force for deflecting cells in the device was controlled by adjusting the magnitude, frequency, and duty cycle of the applied voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated by separating the malaria-infected cells in samples having a cell concentration of 106 cells/µl. From experimental results, we determined the enrichment that is needed to enhance the detection in the case of low parasitemia. The enrichment of the infected cells at the device output was 3000 times as high as that of the input containing 1 infected cell to 106 normal cells. Therefore, the proposed method is highly effective and can significantly facilitate the detection of the infected cells for the identification of Malaria patients.","process equipment, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry"

While poly(A) tails in eukaryotes are 80-200 nucleotides long and generally stabilize the RNAs, the poly(A) tails in prokaryotes are significantly shorter and usually destabilize the RNAs. Although Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) direct RNA sequencing provides long-read sequencing that allows poly(A) tail length estimation in recent years, the standard nanopore RNA library preparation, which requires sequencing oligo(dT) adapter ligation, could not capture short poly(A) tail RNAs, especially RNAs in prokaryotes. Hence, we introduced in vitro uridylation and developed a computational processing workflow to dissect poly(A) tails and estimate their length. Using synthetic RNAs as standard, this study provides the workflow for short poly(A) tail length estimation by reassigning underestimated poly(A) tail length using base-called sequencing data and re-segmenting misassigned poly(A) tail. This workflow could be beneficial to obtain poly(A) tail length in different organisms and potentially provide insights into their gene expression, regulation, and modification.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, sociology","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software, Information Systems and Management, Education"

Two bio-based curing agents viz., cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) and citric acid (CA) were employed to create covalent adaptable networks. The 0–0.5 wt% CNTs were also incorporated into epoxy/CNSL/CA matrix (V-CNT0-0.5). Based on the results of our study, thermomechanical properties of V-CNT nanocomposites increased with increasing CNTs content. The bond exchange reaction of esterification was thermally activated by near infrared (NIR) light. The V-CNT0.5 showed the highest self-healing efficiency in Shore D hardness of 97.34%. The corrosion resistance of coated steel with V-CNT0 and V-CNT0.5 were observed after immersing the samples in 3.5 wt% NaCl for 7 days. The corrosion rate of coated steel with V-CNT0.5 decreased from 9.53 × 102 MPY to 3.12 × 10–5 MPY whereas an increase in protection efficiency of 99.99% was observed.

In this work, two nonpathogenic crude oil-degrading bacteria, Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Bacillus aryabhattai TL01-2, isolated from the sponges Chalinula sp. and Clathria reinwardti, respectively, were selected to construct a bacterial consortium named MOTL. The results showed that the strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 had biosurfactant producing abilities and each had the ability to adhere to hydrocarbons. These strains also demonstrated capacities for surviving in the presence of various heavy metals. Moreover, strain MO2-4 contained genes encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes. Consortium MOTL achieved 64%, 63%, and 51% degradation efficiencies for 2000 mg L-1 crude oil, diesel oil, and fuel oil, respectively, within 7 days and still maintained its degradation capacity when the concentration of petroleum oil increased to 8000 mg L-1. The consortium could degrade phenanthrene, tetradecane and a mixture of phenanthrene and tetradecane, and its degradation efficiencies were more effective than those of the individual strains. Consequently, the consortium MOTL is a promising candidate for the full-scale application of petroleum bioremediation in the presence of heavy metals.","petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Properties of mixed species/density cross laminated timber made of rubberwood and coconut wood,"Srivaro S., Lim H., Li M., Pasztory Z.",2022-06-01,"Coconut wood, Cross laminated, Cross laminated timber, Laminated timber, Material cost, Mixed density, Mixed species, Outer layer, Rubberwood, Species density, Coconut wood, Cross laminated timber, Mixed densities, Mixed species, Rubberwood","The utilization of rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis) and coconut wood (Cocos nucifera L.), the essential economic crops in Thailand and tropical countries, was proposed for manufacturing mixed species/density cross-laminated timber (CLT) for building construction. Six 3-layer CLT configurations, which are composed of either medium-density (600 – 799 kg/m3) rubberwood (MRB) or coconut wood (MCC) or high-density (800 – 999 kg/m3) coconut wood (HCC) laminations, were determined considering the mechanical properties and material costs. The outer layers of the control MCC CLT were replaced with either MRB or HCC to improve its mechanical properties, while either outer or core layers of the control MRB CLT were replaced with HCC to reduce its material cost. The material properties of the three wood types and the six CLT configurations were examined. The densities of the produced CLTs were not affected by the chosen manufacturing parameters showing a strong correlation to the lamination's density. From the bonding performance perspective, the mixed-species approach significantly increased the average wood failure percentage of the control MRB CLT. However, only the control MCC CLT achieved the average wood failure percentage greater than 80%, as required in North America's CLT standard. The compressive strength properties of the CLTs in their major strength directions, σclt, were governed by the outer laminations' parallel-to-grain compressive strength. Unlike softwood CLTs, neglecting the load sharing contribution of the core layer in the σclt estimation resulted in 15% underestimation. Rolling shear strength, τrs, was determined by the core laminations regardless of the CLT layups. MRB achieved the highest τrs followed by HCC and MCC, and all values were significantly larger than the common softwood used in CLT production. The results imply that the mixed species/density approaches can effectively improve the mechanical properties of the coconut wood CLT and reduce the material cost of rubberwood CLT without compromising structural performance.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

This was a prospective multicenter study in 7877 singleton pregnancies. The differences of the predictive performance between the IPPIC and CR models were compared. There were 141 women (1.79%) who developed preeclampsia, including 13 cases (0.17%) of early-onset preeclampsia and 128 cases (1.62%) of late-onset preeclampsia. In pregnancies that developed preeclampsia compared to unaffected pregnancies, median serum sFlt-1 levels and its MoMs were not significantly different (p>0.05). There was no significant association between gestational age at delivery and log10 sFlt-1 and log10 sFlt-1 MoM (p>0.05). The areas under the curve of CR models were significantly higher than the IPPIC models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia but not for early-onset preeclampsia. In conclusion, there are no significant differences in the maternal serum sFlt-1 levels at 11-13 weeks’ gestation between women who subsequently develop preeclampsia and those who do not. Moreover, the CR models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia perform better than the IPPIC reported model.",medical,Internal Medicine

This lung cancer type often develops other organ-specific metastases that are critical burdens in the treatment process. Orchid species in the genus Vanda have shown their potential in folkloric medication of diverse diseases but not all its species have been investigated, and little is known about their anticancer activities against NSCLC. Here, we firstly profiled the specialized metabolites of Vanda bensonii and examined their capability to inhibit growth and metastasis of NSCLC using NCI-H460 cells as a study model. Four phytochemicals, including phloretic acid methyl ester (1), cymbinodin-A (2), ephemeranthoquinone B (3), and protocatechuic acid (4), were isolated from the whole plant methanolic extract of V. bensonii. The most distinguished cytotoxic effect on NCI-H460 cells was observed in the treatments with crude methanolic extract and compound 2 with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 40.39 μg mL−1 and 50.82 μM, respectively. At non-cytotoxic doses (10 μg mL−1 or 10 μM), only compound 1 could significantly limit NCI-H460 cell proliferation when treated for 48 h, while others excluding compound 4 showed significant reduction in cell proliferation after treating for 72 h. Compound 1 also significantly decreased the migration rate of NCI-H460 cells examined through a wound-healing assay. Additionally, the crude extract and compound 1 strongly affected survival and growth of NCI-H460 cells under anchorage-independent conditions. Our findings proved that natural products from V. bensonii could be promising candidates for the future pharmacotherapy of NSCLC.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

There are emerging population-based studies suggesting that warfarin may be associated with improved overall survival in cancers. Warfarin has anti-neoplastic activity mediated through both coagulation pathway -dependent and -independent mechanisms, the latter of which includes inhibition of the Gas6-AXL signaling pathway.

The synthesis of PLA-PEI was performed in two steps through a PLA-maleate (PLA-MA) precursor varying the proportion of maleic anhydride (MA) at 1, 2, 3, or 4%(w/w) and the free radical initiator, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-(tert-butylperoxy)hexane, at 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5% (w/w). The effects of the amount of initiator and MA on the degree of maleate grafting was investigated in terms of the acid value by titration. The %MA was found to depend on the amount of initiator, but not on the amount of MA. Next, two different molecular weights of PEI at different proportions [PEI800 at 1–4% (w/w) and PEI25k at 1–2% (w/w)] were modified onto the PLA-MA by the ring opening reaction of the anhydride group and the amino groups of PEI during extrusion. The amount of amino groups was quantitatively determined using the ninhydrin method. The structure of the obtained PLA-MA and PLA-PEI were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. Thermal properties were analyzed by differential scanning colorimetry. The molecular weight determination and melt flow index results implied the degradation of PLA during synthesis of the PLA-MA precursor, or substitution of PEI for PLA-PEI. Antibacterial properties of PLA-PEI were investigated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The multibranched PLA-PEI800 showed a higher crystallization than neat PLA. The PLA modified with a PEI800 content of more than 1% (w/w) and PEI25k showed antibacterial activities against S. aureus in 24 h, but not against E. coli. The % reduction in the number of viable cells (colonies) was proportional to the amino group contents.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The benefit of different B-cation incorporation is to induce the reactive oxygen sites — it plays an essential role in catalysis. Hence, the research aims to study the effect of the Mn element partially replacing Ni-cation in the LaNiO3 structure, so-called double perovskite oxide with LaMnxNi1-xO3-δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). The catalysts were synthesized by the sol–gel method. In addition, comprehensive characterizations such as SEM–EDX, XRD, and XPS were used to study catalyst properties, especially oxygen surface sites. The 5-HMF oxidation reaction was performed in TBHP oxidant and acetonitrile solvent. Besides, crucial operating parameters, i.e., temperature (80–120 °C), pressure (1–5 bar), base addition (0–6 mmol), and time (2–24 h), were studied to predict the optimal reaction conditions. The results show that the variation of the Mn element incorporated with LaNiO3-δ solid affected 5-HMF conversion and the intermediate distribution. The LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3-δ, a high relative O2−latt/Oads ratio catalyst, shows 100% HMF conversion with as much as 61% FDCA yield. The appropriated value of 0.04 mmol Na2CO3 addition, 120 °C operating temperature, and 2-h reaction time suggested for the highly catalyzed 5-HMF oxidation over the alternative LaMnxNi1-xO3-δ catalyst.

Most computational drug repositioning methods focus on known targets. Analyzing multiple aspects of various protein associations provides an opportunity to discover underlying drug-associated proteins that can be used to improve the performance of the drug repositioning approaches. In this study, machine learning models were developed based on the similarities of diversified biological features, including protein interaction, topological network, sequence alignment, and biological function to predict protein pairs associating with the same drugs. The crucial set of features was identified, and the high performances of protein pair predictions were achieved with an area under the curve (AUC) value of more than 93%. Based on drug chemical structures, the drug similarity levels of the promising protein pairs were used to quantify the inferred drug-associated proteins. Furthermore, these proteins were employed to establish an augmented drug-protein matrix to enhance the efficiency of three existing drug repositioning techniques: a similarity constrained matrix factorization for the drug-disease associations (SCMFDD), an ensemble meta-paths and singular value decomposition (EMP-SVD) model, and a topology similarity and singular value decomposition (TS-SVD) technique. The results showed that the augmented matrix helped to improve the performance up to 4% more in comparison to the original matrix for SCMFDD and EMP-SVD, and about 1% more for TS-SVD. In summary, inferring new protein pairs related to the same drugs increase the opportunity to reveal missing drug-associated proteins that are important for drug development via the drug repositioning technique.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

The online controller gain is computed by interpolating between feedback gains of the polyhedral invariant (PI) sets constructed for each vertex of the polytopic uncertainty set so robust stability can be guaranteed as the parameters vary. At each time step, the smallest PI set containing the state is selected for each PI sets sequence. Then, the scheduling parameters are measured and employed in the interpolating between feedback gains of the PI sets. The novelty lies in the fact that the online controller gain is scheduled according to the scheduling parameters so the proposed GSORPC can achieve less conservative results as compared with the conventional offline predictive controller. All optimization problems are solved offline so the online computation is tractable.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Mechanical Engineering, Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The parametric images of brain ECD clearance were generated by linear regression model analysis from serial brain SPECT scans from 30 to 240 min after ECD injection (7-times point) in 7 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and 3 normal volunteers. Clearance patterns of the SOZ confirmed by good surgical outcome or consensus with other investigations were analyzed quantitatively and semi-quantitatively by visual grading (slower or faster washout than contralateral brain regions). The average [99mTc]Tc-ECD clearance rates of SOZs were + 1.08% ± 2.57%/hr (wash in), -7.02% ± 2.56%/hr (washout), and -5.37% ± 1.71%/hr (washout) in ictal, aura and interictal states, respectively. Paired t-tests between the SOZ and contralateral regions showed statistically significant difference (p = 0.039 in interictal state). Clearance patterns that can define the SOZs were 1) wash in and slow washout on ictal slope, 2) fast washout on aura slope and interictal slope with 100% (6/6), 100% (2/2) and 75% (6/8) localization using ictal, aura, and interictal slope maps, respectively.

Alternatively, stimulating PHB levels by chemical exposure is desirable because it might be applied to various cyanobacterial strains. However, the study of such chemicals is still limited. Here, 19 compounds previously reported to affect bacterial cellular processes were evaluated for their effect on PHB accumulation in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, where 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, methyl viologen, arsenite, phenoxyethanol and 2-phenylethanol were found to increase PHB accumulation. When cultivated with optimal nitrate supply, Synechocystis contained less than 0.5% [w/w dry weight (DW)] PHB, while cultivation under -N conditions increased the PHB content to 7% (w/w DW). Interestingly, the -N cultivation combined with 2-phenylethanol exposure reduced the Synechocystis protein content by 27% (w/w DW) but significantly increased PHB levels up to 33% (w/w DW), the highest ever reported photoautotrophic cyanobacterial PHB accumulation in a wild-type strain. Results from transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis suggested that under 2-phenylethanol treatment, Synechocystis proteins were degraded to amino acids, which might be subsequently utilized as the source of carbon and energy for PHB biosynthesis. 2-Phenylethanol treatment also increased the levels of metabolites required for Synechocystis PHB synthesis (acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and NADPH). Additionally, under -N, the exposure to phenoxyethanol and 2-phenylethanol increased the PHB levels of Anabaena sp. from 0.4% to 4.1% and 6.6% (w/w DW), respectively.

Our study uses a simplified data transformation approach by transforming the 1-dimensional (1D) time-series signal into 2-dimensional (2D) synchronized beat images. These images can simply capture and visualize all the information in the record. The classification task is performed based on a novel lightweight neural network such as MobileNetV2 via transferred learning. The effect on AF detection performance due to the quality of the image is examined using uncompressed and compressed ECG images.

Enhanced Bacteremia in Dextran Sulfate‐Induced Colitis in Splenectomy Mice Correlates with Gut Dysbiosis and LPS Tolerance,"Thim-uam A., Makjaroen J., Issara-amphorn J., Saisorn W., Wannigama D.L., Chancharoenthana W., Leelahavanichkul A.",2022-02-01,"Animals, Bacteremia, Colitis, Dextran Sulfate, Dysbiosis, Immune Tolerance, Lipopolysaccharides, Male, Mice, Splenectomy, Dysbiosis, Endotoxemia, Gut barrier defect, Splenectomy","Because both endotoxemia and gut dysbiosis post‐splenectomy might be associated with systemic infection, the susceptibility against infection was tested by dextran sulfate solution (DSS)‐ induced colitis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection models in splenectomy mice with macrophage experiments. Here, splenectomy induced a gut barrier defect (FITC‐dextran assay, endotoxemia, bacteria in mesenteric lymph nodes, and the loss of enterocyte tight junction) and gut dysbiosis (increased Proteobacteria by fecal microbiome analysis) without systemic inflammation (serum IL‐6). In parallel, DSS induced more severe mucositis in splenectomy mice than sham‐DSS mice, as indicated by mortality, stool consistency, gut barrier defect, serum cytokines, and blood bacterial burdens. The presence of green fluorescent‐producing (GFP) E. coli in the spleen of sham‐DSS mice after an oral gavage supported a crucial role of the spleen in the control of bacteria from gut translocation. Additionally, LPS administration in splenectomy mice induced lower serum cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐6) than LPS‐administered sham mice, perhaps due to LPS tolerance from pre‐existing post‐splenectomy endotoxemia. In macrophages, LPS tolerance (sequential LPS stimulation) demonstrated lower cell activities than the single LPS stimulation, as indicated by the reduction in supernatant cytokines, pro‐inflammatory genes (iNOS and IL‐1β), cell energy status (extracellular flux analysis), and enzymes of the glycolysis pathway (proteomic analysis). In conclusion, a gut barrier defect after splenectomy was vulnerable to enterocyte injury (such as DSS), which caused severe bacteremia due to defects in microbial control (asplenia) and endotoxemia‐induced LPS tolerance. Hence, gut dysbiosis and gut bacterial translocation in patients with a splenectomy might be associated with systemic infection, and gut‐barrier monitoring or intestinal tight‐junction strengthening may be useful.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Despite being the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor for relapsed/refractory MCL, resistance to bortezomib (BTZ) in MCL patients remains a major hurdle of effective therapy, and relapse following BTZ is frequent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying BTZ resistance is, therefore, important for improving the clinical outcome and developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we established de novo BTZ-resistant human MCL-derived cells with the highest resistance index of 300-fold compared to parental cells. We provided compelling evidence that both Bcl-xL and Bax are key mediators in determining BTZ sensitivity in MCL cells. Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and depletion of proapoptotic Bax cooperatively protected MCL cells against BTZ-induced apoptosis, causing acquired BTZ resistance, likely by tilting the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins toward antiapoptotic signaling. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that high BCL2L1 (encoded Bcl-xL) and low BAX were, in part, associated with poor prognosis of MCL patients, e.g., when combined with low OGT, which regulates cellular O-GlcNAcylation. Our findings support recent strategies in small molecule drug discovery co-targeting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins using BH3 mimetics and Bax using Bax activators to overcome cancer drug resistance.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

However, the region cannot deny that its diverse population and strategic location have become a center of attention for global players to invest in the region. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, digital transformation has become mandatory for any organizations or nations in Southeast Asia to consider. Through SEACHI (Southeast Asian CHI) Symposium, we aim to grow awareness in HCI and UX to improve the design and development of technology for a living and bring together the Southeast Asian academic researchers and industry practitioners. As HCI is maturing in Asia, we identified the remarkable growth and needs of HCI in the Southeast Asian community. In this symposium, we have several questions that we would like to answer: To what extent the HCI and UX that has been taught and practiced in Southeast Asia met the needs to support the digital transformation initiatives in the region; whether there has been any significant and proper contextualization of the HCI and UX fields; whether HCI and UX are still perceived as a Western mindset instead of a localized approach to make a difference in any projects; whether HCI and UX have become a standard norm in the digital product and design process and how HCI and UX players in Southeast Asia have worked together to create a unique ecosystem. Under the big conference theme ""Equity, Justice and Access Commitments,""the symposium aims to bring about equal and fair access for anyone to exchange information and transfer knowledge in this multidisciplinary environment and multi-socioeconomic aspects of research and practice HCI and UX in Southeast Asia.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Software"
Extremely halophilic strains of Halobacterium salinarum as a potential starter culture for fish sauce fermentation,"Udomsil N., Pongjanla S., Rodtong S., Tanasupawat S., Yongsawatdigul J.",2022-12-01,"Animals, Biogenic Amines, Fermentation, Fish Products, Fishes, Food Microbiology, Halobacterium salinarum, 16S rRNA, GC-MS, histamine, protein hydrolysis, proteinase-producing halophilic archaea","Proteinase-producing halophilic archaea were isolated from Thai fish sauce collected from industrial fermentation tanks at various periods of fermentation. Five isolates namely, J-1-S4, J-1-S13, J-1-S22, 2 m-40-15-R2, and P-1-S8, were identified as Halobacterium salinarum with slightly different colony and morphological characteristics among isolates. Starters of five isolates were prepared and added to the anchovy mixed with 25% solar salt and fermented for 180 days at 30–35°C. Halophilic bacteria/archaea counts of inoculated samples were decreased and undetected after 120 days of fermentation. At 180 days of fermentation, α-amino group contents of inoculated fish sauce samples (856–1010 mM) and total nitrogen content (2.2%–2.5%) were higher than the control without archaea inoculation (p < 0.05). All samples contained low amounts of biogenic amines, suggesting that all starters were not biogenic amine formers. The major volatile compound found in samples inoculated with H. salinarum P-1-S8 and H. salinarum 2 m-40-15-R2 was 3-methylbutanal, which contributes to the meaty note. Dimethyl disulfide, a compound that contributes to fecal note, was detected in all inoculated samples in a lower amount than in the commercial fish sauce (p < 0.05). Thus, H. salinarum accelerated protein hydrolysis and produced desirable volatile compounds during fish sauce fermentation in a strain-specific manner.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Food Science
Physical function limitation among gay and bisexual men aged ≥55 years with and without HIV: findings from the Australian Positive and Peers Longevity Evaluation Study (APPLES),"Boettiger D.C., Huque M.H., Bloch M., Woolley I., Templeton D.J., Law M.G., Fraser N., Hoy J., Petoumenos K.",2022-01-01,"Australia, Cross-Sectional Studies, HIV Infections, Humans, Malus, Middle Aged, aging, Australia, gay and bisexual, HIV, men, physical, physical function, physical function limitation","Background: As people living with HIV now have a life expectancy approaching that of the general population, clinical care focuses increasingly on the management and prevention of comorbidities and conditions associated with aging. We aimed to assess the prevalence of physical function (PF) limitation among gay and bisexual men (GBM) and determine whether HIV is associated with severe PF limitation in this population. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional data from GBM aged ≥55 years in the Australian Positive and Peers Longevity Evaluation Study who completed a self-administered survey on health and lifestyle factors. PF was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study-Physical Functioning scale. Factors associated with severe PF limitation were assessed using logistic regression. Results: The survey was completed by 381 men: 186 without HIV and 195 with HIV. Median age was 64.3 years for GBM without HIV and 62.1 years for GBM with HIV. Compared with men without HIV, those with HIV had higher proportions of severe (13.3% vs 8.1%) and moderate-to-severe (26.7% vs 24.2%) PF limitation. Severe PF limitation commonly involved difficulty with vigorous activity (95% with severe PF limitation described being limited a lot), climbing several flights of stairs (68.4% limited a lot), bending, kneeling or stooping (60.5% limited a lot), and walking 1 km (55.0% limited a lot). In a model adjusted for age, body mass index, typical duration of physical activity, psychological distress, and number of comorbidities, we found a significant association between HIV and severe PF limitation (adjusted odds ratio 3.3 vs not having HIV, 95% confidence interval 1.3-8.7). Conclusions: The biological mechanisms underlying this association require further investigation, particularly given the growing age of the HIV population and inevitable increase in the burden of PF limitation.",medical,Medicine (all)
Exploring of paritaprevir and glecaprevir resistance due to A156T mutation of HCV NS3/4A protease: molecular dynamics simulation study,"Boonma T., Nutho B., Darai N., Rungrotmongkol T., Nunthaboot N.",2022-01-01,"Aminoisobutyric Acids, Antiviral Agents, Cyclopropanes, Drug Resistance, Viral, Hepacivirus, Lactams, Macrocyclic, Leucine, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Mutation, Proline, Protease Inhibitors, Quinoxalines, Serine Proteases, Sulfonamides, Viral Nonstructural Proteins, A156T, glecaprevir, Hepatitis C virus, molecular dynamics simulation, NS3/4A protease, paritaprevir","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A serine protease is a promising drug target for the discovery of anti-HCV drugs. However, its amino acid mutations, particularly A156T, commonly lead to rapid emergence of drug resistance. Paritaprevir and glecaprevir, the newly FDA-approved HCV drugs, exhibit distinct resistance profiles against the A156T mutation of HCV NS3/4A serine protease. To illustrate their different molecular resistance mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations were carried out on the two compounds complexed with both wild-type (WT) and A156T variants of HCV NS3/4A protease. QM/MM-GBSA-based binding free energy calculations revealed that the binding affinities of paritaprevir and glecaprevir towards A156T NS3/4A were significantly reduced by ∼4 kcal/mol with respect to their WT complexes, which were in line with the experimental resistance folds. Moreover, the relatively weak intermolecular interactions with amino acids such as H57, R155, and T156 of NS3 protein, the steric effect and the destabilized protein binding surface, which is caused by the loss of salt bridge between R123 and D168, are the main contributions for the higher fold-loss in potency of glecaprevir due to A156T mutation. An insight into the difference of molecular mechanism of drug resistance against the A156T substitution among the two classes of serine protease inhibitors could be useful for further optimization of new generation HCV NS3/4A inhibitors with enhanced inhibitory potency.

More than 90% of cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccines developed only guard against a few HPV types and do not protect people who have already been infected. HPV is a small DNA virus that infects the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the skin and mucosa through small breaks and replicates as the cells differentiate. The mucosal types of HPV can be classified into low-risk and high-risk groups, based on their association with cancer. Among HPV types in high-risk group, HPV type 16 (HPV-16) is the most common, causing 50% of all cancer cases. HPV infection can occur as transient or persistent infections, based on the ability of immune system to clear the virus. Persistent infection is characterized by the integration of HPV genome. HPV-16 exhibits a different integration pattern, with only 50% reported to be integrated at the carcinoma stage. Replication of the HPV genome depends on protein E1, an ATP-dependent helicase. E1 is essential for the amplification of the viral episome in infected cells. Previous studies have shown that E1 does not only act as a helicase protein but is also involved in recruiting and interacting with other host proteins. E1 has also been deemed to drive host cell proliferation. Recent studies have emphasized the emerging role of HPV E1 in cervical carcinogenesis. In this review, a possible mechanism by which E1 drives cell proliferation and oncogenesis will be discussed.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Higher blood pressure versus normotension targets to prevent acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials,"Tran P.N.T., Kusirisin P., Kaewdoungtien P., Phannajit J., Srisawat N.",2022-12-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Blood Pressure, Humans, Hypertension, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Renal Replacement Therapy, Acute kidney injury, Hypertension, Mean arterial blood pressure, Perioperative, Renal replacement therapy, Shock","Background: Renal hypoperfusion is one of the most common causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), especially in shock and perioperative patients. An optimal blood pressure (BP) target to prevent AKI remains undetermined. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized clinical trial (RCT) results to address this knowledge gap. Methods: From inception to May 13, 2022, we searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, clinicaltrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP for RCTs comparing higher BP target versus normotension in hemodynamically unstable patients (shock, post-cardiac arrest, or surgery patients). The outcomes of interest were post-intervention AKI rate and renal replacement therapy (RRT) rate. Two investigators independently screened the citations and reviewed the full texts for eligible studies according to a predefined form. Results: Twelve trials were included, enrolling a total of 5759 participants, with shock, non-cardiac, and cardiac surgery patients accounting for 3282 (57.0%), 1687 (29.3%) and 790 (13.7%) patients, respectively. Compared to lower mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) targets that served as normotension, targeting higher MAP had no significant effect on AKI rates in shock (RR [95% CI] = 1.10 [0.93, 1.29]), in cardiac-surgery (RR [95% CI] = 0.87 [0.73, 1.03]) and non-cardiac surgery patients (RR [95% CI] = 1.25 [0.98, 1.60]) using random-effects meta-analyses. In shock patients with premorbid hypertension, however, targeting MAP above 70 mmHg resulted in significantly lower RRT risks, RR [95%CI] = 1.20 [1.03, 1.41], p < 0.05. Conclusions: Targeting a higher MAP in shock or perioperative patients may not be superior to normotension, except in shock patients with premorbid hypertension. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of a high MAP target to preventing AKI in hypertensive patients across common settings of hemodynamic instability.

Improvement of stress-strain behavior of brick-waste aggregate concrete using low-cost FCSM composites,"Joyklad P., Ali N., Chaiyasarn K., Poovarodom N., Yooprasertchai E., Maqbool H.M., Ruangrassamee A., Hussain Q.",2022-10-10,"Brick aggregate, Chopped strand mat, Clay brick aggregate, Clay bricks, Fiber reinforced polymer sheets, Fiberglass chopped strand mat, Low-costs, Recycled aggregate concrete, Stress and strain, Ultimate compressive stress and strain, Analytical models, Clay brick aggregates, Fiberglass Chopped Strand Mat (FCSM), Recycled aggregate concrete, Ultimate compressive stress and strain","Reusing the waste materials generated from demolishing existing infrastructures can play a vital role in minimizing their detrimental environmental impacts. A substantial portion of the total construction waste comprises brick wastes (B-waste). It has already been established that recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) fabricated using recycled clay brick aggregates (CBA) lacks adequate compressive strength and corresponding strain. This limits the application of RAC-CBA to mainly non-load-bearing works. External strengthening of RAC using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets has been found beneficial in terms of the improvement in ultimate compressive strength and ultimate strain. With massive costs associated with synthetic FRP sheets, this study proposes the use of Fiberglass Chopped Strand Mat (FCSM) sheets as a low-cost alternative to synthetic FRP sheets to improve compressive strength and behavior of RAC-CBA. To accomplish this, RAC was constructed with three different waste brick aggregates, mainly hollow-clay, solid-clay, and hydraulic cement-clay interlocking bricks. Typical cylinders of size 150 mm in diameter × 300 mm in height were cast and strengthened using 2, 4, and 6 layers of FCSM sheets. It was found that FCSM sheets successfully enhanced the ultimate compressive strength and strain of RAC-CBA irrespective of the type of constituting brick aggregates. Further, a correlation in the improvement of axial compressive behavior was found with the number of external FCSM sheets. The accuracy of existing ultimate strength-strain models was assessed in predicting the experimental ultimate stress and strain. In general, none of the existing models exhibited a consistent trend in predicting the axial behavior of RAC-CBA. Hence, the ultimate stress–strain models were proposed.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

The tandem catalysis with the Ru-Macho-BH complex and ethylenediamine (EDA) was investigated. Three possible routes, Route A, B, and C, were realized for the process. Route A (δE > 60 kcal mol−1) consists of three steps, formic acid formation, formamide formation, and methanol formation (from alkanolamine). Route B (δE = 35.07 kcal mol−1) contains four steps, formic acid formation, formamide formation, formaldehyde synthesis, and methanol formation (from formaldehyde). Route C (δE = 39.14 kcal mol−1), a non-amine route, involves three steps, formic acid formation, formaldehyde dehydration, and methanol formation. Route B has the lowest energetic span and, thus, we propose it as a favorite route for CO2 conversion to methanol. Although Route C has a lower activation barrier, it has a larger δE. The exogenic reaction of the formamide formation step in Route B can affect lower energy requirements in further methanol formation. In the absence of EDA, CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid cannot produce, because the formate form is trapped by the catalyst. Thus, it can explain why CO2 conversion to methanol is impossible without the presence of amines.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Herein, we investigated the use of ethylene carbonate (EC) as an electrolyte additive to improve the performance of ZIBs. The addition of 6% (w/v) EC substantially enhanced the first-cycle discharge capacity from 115 to 203 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, while retaining this high discharge capacity (102% retention of the initial capacity) after 200 cycles, and from 43 to 54 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 85% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles. The ex-situ characterizations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis before and after Zn–MnO2 and Zn–Zn battery cycling suggested that the addition of EC could effectively suppress dendrite formation and parasitic reactions on the Zn anode, possibly via electrolyte/Zn anode interface film formation in the presence of EC. Moreover, the presence of EC made the MnO2 morphology more open and accessible. These led to substantial improvements in the rate performance and cyclability compared to the additive-free electrolyte.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)

Because of increasing biodiesel consumption, the volume of glycerol being produced has grown significantly, leading to a large surplus and, consequently, a dramatic drop in its market value. Thus, the valorization of glycerol into chemicals is a promising pathway toward sustainability in biodiesel industries. This study focused on upgrading biodiesel plant-derived glycerol into short-chain polyglycerols (PG), which are used as intermediates for producing emulsifiers in several consumer products, via catalytic etherification. To enhance environmental sustainability, solvent-free etherification of glycerol was performed over mixed oxides derived from magnesium–aluminum layered double hydroxides (MgAl LDH).

Step 2 is a screening by 3 physical fitness testing tools including Time Up and Go test (TUG), 30-s Chair Stand, and 4-stage balance test. Participants were then followed for their fall incidents. Statistical analyses were conducted by using Cox proportional hazard model. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant predictive validity indices were then estimated. Results: The average age of the participants was 73.3 ± 6.51 years (range 65–95 years), and 52.5% of them were female. The screening based on the clinician’s 3 key questions in Step 1 had a high AUC (0.845), with the sensitivity and specificity of 93.9% (95% CI 88.8, 92.7) and 75.0% (95% CI 70.0, 79.6), respectively. Appropriate risk categorization however differed slightly from the original STEADI program. Conclusions: With some modification, the fall risk screening algorithm based on the STEADI program was applicable in Thai context.",medical,Medicine (all)
Enhanced transdermal insulin basal release from silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels via iontophoresis,"Sakunpongpitiporn P., Naeowong W., Sirivat A.",2022-01-01,"Administration, Cutaneous, Animals, Fibroins, Hydrogels, Insulin, Iontophoresis, Swine, diabetes, insulin, iontophoresis controlled release, Silk fibroin, transdermal drug delivery","Insulin is the peptide hormone used to treat the diabetes patient. The hormone is normally taken by injection. The transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) is an alternative route. The silk fibroin (SF) hydrogels were fabricated via solution casting as the insulin matrix. The release and release-permeation experiments of the insulin loaded SF hydrogels were carried out using a modified Franz-diffusion cell at 37 °C for 36 h, under the effects of SF concentrations, pH, and electric field. The release-permeation mechanism through the pig skin was from the Case-II transport with the constant release rate. The diffusion coefficient (D) increased with decreasing SF concentration due to a larger mesh size, and with increasing electric field due to the electroreplusive forces between the insulin and the SF hydrogels against the negatively-charged electrode, and the induced SF hydrogel expansion. The rate and amount of insulin release-permeation became relatively lower as it required a longer time to generate aqueous pathways through the pig skin. The present SF hydrogels are demonstrated here deliver insulin with the required constant release rate, and the suitable amount within a prescribed duration.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai), a self-rated, brief, questionnaire is a potential tool for screening for sexual dysfunction in this population. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of ASEX-Thai in Thai patients with mental disorders. Methods: We enrolled 202 patients from an outpatient psychiatric department at a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Demographic data, clinical data, and diagnosis of sexual dysfunction were assessed. ASEX-Thai was done, and we analyzed the test's psychometric properties. Results: Most participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (48%). A score of ≥ 17 points of the ASEX-Thai was the most suitable for sexual dysfunction screening (sensitivity 77.23 %, and specificity 58.42 %). For reliability, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.831) showed good internal consistency. Conclusions: The ASEX-Thai is a valid and reliable self-rated questionnaire for screening for sexual dysfunction among Thai patients with mental disorders. The test could help clinicians to evaluate this undetected condition and deliver proper interventions.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

Numerous DfCWM practices have been recommended, but they are hitherto in a piecemeal fashion without an integrative guideline to enable designers to consider DfCWM in a systematic manner. Their practice examples and application results have also been rarely investigated. This study aims to amalgamate DfCWM recommendations, develop practicable guidelines, and implement in real-world settings. It adopts a design thinking method to develop the guidelines from literature, brainstorming, action research, case study, and most importantly, dynamic iteration thereof. The results affirm the impact of DfCWM on not only preventing construction waste generation effectively but reducing the construction cost without jeopardizing the design. However, its implementation is not merely a simple linear process and requires coordination from all stakeholders. For practitioners, this research also provides the DfCWM guidelines to be a design companion, encouraging deliberation of an entire building and material life cycle with special consideration given to waste minimization. Further studies are suggested for two areas: (a) modelling DfCWM into a multi-criteria optimization problem, and (b) integrating it with other design for excellence considerations.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Business","Architecture, Building and Construction, Business, Management and Accounting (all)"

Methods: Two hundred and sixty-eight parturients with pre-delivery hypotension after spinal anesthesia were equally randomized to (1) Group P/E (n = 134), phenylephrine 100 mcg in 10 mL intravenously if HR ≥ 60 beats/min (bpm), or ephedrine 6 mg intravenously if HR < 60 bpm, and 2) Group C (n = 134). The primary outcome was the incidence of the parturients with abnormal HR after vasopressor administration. The secondary outcome was the mean differences of HR and hypotensive periods during the pre-delivery period. Results: There was no significant difference of between-group incidences of bradycardia (12.0% in Group P/E vs 6.7% in Group C, p = 0.136) and tachycardia (26.9% vs 35.8%, p = 0.114). Mean HR was 81.9 bpm (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.9, 84.3) in Group P/E, and 88.8 bpm (86.8, 90.6) in Group C (p < 0.001). The duration of hypotension in relation to the time interval from spinal anesthesia to delivery was 20.9% (95% CI 18.4–23.2) in Group P/E, and 26.5% (23.9–29.3) in Group C (p < 0.01). The calculated area under the curve (AUC) of abnormal HR in relation to time was significantly reduced only in Group P/E (p < 0.010).

This study aimed to fabricate pH-responsive Zn2+-releasing glass particles and evaluate their solubilities, ion-releasing characteristics, and antibacterial properties in vitro. Three kinds of silicate-based glass particles containing different molar ratios of Zn (PG-1: 25.3; PG-2: 34.6; PG-3: 42.7 mol%) were fabricated. Each particle was immersed in a pH-adjusted medium, and the solubility and concentration of the released ions were determined. To evaluate the antibacterial effect, Streptococcus mutans was cultured in the pH-adjusted medium in the presence of each particle, and the bacterial number was counted. The solubility and concentration of Zn2+ released in the medium increased with a decrease in medium pH. PG-3 with a greater content of Zn demonstrated higher concentrations of released Zn2+ compared with PG-1 and PG-2. PG-2 exhibited bactericidal effects at pH 5.1, whereas PG-3 demonstrated bactericidal effects at pH values of 5.1 and 6.1, indicating that PG-3 was effective at inhibiting S. mutans even under slightly acidic conditions. The glass particle with 42.7 mol% Zn may be useful for developing smart antibacterial restoratives that contribute to the prevention of diseases such as caries on root surfaces with lower acid resistance.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The tacrolimus concentration within peripheral blood mononuclear cells ([Tac]cells) might correlate better with clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells, the evolution of [Tac]cells and the [Tac]cells/[Tac]blood ratio, and to assess the relationship between tacrolimus concentrations and the occurrence of rejection. Methods: In this prospective study, samples for the measurement of [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells were collected on days 3 and 10 after kidney transplantation, and on the morning of a for-cause kidney transplant biopsy. Biopsies were reviewed according to the Banff 2019 update. Results: Eighty-three [Tac]cells samples were measured of 44 kidney transplant recipients. The correlation between [Tac]cells and [Tac]blood was poor (Pearson's r = 0.56 (day 3); r = 0.20 (day 10)). Both the dose-corrected [Tac]cells and the [Tac]cells/[Tac]blood ratio were not significantly different between days 3 and 10, and the median inter-occasion variability of the dose-corrected [Tac]cells and the [Tac]cells/[Tac]blood ratio were 19.4% and 23.4%, respectively (n = 24). Neither [Tac]cells, [Tac]blood, nor the [Tac]cells/[Tac]blood ratio were significantly different between patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection (n = 4) and patients with acute tubular necrosis (n = 4) or a cancelled biopsy (n = 9; p > 0.05). Conclusion: Tacrolimus exposure and distribution appeared stable in the early phase after transplantation. [Tac]cells was not significantly associated with the occurrence of rejection. A possible explanation for these results might be related to the low number of patients included in this study and also due to the fact that PBMCs are not a specific enough matrix to monitor tacrolimus concentrations.",biochemistryistry,Clinical Biochemistry

The effects of rotational disc speed (R), volumetric flow rate (Q) and disc surface on the liquid flow pattern, extraction efficiency (E) and overall mass transfer coefficient (kLa) were studied. Three disc surface types were considered including 1) smooth disc, 2) roughness A disc (metal sandpaper P36), and 3) roughness B disc (metal sandpaper P24). The highest values of E and kLa were 69.7% and 9.59 s−1 when using the roughness B disc surface operated at R of 1000 rpm and Q of 5 mL/s. A 3D-multiphase CFD model was applied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics in the SDR for further understanding of the mass transfer performance in the SDR. The dissipation rate (ε) and micromixing time (tm) were proposed to compare the turbulent degree of each disc surface. The mass transfer performance was significantly enhanced by using the metal sandpaper as the disc surface.

To assess the prudent use of antibiotic in reptiles, this study was conducted to explore the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CLA in the freshwater crocodile, Crocodylus siamensis, following either single intravenous (i.v.) or intramuscular (i.m.) administration at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Blood samples were collected at assigned times up to 168 h. CLA plasma samples were cleaned up using liquid–liquid extraction, and analysed by a validated liquid chromatography tandem–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). CLA was quantifiable from 5 min to 72 h after i.v. administration, whereas it was detectable for 168 after i.m. administration at an identical dose rate. A non-compartmental model was used to fit the plasma concentration of CLA versus time curve for each crocodile. The t1/2λz value, similar for both routes (20 h), indicated that the overall rate of elimination of CLA in crocodiles is relatively slow. The average i.m. F% was complete. The protein plasma bound was found to be about 30%. CLA is a time-dependent antibiotic, and the T > MIC is the best PK/PD predictor for its efficacy. The CLA dosage of 2.5 mg/kg appeared to produce an appropriate value of the PK-PD surrogate that predicts antibacterial success for disease caused by susceptible bacteria.","pharmacology, Veterinary Science","Pharmacology, Veterinary (all)"

Due to the inherently subjective nature of human perception, translating soundscape attributes using only small focus group discussions or expert panels could lead to translations with psycholinguistic meanings that, in a non-expert setting, deviate or distort from that of the source language. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation method based on the circumplex model of soundscape perception to assess the overall translation quality. By establishing a set of criteria for evaluating the linguistic and psychometric properties of the translation candidates, statistical analyses can be performed to objectively assess specific strengths and weaknesses of the translation candidates before committing to listening tests or more involved validation experiments. As an initial application domain, we demonstrated the use of the quantitative evaluation framework in the context of an English-to-Thai translation of soundscape attributes. A total of 31 participants who are bilingual in English and Thai were recruited to assess the translation candidates. Subsequent statistical analysis of the evaluation scores revealed acoustico-psycholinguistic properties of the translation candidates which were not previously identified by the expert panel and facilitated a more objective selection of the final translations for subsequent usage. Additionally, with specific biases of the final translations determined numerically, mathematical and statistical techniques for corrections of the survey data may be employed in the future to improve cross-lingual compatibility in soundscape evaluation.","fluidex; related topics, physics",Acoustics and Ultrasonics

The optimum pHs for mesophilic amylomaltases are around pH 6.0–7.0, while the thermostable amylomaltases are generally active at more acidic conditions. Size of LR-CDs depends on the source of amylomaltases and the reaction conditions including pH, temperature, incubation time, and substrate. For example, in the case of amylomaltase from Corynebacterium glutamicum, LR-CD productions at alkaline pH or at a long incubation time favored products with a low degree of polymerization.

In addition, the previous analytical model was extended to predict the axial load-strain relationships of the PEC columns with H-shaped steel sections. A good agreement between the predicted load-strain relationships and test data was observed. Using the analytical model, the effects of compressive strength of concrete (21 to 69 MPa), yield strength of steel (245 to 525 MPa), slenderness ratio of flange (4 to 10), and slenderness ratio of web (10 to 25) on the interactive mechanism (Kh = confinement factor for highly confined concrete and Kw = reduction factor for steel web) and ductility index (DI = ratio between strain at peak load and strain at proportional load) were assessed.

Smtnl2-deficient Sertoli cells exhibited defective ability to engulf apoptotic germ cells and importantly, the phenomenon occurred in the setting of an unaffected maturation of phagosome. We demonstrated that Smtnl2 regulates the engulfment process through the function of branched actin nucleation protein ARP3, an actin assembly dictator. Intriguingly, a shift in glucose metabolism that restricts lactate production in Sertoli cells was induced upon Smtnl2 depletion, leading to the activation of downstream AMPK and AKT signaling. Using an in vivo RNAi approach, we found that silencing of Smtnl2 in testis triggers an obvious disruption in cytoskeleton architecture and blood-testis barrier integrity across seminiferous epithelium, causing the detachment of massive germ cells from their nest, as evidenced by their exfoliation into the lumen. Overall, our study identifies Smtnl2 as a determinant for Sertoli cells’ functioning in supporting spermatogenesis.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Endocrinology"
Enhancing the potential of sugarcane bagasse for the production of ENplus quality fuel pellets by torrefaction: an economic feasibility study,"Jarunglumlert T., Bampenrat A., Sukkathanyawat H., Prommuak C., Pavasant P.",2022-01-01,"Ash contents, Biomass fuels, Economic feasibilities, Feasibility studies, Fuel pellet, Fuel substitution, Greenhouse gas emissions, Potential feedstock, Sugar-cane bagasse, Torrefaction, Agricultural waste, Biomass, Fuel pellet, Sugarcane bagasse, Torrefaction","When fossil fuel substitution with biomass is viewed as a potential solution to global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the demand for biomass fuel pellets has increased worldwide. Although agricultural waste is an attractive potential feedstock for fuel pellet production due to its relatively high calorific value and low cost, its excessive ash content is a major drawback. This research investigates the properties of sugarcane bagasse fuel pellets treated by dry and wet torrefaction and evaluates the economic value of selling the fuel pellets, which were priced based on their quality. It was found that the wet torrefaction could significantly reduce the ash content in the product (1% ash content at a torrefaction temperature of above 180°C), resulting in higher quality and more marketable fuel pellets. Consequently, the yield and the net present value of the production of wet torrefied fuel pellets were greater than those of dry torrefied pellets. Nevertheless, the production of fuel pellets from sugarcane bagasse treated by either process is shown to be economically viable.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

The OCPEMFC performance is evaluated at various humidifier distances from the cathode inlet, and it is compared with that where no humidifier is used when the OCPEMFC operates under three different current levels of 1, 5, and 8 A. The results show that the novel design improves the stack power, and optimal performance is achieved at a humidifier distance of 2 cm. The energy efficiency achieves an improvement between 1.4% and 1.8% when a humidifier is used.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

With the proposed PWM strategy, the upper and lower dc bus voltages can be controlled separately in a decoupled manner. These characteristics are crucial in photovoltaic applications (PV) when tracking of maximum power points for two strings of PV panels under different irradiations is required. Independent control of input dc-bus power is achieved by simply decomposing the voltage command of the inverter in proportional to the required dc-bus power. Implementation of the proposed PWM strategy is also simple because it uses double carrier waveforms supported by PWM modules in most hardware. Effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed PWM theory are verified by experiment.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization"
Design of a More Efficient Rotating-EM Energy Floor with Lead-Screw and Clutch Mechanism,"Jintanawan T., Phanomchoeng G., Suwankawin S., Thamwiphat W., Khunkiat V., Watanasiri W.",2022-09-01,"Electromagnetic generators, Energy, Energy floor tile, Energy harvesting paver, Floor tile, Footstep energy harvesting, One way clutch, Piezoelectric, Power, Power management systems, clutch, electromagnetic generator, energy floor tile, energy harvesting, energy harvesting paver, footstep energy harvesting, piezoelectric, power management system","There is an interest in harvesting energy from people’s footsteps in crowded areas to power smart electronic devices with low consumption. The average power consumption of these devices is approximately 10 μW. The energy from our footsteps is green and free, because walking is a routine activity in everyday life. The energy floor is one of the most efficient pieces of equipment in vibration-based energy harvesting. The paper aims to improve the previous design of the energy floor—called Genpath—which uses a rotational electromagnetic (EM) technique to generate electricity from human footsteps. The design consists of two main parts of (1) the EM generator, including the lead-screw mechanism for translation-to-rotation conversion, and (2) the Power Management and Storage (PMS) circuit. The improvement was focused on the part of the EM generator. A thorough investigation of the design components reveals that the EM generator shaft in the previous Genpath design cannot continuously rotate when the floor-tile reaches the bottom end, resulting in no energy gain. Therefore, a one-way clutch is implemented to the system to disengage the generator shaft from the lead-screw motion when the floor-tile reaches the allowable displacement. During the disengagement, the EM generator shaft still proceeds with a free rotation and could generate more power. In our analysis, the dynamic model of the electro-mechanical systems with the one-way clutch was successfully developed and used to predict the energy performances of the VEH floors and fine-tune the design parameters. The analytical result is shown that the spring stiffness mainly affects the force transmitted to the EM generator, and then the induced voltage and power of the generator, thus, the value of the stiffness is one of the critical design parameters to optimize. Finally, the new prototype consisting of 12-V-DC generator, mechanisms of lead-screw and clutch, as well as coil springs with the optimal stiffness of 1700 N/m was built and tested. The average energy produced by the new prototype is 3637 mJ (or average power of 3219 mW), per footstep which is 2935 mJ greater than that of the previous design. Moreover, to raise the social awareness about energy usage, the sets of Genpath have been used to organize an exhibition, “Genpath Empower our Journey”. The people who stroll forward on the paths can realize how much energy they gain from their footsteps.","lubrication, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Exposure concentrations of the total volatile organic compound and fine particulate matter were measured in the four voluntary printing factories in Thailand. Two types of the printing process, offset and digital printing, were compared. The 8 h average of particulate matter 2.5 in the field blank, Offset A, Offset B, Offset C printing and Digital printing D was 7.46, 21.51, 44.26, 77.92, and 42.08 µgm−3, respectively. The highest particulate matter level in the Offset printing C, 77.92 µgm−3 was due to the surrounded paper dust in the area. The 8 h average of total volatile organic compounds in field blank, Offset A, Offset B, Offset C printing and Digital printing D was 0.12, 2.68, 5.02, 21.86, and 0.67 ppm, respectively. The highest total volatile organic compound was 21.86 ppm in the Offset printing C because of the high production rate and the application of organic solvents in the cleanup process. Worker's exposure to total volatile organic compound and particulate matter 2.5 in the offset printings was higher than in the digital laser printing. From the health risk evaluation, the workers in offset printings were at risk from total volatile organic compound exposure, Hazard quotient > 1. However, workers exposed to particulate matter exposures were not at risk, Hazard quotient < 1.

A review of current vaccination policies is required to improve measles elimination strategies. Methods: A pseudotype-based virus neutralisation assay (PVNA) was used to measure neutralising antibody titres in serum samples collected from Thai infants at six timepoints before and after two-doses of MMR (1&2) vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) luciferase pseudotypes bearing the haemaglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of measles virus (MeV) were prepared. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with VSV (MeV) pseudotypes and plated onto HEK293-human SLAM1 cells; the neutralising antibody titre was defined as the dilution resulting in 90% reduction in luciferase activity. Results: Neutralising antibody titres in infants born with high levels of maternal immunity (H group) persisted at the time of the first MMR vaccination, and those infants did not respond effectively by developing protective titres. In contrast, infants with lower maternal immunity (L group) developed protective titres of antibody following vaccination. Responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher (P = 0.0171, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the H group. The observed correlation between anti-MeV IgG level and neutralising antibody titre in Thai infants indicates the possibility of using rapid IgG testing as a surrogate measure for neutralising activity to define clinical protection levels within populations. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that varying the timing of the first MMR immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity could increase vaccination immunogenicity and hence accelerate measles eradication.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

There is strong comorbidity between atherosclerosis (ATS) and depression which is attributed to increased atherogenicity, insulin resistance (IR), and immune and oxidative stress. Aim of the study. To examine the role of the above pathways and mu-opioid receptor (MOR), β-endorphin levels, zinc, copper, vitamin D3, calcium, and magnesium in depression due to ATS/unstable angina (UA). Methods. Biomarkers were assayed in 58 controls and 120 ATS patients divided into those with moderate and severe depression according to the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores >19 and >29, respectively. Results. Neural network and logistic regression models showed that severe depression due to ATS/UA was best predicted by interleukin-6 (IL-6), UA, MOR, zinc, β-endorphin, calcium and magnesium, and that moderate depression was associated with IL-6, zinc, MOR, β-endorphin, UA, atherogenicity, IR, and calcium. Neural networks yielded a significant discrimination of severe and moderate depression with an area under the receiver operating curves of 0.831 and 0.931, respectively. Using Partial Least Squares path analysis, we found that 66.2% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from ATS/UA clinical features, and the BDI-II scores, atherogenicity, and IR could be explained by the regression on IL-6, IL-10, zinc, copper, calcium, MOR, and age. The BDI-II scores increased from controls to ATS to UA class III to UA class IV. Conclusions. Immune activation, the endogenous opioid system, antioxidants, trace elements, and macrominerals modulate a common core shared by increased depressive symptoms, ATS, UA, atherogenicity, and IR.",medical,"Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Five objectives related to the system as a whole and another three interacting entities are optimised simultaneously. A mathematical model is formulated for the first time for this type of layout. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, a reference point based evolutionary algorithm, namely non-dominated sorting teaching-learning-based optimisation (NSTLBO III), is proposed to solve medium- and large-sized problems. The performances of NSTLBO III are benchmarked in the sense of Pareto efficiency with two well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA III) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). The experimental results show that NSTLBO III surpasses its contestants significantly concerning the convergence to the true Pareto front.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics, decision sciences","Computer Science (all), Modeling and Simulation, Management Science and Operations Research"

With the evolution of composite materials and an increasing emphasis on the economical and sustainable use of natural fibers, many researchers have utilized them in the strengthening of flat flabs mitigating punching failures. This study aims at investigating and comparing the behavior of flat slabs strengthened with post-installed composite and natural reinforcements. An experimental program was devised consisting of eight flat-slab specimens. One specimen was tested in as-built condition to provide a reference. The remaining specimens were strengthened with Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), Aramid Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (AFRP), and sisal rods. The pattern of post-installed rods was varied as single line, double line, and star shapes around the column. The results indicated that the single-line pattern could only enhance the maximum sustained load by up to 6% compared to that of the reference specimen. On the contrary, double line and star shape configurations resulted in a substantial increase in the maximum sustained load. An analytical assessment of ACI 318-19 provisions resulted in an over-estimation of the shear strengths of CFRP-and AFRP-strengthened slabs. Furthermore, the same provisions led to lower yields than experimental shear strengths for sisal-strengthened slabs.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Can programmatic inputs improve adolescent mothers’ access to maternal care in rural Bangladesh?

WHO recommended 4–8 Antenatal Care (ANC) visits, in addition to quality care and facility-based deliveries, are well-documented interventions to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Determinants of maternal and child health care in Bangladesh have received considerable attention, but less attention has been focused on adolescent mothers. This study explores the factors associated with 4 or more (4 +) ANC visits and facility-based delivery among adolescent mothers in one rural area of Bangladesh. Methods: This study uses Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) data. We conducted a comparative study on trends in 4 + ANC visits and facility-based deliveries among adolescent mothers (10–19 years) residing in an intervention area (icddr,b service area, ISA) against a comparison area (government service areas, GSA) of HDSS between 2007 and 2015. Totally, 4,996 adolescent mothers were included in the final analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to document the statistical difference on outcome indicators in the two study areas. Results: Trends in 4 + ANC visits and facility-based deliveries were higher in the ISA relative to the GSA. The adjusted odds of an adolescent mother accessing 4 + ANC visits in the GSA, relative to ISA, were 0.57 (95% CI 0.49–0.66, p value < 0.05); the adjusted odds of an adolescent mother accessing facility-based delivery in the ISA, relative to GSA, were 6.63 (95% CI: 5.85–7.52, p value < 0.05). Increasing numbers of ANC visits were associated with increases in facility-based births in both the ISA and GSA. Conclusion: This study documented that both 4 + ANC visits and facility delivery rates among adolescent mothers are much higher in the ISA than GSA. Increasing 4 + ANC visits and facility deliveries over the years, particularly in the ISA, coincide with programmatic efforts to improve the quality and availability of maternal and newborn health services. Learning from existing interventions in ISA and applying them to other areas will strengthen Bangladesh’s efforts to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3).","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical, environmental","Food Science, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Whether IFN-I induced by mRNA vaccine is crucial for anti-tumor immune response remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of mRNA encoding tumor antigens with different degrees of N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) modification in B16 melanoma model. Our results demonstrated that ovalbumin (OVA) encoding mRNA formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) induced substantial IFN-I production and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) with negative correlation with increasing percentages of m1Ψ modification. In B16-OVA murine melanoma model, unmodified OVA-LNP significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival, compared to OVA-LNP with m1Ψ modification. This robust anti-tumor effect correlated with the increase in intratumoral CD40+ DCs and the frequency of granzyme B+/IFN-γ+/TNF-α+ polyfunctional OVA peptide-specific CD8+ T cells. Blocking type I IFN receptor completely reversed the anti-tumor immunity of unmodified mRNA-OVA reflected in a significant decrease in OVA-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells and enrichment of PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells. The robust anti-tumor effect of unmodified OVA-LNP was also observed in the lung metastatic tumor model. Finally, this mRNA vaccine was tested using B16 melanoma neoantigens (Pbk-Actn4) which resulted in delayed tumor growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that an unmodified mRNA vaccine induces IFN-I production or the downstream signaling cascades which plays a crucial role in inducing robust anti-tumor T cell response for controlling tumor growth and metastasis.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Methods: This retrospective study included 112 patients with PDAC who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT before and after neoadjuvant CRT. A 5-point score was used to determine arterial involvement (A score; 1 = no involvement, 2 = haziness, 3 = abutment, 4 = encasement, 5 = deformity) and 4-point score evaluating resectability status (R score; 1 = resectable, 2 = borderline resectable [BR] with venous involvement, 3 = BR with arterial involvement, 4 = locally advanced [LA]). A score before and after CRT were summed with R score before and after CRT to compute the AR score (ARtotal). The associations between ARtotal, R0 resection, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed. Results: The ARtotal was associated with R0 resection (p <.001) and showed area under the ROC curve of 0.79 for differentiating R0 and R1 resections. Median OS was significantly lower for patients with ARtotal > 9 (median: 35.2 months) compared to patients with ARtotal ≤ 9 (median: not estimable) (p <.001). Similar results were observed for DFS (median, 16.8 months in > 9 vs median, not estimable in ≤ 9; p <.001). Conclusions: A composite score which incorporates degree of arterial involvement and resectability status before and after neoadjuvant CRT is associated with R0 resection and discriminates between R0 and R1 resections in PDAC.

Behavioral activation (BA), which can easily be adapted for non-clinical populations, has been the recommended treatment for depression. It is based on a model of psychopathology explaining that losses or chronically low levels of positive reinforcement yield behavioral and emotional changes in depression and that encouraging individuals to increase their engagement in reinforcing activities can improve their mood and enhance their valuable life experiences. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides indices of autonomic function related to depression, but only a few studies have investigated the effect of BA on HRV, particularly among older adults with subthreshold depression. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the effect of BA on HRV in older adults with subthreshold depression. Methods: We conducted a 9-month cluster randomized controlled trial in two Health Promoting Hospitals (HPHs). Eighty-two participants were randomized into either intervention (BA with usual care) or control (usual care only) groups, with 41 participants per group. Daily step count was collected weekly during the 12-week BA intervention period, while HRV parameters, including the Standard Deviation of the Normal-to-Normal interval (SDNN), High Frequency (lnHF), Low Frequency (LF), and Low Frequency/High Frequency ratio (LF/HF), were examined at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) were used in the data analysis. Results: Over nine months, the intervention and control groups differed significantly in the unadjusted mean change of HRV, SDNN [7.59 ms (95% CI: 1.67, 13.50)], lnHF [0.44 ms2 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.85)], and LF [0.53 ms2 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.98)], whereas the groups did not differ significantly in LF/HF ratio [0.01 ms2 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.06)]. Conclusion: Our results suggest that BA may have a therapeutic effect on depression symptoms of older adults with subthreshold depression via improved HRV.

To be able to respond to customers' needs, accurate sales forecasting is essential to prepare appropriate levels of stocks. This research aims to find methods and features to forecast the daily sales for a case study retail store chain having many categories of products with varied promotion prices. Three main models are considered: (1) Time series forecasting, i.e., TBATS model, (2) explanatory forecasting method, i.e., multiple linear regression, and (3) machine learning model, i.e., XGBoost. Different types of dependent and independent variables transformation in Stepwise regression are also considered in order to find the most accurate results. Since there were records of the number of Covid-19 cases in Thailand from 2020 and there was also government's welfare money policy during Covid-19 crisis, this paper attempts to find how these variables affects retail sales.

Optimal Loss of Load Expectation for Generation Expansion Planning Considering Fuel Unavailability,"Diewvilai R., Audomvongseree K.",2022-11-01,"Fuel supply, Fuel unavailability, Generation expansion planning, Generation systems, Loss of load expectation, Minimum generations, Peak demand, Reliability criterion, Reliability level, Reserve margin, fuel unavailability, generation expansion planning, loss of load expectation, reliability criterion, reserve margin","In generation expansion planning, reliability level is the key criterion to ensure enough generation above peak demand in case there are any generation outages. This reliability criterion must be appropriately optimized to provide a reliable generation system with a minimum generation cost. Currently, a method to determine an optimal reliability criterion is mainly focused on reserve margin, an accustomed criterion used by several generation utilities. However, Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) is a more suitable reliability criterion for a generation system with a high proportion of renewable energy since it considers both the probabilistic characteristics of the generation system and the entire load’s profile. Moreover, it is also correlated with the reserve margin. Considering the current fuel supply situation, a probabilistic model based on Bayes’ Theorem is also proposed to incorporate fuel supply unavailability into the probabilistic criterion. This paper proposes a method for determining the optimal LOLE along with a model that incorporates fuel supply unavailability into consideration. This method is tested with Thailand’s Power Development Plan 2018 revision 1 to demonstrate numerical examples. It is found that the optimal LOLE of the test system is 0.7 day/year, or shifted to 0.55 day/year in the case of considering the fuel supply unavailability.","numerical methods, fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The similar argument serves for a control-localized solution. Theorems are proved to obtain the characterizations of the new solutions. Both sets of tolerance-localized and control-localized solutions could be represented by a system of integer linear equations.

However, the electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in overall water splitting, polysulfide conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries, formation/decomposition of lithium peroxide in lithium-oxygen batteries, and nitrate reduction reaction to degrade sewage, suffer from sluggish kinetics caused by multielectron transfer processes. Owing to the merits of accelerated charge transport, optimized adsorption/desorption of intermediates, raised conductivity, regulation of the reaction microenvironment, as well as ease to combine with geometric characteristics, the built-in electric field (BIEF) is expected to overcome the above problems. Here, we give a Review about the very recent progress of BIEF for efficient energy electrocatalysis. First, the construction strategies and the characterization methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) of BIEF are summarized. Then, the up-To-date overviews of BIEF engineering in electrocatalysis, with attention on the electron structure optimization and reaction microenvironment modulation, are analyzed and discussed in detail.

Furthermore, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) were utilized as the surfactant templates. The P3HT synthesized with DBSA at 6 CMC, where CMC stands for the Critical Micelle Concentration of surfactant, provided a higher electrical conductivity than those with PTSA, SDS and AOT. The highest electrical conductivity of P3HT using DBSA was 16.21 ± 1.55 S cm−1 in which the P3HT particle shape was spherical with an average size of 1530 ± 227 nm. The thermal analysis indicated that the P3HT synthesized with the surfactants yielded higher stability and char yields than that of P3HT without. The P3HT_DBSA electrical conductivity was further enhanced by de-doping and doping with HClO4. At the 10:1 doping mole ratio, the electrical conductivity of dP3HT_DBSA increased by one order of magnitude relative to P3HT_DBSA prior to the de-doping.

These data are reported in the literature and can be estimated by conventional predictive correlations. However, the conventional correlation is applicable for an individual solvent at various blended ratios and temperatures. Thus, artificial neural network (ANN) was then applied for prediction of the transport properties of MPDL-based solvents, including aqueous solutions of MPDL, MPDL-monoethanolamine (MEA), MPDL-2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), and MPDL-piperazine (PZ).

The objective of this study was to determine differences between older and younger HPN patients in regard to HPN indications, prescriptions, and outcomes over the first 2 years receiving HPN. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from HPN adult patients entered in the Canadian HPN Registry. New HPN patients enrolled between 2003 and 2017 and receiving HPN for at least 2 years were selected. Data included demographics, PN prescriptions, catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) over the past year, survival, and quality of life based on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Results: Four hundred two patients were included: 184 patients were ≥60 years old, and 219 patients were between 18 and 59 years old. There were no differences in the main indications for HPN, body mass index (BMI), and PN prescriptions at baseline.

We conducted large-scale evolutionary genomic and transcriptomic analyses to comprehensively search for LTR retroelement-derived genes whose origination coincided with therian placental emergence and that became consistently expressed in therian placentae. We identified NYNRIN as another Ty3/Gypsy LTR retroelement-derived gene likely to contribute to placental emergence in the therian stem lineage. NYNRIN knockdown inhibited the invasion of HTR8/SVneo invasive-type trophoblasts, whereas the knockdown of its nonretroelement-derived homolog KHNYN did not. Functional enrichment analyses suggested that NYNRIN modulates trophoblast invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix remodeling and that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for the functional differences between NYNRIN and KHNYN.

The efficiency of adsorbents is critical to the success of this approach. Sugarcane bagasse fly ash (SBA) was used in this study as a support to increase the CO2 adsorption capacity of CaO. The physical and chemical characteristics of SBA treated with various reagents (HCl, H3PO4, CH3COOH, NaOH, NH3, and H2O2) were investigated. The CaO was then loaded at 10–50 wt% on the support surface, and the modified adsorbent was tested for its potential to adsorb CO2. According to the results of the experiments, the acidic reagent increased the surface area of SBA, whereas the base reagents provided SBA with a higher pore volume and a larger pore size. The different surface characteristics of the modified SBA had a direct impact on its CO2 adsorption capacity. The adsorbent with NaOH-pretreated SBA and 50% CaO loading had the highest CO2 adsorption capacity, which was 27% higher than that of unsupported CaO due to the decent distribution of CaO found on the NaOH-treated SBA surface. For a better understanding, a graphical model was finally proposed to describe the aforementioned changes in surface characteristics and adhesion of CaO on the SBA support.

Easy albumin-bilirubin (EZ-ALBI), a simplified albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, has recently been proposed as a new prognostic score for HCC. This study aimed to validate the EZ-ALBI score and evaluate the impact of dynamic changes in patients with intermediate-stage HCC undergoing TACE. Methods: All patients with HCC treated with TACE at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between January 2015 and December 2019 were prospectively enrolled. Intermediate-stage HCC was defined as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or unresectable single HCC with size > 5 cm in BCLC stage A. EZ-ALBI and ALBI scores were calculated and stratified into three different grades. Overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard model. Decision analysis curves were used to evaluate the clinical utility of the predictive scores. Results: Among 672 patients with HCC treated with TACE, 166 patients with intermediate-stage HCC who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled. The median OS of all patients in the cohort was 21 months. A good correlation between the EZ-ALBI and ALBI scores was observed (correlation coefficient 1.000, p < 0.001). The baseline EZ-ALBI grades 1, 2, and 3 were 24.5%, 70%, and 5.5%, respectively. EZ-ALBI grade can stratify patients with significantly different prognoses (p = 0.002). Baseline EZ-ALBI grade 2, 3, and serum alpha-fetoprotein > 20 ng/ml were significantly associated with OS [hazard ratio (HR) 2.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–3.88, p = 0.007), 3.26 (95% CI 1.24–8.57, p = 0.016), and 1.77 (95% CI 1.10–2.84, p = 0.018), respectively]. Following TACE, 42 (29.6%) patients had a worsening EZ-ALBI grade. However, the EZ-ALBI grade migration was not significantly correlated with OS. EZ-ALBI and ALBI score provided improved discriminatory ability (Harrell’s concordance index 0.599 and 0.602, respectively) and better net benefit compared with Child-Turcotte-Pugh and Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores. Conclusions: The baseline EZ-ALBI score demonstrated good predictive performance for survival and a strong correlation with conventional ALBI scores. Both the EZ-ALBI and ALBI scores outperformed other prognostic models in patients with intermediate-stage HCC receiving TACE. However, the dynamic change in the EZ-ALBI grade after TACE was not associated with postprocedural survival.",medical,Gastroenterology
Epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in Thailand from 2011 to 2018,"Chanchaidechachai T., Saatkamp H., de Jong M., Inchaisri C., Hogeveen H., Premashthira S., Buamitoup N., Prakotcheo R., van den Borne B.H.P.",2022-11-01,"Animals, Cattle, Cattle Diseases, Disease Outbreaks, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus, Livestock, Swine, Swine Diseases, Thailand, foot-and-mouth disease, risk factors, spatial analysis, temporal analysis, Thailand","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most important animal diseases hindering livestock production in Thailand. In this study, a temporal and spatial analysis at the subdistrict level was performed on FMD outbreak reports in Thailand from 2011 to 2018. Risk factors associated with FMD outbreaks were furthermore investigated using generalized estimating equations. The results showed that the incidence of FMD outbreaks was the highest in 2016 and was affected by season, with a peak in FMD outbreaks occurring in the rainy-winter season, during October to December. FMD outbreaks were mostly distributed in small clusters within a few subdistricts. Some high-risk areas with repeated outbreaks were detected in the central regions. Risk factors, including the increase of subdistrict's size of the dairy population, beef population or pig population, the low percentage of forest area, subdistricts in the provinces adjacent to Malaysia, the presence of a livestock market and the occurrence of an FMD outbreak in a neighbouring subdistrict in the previous month significantly increased the odds of having an FMD outbreak. The increase in proximity to the nearest subdistrict with an FMD outbreak in the previous month decreased the odds of having FMD outbreaks. This study helped to identify high-risk areas and periods of FMD outbreaks in Thailand. Together with the identified risk factors, its results can be used to optimize the FMD control programme in Thailand and in other countries having a similar livestock industry and FMD situation.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"
Identification of B33 and Cm martensitic products in CuZr-based alloys: A DFT study,"Yue Y., Zhang X., Qin J., Zhang X., Liu R.",2022-12-01,"B33 phase, Cm phase, Cu-Zr alloy, Cuzr-based alloy, DFT, DFT method, DFT study, Martensite transformations, Martensitics, Phase formations, B33 phase, Cm phase, CuZr-based alloys, DFT, Martensitic transformation","B33 and Cm phases as martensite products of CuZr-based alloys are still controversial and even confused. This work identified that the B33 and Cm are martensite products of binary CuZr and ternary CuZrX systems, respectively, and revealed the martensite transformation (MT) barriers and pathways of the two systems by the DFT method. According to our results, in binary CuZr alloy, B19' phase is firstly formed along the B2→RB19'→B19' path with the barrier of 0.28 eV. Then B33 phase formation follows the no-barrier pathway of B19'→B33. However, due to the higher MT barrier and the fact that the Cm lattice observed in B19' supercell is still B19' phase, the Cm phase was excluded from CuZr martensite products. As for CuZrX systems, the symmetry reduction caused by the third metallic element X makes the Cm phase appear in all Cu43.75Zr50X6.25 and Cu37.5Zr50X12.5 alloys. Owing to the lattice overlap, the Cm phase in the CuZrX system is always accompanied by B19'. Notably, the transformations of all Cu43.75Zr50X6.25 and most Cu37.5Zr50X12.5 martensites prefer the two-step pathway of B2→RM→M rather than the B2→M path. Especially for Cu37.5Zr50Ni12.5 martensite, there is no transformation barrier along the B2→RM→M path.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

Nevertheless, there are no data on whether the activation of the interleukin (IL)-6, IL-23, T helper (Th)-17 axis, and lower magnesium and calcium levels impact DisQoL scores. This study recruited 90 patients with schizophrenia (including 40 with deficit schizophrenia) and 40 healthy controls and assessed the World Health Association QoL instrument-Abbreviated version and Sheehan Disability scale, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, magnesium and calcium. Regression analyses showed that a large part of the first factor extracted from the physical, psychological, social and environmental HR-QoL and interference with school/work, social life, and home responsibilities was predicted by a generalized cognitive deterioration (G-CoDe) index (a latent vector extracted from BACs scores), and the first vector extracted from various symptom domains (“symptomatome”), whereas the biomarkers had no effects. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the IL6IL23Th17 axis and magnesium/calcium had highly significant total (indirect + direct) effects on HR-QoL/disabilities, which were mediated by G-CoDe and the symptomatome (a first factor extracted from negative and positive symptoms). The IL6IL23Th17 axis explained 63.1% of the variance in the behavioral-cognitive-psycho-social (BCPS) worsening index a single latent trait extracted from G-CoDe, symptomatome, HR-QoL and disability data. In summary, the BCPS worsening index is partly caused by the neuroimmunotoxic effects of the IL6IL23Th17 axis in subjects with lowered antioxidant defenses (magnesium and calcium), thereby probably damaging the neuronal circuits that may underpin deficit schizophrenia.","medicalcal geography, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

To date, no study has investigated the entire cervical microbiome, which consists of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In this study, cervical samples with different histopathology (CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3), with or without HPV16 and Hr-HPVs infection, were enrolled. From bacterial community analysis, 115 bacterial species were found and separated into 2 distinct categories based on Lactobacillus abundance: Lactobacilli-dominated (LD) and non-Lactobacilli-dominated (NLD) groups. The LD group had significantly less bacterial diversity than the NLD group. In addition, the variety of bacteria was contingent on the prevalence of HPV infection. Among distinct histological groups, an abundance of L. iners (>60% of total Lactobacillus spp.) was discovered in both groups. A few fungi, e.g., C. albicans, were identified in the fungal community. The viral community analysis revealed that the presence of HPV considerably reduced the diversity of human viruses. Taken together, when we analyzed all our results collectively, we discovered that HPV infection was a significant determinant in the diversity of bacteria and human viruses in the cervix.","gender studies, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Incorporating 2% CTS-MMT nanocomposites into the free-standing CTS films could improve the water-resistance and oxygen barrier of the film. For the postharvest experiment, CTS and CTS supplemented with CTS-MMT nanocomposite solutions were applied as banana fruit coating by the dipping technique. The CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT showed a significant retarding in peel color change, reduced electrolyte leakage, and MDA content, while CTS coating could maintain fruit firmness and reduce plasma membrane destruction for only the first few days. In addition, the CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT coating could reduce ethylene production and respiration rate of the banana fruit. Overall results suggest that the CTS supplemented with 2% CTS-MMT nanocomposites is a novel coating material for maintaining the postharvest quality of ‘Hom Thong’ banana fruit.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Food Science"

We developed the lung balance contrast enhancement technique (lung BCET) which automatically identifies the lung region and normalizes the image accordingly to improve the robustness on out-of-domain data. We also explored augmentation methods that are suitable for chest radiography. We compiled data from multiple tuberculosis (TB) datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of the preprocessing and augmentation methods using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and heatmap quality. On out-of-domain testing conditions, the lung BCET preprocessing method achieves the highest AUC scores of 0.7978 and 0.6240 for the Maesot and Bureau of TB (BT) datasets, respectively. We also found that lung BCET can also be used to perform data augmentation in conjunction with standard augmentation techniques to improve the performance in both in- and out-of-domain conditions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Several studies have reported possible contributing factors, however, studies regarding the dropout rate from medical education among Thai medical students and its associated factors are still lacking. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of dropout from medical education within the preclinical period and its associated factors among Thai medical students. Methods: We collected data from preclinical medical students who entered one medical school in Bangkok, Thailand, between 2017–2019. Demographic data, admission program, pre-admission mental health status assessed by the Thai Mental Health Indicator 66, mental health records from the faculty-based counseling services, and academic achievement were extracted. Data were reported in a descriptive fashion. We analyzed the association between dropout and these factors by robust Poisson regression. Results: In total, 914 students were recruited. Dropout was only 1.5%, which was lower than the previous studies. Regression analysis showed a significant association between dropout and mental health problems [Prevalence ratio (PR) 58.20, 95%CI 13.72- 246.95] but not admission program [PR 0.32, 95%CI 0.09 – 1.16] or failing examinations [PR 0.59, 95%CI 0.18 – 1.90]. However, other contributing factors such as financial status, family problems, medical illness, and students’ motivation, were not evaluated in this study. Conclusions: Mental health problems during medical education were associated with dropout after adjusting for other confounding variables. Further longitudinal studies are needed to identify the impacts of academic failure on dropout in higher clinical years.",sociology,Education

Few studies have directly compared heart rate variability (HRV), arterial stiffness, and aerobic capacity between male and female athletes, especially among badminton athletes. This study investigated sex differences in HRV, arterial stiffness, and aerobic capacity in badminton athletes. Elite badminton athletes were recruited and divided into male (n = 20, 21.0 ± 1.8 years old) and female (n = 16, 21.2 ± 2.3 years old) groups. Both groups performed an incremental treadmill running test for the evaluation of maximal oxygen consumption (.VO2max), anaerobic threshold, and time to exhaustion. They started exercising at a treadmill speed of 2.7 km/h and an inclination of 10% gradient for 3 min, and the speed and inclination were gradually increased every 3 min until they were exhausted or fatigued volitionally. HRV was examined using the Polar heart rate monitor over a period of 5 min at rest in the supine position. Subsequently, the index of arterial stiffness was examined under the same condition. Our results revealed significant differences between the male and female athletes in .

However, no significant differences in HRV measures were observed between the two groups. These findings suggested that the male badminton athletes demonstrated significantly higher aerobic capacity than did the female athletes, but there were no significant differences in HRV measures. The female athletes exhibited superior arterial function, compared with their male counterparts.","physicsiology, geobase; related topics, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Aedes aegypti mosquito is an important vector of DTMUV. This study sought to determine whether any individual Ae. aegypti salivary protein modulated DTMUV replication in the mosquito salivary gland. Ae. aegypti salivary gland protein of 34 kDa (AaSG34) was found to be expressed explicitly in mosquito salivary glands and was upregulated following DTMUV infection. Thus, AaSG34 was silenced in mosquitoes via RNA interference using double strand RNA (dsRNA), and the mosquitoes were then infected with DTMUV to elucidate their effects on DTMUV replication and transmission. Transcripts of the DTMUV genome in salivary glands and virus titer in saliva were significantly diminished when AaSG34 was silenced, indicating that its presence enhances DTMUV replication in the salivary glands and DTMUV dissemination to saliva. Furthermore, the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was upregulated upon AaSG34 silenced. Our results demonstrate that AaSG34 may play a vital role in the suppression of antiviral immune responses to enhance DTMUV replication and transmission. We thus provide new information on the effect of the AaSG34 salivary protein on DTMUV replication in Ae. aegypti as the mechanism of blocking virus transmission to the host.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

This paper investigates the production of voicing and tones in a tonal Northern Kmhmu' dialect spoken in Nan Province, Thailand, and a non-tonal Eastern Kmhmu' dialect spoken in Vientiane, Laos, from both acoustic and electroglottographic perspectives. Large and consistent VOT differences between voiced and voiceless stops are preserved in Eastern Kmhmu', but are not found in Northern Kmhmu', consistent with previous reports. With respect to pitch, f0 is clearly a secondary property of the voicing contrast in Eastern Kmhmu', but unquestionably the primary contrastive property in Northern Kmhmu'. Crucially, no evidence is found to suggest that either phonation type or formant differences act as significant cues to voicing in Eastern Kmhmu' or tones in Northern Kmhmu'. These results suggests that voicing contrasts can also be transphonologized directly into f0-based contrasts, skipping a registral stage based primarily on phonation and/or vowel quality.","arts, physics, sociology","Language and Linguistics, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Linguistics and Language"

Experiments were conducted by connecting an extraction reactor to an oxidizing electro-generator. It was found that copper and gold were mostly extracted by adjusting different extraction conditions, such as extraction time, HCl concentration, extraction temperature, current density, particle size range, sample mass (solution density), and stirring speed. Two specific extraction steps were employed to selectively extract copper and gold. It was detected that 98.1 % of copper was extracted using the first extraction step twice, whereas, in the final step, 95.1 % of gold was extracted from the residue sample of the first step. The gold recovery performances of five different resins were investigated, and IRA402 Cl and HPR9700 resins manifested the highest adsorption ability and selectivity. The adsorption mechanism was found to be a monolayer adsorption process, and the adsorption capacities of IRA402 Cl and HPR9700 resins reached 303.8 mg g[sbnd]1 and 295.4 mg g[sbnd]1, respectively.

Although acne may not lead to serious medical complications, its psy-chosocial effects are tremendous and scientifically proven. The first-line treatment for acne is topical medications composed of synthetic compounds, which usually cause skin irritation, dryness and itch. Therefore, naturally occurring constituents from plants (phytochemicals), which are generally regarded as safe, have received much attention as an alternative source of treatment. However, the degradation of phytochemicals under high temperature, light and oxygen, and their poor penetration across the skin barrier limit their application in dermatology. Encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles is one of the strategies commonly used to deliver drugs and phytochemicals because it allows appropri-ate concentrations of these substances to be delivered to the site of action with minimal side effects. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are promising delivery systems developed from the combination of lipid and emulsifier. They have numerous advantages that include biocompatibility and biodegradability of lipid materials, enhancement of drug solubility and stability, ease of modulation of drug release, ease of scale-up, feasibility of incorporation of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs and occlusive moisturization, which make them very attractive carriers for delivery of bioactive compounds for treating skin ailments such as acne. In this review, the concepts of SLNs and NLCs, methods of preparation, characterization, and their application in the encapsulation of anti-acne phytochemicals will be discussed.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite for selective and sensitive cyanide determination in food samples through catalytical colorimetry using a paper-based test kit,"Malahom N., Jarujamrus P., Anutrasakda W., Siripinyanond A., Amatatongchai M., Citterio D., Nacapricha D.",2022-04-01,"Ag +, Ag3PO4/ag nanocomposite, Catalytic colorimetry, Color intensity, Food samples, Paper-based test, Paper-based test kit, Real samples, Synthesised, Test kits, Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite, Catalytic colorimetry, Cyanide, Food sample, Paper-based test kit","A paper-based test kit for selective and sensitive determination of cyanide was successfully developed using a Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite for catalytic colorimetry. The Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite synthesized via a one-step chemical bath method could instantly oxidize the chromogenic substrate ABTS for the color development under acidic conditions without the requirement of H2O2. During the detection step, cyanide in the sample was converted into gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) using sulfuric acid. The HCN species then reacted with the generated Ag+ species via coordinate covalent bonding to form silver cyanide complex ions [Ag (CN2)]-. The amount of Ag+ species used for oxidizing ABTS subsequently decreased and so did the color intensity on the paper-based test kit. Specifically, the color intensity decreased with increasing cyanide concentrations in the range of 2.50–20.0 mg L−1. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.48 mg L−1 and 1.59 mg L−1, respectively. The developed test kit showed relatively high selectivity towards cyanide and high tolerance towards other cations and anions present in real samples. When applied to real samples including fruit juices and food products, the performance of the rapid and low-cost test kit was well validated by a conventional precipitation titration method.﻿","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Neural network-based adaptive control and energy management system of a direct methanol fuel cell in a hybrid renewable power system,"Jienkulsawad P., Eamsiri K., Chen Y.-S., Arpornwichanop A.",2022-12-01,"Demand pattern, Direct-methanol fuel cells, Electricity demands, Energy-based, Hybrid power, Hybrid power system, Neural network based adaptive control, Neural-networks, Renewable power systems, Weather patterns, Direct methanol fuel cells, Energy management system, Hybrid power system, Neural network","Due to fluctuations in electricity demand and weather patterns, the solar energy-based system should be integrated with energy storage for efficient energy management. However, using only a battery cannot cope with the long-term power demand. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been considered one of the most promising backup power supplies for household applications. Therefore, the photovoltaic and solar thermal collector system incorporated with battery and DMFC is proposed along with the energy management system. In this study, a neural network-based adaptive control is developed to control the DMFC to meet persistent residential power demand and follow the technical requirements. Simulation results show that the neural network-based control outperforms the proportional-integral-derivative control in set-point change, disturbance, and model mismatch cases. Implementing the controlled DMFC in the hybrid system results in lower power requirements from the grid, which is less than twice that of a hybrid system without the DMFC. Furthermore, when solar power was insufficient to supply the load demand, the battery lifecycle in the system integrated with the DMFC seems more extended than that of a system without the DMFC.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, sociology, engineering, energy","Geography, Planning and Development, Civil and Structural Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Transportation"

The selected articles were included in this study. Extensive research on graphene in several fields exists. However, the available literature on graphene-based coatings in dentistry and medical implant technology is limited. Graphene exhibits high biocompatibility, corrosion prevention, antimicrobial properties to prevent the colonization of bacteria. Graphene coatings enhance adhesion of cells, osteogenic differentiation, and promote antibacterial activity to parts of titanium unaffected by the thermal treatment. Furthermore, the graphene layer can improve the surface properties of implants which can be used for biomedical applications. Hence, graphene and its derivatives may hold the key for the next revolution in dental and medical technology.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Dengue infection triggered immune mediated necrotizing myopathy in children: a case report and literature review,"Mekmangkonthong A., Amornvit J., Numkarunarunrote N., Veeravigrom M., Khaosut P.",2022-12-01,"Autoantibodies, Autoimmune Diseases, Child, Dengue, Humans, Male, Muscle Weakness, Muscular Diseases, Myositis, Prednisolone, Anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR), dengue, Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, Inflammatory myopathy, Paediatric","Background: Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies manifesting with progressive weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, and necrotizing myopathic features on muscle biopsy. There is a paucity of data on the clinical presentation of IMNM in children. We report a paediatric patient who developed anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (anti-HMGCR)-positive necrotizing myopathy after recent dengue infection. Case presentation: A previously healthy 9-year-old boy presented with acute proximal muscle weakness after recovery from dengue infection. Five days after the fever subsided, he could not stand from a squatting position. He denied having skin rash, arthritis, or other systemic features. He had marked elevation of CK level of 30,833 mg/dL and was put on steroid therapy. The patient initially responded to oral prednisolone, however the weakness persisted and muscle enzymes increased as steroids were decreased. He was then referred to our hospital for further assessment. Subsequent investigation revealed anti-HMGCR positivity along with specific histopathological findings consistent with IMNM. The patient was treated with six cycles of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) monthly, then followed by a gradual taper of prednisolone and oral methotrexate weekly with complete recovery in motor power. Conclusions: Our report presents a child with clinical manifestations of IMNM which can be categorized as acute onset of muscle weakness following dengue infection. Two key points supporting a diagnosis in this case are clinical response after immunosuppressive therapy and absence of rashes found in juvenile dermatomyositis.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy"
Comparative study on physicochemical hydrolysis methods for glycerides removal from rice bran acid oil for subsequent γ-oryzanol recovery,"Meedam A., Usaku C., Daisuk P., Shotipruk A.",2022-02-01,"Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, Base-catalyzed hydrolysis, Comparative studies, Hydrolysis conditions, Hydrolysis methods, Residual levels, Subcritical water hydrolysis, Suitable conditions, Condition effects, Glycerides removal, Hydrolysis, Subcritical water, γ-Oryzanol","A comparative study on physicochemical hydrolysis methods, including acid-catalyzed, base-catalyzed, and subcritical water hydrolysis, for glycerides removal prior to subsequent γ-oryzanol purification from rice bran acid oil (RBAO), is presented. The effects of hydrolysis conditions on the residual levels of glycerides and γ-oryzanol in RBAO were first investigated for each method. It can be concluded that the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis was not a suitable hydrolysis method for this application as it provided a low glycerides conversion level of ca. 30% using 2 N H2SO4 at 80–100 °C, despite the long reaction time (> 60 min). For the base-catalyzed hydrolysis, 100% glycerides removal was achieved at the most suitable condition, which was suggested to be at 2.5 N NaOH, 90 °C and 5–10 min. At this condition, a relatively high residual level of γ-oryzanol of ca. 57–66% was obtained. For the subcritical water hydrolysis, the results suggested that γ-oryzanol was hydrolyzed more rapidly than glycerides, and the most suitable condition for subcritical water hydrolysis was at 220 °C for 10 min. At this condition, high glycerides removal of > 95% was achieved while the remaining amount of γ-oryzanol was still acceptable (50%).","chemistryical reactions, fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on achieving energy and protein delivery goals. Methods: Medical records of the patients admitted in the PICU from August 2015 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who stayed in the PICU for less than 24 h or had an inborn error of metabolism were excluded. Achievement of nutritional goals was compared between the patients during the pre-implementation period (August to October 2015) and post-implementation period (November 2015 to April 2017) of the guideline. Subgroup analysis by protocol compliance was conducted in the post-implementation group. Results: A total of 215 patients were included in the study (53 pre-implementation, 162 post-implementation). There were no differences between the two groups in patient characteristics, time to start enteral nutrition, time to reach the energy delivery goal, time to reach the protein delivery goal, and proportion of the patients who reached each goal. In the post-implementation group, parenteral nutrition was delayed to three days compared with one day in pre-implementation (p = 0.027) and the proportion of patients who did not receive nutrition support was lower (3.1% vs 9.4% pre-implementation, p = 0.043). Subgroup analysis in the post-implementation group showed that 69.7% of the patients were protocol compliant, of which the time to reach the energy delivery goal (59 vs 103 h, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (64 vs 135 h, p = 0.02) were significantly shorter compared with the non-compliant group. Moreover, the proportion of the patients who reached the energy delivery goal (75.2% vs 24.5%, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (56.6% vs 12.2%, p < 0.001) were higher in the compliant group. Conclusions: Compliance with the nutrition support guideline significantly improved the achievements in delivering energy and protein to patients in PICU. Increasing compliance with the guideline may improve clinical outcomes in PICU patients.","medical, Nursing","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

However, the flowchart of a complex software system inevitably contains the nested structures of branching and looping of the processes. The verification of these nested structure of the flowchart in advance is still difficult to conduct even using simulation techniques. In this paper, we intend to consider the complex flowchart with nested structures, so called nested-if and nested-loop, as our input design model. A set of mapping rules is proposed to transform the input complex flowchart with nested structures into the hierarchical coloured Petri nets to avoid the drawing of a single huge net of complicate model. The hierarchical coloured Petri nets also provides us to manage level of abstraction of the formal model and helps us concentrate on only an appropriate detail at a time. In our transforming approach, both data flow and control flow of the processes in flowchart are concerned as well so that all changing states of the observable variables in the flowchart would be represented and simulated in our resulting hierarchical coloured Petri nets. The CPN simulation tool is used to test and ensure the correctness of our resulting hierarchical coloured Petri nets.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science","Business, Management and Accounting (all), Computer Science (all)"

The results demonstrate that morphology has a significant and different effect on toluene adsorption under dry or wet conditions. The dynamic adsorption capacities follow S–S (spherical-like silicalite-1) > P–S (plate-like silicalite-1) > B–S (brick-like silicalite-1) under the dry condition (303 K). For the wet condition (RH = 50%, 303 K), the order of the dynamic adsorption capacities is P–S > S–S > B–S. Silicalite-1 zeolites were tested for five adsorption-regeneration cycles to study the reusability and their performance remained stable above 85% after five cycles. The calculated rate constants of Yoon-Nelson model and Weber-Morris (W-M) intra-particle diffusion model reveal that there is less diffusion resistance in P–S. The findings may provide valuable information on zeolite-based adsorbents for adsorption removal or recovery of volatile organic compounds.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

Here, we describe an epidemiological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 639 cats and 224 dogs throughout multiple waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand. To indicate the potential source of infection, we performed SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing of samples obtained from pets and contacted humans, combined with in-depth interviews to support the epidemiological investigation. In the tested animals, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in 23 cases (19 cats and 4 dogs). Whole-genome sequencing of selected samples showed various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which included the original European lineage (B.1), Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617), and Omicron (BA.2). Among SARS-CoV-2-positive pets, 34.78% had evidence of contact with infected humans. Together with genomic analysis and an overlapping timeline, we revealed evidence of viral transmission from infected humans as the primary source, which spread to household cats via an undefined mode of transmission and most likely circulated between cohoused cats and caretakers within the weeks before the investigation. The SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein (spike gene) obtained from caretakers of individual cats contained sequence signatures found in the sequences of infected cats, indicating possible exposure to the virus excreted by cats. Although pet-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered relatively rare, our study provides suspected episodes of human infection from animals that were initially infected through contact with infected humans.",medical,Microbiology (medical)

Methodology: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the associations between prolonged breastfee¬ding and AR symptoms later in life. Comparisons were conducted between breastfeeding durations <6 months and ≥6 months and between <12 months and ≥12 months. Exclusive breastfeeding and nonexclusive breastfeeding were analysed separately. Outcomes were risks of AR development later in life. Results: Twenty-three observational studies (161,611 children, age 2-18 years, 51.50% male) were included. Two studies (9%) were with high quality. Both exclusive and nonexclusive prolonged breastfeeding (≥6 months) decreased the risk of AR. The long-term (≥12 months) nonexclusive breastfeeding lowered the likelihood of AR compared to the <12 months. The long-term exclusive breastfeeding did not show the same protective effect; however, this result was restricted to only one study. Conclusions: Exclusive breastfeeding and nonexclusive breastfeeding for ≥6 months may have protective effects against the development of AR up to 18 years of age.

From March to April 2022, using the snowball and convenience sampling methods, a total of 413 valid questionnaires were collected from 13 hospitals in Hunan Province. AMOS 23.0 was used to construct a structural equation model (SEM) with the bootstrapping approach to verify the proposed hypotheses. Doctors with more sports involvement exhibited higher levels of regulatory emotional self-efficacy and lesser perceived stress. Doctors who exhibited higher regulatory emotional self-efficacy had lesser perceived stress. The relationship between sports involvement and emotional exhaustion was mediated by perceived stress and/or regulatory emotional self-efficacy. Therefore, the government and hospitals should strengthen the depth and intensity of implementing the “National Fitness Program” at the hospital level, instead of just holding short-term activities with a small number of participants, but to cover all medical staff with fitness opportunities.","environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available strategies to reduce FGF23 in CKD patients. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by searching the databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm studies that examined the effects of dietary phosphate restriction, phosphate binders, iron supplements, calcimimetics, parathyroidectomy, dialysis techniques, and the outcome of preservation of residual renal function (RRF) on FGF23 levels in CKD patients. Random-effects model meta-analyses were used to compute changes in the outcome of interests. Results: A total of 41 articles (7590 patients), comprising 36 RCTs, 5 prospective studies were included in this meta-analysis. Dietary phosphate restriction less than 800 mg per day yielded insignificant effect on FGF23 reduction. Interestingly sevelamer, lanthanum, iron-based phosphate binders, and iron supplement significantly lowered FGF23 levels. In CKD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetics prescription could significantly reduce FGF23 levels, while surgical parathyroidectomy had no significant effect. In dialysis patients, preservation of RRF and hemoperfusion as well as hemodiafiltration provided a significant decrease in FGF23 levels.

These biological pollutants are commonly generated both by the activities and behaviors of the occupants, and by housing materials and substances that penetrate from the outdoor environment. Fungi and bacteria are the most common bioaerosols present in the indoor environment. After exposure, occupants may experience adverse health outcomes such as infection or allergy. If the indoor environment is severely contaminated, as observed in many places during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in public areas, a large number of people may be affected by contamination. This chapter also summarizes monitoring and assessment technologies. The monitoring procedure can be chosen and performed according to the objective of the assessment. Advance technologies such as real-time sensor monitoring, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence have been integrated, but their use for bioaerosols monitoring is still limited as compared to their use for other types of indoor air pollutants.

Limitations of traditional neuropsychological tests hinder assessment of neurocognition in low and middle-income countries where most AYA with PHIV reside. Computerized testing could make assessment of neurocognition more accessible in these countries. This study examined a culturally modified NeuroScreen, a tablet-based neurocognitive testing app, for use in Thailand. Construct validity was examined among Thai AYA (13–23 years) with and without PHIV. Method: NeuroScreen underwent adaptation including language, content, and usability review by Thai psychologists, AYA, and clinical staff. One hundred Thai AYA (50 PHIV; 50 HIV-uninfected, matched controls) were administered the adapted NeuroScreen and a battery of traditional paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tests. Correlations, mean differences, and proportions with impaired performance were examined across NeuroScreen and the traditional tests. Results: The Thai version of NeuroScreen was deemed understandable and culturally appropriate.A large correlation (.82) between overall performance on the NeuroScreen and traditional batteries was observed. Small-to-large correlations were found between conceptually similar NeuroScreen and traditional tests of processing speed, working memory, motor speed, and executive functioning. Mean test performance differences between AYA with PHIV and controls were similar between test batteries. Both sets of tests identified similar rates of impaired participants. Conclusions: Results provide support for the acceptability and construct validity of the Thai NeuroScreen tests to assess neurocognition in Thai AYA with PHIV.

Docking studies showed the site-specific activation of PXR and CAR by Phe and inhibition of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 by the bioactive compounds of HS similar to that of the positive controls tested. Our results conclude that HS extract can attenuate Phe-induced toxicity in HaCaT cells through CAR/PXR/RXR mediated inhibition of CYP1A1.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"
Cr/MCM-22 catalyst for the synthesis of levulinic acid from green hydrothermolysis of renewable biomass resources,"Mongkolpichayarak I., Jiraroj D., Anutrasakda W., Ngamcharussrivichai C., Samec J.S.M., Tungasmita D.N.",2022-01-01,"Biomass resources, Cr-loaded MCM-22 zeolite, Heterogeneous catalyst, Higher yield, Hydrothermolysis, Levulinic acid, MCM-22 zeolites, Synthesised, Zeolite catalyst, ]+ catalyst, Agricultural residue, Cr/MCM-22, Hydrothermolysis, Levulinic acid","The novel Cr-loaded MCM-22 zeolite (Cr/MCM-22) was successfully synthesized, fully characterized, and applied as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transformation of biomass-derived materials (glucose, sucrose, cellulose, starch, agricultural residues, and other municipal wastes) into levulinic acid via hydrothermolysis. The novel Cr/MCM-22 gives higher yields of levulinic acid compared to other reported catalysts. Specifically, Cr/MCM-22 produced 73.2% levulinic acid yield from glucose at relatively high concentrations (solvent:biomass 20:1). For starting materials with higher structural complexity, pretreatment was required to maintain a high yield of levulinic acid. The novel catalyst was studied and compared to other related catalysts. The high efficiency is attributed to the synergistic effect induced by confinement control of the microporous material as well as Lewis and Brønsted acid sites of Cr/MCM-22. A reaction mechanism including all reaction steps has been proposed. The Cr/MCM-22 was successfully recycled three times.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"
Influence of copula approaches on reliability analysis of slope stability using random adaptive finite element limit analysis,"Nguyen T.S., Likitlersuang S., Tanapalungkorn W., Phan T.N., Keawsawasvong S.",2022-08-01,"Adaptive finite element, Adaptive meshing, Copula functions, Failure Probability, Finite element limit analysis, Multiple dependencies, Random fields, Soil conditions, Soil parameters, Undrained, adaptive meshing, copula function, finite element limit analysis, random field, slope stability, soil parameters","Recently, random field copulas have been deployed to characterise the dependent structures of spatially variable soil parameters. This study expands on this concept by implementing finite element limit analysis (FELA) with adaptive meshing alongside the copula approach to perform reliability assessment of a geotechnical problem. A hypothetical slope with drained and undrained soil conditions was used as an example. First, adaptive FELA was carried out on the hypothetical slope. Second, single and multiple dependency soil parameter structures were represented by several selected copulas (Gaussian, Frank and Clayton). Finally, random adaptive FELA was implemented to explore the effects of copula selection on slope stability and reliability analyses. Results show that considerably different slope failure probabilities are produced by different copula approaches, and that failure probabilities reduce for simulating multiple dependency structures. In addition, failure probability exhibits different tendencies between drained and undrained soil conditions as soil parameter cross-correlations become stronger. Failure probabilities are also different when performing lower and upper bound (UB) random adaptive FELA with each of the selected copulas.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science, earth sciences","Computational Mechanics, Materials Science (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanics of Materials"
A German AWMF's S2e/realist synthesis and meta-narrative snapshot of craniomaxillofacial manifestations in COVID-19 patients: Rapid living update on 1 January 2021,"Pitak-Arnnop P., Meningaud J.-P., Sirintawat N., Subbalekha K., Auychai P., Iamaroon A., O-Charoenrat P., Suntorntham S., Messer-Peti R., Neff A.",2022-02-01,"COVID-19, Humans, Pandemics, SARS-CoV-2, Societies, Medical, COVID-19, Craniomaxillofacial region, Head and neck, Review, Signs and symptoms","Purposes: To execute a review answering the following question: “Among novel coronavirus disease (COVID19) patients, what are craniomaxillofacial (CMF) manifestations?” based on the RAMESES and the German Association of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF)’s S2e guidelines. Methods: We performed a realist synthesis and meta-narrative review extracting data in English, French, German and Thai from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Biomed Central, Cochrane Library, and Thai Journals Online, until 1 January 2021. The primary outcome variable was CMF manifestations grouped into 5 categories: (1) mouth and throat, (2) nose, paranasal sinus, and skull base (3) ocular/orbital and periorbital tissue, (4) ear, and (5) craniofacial skin. Appropriate statistics was computed. Results: Thirty-seven original articles meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed; all were in English and indexed in PubMed/Medline. Hand searches of their references yielded a total of 101 articles for the review. Most data were in low level of evidence and focused on smell and taste disturbances and non-specific orofacial lesions. Iatrogenic complications may occur in this body region. Conservative measures remained effective and were usually enough for patient care. Conclusion: Because SARS-CoV-2 infection is new and becomes the stringent worldwide pandemic within a short time period, most of the data on CMF symptoms are of low level evidence. Apart from taste and smell dysfunctions, non-specific CMF lesions can be found and treated conservatively. Treatment complications are possible.

Herein, it is evident that the treatment exhibited the potential use to enhance the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms for surface disinfection. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the ionic silver treatment of 60 min significantly increased the logarithmic reduction (LR) of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates and the electrical treatment enhanced the silver susceptibility of E. coli biofilms. The LR values after the ionic silver treatments and the electric-enhanced silver treatments were in the ranges of 1.94–2.25 and 2.10–2.73, respectively. The treatment was also associated with morphological changes in silver-treated E. coli cells and biofilm-contaminated titanium surfaces. Nevertheless, the treatments showed no cytotoxic effects on the L929 mouse skin fibroblast cell line and only a slight decrease in pH was observed during the electrical polarization of titanium substrate.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Combining these training modalities might be an effective training modality for masters athletes who seek to enhance athletic performance and to reduce cardiovascular risks. Methods Fifty masters road cyclists age 35-49 yr were randomly assigned to the continuous exercise training (n = 16), continuous plus HIIT (n = 17), and continuous plus BFR training combined with HIIT (BFRIT; n = 17) for 12 wk. Both HIIT and BFRIT were performed on a cycle ergometer twice a week. Results Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased in the HIIT and BFRIT groups (P < 0.05). This was accompanied by significant improvements in maximal cardiac output and stroke volume (P < 0.05). Forty-kilometer time trial performance improved in all three groups (P < 0.05). Peak power output increased in both HIIT and BFRIT groups (P < 0.05). Flow-mediated dilation in both brachial and popliteal arteries increased in all three groups (all P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in carotid intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness in any of the groups. Total lean mass, muscle cross-sectional area and thickness in rectus femoris and vastus lateralis, and peak torque of isokinetic knee extension increased only in the BFRIT group (all P < 0.05). Tissue saturation index decreased only in the BFRIT group (P < 0.05). Changes in 40-km time trial performance were associated with corresponding changes in VO2max (r =-0.312, P = 0.029) and peak isokinetic extensor torque (r =-0.432, P = 0.002). Conclusions Including HIIT particularly with BFR in the routine continuous training may be more effective in enhancing performance and physiological functions in masters road cyclists.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

Methods: Eighty-Six patients who underwent 1–2 levels of MIS-TLIF were randomly allocated to receive a TiPEEK or PEEK cage. Patient-reported outcomes were recorded using visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and EuroQoL-5D-5L. Postoperative radiographs and computed tomography were assessed for spinal fusion and cage subsidence. Results: The eligible 82 patients (41 patients, 49 operated levels in TiPEEK group and 41 patients, 50 operated levels in PEEK group) were included in the final analysis. Over total follow-up, the mean difference in visual analog scale back and leg pain scores between TiPEEK versus PEEK group was −0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.85) and −0.12 (95% CI, −0.6 to 0.3; P = 0.62), respectively. The mean difference in Oswestry Disability Index scores was −0.71 (95% CI, −3.8 to 2.4; P = 0.65), and the mean difference in EQ-5D-5 L was 0.03 (95% CI, −0.01 to 0.06; P = 0.11) in TiPEEK group versus PEEK group as a reference.

Strategic construct design, consistent expression platforms, and suitable upstream and downstream techniques are key considerations to produce commercially viable recombinant proteins. The recombinant antigenic protein production for use either as a diagnostic reagent or subunit vaccine formulation is usually carried out in prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression platforms. Microbial and mammalian systems dominate the biopharmaceutical industry for such applications. However, there is no universal expression system that can meet all the requirements for different types of proteins. The adoptability of any expression system is likely based on the quality and quantity of the proteins that can be produced from it. The huge demand of recombinant proteins for different applications requires an inexpensive production platform for rapid development. The molecular farming scientific community has been promoting the plant system for nearly 3 decades as a cost-effective alternative to produce high-quality proteins for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. Here, we discuss how plant biotechnology could offer solutions for the rapid and scalable production of protein antigens as low-cost diagnostic reagents for use in functional assays.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

However, the economic feasibility of biofuel production from microalgae does not satisfy capital investors. Apart from the biofuels, it is necessary to produce high-value co-products from microalgae fraction to satisfy the economic aspects of microalgae biorefinery. In addition, microalgae-based wastewater treatment is considered as an alternative for the conventional wastewater treatment in terms of energy con-sumption, which is suitable for microalgae biorefinery approaches. The energy consumption of a microalgae wastewater treatment system (0.2 kW/h/m3 ) was reduced 10 times when compared to the conventional wastewater treatment system (to 2 kW/h/m3 ). Microalgae are rich in various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, pigments, vitamins, and antioxidants; all these valuable products can be utilized by nutritional, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. There are several bottlenecks associated with microalgae biorefinery. Hence, it is essential to promote the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery with innovative ideas to produce biofuel with high-value products. This review attempted to bring out the trends and promising solutions to realize microalgal production of multiple products at an industrial scale.

Increases in plastic consumption have triggered increased production, which in turn has led to increased plastic disposal. In situ observation of plastic litter is tedious and cumbersome, especially in rural areas and around transboundary rivers. We therefore propose automatic mapping of plastic in rivers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning (DL) models that require modest compute resources. We evaluate the method at two different sites: the Houay Mak Hiao River, a tributary of the Mekong River in Vientiane, Laos, and Khlong Nueng canal in Talad Thai, Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani, Thailand. Detection models in the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family are evaluated in terms of runtime resources and mean average Precision (mAP) at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5. YOLOv5s is found to be the most effective model, with low computational cost and a very high mAP of 0.81 without transfer learning for the Houay Mak Hiao dataset. The performance of all models is improved by transfer learning from Talad Thai to Houay Mak Hiao. Pre-trained YOLOv4 with transfer learning obtains the overall highest accuracy, with a 3.0% increase in mAP to 0.83, compared to the marginal increase of 2% in mAP for pre-trained YOLOv5s. YOLOv3, when trained from scratch, shows the greatest benefit from transfer learning, with an increase in mAP from 0.59 to 0.81 after transfer learning from Talad Thai to Houay Mak Hiao. The pretrained YOLOv5s model using the Houay Mak Hiao dataset is found to provide the best tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity, requiring model resources yet providing reliable plastic detection with or without transfer learning. Various stakeholders in the effort to monitor and reduce plastic waste in our waterways can utilize the resulting deep learning approach irrespective of location.","water engineeringneering, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

The advancement of nanoscale science relies on a better understanding of theory, manufacturing and fabrication practices, and the application specific methods. The topology and tunable properties of nanoparticles, a part of nanoscale science, can be changed by different manufacturing processes, which separate them from their bulk counterparts. In the recent past, different nanostructures, such as nanosphere, nanorods, nanofiber, core–shell nanoparticles, nanotubes, and thin films, have been exploited to enhance the detectability of labelled or label-free biological molecules with a high accuracy. Furthermore, these engineered-materials-associated transducing devices, e.g., optical waveguides and metasurface-based scattering media, widened the horizon of biosensors over a broad wavelength range from deep-ultraviolet to far-infrared.

Microservices architecture is preferable since it promotes independence of software modification, maintenance, and deployment. However, anti-patterns or poor development patterns of microservices can decrease the software quality. Nonetheless, quality measurement of microservices design based on anti-patterns has not been found in existing research. Using the QMOOD method for quality model design, this paper proposes a microservices quality model based on 11 microservices anti-patterns and ISO/IEe 25010 as a standard reference for quality attributes. Also, a microservices quality measurement tool called MSA Nose+ is developed to measure the quality of microservices applications. In an experiment to validate the proposed model, the result shows that the quality values obtained from the proposed model improve consistently with the refactorings that are applied to a microservice-based system. Thus, development teams can use the proposed model and quality measurements as part of the decision making on quality improvement and maintenance of microservices applications.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, sociology","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software, Information Systems and Management, Education"

A number of DL models have achieved excellent results in eliminating the background noise and enhancing the quality as well as the intelligibility of noisy speech. Designing resource-efficient and compact models during real-time processing is still a key challenge. In order to enhance the accomplishment of E2E models, the sequential and local characteristics of speech signal should be efficiently taken into consideration while modeling. In this paper, we present resource-efficient and compact neural models for end-to-end noise-robust waveform-based speech enhancement. Combining the Convolutional Encode-Decoder (CED) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the Convolutional Recurrent Network (CRN) framework, we have aimed at different speech enhancement systems. Different noise types and speakers are used to train and test the proposed models. With LibriSpeech and the DEMAND dataset, the experiments show that the proposed models lead to improved quality and intelligibility with fewer trainable parameters, notably reduced model complexity, and inference time than existing recurrent and convolutional models. The quality and intelligibility are improved by 31.61% and 17.18% over the noisy speech. We further performed cross corpus analysis to demonstrate the generalization of the proposed E2E SE models across different speech datasets.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Hydrochar was obtained by microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization under different conditions: temperature (150 – 200°C), residence time (20 – 60 min), and liquid to solid ratio (5:1 – 15:1 mL g-1). Surface activation of hydrochar was conducted using various concentrations of KOH and H2O2. The results indicated that hydrochar prepared at higher temperatures, lower liquid to solid ratios, and longer residence times had significantly higher atrazine adsorption capacities. Atrazine adsorption by pristine and activated hydrochars could be best fitted to the pseudo-second-order and Freundlich models. The adsorption capacity of KOH-activated hydrochar was the highest (4.06 mg g-1), which is even greater than that of biochar with higher surface areas. The results of FTIR and XPS demonstrated that activated rice husk hydrochars contained abundant oxygen functional groups, which played a dominant role in atrazine adsorption via hydrogen-bonding interaction.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Therefore, this study aims to explore the correlation between two genes, UGT1A1 and SLCO1B1, and hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. One hundred thirty seven neonates were recruited from Division of Clinical Chemistry, Ramathibodi Hospital. UGT1A1*28 and *6 were determined by pyrosequencing whereas, SLCO1B1 388A > G and 521 T > C genetic variants were determined by TaqMan® real-time polymerase chain reaction. Neonates carrying with homozygous (AA) and heterozygous (GA) variants in UGT1A1*6 were significantly related to hyperbilirubinemia development compared with wild type (GG; P < 0.001). To the combined of UGT1A1, total bilirubin levels in homozygous variant were higher significantly than heterozygous variant and wild type (P = 0.002, P = 0.003, respectively). Moreover, SLCO1B1 combination was significant differences between the hyperbilirubinemia and the control group (P = 0.041). SLCO1B1 521 T > C variant provide protection for Thai neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (P = 0.041). There are no significant differences in UGT1A1*28 and SLCO1B1 388A > G for the different severity of hyperbilirubinemia. The combined UGT1A1*28 and *6 polymorphism is a strong risk factor for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Thai neonates. Therefore, we suggest neonates with this gene should be closely observed to avoid higher severities of bilirubin.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Many people die due to COVID-19 as a result of catastrophic consequences, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by a cytokine storm. Immunopathology and immunogenetic research may assist in diagnosing, predicting, and treating severe COVID-19 and the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. This paper reviews the immunopathogenesis and immunogenetic variants that play a role in COVID-19. Although various immune-related genetic variants have been investigated in relation to severe COVID-19, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) have not been assessed for their potential significance in the clinical outcome. Here, we a) sum-marize the current understanding of the immunogenetic etiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the associated cytokine storm; and b) construct and analyze protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (using enrichment and annotation analysis) based on the NLRP3 and IL18 variants and all genes, which were established in severe COVID-19. Our PPI network and enrichment analyses predict a) useful drug targets to prevent the on-set of severe COVID-19, including key antiviral pathways such as Toll-Like-Receptor cascades, NOD-like receptor signaling, RIG-induction of interferon (IFN) α/β, and interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor signaling; and b) SARS-CoV-2 innate immune evasion and the participation of MYD88 and MAVS in the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19. The PPI network genetic variants may be used to predict more severe COVID-19 outcomes, thereby opening the door for targeted preventive treatments.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

The use of an ester prodrug is a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles. In previous researches, several carboxylate esters of OXY were synthesized and oxyresveratrol tetraacetate (OXY-TAc) was reported to possess anti-melanogenic and anti-skin-aging properties. In this study, in addition to OXY-TAc, two novel ester prodrugs of OXY, oxyresveratrol tetrapropionate (OXY-TPr), and oxyresveratrol tetrabutyrate (OXY-TBu), were synthesized. Results from the Caco-2-permeation assay suggested that synthesized ester prodrugs can improve the membrane-permeation ability of OXY. The OXY-TAc exhibited the most significant profile, then this pro-drug was chosen to observe anti-inflammatory activities with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Our results showed that OXY-Tac significantly alleviated secretion of several pro-inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), mitigated expression of enzyme-regulated inflammation (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)), and suppressed the MAPK cascades. Interestingly, the observed anti-inflammatory activities of OXY-TAc were more remarkable than those of its parent compound OXY. Taken together, we demonstrated that OXY-TAc improved physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic profiles and enhanced the pharmacological effects of OXY. Hence, the results in the present study would strongly support the clinical utilities of OXY-TAc for the treatment of inflammation-related disorders.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

It plays an essential role to adapt and apply for real-world use-cases, including the application with autonomous driving systems. To further study self-driving cars in Thailand, we provide both the proposed methods and the proposed dataset in this paper. In the proposed method, we contribute Deeplab-V3-A1 with Xception, which is an extension of DeepLab-V3+ architecture. Our proposed method as DeepLab-V3-A1 with Xception is enhanced by the different number of 1×1 convolution layers on the decoder side and refining the image classification backbone with modification of the Xception model. The experiment was conducted on four datasets: the proposed dataset and three public datasets i.e., the CamVid, the cityscapes, and IDD datasets, respectively. The results show that our proposed strategy as DeepLab-V3-A1 with Xception performs comparably to the baseline methods for all corpora including measurement units such as mean IoU, F1 score, Precision, and Recall. In addition, we benchmark DeepLab-V3-A1 with Xception on the validation set of the cityscapes dataset with a mean IoU of 78.86%. For our proposed dataset, we first contribute the Bangkok Urbanscapes dataset, the urban scenes in Southeast Asia. This dataset contains the pair of input images and annotated labels for 701 images. Our dataset consists of various driving environments in Bangkok, as shown for eleven semantic classes (Road, Building, Tree, Car, Footpath, Motorcycle, Pole, Person, Trash, Crosswalk, and Misc). We hope that our architecture and our dataset would help self-driving autonomous developers improve systems for driving in many cities with unique traffic and driving conditions similar to Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The 17-m-long PVDs were installed from the top of the embankment in a triangular pattern at a spacing of 0.9 m. Monitoring instruments were installed to measure surface settlements, lateral movements, and pore water pressures in the soft clay layer. The subsequent analyses included settlement calculations, settlement predictions using observational methods, flow parameter back-calculations, soil property comparisons before and after improvement, and FEM simulations. The very soft to soft clay was transformed to medium-stiff clay because its undrained shear strengths and maximum past pressures increased, and its water contents, void ratios, and compression indices decreased. The analyses of the degree of consolidation utilized one-dimensional and observational methods as well as a numerical simulation for the prediction of consolidation settlements and comparison to the field data. The results illustrated the effectiveness of the modified vacuum-PVD system. The findings could be used for guidance of similar soft clay improvement projects.","Materials Science, earth sciences","Materials Science (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

However, there is still a lack of studies comparing the performance of these methods, especially in terms of functional pathway discovery. Thus, this study demonstrated the performance comparison of these two techniques in both numerical accuracies based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and biological meaning efficiency based on functional pathway enrichment. In this study, we analyzed data of severe COVID-19 immune-related genes using heterogeneous data. The prediction results of the COVID-19 immune-related genes in the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network showed that the network diffusion had better performance in both AUROC and pathway enrichment even though it provided a longer computational time than the neighborhood method.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems and Management, Control and Optimization"

Severely impaired left ventricular systolic function can lead to an overt cardiogenic shock requiring mechanical circulatory support. Abnormal cardiac structure and function are potentially reversible after achievement of euthyroid state. Case Report: We present a case of a 53-year-old patient with a diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis-induced acute heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle and severely reduced systolic function with ejection fraction of 20%. Subsequently, the patient developed refractory cardiogenic shock, which was treated with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). After early intensive treatments to achieve euthyroid state, the clinical status significantly improved. Echocardiography prior to discharge showed improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction to 40%. The anti-TSH receptor was positive and Grave’s dis­ease was diagnosed. The patient eventually returned to baseline functional status and could return to basic activities of daily living without limitations. Conclusions: Early diagnosis of cardiac involvement in patients with thyrotoxicosis is critical. Promptly delivered intensive treatment with rapid achievement of euthyroid state can reverse cardiac dysfunction and improve patient outcomes. The use of ECMO can be considered as a “bridge” to recovery of cardiac function after restoration of euthyroid state.",medical,Medicine (all)

The addition of NaCl resulted in the two-step hydrate formation, and it is the first stage that adversely affected the hydrate formation rate. However, the final gas uptake in this system was similar to that without NaCl. The synergistic effects on the kinetic promotion by adding a co-promoter including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and amino acids (valine, leucine, and methionine) were then studied. The results showed that the addition of the co-promoters reduced the induction time, minimized the length of the first stage formation, and increased the hydrate formation rate. Moreover, the induction time and the length of the first stage formation decreased along with the increase in the co-promoter concentration. However, the addition of SDS had the adverse effects by decreasing about half of the final gas uptake and the water to hydrate conversion for the system without SDS. Moreover, the addition of methionine resulted in the best performance as a kinetic promoter on the hydrate formation in the system with THF and NaCl. Up to 95 % of methane gas can be recovered from the hydrates formed with and without the co-promoters. The hydrate formation morphology illustrated the same pattern in all cases.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; crudes; natural gas, natural gasoline and lpg, petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Methods: Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-utility of two modalities, stratified into five age groups based on the first modality taken at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 years old from government and societal perspectives. Input parameters related to clinical aspects and cost were obtained from 15 hospitals throughout Thailand and Thai Renal Replacement Therapy databases. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%, adjusted to 2021, and converted to USD (1 USD = 33.57 Thai Baht). One-way analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the uncertainty surrounding model parameters. Results: From the government perspective, compared to PD-first policy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was between 19,434 and 23,796 USD per QALY. Conversely, from a societal perspective, the ICER was between 31,913 and 39,912 USD per QALY. Both are higher than the willingness to pay threshold of 4,766 USD per QALY. Conclusion: By applying the updated real-practice data, PD-first policy still remains more cost-effective than HD-first policy at the current willingness to pay. However, HD gained more quality-adjusted life years than PD.

PPO was used as a renewable feedstock for bio-hydrogenated diesel production via catalytic hydrotreating under a temperature of 330 °C, H2 pressure of 50 bar, WHSV of 1.5 h−1, and H2/oil (v/v) of 1000 cm3/cm3 under continuous operation. The oil yield from a Soxhlet extraction of PPO was up to 26 wt.% on a dry basis, mainly consisting of C18 fatty acids. The catalytic activity in terms of conversion and diesel yield was in the same trend as increasing in the order of NiMo/γ-Al2O3 > NiMo/TiO2 > NiMo/SiO2. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity was more favorable over the sulfided NiMo supported on γ-Al2O3 and TiO2, while a high DCO was observed over the sulfided NiMo/SiO2 catalyst, which related to the properties of the support material and the intensity of metal–support interaction. The deactivation of NiMo/SiO2 and NiMo/TiO2 occurred in a short period, due to the phosphorus and alkali impurities in PPO which were not found in the case of RPO. NiMo/γ-Al2O3 exhibited the high resistance of impure feedstock with excellent stabil-ity. This indicates that the catalytic performance is influenced by the purity of the feedstock as well as the characteristics of the catalysts.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, its efficacy in comparison with periarticular anesthetic injection (PAI) alone has yet to be evaluated. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study to compare PAI and ACB + iPACK for controlling pain after TKA. Methods: Propensity scores, incorporating American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, body mass index, age, and sex, were used to match the ACB + iPACK group with the PAI group. All patients received the identical surgical technique and postoperative care. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, morphine consumption, knee flexion angle, straight leg raising (SLR), postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV), and length of stay (LOS) after the surgery. Results: After matching by propensity score, there were 49 patients with comparable demographic data in each group. The VAS and morphine requirements of the PAI and ACB + iPACK groups were not different during the first 48 hours after TKA. At 72 hours postoperatively, the VAS of the ACB + iPACK was 0.97 higher than that of the PAI group (p = 0.020). Knee flexion angle, SLR, PONV, and LOS were not significantly different between groups. No procedure-related complications were identified in either group. Conclusions: The anesthesiologist-administered ACB + iPACK was as effective as surgeon-administered PAI in controlling pain in the first 48 hours after TKA.

It is a vital therapeutic target for designing novel anticancer agents in targeted cancer therapy. Sulfones, members of organosulfur compounds, have been reported to possess various biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, anticancer, and antimalarial properties. In the present study, a series of sulfones was selected to evaluate their inhibitory activity against TopoIIα using computational approaches. Molecular docking results revealed that several sulfone analogs bind efficiently to the ATPase domain of TopoIIα. Among them, sulfones 18a, 60a, *4 b, *8 b, *3c, and 8c exhibit higher binding affinity than the known TopoII inhibitor, salvicine. Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations based on MM/PB(GB)SA method demonstrated that sulfone *8 b strongly interacts with amino acid residues in the ATP-binding pocket (E87, N91, D94, I125, I141, F142, S149, G161, and A167), driven mainly by an electrostatic attraction and a strong H-bond formation at G161 residue. Altogether, the obtained results predicted that sulfones could have a high potential to be a lead molecule for targeting TopoIIα. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Axial load-strain relationships of partially encased composite columns with H-shaped steel sections,"Bangprasit P., Anuntasena W., Lenwari A.",2022-10-01,"Axial compression behavior, Composite column, Confined concrete, H shaped steel, H-shaped, Partial encasement, Partially encased composite columns, Peak load, Slenderness ratios, Steel sections, analytical model, composite column, compressive strength, confined concrete, partial encasement","This paper presents the axial compression behavior of partially encased composite (PEC) columns using H-shaped structural steel. In the experimental program, a total of eight PEC columns with H-shaped steel sections of different flange and web slenderness ratios were tested to investigate the interactive mechanism between steel and concrete. The test results showed that the PEC columns could sustain the load well beyond the peak load provided that the flange slenderness ratio was not greater than five. In addition, the previous analytical model was extended to predict the axial load-strain relationships of the PEC columns with H-shaped steel sections. A good agreement between the predicted load-strain relationships and test data was observed. Using the analytical model, the effects of compressive strength of concrete (21 to 69 MPa), yield strength of steel (245 to 525 MPa), slenderness ratio of flange (4 to 10), and slenderness ratio of web (10 to 25) on the interactive mechanism (Kh = confinement factor for highly confined concrete and Kw = reduction factor for steel web) and ductility index (DI = ratio between strain at peak load and strain at proportional load) were assessed. The numerical results showed that the slenderness of steel flange and yield strength of steel significantly influenced the compression behavior of the PEC columns.","process equipment, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Metals and Alloys"

Methods: A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted with paediatric postgraduate trainees who used an online English-language breastfeeding module in two Thai universities (May 2020, done online) and two Malaysian universities (Sept- Nov 2019, in-person). FGDs explored module usability and utility. Sessions were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The process of coding was done collaboratively by Thai and Malaysian researchers. Results: Twenty Six resident trainees participated (Thai, n = 13; Malaysian, n = 13). Ages ranged from 29–34 years old, with 21 females. Nineteen participants had never used online learning modules prior to this. Participants took between 1 to 5 sessions to complete the breastfeeding module. Four themes emerged from their experience. 1) The online learning module was more engaging and detailed than previous lectures, courses and/or books, but lacked hands-on training. 2) Using an online platform facilitated learning as eased navigation and resource searching, however, problems were encountered navigating the module on some devices. 3) Learners preferred less words and more graphics, as this helped them capture key messages. 4) Regionally tailored content elicited a mixed reaction from participants. Conclusions: Users found that the adapted module compared favourably with previous learning experiences. However, online learning modules lack hands-on training, and implementation should ideally incorporate a mix of both. Consideration of device diversity and preferences for how content was adapted for local settings are needed for tailoring.",sociology,Education

This article proposes a new control strategy based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets for controlling the grid-connected dispersed generation (DG) system tied to the distorted electric grid. The proposed control technique can easily model and handle the uncertainties in the system parameters and renewable energy sources. The existence of three-dimensional membership functions of type-2 fuzzy sets offers an additional degree of freedom to counter the uncertainties in the system. The proposed strategy is effective in improving the dynamic response during system uncertainties such as distortions in grid voltage, variations in grid frequency, variations in renewable energy sources and due to presence of non-linear and unbalanced loads. Also, it improves the quality of the current being injected to the grid during uncertainties. The proposed control strategy is applied to control the dc side capacitor voltage as well as to control the current loop of the grid connected inverter. The proposed system is simulated in MATLAB Simulink environment and the performance is compared with traditional controllers to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy during system abnormalities.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence"

However, the effects of DTMUV on duck immunological components and functions remain largely unknown. In this study, the dynamics of cellular and humoral immune responses of DTMUV-infected ducks were investigated. The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and non-T and B lymphocytes as well as the levels of neutralizing antibodies were quantified in parallel with DTMUV loads in blood and target organs. Our results demonstrated that DTMUV infection caused severe losses of non-T and B lymphocyte/myeloid cell subpopulation, and reduction in phagocytic activity during 3–5 days after infection. We also found that the numbers of T and B cells were increased during the first week of DTMUV infection. A significant negative correlation between the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T, B and non-T and B lymphocytes and viral loads in blood and target organ (spleen) was observed during the early phase of infection. Additionally, DTMUV infection induced an early and robust neutralizing antibody response, which was associated with DTMUV-specific IgM and IgG responses. The presence of neutralizing antibody also correlated with reduction of viremia and viral load in the spleen. Overall, DTMUV elicited both cellular and humoral immune responses upon infection, in which the magnitude of these responses was correlated with reduction of viremia and viral loads in the target organ (spleen). The results suggested the critical role of both cellular and humoral immunity against DTMUV infection. This study expands our understanding of the immunological events following DTMUV infection in ducks.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, www.clinicaltrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from inception to July 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use versus non-use of spirometry during standard clinical review in children aged <18 years with respiratory problems in clinics. We used Cochrane methodology. The search identified 3475 articles; 8 full-text articles were reviewed but only 1 study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The single study involved two cluster RCTs of spirometry for children with asthma in general practice. The included study did not find any significant intergroup difference at the 12-month follow-up for asthma-related quality-of-life and clinical endpoints. However, the findings were limited by methodological weaknesses and high risks of bias. With a paucity of data, the clinical benefits of spirometry remain unclear. Thus, there is a clear need for RCTs that provide high-quality evidence to support the routine use of spirometry in children with suspected or known lung disease.

However, service users have no mechanism to provide their requirements in assessing validators. Existing works are biased from users' perspectives, which risks collusion attacks due to improperly selected validators. This article aims to solve this by considering users' expectations on services. A user-oriented framework is proposed to evaluate the trust of BIoT services with the consideration of validator attributes. It provides an effective mechanism to express requirements. Specification language is adopted in our algorithm to perform compliance checking. The feasibility has been verified in a simulation. We found that the permissioned blockchain has also benefited from the proposed user-oriented selection of validators in terms of computing efficiency due to additional constraints.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Information Systems, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study aimed to determine the association between the duration of online learning and food consumption behaviors, lifestyles, and quality of life in terms of mental health among Thai undergraduate students during COVID-19 restrictions. A cross-sectional online survey of 464 undergraduate students was conducted at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, between March and May 2021. The majority of undergraduate students stated that they spent 3–6 h per day on online learning (76.1%) and used their digital devices such as computers, tablets, or smartphones more than 6 h per day (76.9%). In addition, they had 75.4% of skipping breakfast (≥3 times/week) and 63.8% of sleep duration (6–8 h/day). A higher proportion of students who drank tea or coffee with milk and sugar while online learning was observed. The results found that the increased duration of online learning was significantly associated with skipping breakfast and the frequency of sugary beverage consumption. On the other hand, the increased computer, tablet, and smartphone usage for online learning was correlated with lower sleep duration and a poor quality of life in terms of mental health. The findings from this study contribute to a report of the association between online learning and food consumption and lifestyle behaviors and quality of life of undergraduate students, emphasizing the necessity for intervention strategies to promote healthy behaviors.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Methods: In this HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved retrospective analysis, a total of 105 patients who underwent nephrographic phase (NP) dlDECT between 07/2018 and 11/2019 were included: 55 patients received single bolus and 50 patients split-bolus examinations. Both scan protocols comprised a TUE and 120-kVp NP acquisition from which VUE images were reconstructed. A radiologist performed ROI-based attenuation measurements of liver parenchyma, main portal vein, aorta, spleen, renal parenchyma, and pelvis on TUE and VUE images. Agreement between TUE and VUE images was determined and compared for both protocols and each anatomic region. Results: VUE attenuation was significantly higher than TUE attenuation in both cohorts in the liver, portal vein, spleen, and renal parenchyma (p < 0.05), while it was similar in the abdominal aorta in both cohorts (p = 0.05, 0.7522, respectively). VUE attenuation was significantly higher than TUE attenuation in the renal pelvis of the split-bolus cohort (p < 0.05). When comparing VUE images between single- and split-bolus protocols, the renal parenchyma yielded a significantly higher VUE attenuation in the single-bolus cohort (single bolus: 38.8 ± 3.3 HU vs. split bolus: 36.8 ± 3.6 HU; p < 0.05), whereas the split-bolus cohort revealed markedly higher VUE attenuation in the renal pelvis (single bolus: 2.3 ± 10.8 HU vs. split bolus: 92.3 ± 76.8; p < 0.05). Mean intra-patient differences between TUE and VUE images were comparable between single- and split-bolus cohorts (p-range 0.09–0.35) except for the renal parenchyma and pelvis: in the first, the single-bolus cohort yielded a higher VUE attenuation, while in the second, attenuation was significantly higher in the split-bolus cohort (p < 0.05).

Optimal Sizing of BESS Considering Economic Dispatch and VRE in Thailand Generation System,"Yimprapai A., Chaitusaney S.",2022-01-01,"Battery energy storage systems, Conventional generation, Economic Dispatch, Generation systems, Load curves, Optimal sizing, Ramp-rate, Renewable energy generation, Thailand, Variable renewable energies, Battery Energy Storage System, Conventional Generation, Operating Costs, Ramp Rate, Variable Renewable Energy","The increasing proportion of renewable energy (RE) in a power system causes many problems such as duck curve phenomenon, making its load curve and conventional generator operations change. These issues have become significant concerns. If the difference of the load curve is a huge ramp, the operating costs of the conventional generation will increase. In recent years, the price of battery energy storage system (BESS) has been decreasing continuously. With its fast response characteristic, the BESS is a potential candidate to mitigate the load curve issue. Therefore, this paper proposes an economic dispatch method for minimizing the operating costs of conventional generation integrated with RE generation and the BESS. Besides, the detailed analysis based on Thailand's power generation is provided to achieve the optimal BESS size. According to Power Development Plan (PDP) 2018, the RE generation comprises photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation while the conventional generation consists of combined-cycle and coal thermal generation. The proposed method was performed using the optimization toolbox in MATLAB programming. The amount of RE generation is swept through 10 to 140 percent of its initial value while the amount of conventional generation is constant. The simulation results show that if the RE generation reaches 90 percent, the BESS is required.

Surface characteristics such as surface morphology, surface moieties, roughness, and wettability were observed. The addition of FAS decreased the apparent surface energy between solid surfaces and liquids with a polar contribution of surface free energy as low as 0 mN m−1. The formation of the FAS layer was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level spectra. Three-dimensional surface topography revealed an increase in the spray coating cycle that enhanced the hydrophobicity of the coated paper. The results confirmed that not only microstructures but also the presence of functional groups with low surface energy (such as FAS) can promote surface hydrophobicity. The spray-coated paper with FAS/ZIF in the presence of a small amount of nanocellulose provided a superhydrophobic surface after the first spray cycle. The separation efficiency was up to 85% and was slightly affected by oil viscosity. Moreover, this can be used as a filter membrane for water-in-oil emulsions.

Conventional zeolites were modified for mesoporous zeolites by desilication with NaOH. The zeolite supported Ni-catalysts were prepared by a wet impregnation method with 10 wt% of Ni loading. The experiments were carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor at different conditions; temperatures of 375–475 °C and hydrogen pressures of 15–25 bar. The findings demonstrated that the reaction temperature has a strong effect on conversion of palm oil and selectivity of jet-fuel range product which has 8–16 carbon atoms per molecule. A high liquid content was achieved at the temperature and pressure of 425 °C and 25 bar, respectively. The conventional zeolite 10 wt% Ni/USY gave the highest liquid product, lowest aromatic content and highest jet-fuel range selectivity of 56.83%, 17.97% and 79.97%, respectively. Moreover, in case of modified-support catalyst, 10 wt% Ni/USY desilicated with 0.5 M NaOH can reach the higher yield of liquid product up to 58.52% and high iso-alkane selectivity.

The principle of virtual work is used to derive the equations of motion. The outputs, including the deformation measures, constitutive relations, cross-sectional stress resultants, equations of motion, and boundary conditions, are explicitly expressed in terms of the kinematic unknowns. The established general formulation is further specialized to the case of planar arbitrarily curved microbeams which cannot be found in the literature. The accuracy of the derived equations of motion is tested by a comparison with existing studies of planar circular and straight microbeams.

A common dye, phenolphthalein (PhP), is used as a colorless dye marker in commercial gasoline. The color was developed by the interaction of PhP with NaOH on filter paper strips and evaluated by CMYK color systems. The newly developed counter-flowing technique, in which a gasoline sample containing PhP and NaOH solution are allowed to travel on a filter paper strip from the opposite end, gives the naked eye detection of PhP as low as 1 ppm with the limit of detection for a smartphone camera of 0.31 ppm. The high sensitivity is attributed to the preconcentration derived from accumulation of PhP at the immiscible liquid interface. The counter-flowing method can thus be a new facile analytical technique for enhancing chemical detection sensitivity.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Mechanics of Materials, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Various information can be extracted and quantified from neutron images for further analysis, such as flow patterns, void fraction distribution, bubble coalescence and breakup, bubble velocity, pressure loss, gas volume fraction, and effects of rising bubbles. Two-dimensional Neutron Radiography (NR) is produced by measuring an amount of transmitted neutron intensity after passing through a test section. This modality of imaging has been successfully utilized for visualization and quantification purposes in many applications and multiphase flow studies such as geological and porous media research, thermal-hydraulics phenomena, etc. However, certain shortcomings of two-dimensional NR are prominent, including limited temporal and spatial resolutions, which result in challenges in evaluating materials with complex geometries and capturing the high-speed fluid flow and dynamic phenomena. Three-dimensional Neutron Computed Tomography (NCT) provides a clearer insight into an object and a capability to observe dynamic phenomena. The CT technique is based on a measurement of radiation attenuation in a projection through an object from different orientations. Two main types of reconstruction algorithms are analytical reconstruction algorithms and iterative reconstruction algorithms. The analytical reconstruction algorithm provides accurate reconstruction without requiring long computational time and a high level of complexity. However, it requires a fully sampled projection data set with an angle coverage of 360° around the object, which is not always feasible to obtain under extreme experimental environments such as high heat, physical stress, and intense radiation. An investigation of multiphase flow studies in neutron imaging facilities encounters the mentioned environments, limited access, and high cost of implementation. Therefore, a research direction in NCT reconstruction methods lies in a trade-off between many projections with a low number of counts against a reduction in projections but increased acquisition time per orientation angle. Iterative reconstruction techniques produce improved image quality with a smaller amount of projection data. Nevertheless, the techniques exhibit increased computing complexity and longer computational time. This study reviews recent studies of NR and NCT in multiphase flow applications, such as an investigation of heavy oil flow behaviors for upgrading a packed bed of metallic reactors and determination of flow regime and void fraction distribution, etc. In addition, this study presents an in-depth explanation of iterative reconstruction algorithms and discusses the direction in which the NCT study is gradually shifting.","energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ajmaline and high pacing rate on the BrS substrates. Methods: Thirty-two patients with BrS (mean age 40 ± 12 years) and frequent ventricular fibrillation episodes underwent right ventricular outflow tract substrate electroanatomical and electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) mapping before and after ajmaline administration and during high-rate atrial pacing. In 4 patients, epicardial mapping was performed using open thoracotomy with targeted biopsies. Results: Ajmaline increased the activation time delay in the substrate (33%; P = .002), ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (74%; P < .0001), and the area of delayed activation (170%; P < .0001), coinciding with the increased substrate size (75%; P < .0001). High atrial pacing rate increased the abnormal EGM duration at the right ventricular outflow tract areas from 112 ± 48 to 143 ± 66 ms (P = .003) and produced intermittent conduction block and/or excitation failure at the substrate sites, especially after ajmaline administration. Biopsies from the 4 patients with thoracotomy showed epicardial fibrosis where EGMs were normal at baseline but became fractionated after ajmaline administration. In some areas, local activation was absent and unipolar EGMs had a monophasic morphology resembling the shape of the action potential. Conclusion: Sodium current reduction with ajmaline severely compromises impulse conduction at the BrS fibrotic substrates by producing fractionated EGMs, conduction block, or excitation failure, leading to the Brugada ECG pattern and favoring ventricular fibrillation genesis.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

Self-rated oral health among elderly patients attending a university dental hospital in Thailand: a telephone-based cross-sectional survey study,"Sermsuti-Anuwat N., Nampikul N., Suwannimit R., Panthueng W.",2022-10-10,"Geriatric dentistry, Health promotion, Oral health promotion, Oral healths, Self-rated oral health, Subjective oral function, Telephone numbers, Thailand, Geriatric dentistry, Oral health, Oral health promotion, Self-rated oral health, Subjective oral functions","Background. Oral health perception is an influential predictor of both current and future health among the elderly. However, limited research has focused on self-rated oral health among older patients attending tertiary dental care. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential factors associated with self-rated oral health among elderly patients attending a university dental hospital in Thailand. Methods. This telephone-based cross-sectional study was carried out among elderly patients older than 60 years who attended at least one dental visit at the university dental hospital in 2020. Hospital numbers (HN) were used to identify eligible candidates for this study. We calculated the sample size by assuming a finite population of 70,028 elderly patients with valid telephone numbers. The minimum sample required for this study was 398 participants. Trained interviewers conducted telephone calls between July 2021 and January 2022 using the validated modified oral health questionnaire. Self-rated oral health was assessed using a conventionally used global oral health question: ‘‘How would you describe your dental health?’’ with three response options: good, fair, and poor. Descriptive statistics, Fisher’s exact test, and binary logistic regression were performed to analyze the data. Results. A total of 836 telephone numbers were called. There were 402 (48.10%) elderly patients who agreed to and completed the telephone interview. Most of the study participants were women (61.4%) between 61–74 years of age (83.1%) with a mean age of 69.18 years. Bivariate analyses showed associations between poor self-rated oral health and lower subjective oral functions: chewing discomfort (p < 0.001) and speaking discomfort (p = 0.013). However, the multivariate regression model indicated a significant association between poor self-rated oral health and chewing discomfort (p < 0.001). Therefore, elderly patients with chewing discomfort were more likely to perceive poor oral health. Conclusions. These findings indicate that difficulty chewing could be a potential factor influencing self-rated adverse oral health among older patients attending the university dental hospital. Furthermore, our study adds that the predictive power of a single-item self-measurement supports its value as a standard measure to predict oral health risk in tertiary care institutions, as well as primary care settings and community-based survey research. Therefore, healthcare providers should routinely evaluate self-rated oral health among elderly patients to detect early signs and symptoms of oral health problems, assess the success of dental treatments, and monitor general health and well-being.","fluidex; related topics, neuroscience, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Neuroscience (all), Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

CoronaVac, which is an inactivated virus vaccine, was the first imported COVID-19 vaccine in Thailand. To investigate the safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac within the Thai population, we conducted a prospective cohort study among health care workers aged 18–59 years, who received a 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac 21 days apart between March and April 2021 at the hospital in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. We recruited 185 participants with a mean age of 32 years. Total antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 were tested. Total antibodies against RBD were negative before immunization. One volunteer was positive for N, although negative for the RBD antibodies. The seroconversion rate of total antibodies against RBD after the first CoronaVac dose was 67% with a Geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 1.98 U/ml. Following CoronaVac dose 2, the seroconversion rate increased to 100% with a GMC of 92.9 U/ml. The seroconversion rates of IgG against N protein were 1% after dose 1 and 62.8% after dose 2. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 59.5%. Injection-site pain was the most common local adverse event (52.4%), while myalgia was the most common systemic adverse event (31.9%). No serious adverse events were observed. A 0–21 days, 2-dose CoronaVac regimen appears safe, inducing a satisfactory response compared with convalescent serum obtained 4–6 weeks postnatural infection. Antibody responses after 2-dose CoronaVac were comparable to the convalescent plasma but waned rapidly after 3 months. Therefore, we recommend 2-dose CoronaVac administration with possible booster doses.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Mulberry leaves, which contain 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), have been used as a complementary medicine for diabetes prevention and treatment. Our recent study demonstrated that mulberry leaf powder with 12 mg of DNJ improves postprandial hyperglycemia, fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. However, the detailed mechanisms are still unknown. This study investigates the effect of long-term (12-week) supplementation of mulberry leaves in obese people with prediabetes and patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes. Participants’ blood was collected before and after supplementation. The protein profile of the plasma was examined by proteomics. In addition, the mitochondrial function was evaluated by energetic and homeostatic markers using immunoelectron microscopy. The proteomics results showed that, from a total of 1291 proteins, 32 proteins were related to diabetes pathogenesis. Retinol-binding protein 4 and haptoglobin protein were downregulated, which are associated with insulin resistance and inflammation, respectively. For mitochondrial function, the haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 3 (HDHD-3) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) displayed a significant increment in the after treatment group. In summary, administration of mulberry leaf powder extract in prediabetes and the early stage of diabetes can alleviate insulin resistance and inflammation and promote mitochondrial function in terms of energy production and fission.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

In addition, a few case reports of thyroiditis after adenoviral vector coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination have been published. Case presentation: A 55-year-old Thai woman presented with palpitation without neck pain 14 days after receiving AstraZeneca coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia. Her blood tests showed elevation of cardiac troponin and free triiodothyronine with suppressed serum thyroid stimulating hormone, reflecting a hyperthyroid status. Evidence of myocardial inflammation and necrosis from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging supported the diagnosis of recent myocarditis. Laboratory results and imaging findings were consistent with thyroiditis. After 3 weeks of symptomatic treatment, her symptom and blood tests had returned to normal. Conclusions: This case demonstrates that the adenoviral vector coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine could possibly cause myocarditis and painless thyroiditis.

The pristine HA hydrogels as the matrix and GO as the drug encapsulation host were fabricated for transdermal patch by the solution casting using citric acid as the chemical crosslinker. In vitro drug release experiment was investigated by utilizing the modified Franz-diffusion cell under the effects of crosslinking ratio, electric potential, and GO. The TMX release behaviors from the hydrogels were found to be from the three mechanisms: the pure Fickian diffusion; the anomalous or non-Fickian diffusion; and Super case II transport depending on the crosslinking conditions. The TMX diffusion and release amount from the pristine HA hydrogels were increased with smaller crosslinking ratios. With applied electrical potential, the enhanced TMX diffusion and release amount were observed when compared to that without due to the electro-repulsive force. Furthermore, the TMX diffusion from the HA hydrogel with GO as the drug encapsulation host was higher by two orders of magnitude than without GO.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

However, its dimensional stability needed to be improved. This study aimed to improve the dimensional stability of TC coconut wood for further use in laminated products by using relatively high pressing temperatures to make it more hydrophobic. TC specimens with a target compression ratio of 55 % were manufactured from low-density (LD, 332 ± 25 kg/m3) wood, and TC specimens with a target compression ratio of 25 % were manufactured from medium-density (MD, 514 ± 28 kg/m3) wood. Two pressing temperatures (170 °C and 200 °C) and three pressing times (1 h, 2 h and 3 h) were applied. Chemical changes, dimensional stability, physical and mechanical properties, and bonding performance of the specimens were examined. Thermal degradation of the LD specimens was higher than that of the MD specimens. Differences in chemistry between the surface and the interior could explain bonding behavior. Pressing temperature had a greater impact on wood degradation than the pressing time. Dimensional stability could be achieved at 200 °C pressing temperature. Most physical and mechanical properties of the TC specimens had decreased due to thermal degradation. However, compressive strength parallel to the grain and modulus of elasticity were not affected at the chosen pressing parameters. Bonding performance determined by block shear tests was dependent on the original material, panel assembly, and the sanding process. Longitudinally laminated panels made from MD specimens with sanded surfaces provided the highest block shear strength.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

Despite this, investigations focused on goats remain limited compared to those for pathogens infecting cattle. We carried out PCR-based surveys and phylogenetic analyses to examine TTBPs from 6 provinces in Thailand between January 2016 and June 2020. A total of 93 tick samples were collected as well as 969 blood samples from goats. All ticks were morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus microplus and confirmed for species based on 16S rRNA and cox1 gene sequences. The mitochondrial cox1 sequences in the present study were clustered into clades A and C. The overall infection rates of Anaplasma spp., piroplasmids, and co-infections of both parasites in goats were 13.5% (131/969), 2.7% (24/880), and 0.7% (7/969), respectively. We observed no statistically significant association between TTBP infections and age or sex. However, TTBP infections and the rainy season were linked (p < 0.05). Anaplasma bovis, Anaplasma marginale, and Anaplasma ovis were detected for the first time in goats in the country using primers targeting the chaperonin GroEL (groEL), major surface protein 2 (msp2), and major surface protein 4 (msp4) genes, while Anaplasma capra and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were not detected. Anaplasma bovis, A. marginale, and A. ovis isolates were clustered in a subclade that differed from the strains found in other countries. Among piroplasmids, only Theileria luwenshuni was detected in the current investigation. This work will add to the current understanding regarding the prevalence, genetic diversity, and genetic relationships of A. bovis, A. marginale, A. ovis, and T. luwenshuni among global isolates and those in Thailand.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

The anticancer potential against various types of human cancer cells, including lung, breast, and colon cancers as well as toxicity to normal dermal papilla cells were assessed via cell viability and nuclear staining assays. Despite lower cytotoxicity in lung cancer H460 cells, the higher % apoptosis and lower % cell viability were presented in breast cancer MCF7 and colon cancer CaCo2 cells treated with 50 µM cymensifin A (1) for 24 h compared with the treatment of 50 µM cisplatin, an available chemotherapeutic drug. Intriguingly, the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of cymensifin A in dermal papilla cells at >200 µM suggested its selective anticancer activity. The obtained information supports the further development of a dihydrophenanthrene derivative from C. ensifolium as an effective chemotherapy with a high safety profile for the treatment of various cancers.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Thus, an effective and safe antimicrobial medication against such refractory infection is necessary in endodontic retreatment, so we aimed to test the efficacy of chitosan paste against these microorganisms compared with Ca(OH)2 in root canals of extracted human teeth. Methods: Thirty-six sterilized human root samples prepared from extracted premolars and upper maxillary incisors were infected with E. faecalis for 14 days, while 32 were infected with C. albicans for 48 h, for mature biofilm formation. The samples were assigned to 6 groups of intracanal medications: Group 1: no medication (negative control); Group 2: 20% Polyethylene glycol (PEG); Group 3: 20% Propylene glycol (PG); Group 4: Ca(OH)2; Group 5: Chitosan + PEG; and Group 6: Chitosan + PG. After 7 days, intracanal surface dentin was harvested using Protaper next, resuspended, serially diluted and spread on Brain–Heart-Infusion agar (for E. faecalis) and Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose agar (for C. albicans) for colony count. Antimicrobial efficacy was determined as percentage of remaining colony forming unit (CFUs) relative to negative control and analyzed using One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Games-Howell test. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: For E. faecalis, chitosan + PG had significantly higher antibacterial activity than Ca(OH)2 (P = 0.039). Chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG medication significantly reduced viable bacteria compared with negative control, PEG and PG (P = 0.001, 0.003, 0.024, respectively for chitosan + PEG; P = 0.002, 0.003, 0.014, respectively for chitosan + PG). For C.albicans, chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG were not significantly different from Ca(OH)2. However, Chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG, but not Ca(OH)2, showed a significantly lower level of remaining CFUs compared with negative control (P = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: Chitosan paste showed better efficacy in reducing viable E. faecalis biofilm when compared to Ca(OH)2 after 7-day intracanal medication in this in vitro root canal model.

Key results included the observation that catalysts produced using an Al2O3 binder possessed the highest catalytic activity compared to kaolin and diatomite supported catalysts, for calcination temperatures of 800 °C, possessing a comparable catalytic activity to the CaO powder. The CaO to Al2O3 mass ratio exhibited a significant effect on the surface area and total basicity. The highest biodiesel yield was obtained using the CaO-A(800)-3.5:1 catalyst due to the presence of several active crystal phases including CaO, Ca(OH)2 and CaSiO3 phases to accelerate the transesterification rate. These fabricated CaO catalyst pellets can be utilized as a catalyst for the continuous biodiesel production process.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"
Human RNA-directed DNA methylation methylates high-mobility group box 1 protein-produced DNA gaps,"Watcharanurak P., Mutirangura A.",2022-06-01,"Alu Elements, DNA, DNA Methylation, HMGB1 Protein, Humans, RNA, Small Interfering, Sirtuin 1, AGO4, Alu methylation, Alu siRNA, genomic instability, global hypomethylation, HMGB1, human RNA-directed DNA methylation, RdDM, Youth-DNA-GAPs","Background: DNA sequences around HMGB1-produced DNA gaps are hypermethylates. DNA methylation of interspersed repetitive sequences (IRS) such as Alu elements can be established through AGO4-mediating, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). HMGB1 depletion, DNA gap reduction and global hypomethylation promote genomic instability. Methods: HMGB1, SIRT1, AGO4 and DNA gap colocalizations were evaluated. Then, Alu methylation was analyzed in HMGB1-deficient or HMGB1-overexpressing cells and Alu siRNA-transfected HMGB1-deficient cells. Results: HMGB1, SIRT1, AGO4 and DNA gap are colocalized in the nucleus. Moreover, HMGB1 or Alu siRNA increased Alu methylation, whereas Alu siRNA could not methylate HMGB1-deficient cells. Conclusion: AGO4 play a role in methylating DNA sequence around HMGB1-produced DNA gaps and localize DNA gap in IRS, and loss of intranuclear HMGB1 causes global hypomethylation.",biochemistryistry,"Genetics, Cancer Research"

Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) due to anti-sD is rare. A mother delivered a newborn whose red blood cells (RBCs) were DAT-positive and was later diagnosed with HDFN. Serum from the mother was incompatible with the father's RBCs and was used to screen 184 Thai blood donors. This study aimed to investigate the cause of HDFN in a Thai family and determine the prevalence of sD in Thai blood donors. Materials and Methods: Three family members and four blood donors were investigated in the study. Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) was used for genotyping. Standard hemagglutination techniques were used in titration studies, phenotyping, and enzyme/chemical studies. Anti-s, anti-Mia, anti-JENU, and anti-sD reagents were used in serological investigations. Results: The mother was GYP*Mur/Mur. The father and the four donors were GYPB*s/sD predicting S − s + sD+. The baby was GYP*Mur/sD and his RBCs were Mia+, s + w with anti-s (P3BER) and JENU+w. RBCs from two GYPB*sD-positive blood donors reacted with anti-sD (Dreyer). Proteolytic enzyme α-chymotrypsin-treated sD+ cells did not react with anti-sD (Wat) produced by the GP.Mur/Mur mother but reacted with the original anti-sD (Dreyer). Discussion: This is the first report of HDFN due to anti-sD in the Asian population. The genotype frequency for GYPB*sD in a selected Thai blood donor population is 2.2% (4/184). Anti-sD should be considered in mothers with Southeast Asian or East Asian background when antibody identification is unresolved in pregnancies affected by HDFN.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Hematology"

The design circuit consists of an active-passive hybrid equalization circuit using the passive RC high pass filter cascaded with the non-inverting active Sallen-Key amplifier and the RF broadband amplifier circuit. The design shows that at -3 dB bandwidth of the optical wireless communication can expand the frequency bandwidth of 1 MHz to 700 MHz. Additionally, it can amplify the input signal to compensate for the attenuation in the frequency operation range of 18 dB.

Participants from China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand presented country-specific information on pertussis prevalence, diagnosis, surveillance, vaccine administration and schedules, maternal and neonatal disease rates, and policies and practice of vaccination during pregnancy. In recent years, many Asian countries have seen an increase in pertussis cases, although underreporting of the disease is a concern. Currently, most Asian countries have only passive surveillance for pertussis in place. There is a need for improved surveillance to determine the disease burden and justify vaccination policies and recommendations, such as essential vaccination, boosters, and vaccination during pregnancy. Better awareness of the disease in adolescents and adults is necessary, and infant and childhood vaccination schedules need to be improved in many countries. Differences between private versus public sector vaccination schedules and between whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines should continue to be examined. It can be anticipated that unmet needs in the prevention and management of pertussis will continue as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and that key recommendations highlighted in this meeting report will be of ongoing importance.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Immunomodulatory effects of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) induce allergen-specific tolerance. However, AIT is not well-recognized as a treatment for LAR. Methodology: Systematic search on six electronic databases and registries was performed. Experimental and observational studies of AIT for LAR patients were retrieved. The primary outcomes were symptom score, medication score, combined symptom medication score, and disease-specific quality of life. Secondary outcomes were serum specific(s) IgG4, sIgE, and adverse events. Results: Four double-blind randomized controlled trials (156 patients) from two research units assessed the effects of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Compared with placebo, SCIT showed significant reductions in symptom score, medication score, combined symptom medication score, disease-specific quality of life, and an increase in serum sIgG4. There was no significant change in serum sIgE. Likewise, two observational studies (one using SCIT and one using sublingual immunotherapy) improved post-therapeutic symptom score. No studies assessed the effects after discontinuation of treatment. AIT was safe without serious adverse events. Conclusion: AIT has beneficial effects and safe for LAR. Its effects are restricted to studies with short-term follow-up. AIT may be considered in LAR patients.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology

Herein, through theoretical screening approach, focusing on addressing this challenge, we rationally designed a series of WS2 monolayer decorated by single transition metal (TM) atom as TM@WS2 candidates and systematically explored their potentials for catalyzing N2 reduction by building a full profile of stability, activity and selectivity. Our results unveil that, among 26 candidates, Cr@WS2, Tc@WS2 and Os@WS2 finally stand out as the most promising candidates, on which the adsorbed N2 molecule can be efficiently converted into NH3 through the distal mechanism with the limiting potentials of −0.37, −0.27 and −0.33 V, respectively, and impressively, the competing HER process can be pronouncedly inhibited. In particular, the activity trend is constructed by using *NNH adsorption energy and φ, and ICOHP reveals the origin of catalytic activity toward NRR. Our investigation not only contributes to the development of the highly efficient electrocatalysts, but also provides insightful views on the optimal design of WS2-based catalysts for advanced NH3 synthesis.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

In the overall population, the incidence of VRAEs was significantly lower in cancer patients than in healthy volunteers (57% vs 80%, P <.001). Because the mean age of the cancer patients was higher than the healthy volunteers (59 vs 48 years, P <.001), we analyzed age-matched comparison and found that there was no significant difference of VRAEs between two groups (74% vs 79%, P.32). Most VRAEs were of mild severity in both groups. The most common local VRAE was pain at the injection site in both groups, and the most common systemic VRAE was fatigue in the cancer cohort, while myalgia was the most common VRAE among the healthy controls. In the cancer cohort, fever was the only VRAE that led to interruption of the cancer treatment (in two cases). Among the cancer treatment types, patients undergoing chemotherapy-containing regimens had a lower likelihood of experiencing VRAEs. In summary, the overall incidence of VRAEs following ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccine in actively treated cancer patients was comparable to healthy controls after adjusting for age. The VRAEs that occurred rarely interfered with the cancer treatment. These findings substantiate that vaccination with AZD1222 is safe in cancer patients undergoing treatment.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied Cox proportional hazards models to identify clinical features associated with recurrent stroke among participants enrolled in RE-SPECT ESUS (Randomized, Double-Blind, Evaluation in Secondary Stroke Prevention Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of the Oral Thrombin Inhibitor Dabigatran Etexilate Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid in Patients With Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) trial, an international clinical trial evaluating dabigatran versus aspirin for patients with ESUS. During a median follow-up of 19 months, 384 of 5390 participants had recurrent stroke (annual rate, 4.5%). Multivariable models revealed that stroke or transient ischemic attack before the index event (hazard ratio [HR], 2.27 [95% CI, 1.83– 2.82]), creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.23– 2.32]), male sex (HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.27– 2.02]), and CHA2 DS2-VASc ≥4 (HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.15– 2.08] and HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.21– 2.26] for scores of 4 and ≥5, respectively) versus CHA2 DS2-VASc of 2 to 3, were independent predictors for recurrent stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In RE-SPECT ESUS trial, expected risk factors previously linked to other common stroke causes were associated with stroke recurrence. These data help define high-risk groups for subsequent stroke that may be useful for clinicians and for researchers designing trials among patients with ESUS.

Impact of reconstruction parameters on lesion detection and localization in joint ictal/inter-ictal SPECT reconstruction,"Onwanna J., Chantadisai M., Tepmongkol S., Fahey F., Ouyang J., Rakvongthai Y.",2022-01-01,"Unknown, Epilepsy imaging, Image reconstruction, Lesion detection, Lesion localization, SPECT","Purpose: Previously, a joint ictal/inter-ictal SPECT reconstruction was proposed to reconstruct a differential image representing the change of brain SPECT image from an inter-ictal to an ictal study. The so-called joint method yielded better performance for epileptic foci localization than the conventional subtraction method. In this study, we evaluated the performance of different reconstruction settings of the joint reconstruction of ictal/inter-ictal SPECT data, which creates a differential image showing the difference between ictal and inter-ictal images, in lesion detection and localization in epilepsy imaging. Methods: Differential images reconstructed from phantom data using the joint and the subtraction methods were compared based on lesion detection performance (channelized Hotelling observer signal-to-noise ratio (SNRCHO) averaged across four lesion-to-background contrast levels) at the optimal iteration. The joint-initial method which was the joint method that was initialized by the subtraction method at optimal iteration was also used to reconstruct differential images. These three methods with respective optimal iteration and the subtraction method with four iterations were applied to epileptic patient datasets. A human observer lesion localization study was performed based on localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) analysis. Results: From the phantom study, at their respective optimal iteration, the joint method yielded an improvement in lesion detection performance over the subtraction method of 26%, which increased to 145% when using the joint-initial method. From the patient study, the joint-initial method yielded the highest area under the LROC curve as compared with those of the joint and the subtraction methods with optimal iteration and with 4 iterations (0.44 vs 0.41, 0.39 and 0.36, respectively). Conclusions: In lesion detection and localization, the joint method at optimal iteration outperformed the subtraction method at optimal iteration and at iteration typically used in clinical practice. Furthermore, initialization by the subtraction method improved the performance of the joint method.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is an ω-6 fatty acid of emerging interest with potential roles as an adjuvant anti-inflammatory agent that could be used with ω-3 PUFAs in the treatment of ADHD and associated symptoms. A narrative review was undertaken to examine the potential role(s) of the ω-6 fatty acid GLA. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus were searched to examine the potential role(s) of the ω-6 fatty acid GLA as (1) an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, (2) a synergistic nutrient when combined with ω-3 PUFAs, and (3) a potential etiological factor in ADHD and its treatment. The results show that GLA exerts anti-inflammatory effects by increasing dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid in immune cells. ω-3 PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, are often co-administered with GLA because these ω-3 PUFAs may prevent the accumulation of serum arachidonic acid in response to GLA administration without limiting the storage of DGLA in immune cells. The administration of ω-3 PUFAs alone might not be sufficient to effectively treat patients with ADHD and developmental disorders. Overall studies point towards a combination of EPA and DHA with GLA in a 9:3:1 ratio appearing to be associated with ADHD symptom improvement. A combination of PUFAs may lead to better outcomes.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze the status of the TRYCAT pathway, including the levels of TRP and kynurenine (KYN) and the activity of IDO, as measured by the ratio of KYN/TRP. Methods: This systematic review searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Sciences and included 14 articles that compared TRP and tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) in COVID-19 patients versus non-COVID-19 controls, as well as severe/critical versus mild/moderate COVID-19. The analysis was done on a total of 1269 people, including 794 COVID-19 patients and 475 controls. Results: The results show a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in the KYN/TRP ratio (standardized mean difference, SMD = 1.099, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.714; 1.484) and KYN (SMD = 1.123, 95% CI: 0.730; 1.516) and significantly lower TRP (SMD = − 1.002, 95%CI: − 1.738; − 0.266) in COVID-19 versus controls.

These E. coli isolates originated from two pigs (TH2 and TH3) and two humans (TH8 and TH9) from Thailand, and three pigs from Lao PDR (LA1, LA2 and LA3). Four E. coli sequence types/serotypes – ST6833/H20 (TH2 and TH3), ST48/O160:H40 (TH8 and TH9), ST5708/H45 (LA1) and ST10562/O148:H30 (LA2 and LA3) – were identified. The plasmid replicon type IncF was identified in all isolates. The point mutations Ser31Thr in PmrA and His2Arg in PmrB were found concurrently in all isolates (colistin MIC=4–8 µg ml−1). LA1 contained up to five point mutations in PmrB, and the colistin MIC was not significantly different from that for the other isolates. All mcr-1.1 was located in the ISApl1-mcr-1-pap2 element, while all mcr-3.1 was located in the TnAs2-mcr-3.1-dgkA-ISKpn40 element.

Materials and Methods: A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients suffering from MTrPs in the UTM. Thirty patients were treated with repeated injection of 2 mL of 1% lidocaine (three injections; one injection per week). Another 30 patients were treated with rESWT (three treatment sessions; one treatment session per week; 2000 radial extracorporeal shock waves per treatment session; positive energy flux density = 0.10 mJ/mm2). The primary outcome measure was pain severity using the VAS score. The secondary outcome measures included muscle elasticity index, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index. Evaluation was performed at baseline (T1), 15–30 min after the first treatment in order to register immediate treatment effects (T2), before the second treatment (i.e., one week after baseline) (T3) and one week after the third treatment (i.e., four weeks after baseline) (T4). Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the patients in the lidocaine arm and the patients in the rESWT arm at T1 and T4. Within the arms, the mean differences of all outcomes were statistically significant (p < 0.001) when comparing the data obtained at T1 with the data obtained at T3 and the data obtained at T4. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that the use of rESWT in patients with MTrPs in the UTM is safe and leads to reduced pain and improved muscle elasticity, pressure pain threshold and neck disability index, without adverse effects. Larger trials are necessary to verify this. Clinicians should consider rESWT instead of injections of lidocaine in the treatment of MTrPs in the UTM.",medical,Medicine (all)

Methods: In 173 subjects imaged with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, divided into development (121) and test (52) sets, we trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network to both classify sites of elevated tracer uptake as nonsuspicious or suspicious for cancer and assign them an anatomical location. We evaluated training strategies to leverage information from a larger dataset of 18F-FDG PET/CT images and expert annotations, including transfer learning and combined training encoding the tracer type as input to the network. We assessed the agreement between the N and M stage assigned based on the network annotations and expert annotations, according to the PROMISE miTNM framework. Results: In the development set, including 18F-FDG training data improved classification performance in four-fold cross validation. In the test set, compared to expert assessment, training with 18F-FDG data and the development set yielded 80.4% average precision [confidence interval (CI): 71.1–87.8] for identification of suspicious uptake sites, 77% (CI: 70.0–83.4) accuracy for anatomical location classification of suspicious findings, 81% agreement for identification of regional lymph node involvement, and 77% agreement for identification of metastatic stage. Conclusion: The evaluated algorithm showed good agreement with expert assessment for identification and anatomical location classification of suspicious uptake sites in whole-body 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. With restricted PSMA-ligand data available, the use of training examples from a different radiotracer improved performance. The investigated methods are promising for enabling efficient assessment of cancer stage and tumor burden.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
Production of bio-paraffin from solvent-free deoxygenation of palm biodiesel over ZrO2-supported nickel phosphide catalysts,"Prasongthum N., Suemanotham A., Sisuthog W., Thanmongkhon Y., Reubroycharoen P., Attanatho L.",2022-11-25,"Catalytic performance, Deoxygenations, Hydrodeoxygenation, Molar ratio, N-paraffin, n-Paraffins, Ni/P ratio, Palm biodiesels, Solvent free, ]+ catalyst, Hydrodeoxygenation, N-paraffins, Ni/P ratio, Nickel phosphide, Palm biodiesel","This study investigated the effects of Ni/P molar ratio on nickel phosphide species and on the catalytic activity on solvent-free deoxygenation of palm biodiesel to produce n-paraffins. ZrO2-supported nickel phosphide catalysts with different Ni/P molar ratio were synthesized and characterized through HRTEM, XPS, XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, and H2-TPR analysis techniques, to give an insight into the correlation of the catalyst structure and its performance. The formation of different types of nickel phosphide phases when preparing the catalyst with different Ni/P molar ratio was observed. Only Ni2P was formed with Ni/P molar ratio of 1, while Ni2P and Ni12P5 were detected when Ni/P molar ratio was 2. With further increasing Ni/P molar ratios to 3 and 4, new phases of Ni0 and Ni3P were formed in addition to those of Ni2P and Ni12P5. NixP/ZrO2 exhibited excellent catalytic performance for deoxygenation of palm biodiesel mainly via decarbonylation/decarboxylation pathways, achieving the high FAME conversion of 50.2–88.0% and n-alkane selectivity of 65.0–95.4%. Conversion and alkane selectivity of the catalysts followed the sequence: Ni3P/ZrO2 ≈ Ni4P/ZrO2 > Ni2P/ZrO2 > Ni1P/ZrO2 > Ni/ZrO2, respectively. These results suggested that Ni/P molar ratio had significantly affected on catalytic performance, which was associated with the type of nickel phosphide phase, metal dispersion, metal particle size, as well as electron density on Ni site.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In a supercell method, the Ni dopant is substituted on the Mg site in the supercell due to the equal oxidation numbers. It is found that Ni dopant reduces the volume cell size and band gap of the host-hydride supercells. The Ni-doped system exhibits a better absorption for a high coefficient in the visible light region. To determine the ability of the hydrogen removal from the LiMgH3 and Li2MgH4 systems, the Ni-doped systems present the lower H-vacancy formation energy, indicating an easier release of hydrogen from the host Li–Mg hydrides.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Materials Chemistry"

This study aimed to identify a halophilic bacterium for histamine degradation in fish sauce, and understand its genomic insight to enhance histamine degradation activity. We discovered the novel halophilic bacterium, Bacillus piscicola FBU1786, degrading histamine and other biogenic amines. Its histamine breakdown was growth-associated in a wide range of NaCl concentrations, pH, and temperature from 4% to 18%, 6.0 to 9.0, and 30 to 45 °C, respectively. Genome sequencing revealed the presence of Cu2+-binding oxidase-encoding genes and their heterologous expression with Cu2+ supplementation triggered histamine degradation in E. coli. The degree of histamine breakdown in B. piscicola FBU1786 could be enhanced by Cu2+ addition. Histamine degradation of the culture was evaluated in raw fish sauce mixtures to partially mimic the condition during fish sauce fermentation. Histamine degradation was suppressed to the extent of raw fish sauce, but could be restored by Cu2+ supplementation. Together, this study disclosed B. piscicola FBU1786 with the potent histamine degradation activity, identified Cu2+-binding oxidases responsible for histamine breakdown, and enhanced histamine degradation of the culture using Cu2+ supplementation.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

Algae biomass gains advantages over other biomasses (agriculture, sewage, forest, sludge, municipal waste) due to their availability, biomass generation in wastewater and negative carbon dioxide emission. In this review paper, we have explored the algae biomass cultivation routes, thermochemical conversion and upgradation of algal biomass. Photo bioreactors (tubular, bag, flat panel, etc) are preferred for microalgae cultivation in association with raceway open ponds for liquid hydrocarbons production. Algae biomass are processed through hydrothermal liquefaction (Temperature range of 220–320 °C, time of 60 min, pressure of 5–20 bar), pyrolysis (Temperature range of 320–420 °C) and co-liquefaction. The commonly upgradation techniques are catalytic cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, etc. Hydrodeoxygenation was performed to nullify the oxygen content of bio-oil, since in adverse case the bio-oil with higher content causes corrosion and coke formation in combustion engines. The algae biofuel production cost depends upon the conversion techniques and upgrading processes. Further in future this review provides strong base for exploring the aqueous phase obtained from thermochemical process for bio-hydrogen production via photo-catalytic reforming processes.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, geobase; related topics, engineering, energy, environmental","Building and Construction, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Methods: One hundred and twenty-three women with breast cancer participated in this study. The fall incidence density, taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) symptoms, and physical performance tests were evaluated at five time points throughout chemotherapy treatment. A fall diary was used to record fall incidence during treatment. The fall incidence density was calculated by dividing the number of first fall occurrences by person-time at risk. The risk factors associated with time to first fall were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The Kaplan-Meier curve illustrated the probability of survival from a fall during chemotherapy treatment. Results: Over the course of treatment, 29 (23.58%) participants reported falls. The fall incidence density was 3 per 1000 person-day.

OP insecticides have short biological half-lives with measurement in a single urine sample typically only reflecting recent exposure within the last few days. Because of the field staff and participant burden of longitudinal sample collection and the high cost of multiple measurements, typically only one or two urine samples have been used to evaluate OP insecticide exposure during pregnancy, which is unlikely to capture an accurate picture of prenatal exposure. Methods: We recruited pregnant farmworker women in Chom Thong and Fang, two districts of Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand (N = 330) into the Study of Asian Women and their Offspring's Development and Environmental Exposures (SAWASDEE) from 2017 to 2019. We collected up to 6 serial urine samples per participant during gestation and composited the samples to represent early, mid, and late pregnancy. We measured concentrations of urinary DAP metabolites in the composited urine samples and evaluated the within- and between-participant variability of these levels. We also investigated predictors of OP insecticide exposure. Results: DAP metabolite concentrations in serial composite samples were weakly to moderately correlated. Spearman correlations indicated that composite urine samples were more highly correlated in Fang participants than in Chom Thong participants. The within-person variances (0.064–0.65) exceeded the between-person variances for DETP, DEP, ∑DEAP, DMP, DMTP, ∑DMAP, ∑DAP. The intraclass correlations (ICCs) for the volume-based individual metabolite levels (ng/mL) ranged from 0.10 to 0.66. For ∑DEAP, ∑DMAP, and ∑DAP the ICCs were, 0.47, 0.17, 0.45 respectively. We observed significant differences between participants from Fang compared to those from Chom Thong both in demographic and exposure characteristics. Spearman correlations of composite samples from Fang participants ranged from 0.55 to 0.66 for the ∑DEAP metabolite concentrations in Fang indicating moderate correlation between pregnancy periods. The ICCs were higher for samples from Fang participants, which drove the overall ICCs. Conclusions: Collecting multiple (∼6) urine samples during pregnancy rather than just 1 or 2 improved our ability to accurately assess exposure during the prenatal period. By compositing the samples, we were able to still obtain trimester-specific information on exposure while keeping the analytic costs and laboratory burden low. This analysis also helped to inform how to best conduct future analyses within the SAWASDEE study. We observed two different exposure profiles in participants in which the concentrations and variability in data were highly linked to the residential location of the participants.","fluidex; related topics, pollution, environmental",Environmental Science (all)

Aim of the study: To assess the anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of the root extracts of all five species of BMY in experimental animal (mouse) models to ensure the rational use of herbal products in Thai traditional medicine. Materials and methods: Root extracts prepared by ethanol and water extraction were used for the biological assays in animal models at five dose levels: 25, 50,100,200 & 400 mg/kg. The anti-nociceptive activity was evaluated based on hot-plate latency, duration of paw licking induced by formalin, and abdominal writhing induced by acetic acid. Carrageenan- and prostaglandin-induced paw oedema models were used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity. Results: The oral administration of AM, DS and WT root extracts displayed significant analgesic effects in the hot-plate test, both phases (early and late) of formalin test and acetic-acid induced writhing test at different dose levels. OI and DL only produced significant analgesia in the late phase of the formalin test and writhing test.

Rotarod test results showed no effects of five herbal plant root extracts on the balance and the motor coordination at the highest dose level evaluated (400 mg/kg). Conclusion: The root extracts of AM, DS, and WT possess both central and peripheral anti-nociceptive properties, while OI and DL possess only peripheral analgesic properties. All five root extracts own anti-inflammatory properties, which might be due to their activity on the prostaglandin system.

Since various biological data are publicly available, DTIs have been identified computationally. To predict DTIs, most existing methods focus on a single similarity measure of drugs and target proteins, whereas some recent methods integrate a particular set of drug and target similarity measures by a single integration function. Therefore, many DTIs are still missing. In this study, we propose heterogeneous network propagation with the forward similarity integration (FSI) algorithm, which systematically selects the optimal integration of multiple similarity measures of drugs and target proteins. Seven drug-drug and nine target-target similarity measures are applied with four distinct integration methods to finally create an optimal heterogeneous network model. Consequently, the optimal model uses the target similarity based on protein sequences and the fused drug similarity, which combines the similarity measures based on chemical structures, the Jaccard scores of drug-disease associations, and the cosine scores of drug-drug interactions. With an accuracy of 99.8%, this model significantly outperforms others that utilize different similarity measures of drugs and target proteins. In addition, the validation of the DTI predictions of this model demonstrates the ability of our method to discover missing potential DTIs.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)

To retard the degradation due to a direct supply of CH4, the Ni/YSZ has been modified with the incorporation of Co into the Ni matrix, forming a substitutional solid-solution alloy. As a result, the porous anode exhibits well-connected compositional grains owing to the Co3O4 precursor as a sintering aid. The 25 mol% Co incorporation producing the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ anode significantly improves the cell performance and prolonged stability. In addition, the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ anode provides the apparent activation energy of the charge transfer reaction to a lower value in the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 at the triple-phase boundary. However, the apparent activation energy decrease is not identified for H2. The Co alloying effect on catalyzing the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 is caused by suppressing the carbon deposition originating from the thermal dissociation of adsorbed CH4 on the Ni1-xCox alloy surface.","corrosion, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"
Haematological profile of malaria patients with G6PD and PKLR variants (erythrocytic enzymopathies): a cross-sectional study in Thailand,"Mungkalasut P., Kiatamornrak P., Jugnam-Ang W., Krudsood S., Cheepsunthorn P., Cheepsunthorn C.L.",2022-12-01,"Antimalarials, Cross-Sectional Studies, Erythrocytes, Female, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Hemoglobinopathies, Humans, Malaria, Malaria, Vivax, Male, Primaquine, Thailand, Erythrocyte enzymopathy, G6PD deficiency, G6PD Mahidol, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Pyruvate kinase, Southeast Asian, Thailand","Background: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PKLR) deficiencies are common causes of erythrocyte haemolysis in the presence of antimalarial drugs such as primaquine and tafenoquine. The present study aimed to elucidate such an association by thoroughly investigating the haematological indices in malaria patients with G6PD and PKLRR41Q variants. Methods: Blood samples from 255 malaria patients from Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia were collected to determine haematological profile, G6PD enzyme activity and G6PD deficiency variants. The multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between anaemia and G6PD MahidolG487A, the most common mutation in this study. Results: The prevalence of G6PD deficiency was 11.1% (27/244) in males and 9.1% (1/11) in female. The MAFs of the G6PD MahidolG487A and PKLRR41Q variants were 7.1% and 2.6%, respectively. Compared with patients with wildtype G6PD after controlling for haemoglobinopathies, G6PD-deficient patients with hemizygous and homozygous G6PD MahidolG487A exhibited anaemia with low levels of haemoglobin (11.16 ± 2.65 g/dl, p = 0.041). These patients also exhibited high levels of reticulocytes (3.60%). The median value of G6PD activity before treatment (Day 0) was significantly lower than that of after treatment (Day 28) (5.51 ± 2.54 U/g Hb vs. 6.68 ± 2.45 U/g Hb; p < 0.001). Reticulocyte levels on Day 28 were significantly increased compared to that of on Day 0 (2.14 ± 0.92% vs 1.57 ± 1.06%; p < 0.001). PKLRR41Q had no correlation with anaemia in malaria patients. The risk of anaemia inpatients with G6PDMahidolG487A was higher than wildtype patients (OR = 3.48, CI% 1.24–9.75, p = 0.018). Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that G6PDMahidolG487A independently associated with anaemia (< 11 g/dl) after adjusted by age, gender, Plasmodium species, parasite density, PKLRR41Q, and haemoglobinopathies (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study revealed that malaria patients with G6PD MahidolG487A, but not with PKLRR41Q, had anaemia during infection. As a compensatory response to haemolytic anaemia after malaria infection, these patients generated more reticulocytes. The findings emphasize the effect of host genetic background on haemolytic anaemia and the importance of screening patients for erythrocyte enzymopathies and related mutations prior to anti-malarial therapy.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Then, the porous BC was dyed with a nitrogen containing carbonyl dye (C.I. Vat Olive B) followed by phosphorus doping and employed as a precursor for preparation of carbon nanofilament. The P/N doped BC mat precursor was stabilized at 330 °C for 2 h and carbonized at 800 °C for 2 h. SEM images confirmed that BC based carbon exhibited the entangled filament structure. To follow the conversion of BC mat to carbon nanofilament, FTIR analysis and Raman spectroscopy were carried out. FTIR spectra of stabilized mats showed that the cellulose carbon-carbon double band centered at 1600 cm−1 appeared strongly. In contrast, the intensity of this band markedly decreased at carbonization stage, resulting from the conversion of cellulose carbon-carbon double bond into carbon aromatic ring which exhibited weak intensity. The graphitic structure was confirmed by the presence of sp3 disorder hybridization and sp2 hybridization (D and G bands, respectively) shown in Raman spectra). In addition, XRD diffractograms further confirmed the existence of amorphous carbon peak found at 26°, indicating that the P/N dopants played a role in inducing the graphitic structure as well as improving carbon yield. Finally, the electrochemical performance as a carbon electrode were revealed.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"
ARERec: Attentive Local Interaction Model for Sequential Recommendation,"Padungkiatwattana U., Sae-Diae T., Maneeroj S., Takasu A.",2022-01-01,"Attention mechanisms, Embeddings, Interaction modeling, License, Local interactions, Predictive models, Region embedding, Representation learning, Sequential recommendation, User behaviors, attention mechanism, Region embedding, representation learning, sequential recommendation","Previous sequential-recommendation methods have been able to capture patterns of item characteristics that interact with the user. However, they modeled user behavior using a whole interaction sequence, despite possible changes in a user's behavior over time, which can make some behaviors no longer relevant by the end of the user-item interaction period. That is, each item representation was derived from the influences of all items in the whole sequence (i.e. global representation) without considering item-adjacency factors that can affect the item characteristics during the interaction period (i.e. local representation). Furthermore, these methods modeled only user behavior, ignoring item behavior, which can involve patterns of user characteristics for users who interact with the item. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel attentive local-interaction model for sequential recommendation called ARERec, which applies a region-embedding technique to both user and item historical sequences. The aim is to model user and item behavior over the user-item interaction sequence while considering local representations that contain specific characteristics of both user and item in the sequence. In this way, information is derived for corresponding periods that reflect more-specific reasons behind the interaction in the sequence. Moreover, to account for ratings and neighbor-related factors, we adopt the concept of neighbor-based collaborative filtering in our predictions. One issue is that neighbors have the same similarity levels for all users, resulting in similar predictions, even though there may be different user-specific information. To address this problem, we apply a multi-head attention mechanism to personalize each neighbor based on the user's characteristics. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ARERec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential methods, including Recurrent Neural Networks and the attention-based methods (both unidirectional and bidirectional) HitRate and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. Our experiments also show that ARERec provides superior results by considering interaction periods with local representation rather than the whole sequence using global representation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Ultrastructurally, aggregations of electron-dense viral-like particles were found where the inclusion-like bodies were located. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against FeMV matrix protein labeled these inclusion-like bodies, and also labeled the cytoplasm of tracheal and bronchiolar epithelial cells, and lymphocytes and macrophages in spleen and mesenteric lymph node. Using double IHC, FeMV antigen was detected in astroglia and oligodendroglia but not in microglia. Phylogenetic characterization of the fusion and hemagglutinin gene sequences revealed FeMV-1A genotypes in both cats. These findings indicated an active viral infection with FeMV.

Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) solution with concentrations of 0–0.6 wt% was used to speed up the hydrate formation and improve the CO2 separation performance. A comprehensive shrinking-core model was established to reveal the roles of CO2 and N2 molecules diffusion and reaction in hydrate formation, and to investigate the effects of DTAC on kinetics. The experimental results show that the induction time is much shorter in larger pores of SGs, and is reduced remarkably with the addition of DTAC. The CO2 gas uptakes increase remarkably in the initial 200–270 min but change little later. The final CO2 concentration in gas phase decreased from 70 mol% to 32.6 mol% in the presence of DTAC, showing the CO2 separation factor raised by 36.6%–77.5%. However, N2 is also involved in the hydrate phase. The simulation results show that the combined reaction rate constants of both CO2 and N2 increase with the addition of DTAC. The lower combined rate constant in smaller pores indicates that the diffusion rate constant changes with pore size more strongly than the “reaction” rate constant. The dramatic decreasing trend of the effective diffusion coefficient reflects the higher porosity of the hydrate shell with more DTAC added.","petroleum engineeringneering, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Leptospirosis subunit vaccines have been under development and require further improvement to provide complete protection. Adjuvants can be used to enhance the amplitude, quality, and durability of immune responses. Previously, we demonstrated that LMQ adjuvant (neutral liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Quillaja saponaria derived QS21 saponin) promoted protective efficacy of LigAc vaccine against Leptospira challenge. To promote immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the subunit vaccines, three alternative adjuvants based on neutral liposomes or squalene-in-water emulsion were evaluated in this study. LQ and LQuil adjuvants combined the neutral liposomes with the QS21 saponin or Quillaja saponaria derived QuilA® saponin, respectively. SQuil adjuvant combined a squalene-in-water emulsion with the QuilA® saponin. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of LigAc (20 µg) formulated with the candidate adjuvants were conducted in golden Syrian hamsters. Hamsters were vaccinated three times at a 2-week interval, followed by a homologous challenge of L. interrogans serovar Pomona. The results showed that LigAc combined with LQ, LQuil, or SQuil adjuvants conferred substantial antibody responses and protective efficacy (survival rate, pathological change, and Leptospira renal colonization) comparable to LMQ adjuvant. The LigAc+LQ formulation conferred 62.5% survival but was not significantly different from LigAc+LMQ, LigAc+LQuil, and LigAc+SQuil formulations (50% survival). This study highlights the potential of saponin-containing adjuvants LMQ, LQ, LQuil, and SQuil for both human and animal leptospirosis vaccines.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Penaeus monodon miR-750 (pmo-miR-750) was found to be strongly up-regulated in the late phase of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection, but its function remains uncharacterized. Herein, the targets that were translationally down-regulated in the shrimp stomach following a pmo-miR-750 mimic injection were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (Scp) and actin1 (Act1) were revealed to be down-regulated protein spots. The genuine binding of pmo-miR-750 mimic to Scp but not Act1 mRNA was validated in vitro. In addition, a negative correlation between the Scp transcript and pmo-miR-750 expression level in WSSV-infected P. monodon stomach implies that pmo-miR-750 regulates Scp expression in vivo. When injected into WSSV-infected shrimp, the pmo-miR-750 mimic suppressed Scp expression but significantly increased the WSSV copy number. Consistent with the miRNA mimic-mediated Scp suppression, the loss of function assay of Scp in WSSV-challenged shrimp by RNA interference revealed a decreased survival rate with a dramatic increase in viral copy number. Besides that, apoptosis was activated in the hemocytes of the Scp knockdown shrimp upon WSSV infection. Collectively, our findings reveal that up-regulated pmo-miR-750 suppresses Scp expression at both the transcript and protein levels in the late stage of WSSV infection, which contributes to modulating apoptosis and eventually enabling viral propagation.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

In the crystal, the complex species are self-assembled into a one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular chain through classical O−H⋅⋅⋅O hydrogen bonds existing between water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms. The adjacent chains are further joined together by C−H⋅⋅⋅π hydrogen bonds involving the thiophene moieties, resulting in the formation of a 3D supramolecular framework. The frameworks feature 1D channels with a dimeter of ca. 1.5 nm that can accommodate Htpa molecules to allow the formation of cocrystals via strong hydrogen bonds.

In this study, visible light responsive novel graphene aerogel/bismuth oxyiodide (GA/BiOI) composite was synthesized via low-temperature solvothermal method. The synthesized GA/BiOI composite was tested for methyl orange (MO) azo-dye degradation under visible light. The graphene aerogel nanosheets were wrapped onto the surface of the each individual BiOI microsphere, which encourages the interconnection charge transfer process. The light absorption properties of GA/BiOI composite were increased with the addition of graphene aerogel. The optimal 5%-GA/BiOI composite displayed higher MO removal efficiency, which is ∼2 fold more than the bare BiOI photocatalyst. This enhanced photocatalytic activity was on account of lower recombination rate of charge carriers, improved light absorption, and the high surface area. In addition, the 5%-GA/BiOI composite showed good stability until 3 cycles without deactivation. The plausible MO degradation mechanism was also proposed over GA/BiOI under visible light. This work provides a new perspective on the design and synthesis of graphene aerogel-based composite for environmental applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The proteins in neem oil cake with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties have been made into films and studied for their properties and potential applications. Neem oil cakes are available in large quantities at low cost but are non-edible and have limited applications. Currently, most of the neem oil cakes are used as fertilizers. Neem oil cakes contain about 25–30% proteins and 30–40% carbohydrates, which are valuable. Proteins in the neem oil cake could be suitable for food, medical, biotechnology, and other applications. However, there are no reports on the properties or applications of proteins in neem meal. In this study, a simple alkaline process was used to extract proteins from the oil meal and the proteins obtained were converted into films. The films were crosslinked with citric acid (CA) to improve mechanical properties and stability in aqueous conditions.

The water vapor permeability (WVP), thermal behavior, dynamic mechanical properties, crystal structure, and biodegradability of the PLA/SS-g-PLA-blended films were characterized and compared with a commercial PLA film. The results clearly indicated that the incorporation of SS-g-PLA copolymer in the PLA matrix had a significant effect on the properties of PLA/SS-g-PLA-blended films. The WVP values of PLA/SS-g-PLA-blended films were lower than that of commercial PLA film by about 2–3 g·mm/m2·day·atm, and their thermal behaviors (e.g. Tg, Tcc, and Tm) were also decreased. Adding SS-g-PLA can increase the crystallinity of PLA. The degree of crystallinity (%χc) of the series of PLA/SS-g-PLA-blended films was increased to about 2–4 times that of the commercial PLA film (3%). Interestingly, biodegradation results revealed that the percent of biodegradability of PLA/SS-g-PLA-blended film was 80% in 43 days under a compost environmental temperature of 58 ± 2°C.

We have found that the nanocomposites change from colorless to blue upon exposure to UVA light. The intensity of blue color systematically increases with the UVA dose. The sensitivity to UVA light can be enhanced by increasing the ZnO ratios within the nanocomposites. Various types of UVA colorimetric sensors can be fabricated by incorporating the nanocomposites into a filter paper, hydrogel, and coconut oil. Interestingly, coconut oil-based sensors exhibit a color transition from colorless to blue with increasing UVA dose in sunlight from 0 to 50 J/cm2. This property allows their utilization for colorimetric detection of minimal erythema dose of UVA light, 33.27 J/cm2, for all skin types of normal people. The preparation of the nanocomposites is simple and cheap, suitable for large-scale production. The nanocomposites can be further developed for colorimetric detection of UVA radiation from sunbeds tanning, phototesting, and UV curing applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Spectrum sensing empowers the CR to adjust to its surroundings by locating free spectrum. Although spectrum sensing using a support vector machine (SVM) is already found in literature, an SVM combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and varying the kernel scale is yet to be investigated. In this paper, we perform spectrum sensing using an SVM and evaluate the performances of various kernel functions used in the SVM as well as how the performances of the learning algorithm change as we apply PCA and vary the kernel scales. We then compare the training time of the SVM kernels. Finally, we calculate the contributions of power, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the received signal towards the decision-making process of the learning algorithm.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Significant advances in CO2RR have been achieved on various metal electrocatalysts to produce a variety of products in gas, liquid, or even solid forms. The frequently used metals such as Ag, Au, Bi, Cu, Sn, and Zn may contain oxide species that were either intentionally or unintentionally formed during the syntheses. For the oxide-derived catalysts, the oxides are pre-catalyst active forms, which are reduced under the CO2RR environment and thus affected the physical/chemical properties of the final catalysts. On the other hand, oxide species (MOx, M+, or O2/O-) can directly enhance CO2activation, C-C coupling, dimerization, and/or modify the surface electronic states of the active species for CO2RR. In this review, we provide the latest progress towards understanding the roles of oxide-containing electrocatalysts in CO2RR. The nature of oxides on various groups of metal electrocatalysts as categorized by their major products [e.g., CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, C2H5OH, C2H4, and C (solid)] and their roles in the direct and in-direct effects for improving the CO2RR performances has been emphasized.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Autochthonous yeast isolates, Saccharomycodes ludwigii and Hanseniaspora uvarum, were selected due to their generated products of alcohol and 2-phenylethyl acetate, respectively. The fermentation kinetic parameters of selected autochthonous yeasts as single and co-cultures in chaptalized pineapple juice were investigated comparing to commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ethanol production rate of S'codes ludwigii (0.104%(v/v)/h) during the initial stage of fermentation was relatively slower compared to those of S. cerevisiae (0.129%(v/v)/h) but increased during middle through final stages with similar ethanol content to the commercial S. cerevisiae (~12%(v/v)). In pineapple juice, fructose was firstly assimilated, S'codes ludwigii (K = 0.405) and S. cerevisiae (K = 0.552), while glucose was secondly used, S'codes ludwigii (K = 0.281) and S. cerevisiae (K = 0.217) for first-order kinetic model. In co-cultures, the two isolated strains displayed synergistic behaviours during fermentation. S'codes ludwigii supported the growth of H. uvarum so that it generated more desirable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at an early stage. Interestingly, the VOCs could not be produced in co-cultures of H. uvarum with the commercial strains. Then, S'codes ludwigii further completed the alcoholic fermentation through final stage. The fermentation performances of co-cultured autochthonous yeasts demonstrated a new approach for successful pineapple winemaking over S. cerevisiae. In addition, growth kinetics and fermentation behaviour, as observed in this study, could be a key information in development of potential substrates and strains for future alcoholic fermentation.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

However, regarding the construction and transportation processes, the most common challenge of modular prefabrication construction is the weight of the modular unit, which leads to additional lifting and transportation costs. Increased costs discourage the use of this modern technique compared with conventional construction. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the satisfaction rates of different lightweight composites through a survey, to develop structural lightweight concrete composites by reducing their weight while maintaining their strength performance, and to implement the concrete mixture in a prefabrication plant. The results indicated that kaolin (KL) concrete and expanded polystyrene foam-steel concrete composites have similar satisfaction rates reported by users. For large-scale implementation, a concrete mixture with a KL replacement level of 100 % coarse aggregate and 50 % fine aggregate resulted in a weight reduction of 26 %, whereas its 28-d compressive strength was 33.5 MPa and its water penetration depth was 2 cm. A structural lightweight concrete composite for a modular prefabricated floor unit was adopted in this study to broaden the adoption of modular prefabrication construction.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Civil and Structural Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Thus, the objectives of this study were to describe the types of diabetes, the clinical characteristics, the treatment regimens and achievement of glycemic control in Thai patients with young-onset diabetes. Materials and Methods: Data of 2,844 patients with diabetes onset before 30 years-of-age were retrospectively reviewed from a diabetes registry comprising 31 hospitals in Thailand. Gestational diabetes was excluded. Results: Based on clinical criteria, type 1 diabetes was identified in 62.6% of patients, type 2 diabetes in 30.7%, neonatal diabetes in 0.8%, other monogenic diabetes in 1.7%, secondary diabetes in 3.0%, genetic syndromes associated with diabetes in 0.9% and other types of diabetes in 0.4%. Type 1 diabetes accounted for 72.3% of patients with age of onset <20 years. The proportion of type 2 diabetes was 61.0% of patients with age of onset from 20 to <30 years. Intensive insulin treatment was prescribed to 55.2% of type 1 diabetes patients. Oral antidiabetic agent alone was used in 50.8% of type 2 diabetes patients, whereas 44.1% received insulin treatment. Most monogenic diabetes, secondary diabetes and genetic syndromes associated with diabetes required insulin treatment. Achievement of glycemic control was identified in 12.4% of type 1 diabetes patients, 30% of type 2 diabetes patients, 36.4% of neonatal diabetes patients, 28.3% of other monogenic diabetes patients, 45.6% of secondary diabetes patients and 28% of genetic syndromes associated with diabetes patients.

Such invariance confirms that zero strain measures are always generated by rigid transformations, i.e., rigid translations and rotations. The violation of this property can degrade the performance of the formulations in predicting structural responses. In the setting of linear analysis, the invariance of planar beam formulations has already been studied, but a similar investigation for spatial beam formulations is not yet carried out. Most of the spatial beam formulations are developed in the local coordinate frame, and components of unknown kinematics in this frame are discretized by using rational B-spline basis functions. Unfortunately, those formulations are found to be non-invariant under such a discretization scheme, and the degradation in their performance is demonstrated. On the other hand, the local coordinate frame is widely defined by the so-called natural Frenet–Serret frame. The sole utilization of this frame does not allow the consideration of beams having twisting configuration. In this study, these shortcomings are resolved.","Mathematicsematics, fluidex; related topics, engineering, physics, computer science","Computational Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Physics and Astronomy (all), Computer Science Applications"

Surface modification of a PCL scaffold to improve hydrophilicity was performed via layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and evaluated using aniline blue staining and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Aniline blue staining was performed to determine the extent of PDADMAC/PSS deposition on the PCL dual-leached scaffold through the inner pores. Peaks attributed to the N 1s orbitals of PDADMAC and the S 2p orbitals of PSS appeared in the XPS spectra of the PCL scaffold. By using LbL deposition, osteopontin (OPN) was immobilized on the top surface. In vitro biological evaluation of the cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineralization were performed. The results showed that the OPN-immobilized PCL scaffold was nontoxic and did not promote cell proliferation, but it highly enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells including ALP activity and mineral deposition compared to the control. This study revealed that LbL deposition on a PCL scaffold surface is sufficient to enable the local delivery of OPN to improve cell interactions with scaffolds.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

When it comes to PV power; however, there are still challenges in market operations. Moreover, the role of a distribution system operator (DSO) in the LETM has not yet been investigated for the centralization of operations to reserve power for PV power uncertainty. Consequently, this paper aims to investigate the effects of PV power uncertainty on the settlement process by proposing centralized optimal operations of the LETM. Furthermore, the DSO is tasked with determining a distribution locational marginal price at each bus in the distribution system, besides analyzing the bus voltage and line current limits. When power is exchanged, the DSO must reserve power to account for the uncertainty of PV power to recover the power balance. The proposed method is formulated as an optimization problem, to maximize the difference between buyers' and sellers' total operating costs, because this maximum value could reflect the maximum benefit obtained by each market participant. Additionally, the proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated on a typical low-voltage distribution system in Thailand. The simulation results show that the total benefit of market participants with PV power uncertainty is reduced, whereas that of the DSO is increased. This implies that prosumers will miss out on a lucrative opportunity if they do not improve their forecasting system.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In addition, for the past decade more and more organizations have been adopting iterative and incremental software development approaches to handle rapid requirement changes in software requirements and to accelerate their products to the market. These factors have pushed tons of pressure on software testing, especially in the regression testing step. Regression testing is a pivotal step to ensure that code alterations do not impact the existing functionalities of the software. As software grows larger, regression testing could become impractical, if done manually, since human resource consumption would exponentially increase. To alleviate this issue, many organizations have embraced automation testing in their regression testing steps. Keyword-driven testing is one of the automation testing techniques that has been frequently used on Android projects. However, constructing a test case for automation testing (also known as a test script) is an arduous task which tends to easily cause errors [1]. Therefore, in this research a tool to generate Robot Framework test scripts for Android applications written in Kotlin is proposed. With this tool, an Android project's source code is analyzed for its flow. Next, test cases are generated using AppiumLibrary keywords and the source code. Test data sets embedded in the test cases are generated using Boundary Value Testing and randomization techniques.

Marigold had the highest translocation factor, with carbaryl taken up, translocated and accumulated in the shoots, where it was biotransformed into 1-naphthol. Consequently, marigold had the least observable toxicity symptoms caused by carbaryl and the highest bioconcentration factor (1848), indicating its hyperaccumulating capability. Sunflower responded to carbaryl exposure differently, with the highest carbaryl accumulation (8.7 mg kg−1) in roots within 4 days of cultivation, leading to a partial toxicity effect.

Results showed that 24MD was concomitant with autophagy induction, indicating by autophagosome staining and the induction of ATG5, ATG7 and ubiquitinated protein, p62 expression after 12-h treatment. LC3-I was strongly conversed to LC3-II, and p62 was downregulated after 24-h treatment. The apoptosis-inducing activity was found after 48-h treatment as indicated by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and the activation of caspase-3. From a mechanistic perspective, 24-h treatment of 24MD at 60 μM substantially downregulated p-mTOR. Meanwhile, p-PI3K and p-Akt were also suppressed by 24MD at concentrations of 80 and 100 μM, respectively. We further confirmed m-TOR-mediated autophagic activity by comparing the effect of 24MD with rapamycin, a potent standard mTOR1 inhibitor through Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Although 24MD could not suppress p-mTOR as much as rapamycin, the combination of rapamycin and 24MD could increase the mTOR suppressive activity and LC3 activation. Changing the substituent groups (R groups) from dimethylphenol to ethylphenol in EMD or changing methylazanedyl to cyclohexylazanedyl in 24CD could only induce apoptosis activity but not autophagic inducing activity.

Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of all-cause mortality after PCI. However, there are less data of various degrees of impaired renal function to predict those risks. Methods: This was a subgroup analysis of nationwide PCI registry of 22 045 patients. Patients were classified into six CKD stages according to preprocedure estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (ml/min/1.73 m2): I (≥90), II (60−89), III (30−59), IV (15−29), or V (<15) without or with dialysis. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were compared among patients in each stage. One-year all-cause mortality was reported with risk prediction based on CKD stages and other risk factors. Results: Patients with CKD stage I−V without and with on dialysis were found in 26.9%, 40.8%, 23.2%, 3.9%, 1.5%, and 3.7%, respectively. PCI procedural success and complication rates ranged from 94.0% to 96.2% and 2.8% to 6.1%, respectively.

Although vaccines and therapeutic options are available, some patients experience severe conditions and need critical care support. Hence, identifying key genes or proteins involved in immune-related severe COVID-19 is necessary to find or develop the targeted therapies. This study proposed a novel construction of an immune-related protein interaction network (IPIN) in severe cases with the use of a network diffusion technique on a human interactome network and transcriptomic data. Enrichment analysis revealed that the IPIN was mainly associated with antiviral, innate immune, apoptosis, cell division, and cell cycle regulation signaling pathways. Twenty-three proteins were identified as key proteins to find associated drugs. Finally, poly (I:C), mitomycin C, decitabine, gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, tamoxifen, and curcumin were the potential drugs interacting with the key proteins to heal severe COVID-19. In conclusion, IPIN can be a good representative network for the immune system that integrates the protein interaction network and transcriptomic data.

Pharmacokinetic characteristics of azithromycin in freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) after intramuscular administration at three different dosages,"Sukkheewan R., Poapolathep A., Giorgi M., Klangkaew N., Phaochoosak N., Wongwaipairoj T., Udomkusonsri P., Chaiyabutr N., Poapolathep S.",2022-11-01,"Alligators and Crocodiles, Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Azithromycin, Chromatography, Liquid, Fresh Water, azithromycin, freshwater crocodiles, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, pharmacokinetics","The study evaluated the pharmacokinetic features of azithromycin (AZM) in 15 freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) in Thailand. The crocodiles were administered a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of AZM at three different dosages of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Blood samples were collected at pre-assigned times up to 168 h. The plasma concentrations of AZM were measured using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. The plasma concentration of AZM were quantifiable for up to 168 h after i.m. administration at the three different dosages. A non-compartmental model was used to fit the plasma concentration of AZM versus the time curve for each crocodile. The elimination half-life values of AZM were 33.70, 38.11, and 34.80 h following i.m. injection after dosages of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg b.w., respectively. There were no significant differences among groups. The results indicated that the overall rate of elimination of AZM in freshwater crocodiles was relatively slow. The maximum concentration and area under the curve from zero to the last values of AZM increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The average binding percentage of AZM to plasma protein was 48.66%. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the susceptibility break-point and the surrogate PK-PD index (T > MIC), the intramuscular administration of AZM at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. might be appropriate for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections (MIC < 4 μg/ml) in freshwater crocodiles.","pharmacology, Veterinary Science","Pharmacology, Veterinary (all)"

A relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis treatment response has been reported. No study has reported the effect of narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) therapy, a standard treatment of psoriasis, on gut microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate gut microbiota change during NBUVB therapy. Stool samples from 22 participants, including 13 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and nine healthy controls, were recruited. Faecal microbiota composition was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing before and after NBUVB therapy. Serum 25-OH vitamin D of patients with psoriasis was evaluated simultaneously. The most abundant phyla of gut microbiota in patients with psoriasis were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in all participants. Bilophila, Paraprevotella, Alistipes, Sutterella, Romboutsia, Clostridium sensu stricto and Agathobacter are significantly more enriched in healthy controls. Lactobacillales and Ruminococus torques appeared more enriched after NBUVB treatment in responders but not non-responders. Serum vitamin D levels significantly increased after NBUVB treatment. The present study revealed that gut microbiota altered after NBUVB treatment. The change might be treatment-specific and influence the treatment response.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"
Salt tolerance at vegetative stage is partially associated with changes in grain quality and starch physicochemical properties of rice exposed to salinity stress at reproductive stage,"Sangwongchai W., Krusong K., Thitisaksakul M.",2022-01-15,"Genotype, Oryza, Salinity, Salt Stress, Salt Tolerance, Seeds, Sodium Chloride, Starch, grain quality, physicochemical property, rice (Oryza sativa L.), salinity stress, salinity tolerance, starch","BACKGROUND: Rice yield and grain quality are highly sensitive to soil salinity. Distinct rice genotypes respond to salinity stress differently. To explore the variation in grain yield and grain trait adaptation to moderate, reproductive-stage salinity stress (4 dS/m electrical conductivity), four rice cultivars differing in degrees of vegetative salt tolerance, including Pokkali (salt-tolerant), RD15 (moderately salt-tolerant), KDML105 (moderately salt-susceptible) and IR29 (salt-susceptible), were examined. RESULTS: Grain fertility and 100-grain weight of RD15, KDML105 and IR29, as well as grain morphology of KDML105 and IR29, were significantly disturbed. Interestingly, grain starch accumulation in RD15 and KDML105 was enhanced under stress. However, only RD15 showed changes in starch physicochemical properties, including increased granule diameter, decreased gelatinization peak temperature (Tp) and decreased retrogradation onset temperature (To). Notably, Pokkali maintained productivity, grain quality, and starch properties, while the grain quality of IR29 remained unchanged under salinity stress. Multivariate analysis displayed clear separation of productivity, grain morphology, and starch variables of RD15 in the salt-treated group relative to the control group, suggesting that it was the cultivar most impacted by salt stress despite its moderate salt-tolerance at vegetative stage. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate specific salinity responses among the rice genotypes, and suggest discrepancies between degrees of salt tolerance at vegetative stage versus the ability to maintain both grain quality and starch properties in response to salinity stress imposed at reproductive stage. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Biotechnology, Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"
Stochastic Modeling of Renewable Energy Sources for Capacity Credit Evaluation,"Junlakarn S., Diewvilai R., Audomvongseree K.",2022-07-01,"Capacity credit, Copula functions, Dependable capacity, Intermittency, Power systems planning, Reliability Evaluation, Renewable energies, Renewable energy generation, Stochastic-modeling, System reliability, capacity credit, copula function, dependable capacity, reliability evaluation, renewable energy, stochastic model","In power system planning, the growth of renewable energy generation leads to several challenges including system reliability due to its intermittency and uncertainty. To quantify the relatively reliable capacity of this generation, capacity credit is usually adopted for long-term power system planning. This paper proposes an evaluation of the capacity credit of renewable energy generation using stochastic models for resource availability. Six renewable energy generation types including wind, solar PV, small hydro, biomass, biogas, and waste were considered. The proposed models are based on the stochastic process using the Wiener process and other probability distribution functions to explain the randomness of the intermittency. Moreover, for solar PV—the generation of which depends on two key random variables, namely irradiance and temperature—a copula function is used to model their joint probabilistic behavior. These proposed models are used to simulate power outputs of renewable energy generations and then determine the capacity credit which is defined as the capacity of conventional generation that can maintain a similar level of system reliability. The proposed method is tested with Thailand’s power system and the results show that the capacity credit depends on the time of day and the size of installed capacity of the considered renewable energy generation.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, developing a new MEA to meet desired properties, such as operation under low-humidity conditions without a humidifier, is a time- and cost-consuming process. This study employs a machine-learning-based approach using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and neural networks (NN) in the MEA development process by identifying a suitable catalyst layer (CL) recipe in MEA. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance and principal component analysis were implemented to specify the most important predictor and reduce the data dimension. The number of predictors was found to play an essential role in the accuracy of the KNN and NN models although the predictors have self-correlations. The KNN model with a K of 7 was found to minimize the model loss with a loss of 11.9%. The NN model constructed by three corresponding hidden layers with nine, eight, and nine nodes can achieve the lowest error of 0.1293 for the Pt catalyst and 0.031 for PVA as a good additive blending in the CL of the MEA. However, even if the error is low, the prediction of PVA seems to be inaccurate, regardless of the model structure. Therefore, the KNN model is more appropriate for CL recipe prediction.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, mixing and separation, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Recent alternative methods and analyzers were developed to overcome those limitations. In this study, we validated two automated ESR analyzers, MIX-RATE® X20 and VISION A, and assessed their analytical performance against the Westergren method. Methods: The analyzers were validated for inter-run and intra-run precision. Hemolysis interference and sensitivity to fibrinogen were also analysed. Analytical performance was performed using 177 patient samples spanning low (<40 mm/h), medium (40–80 mm/h), and high (>80 mm/h) ESR ranges. Method agreement and bias against the Westergren method were calculated. Results: The highest intra-run imprecision was seen in the low ESR range for both analyzers. They showed very high agreement with the Westergren method assessed by Spearmen rank correlation coefficient analysis, r = 1.000, p <.0001 for both analyzers. Bland–Altman analysis yielded overall insignificant mean biases for all comparisons. However, systematic positive and negative bias were observed at medium and high ESR levels analysed by MIX-RATE® X20 while negative bias was evidenced in the high ESR level measured by VISION A. Conclusions: Overall, results from both automated ESR analyzers showed comparable analytical performance with the Westergren method especially for low ESR levels. However, both positive and negative systematic bias were documented in the high levels. Thus, for clinical use, it must be assessed whether these biases could affect the cut-off for significant clinical values.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

Objective: To determine the short-term immune response after the SV and AZ vaccinations in HCWs. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, HCWs who completed a 2-dose regimen of the SV or AZ were included. Immune response was evaluated by surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody. Blood samples were analyzed at 4 and 12 weeks after the complete vaccination. The primary outcome was the seroconversion rate at 4-weeks after complete immunization. Results: Overall, 185 HCWs with a median (IQR) age of 40.5 (30.3-55.8) years (94 HCWs in the SV group and 91 in the AZ group) were included. At 4 weeks after completing the SV vaccination, 60.6% (95%CI: 50.0-70.6%) had seroconversion evaluated by sVNT (≥ 68% inhibition), comparable to the patients recovered from mild COVID-19 infection (69.0%), with a rapid reduction to 12.2% (95%CI: 6.3-20.8) at 12 weeks. In contrast, 85.7% (95%CI: 76.8-92.2%) HCWs who completed two doses of the AZ for 4 weeks had seroconversion, comparable to the COVID-19 pneumonia patients (92.5%), with a reduction to 39.2% (95%CI: 28.4-50.9%) at 12 weeks. When using the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody level (≥ 132 U/ml) criteria, only 71.3% HCWs in the SV group had seroconversion, compared to 100% in the AZ group at 4 weeks. Conclusion: A rapid decline of short-term immune response in the HCWs after the SV vaccination indicates the need for a vaccine booster, particularly during the ongoing spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Assessing discomfort can, therefore, help to identify workers at increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders for targeted intervention development. We aimed: (1) to identify the optimal cut-off value of neck and low back discomfort among office workers and (2) to evaluate its predictive validity with future neck and low back pain, respectively. Methods: At baseline healthy participants (n = 100) completed questionnaires, including the Borg CR-10 discomfort scale (on a 0–10 scale), and were followed for six months, during which musculoskeletal pain was assessed monthly. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of baseline discomfort with the onset of future neck or low back pain. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve were estimated to identify the optimal discomfort cut-off value predicting future pain. Results: Borg CR-10 scores ≥ 3.5 for perceived neck and low back discomfort had acceptable sensitivity and specificity to predict future neck and low back pain, respectively. Perceived discomfort at baseline as a dichotomous measure (using the ≥ 3.5 cut-off) was a statistically significant predictor of future neck pain (OR = 10.33) and low back pain (OR = 11.81).

Aim: To investigate the implant stability in relation to two different implant designs, a cylindrical shaped single-threaded design (CS/ST) and a tapered shaped double-threaded design (TS/DT) using resonance frequency analysis over the first 8 weeks after implantation. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight implants were randomly allocated using computer-generated random numbers into two groups and were placed as single tooth implant in the posterior arch in human jaw as specimens. iCAT™ CBCT scan (Hatfield, PA) was used to determine the bone density according to Misch's Bone classification. The osseotomy sites were prepared and implants were placed with guided surgical template by inexperienced surgeons which were prepared with the same implant planning software (3shape® implant studio). The implant stability was measured using the resonance frequency analysis Osstell® ISQ (Osstell AB, Sweden) on the implant level over the first 8 weeks at three different time intervals. A mean implant stability quotient (ISQ) value was recorded at each measurement time points. The first ISQ of each implant recorded at the time of implant placement were considered as baseline and were the so-called primary stability. Results: All 28 dental implants were analyzed. A similar pattern of implant stability changes was observed in both implant designs. A significant decreased was found at the first 4 weeks after implantation (p < 0.05) before ascending to maximum cumulative stability by the eighth week (p < 0.05). Between the two groups, TS/DT group had a higher mean ISQ values than that of the CS/ST group at all three observation periods but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.69). Regarding different types of bone, TS/DT showed a significant difference in mean ISQ values in D4 bone. To date, all 28 implants are in function with no failure/and or complications. Conclusions: The difference in implant design did not significantly influence the implant stability. TS/DT shows superiority over CS/ST when placed in D4 bone and offer a significant advantage due to their positive bounce back of the ISQ values by the eighth week after implant installation.

"Quinoxalinones as A Novel Inhibitor Scaffold for EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) Tyrosine Kinase: Molecular Docking, Biological Evaluations, and Computational Insights","Suriya U., Mahalapbutr P., Wimonsong W., Yotphan S., Choowongkomon K., Rungrotmongkol T.",2022-12-01,"Cell Line, Tumor, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, ErbB Receptors, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Molecular Docking Simulation, Mutation, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK, EGFR tyrosine kinase, in silico drug discovery and development, lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer","Combating acquired drug resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) is a great challenge and an urgent necessity in the management of non-small cell lung cancers. The advanced EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) triple mutation has been recently reported, and there have been no specific drugs approved for this strain. Therefore, our research aimed to search for effective agents that could impede the function of EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK by the integration of in silico and in vitro approaches. Our in-house quinoxalinone-containing compounds were screened through molecular docking and their biological activity was then verified by enzyme- and cell-based assay. We found that the four quinoxalinone-containing compounds including CPD4, CPD15, CPD16, and CPD21 were promising to be novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitors. The IC50 values measured by the enzyme-based assay were 3.04 ± 1.24 nM; 6.50 ± 3.02 nM,10.50 ± 1.10 nM; and 3.81 ± 1.80 nM, respectively, which are at a similar level to a reference drug; osimertinib (8.93 ± 3.01 nM). Besides that, they displayed cytotoxic effects on a lung cancer cell line (H1975) with IC50 values in the range of 3.47 to 79.43 μM. In this proposed study, we found that all screened compounds could interact with M793 at the hinge regions and two mutated residues including M790 and S797; which may be the main reason supporting the inhibitory activity in vitro. The structural dynamics revealed that the screened compounds have sufficient non-native contacts with surrounding amino acids and could be well-buried in the binding site’s cleft. In addition, all predicted physicochemical parameters were favorable to be drug-like based on Lipinski’s rule of five, and no extreme violation of toxicity features was found. Altogether, this study proposes a novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitor scaffold and provides a detailed understanding of compounds’ recognition and susceptibility at the molecular level.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Accordingly, neutrophil counts, serum cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacteria-free DNA, and NETs parameters (flu-orescent-stained nuclear morphology, dsDNA, neutrophil elastase, histone–DNA complex, and myeloperoxidase–DNA complex) were found to differentiate COVID-19 severity, whereas serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was different between the control and COVID-19 cases. Despite non-detect-able bacteria-free DNA in the blood of healthy volunteers, using blood bacteriome analysis, prote-obacterial DNA was similarly predominant in both control and COVID-19 cases (all severities). In parallel, only COVID-19 samples from moderate and severe cases, but not mild cases, were activated in vitro NETs, as determined by supernatant dsDNA, Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase 4, and nuclear morphology.

Type and location of flexor hallucis longus musculotendinous junctions and its tendinous interconnections with flexor digitorum longus tendon: pertinent data for tendon harvesting and transfer,"Wan-Ae-loh P., Huanmanop T., Agthong S., Chentanez V.",2022-01-01,"Cadaver, Female, Humans, Leg, Male, Muscle, Skeletal, Tendon Transfer, Tendons, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, musculotendinous junction, tendinous interconnection","Background: Anatomy of flexor hallucis longus (FHL) is essential for the achievement of tendon transfer and several procedures performed in the foot and ankle. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical knowledge of FHL including the type and location of musculotendinous junction (MTJ), tendinous interconnections (TIC) morphology, its location related to Master Knot of Henry (MKH), and the pattern of TIC distribution. Materials and methods: One hundred and sixty-six legs from 52 embalmed and 31 soft cadavers were assessed. The medial (MB) and lateral (LB) bellies of FHL were identified and traced until the end of the most distal muscle fibre to determine the medial and lateral MTJs. MTJ was classified into four types based on the existence and length of MB and LB: type 1, long LB and shorter MB; type 2, equal length of both bellies; type 3, only LB and no MB; type 4, long MB and shorter LB. Low lying muscle belly was defined as muscle extending beyond the zero point (the point of intersection between distal osseous part of tibia and FHL tendon). The distance between MTJ and zero point was measured. TIC was classified into seven types based on the direction and number of slip: type I, one slip from FHL to flexor digitorum longus (FDL); type II, crossed connection: type III, one slip from FDL to FHL; type IV, no connection; type V, two slip from FHL to FDL; type VI, two slip from FHL to FDL and one slip from FDL to FHL; type VII, two slips from FDL to FHL and one slip from FHL to FDL. The distance between the TIC and MKH was measured. TIC distribution was defined into four types based on slip distribution to lesser toes: type a, distributed to second toe; type b, distributed to second and third toes; type c, distributed to second to fourth toes, and type d, distributed to second to fifth toes. Results: Type 1 and type 3 of MTJ morphology were found in 87.3% and 12.7%, respectively. Low lying LB was detected in 66.13% of cases with a mean distance of 13.10 ± 4.51 mm. All MBs ended proximal to the zero point with a mean distance of –21.99 ± 13.21 mm. Three types of TIC (I, II, V) were identified. The highest frequency was type I (82.93%). In addition, a new type of TIC was depicted in 8.53% of cases. Part of the FHL tendon in this type fused with FDL tendon and the rest extended directly to the first toe. TIC could be located either proximal, distal or at the MKH. The highest prevalence was distal to MKH in 51.67% of cases with a mean distance of 11.23 ± 5.13 mm and 8.73 ± 4.2 mm in low lying and non-low-lying groups, respectively. Four types of slip distribution to lesser toes were defined, mostly in type b. No statistically significant differences were detected among all parameters including genders, sides, and groups.

Recurrent neural network-based model for estimating the life condition of a dry gas pipeline,"Shaik N.B., Benjapolakul W., Pedapati S.R., Bingi K., Thien Le N., Asdornwised W., Chaitusaney S.",2022-08-01,"Condition, Continuous-flow, Dry gas pipelines, Industrial users, Life predictions, Network-based modeling, Neural network method, Oil and gas, Pipeline networks, Pipeline systems, Oil and gas, Pipeline, Prediction, Recurrent neural networks, Safety","The use of expansive pipeline networks guarantees domestic and industrial users for accessing a continuous flow of valuable liquids and gases. These pipeline systems were considered the most economical and safest pipeline of transport for oil and gas and are of great strategic importance. The risks during operating conditions need to be controlled to handle the pipeline safely and smoothly in the complex globalized economy. Accordingly, life prediction is an essential issue in the pipeline network of the maintenance systems. Recently proposed data-driven and statistical approaches for pipeline's life prediction continue to rely on previous information to create health indicators and define thresholds, which is inefficient in the significant data era. Thus, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based method for predicting the life of equipment with corrosion dimension classes exposed to critical condition monitoring is proposed in this research. The RNN model uses the multiple condition monitoring observations at the current and previous inspection points as its inputs and the pipe life condition and corrosion type as its outputs. Further, to improve the predictability of the proposed model, a validation mechanism is introduced during the training process. The proposed RNN method is validated using the data from oil and gas fields that have been collected in real-time. A critical sensitivity analysis with missing parameters is performed to evaluate the model's effectiveness in forecasting the life situation when inputs are absent. A comparative study is also carried out between the proposed RNN method and an adapted version of the reported method. The results show the advantage of the proposed method in achieving an actual life expectancy which can reduce the annual maintenance costs and help take necessary actions for better protection and safety of a pipeline.","transportation and storage; pipelines; maintenance, petroleum engineeringneering, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

GlauCUTU, a novel time until perceived (TUP) visual field (VF) testing, utilizes a portable virtual reality (VR) headset with visual stimulus that progressively increases in intensity to detect VF defects. GlauCUTU was evaluated on participants with normal visual fields and those with early, moderate, and severe glaucoma. Responses were collected in terms of time until response (TUR). TUR was used to calculate TUP and reported in terms of GlauCUTU sensitivity. False positives were detected with pretest and latency analysis using reaction time (RT). In addition, a novel automated transformation was developed to convert GlauCUTU sensitivity into HFA sensitivity using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Visual field index (VFI) was generated from HFA sensitivity to determine severity of glaucoma. The VFI results were evaluated using post-hoc analysis from two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results demonstrate no significant difference (p=0.073) between Humphrey visual field analyzer (HFA) and GlauCUTU with machine learning transformation (GlauCUTU-ML) in all glaucoma stages. However, there was a significant difference between HFA and GlauCUTU with deep learning transformation (GlauCUTU-DL) in severe glaucoma (p<0.050). GlauCUTU-ML generates the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.92. Meanwhile, GlauCUTU-DL yields the highest Pearson's r correlation coefficient with HFA of 0.74, but produces the highest RMSE of 6.31. Comparison between three expert ophthalmologists' grading of glaucomatous eyes on GlauCUTU-ML and HFA aligns with the majority voting with an average agreement of 0.83, which is highly reliable. All in all, the portable and inexpensive GlauCUTU perimetry system introduces the use of TUP for VF evaluation with results comparable to HFA. GlauCUTU proves to be a promising method to increase accessibility to glaucoma screening, particularly in low-resource setting countries.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Learning how it began and spread will help to determine how to reduce the risk of future events. We review major RNA virus outbreaks since 1967 to identify common features and opportunities to prevent emergence, including ancestral viral origins in birds, bats, and other mammals; animal reservoirs and intermediate hosts; and pathways for zoonotic spillover and community spread, leading to local, regional, or international outbreaks. The increasing scientific evidence concerning the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is most consistent with a zoonotic origin and a spillover pathway from wildlife to people via wildlife farming and the wildlife trade. We apply what we know about these outbreaks to identify relevant, feasible, and implementable interventions. We identify three primary targets for pandemic prevention and preparedness: first, smart surveillance coupled with epidemiological risk assessment across wildlife–livestock–human (One Health) spillover interfaces; second, research to enhance pandemic preparedness and expedite development of vaccines and therapeutics; and third, strategies to reduce underlying drivers of spillover risk and spread and reduce the influence of misinformation. For all three, continued efforts to improve and integrate biosafety and biosecurity with the implementation of a One Health approach are essential. We discuss new models to address the challenges of creating an inclusive and effective governance structure, with the necessary stable funding for cross-disciplinary collaborative research. Finally, we offer recommendations for feasible actions to close the knowledge gaps across the One Health continuum and improve preparedness and response in the future.",Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary

BAM15 attenuated sepsis as indicated by survival, organ histology (kidneys and livers), spleen apoptosis (activated caspase 3), brain injury (SHIRPA score, serum s100β, serum miR370-3p, brain miR370-3p, brain TNF-α, and apoptosis), systemic inflammation (cytokines, cell-free DNA, endotoxemia, and bacteremia), and blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage (Evan’s blue dye and the presence of green fluorescent E. coli in brain after an oral administration). In parallel, brain miR arrays demonstrated miR370-3p at 24 h but not 120 h post-CLP, which was correlated with metabolic pathways. Either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNF-α upregulated miR370-3p in PC12 (neuron cells). An activation by sepsis factors (LPS, TNF-α, or miR370-3p transfection) damaged mitochondria (fluorescent color staining) and reduced cell ATP, possibly through profound mitochondrial activity (extracellular flux analysis) that was attenuated by BAM15. In bone-marrow-derived macrophages, LPS caused mitochondrial injury, decreased cell ATP, enhanced glycolysis activity (extracellular flux analysis), and induced pro-inflammatory macrophages (iNOS and IL-1β) which were neutralized by BAM15. In conclusion, BAM15 attenuated sepsis through decreased mitochondrial damage, reduced neuronal miR370-3p upregulation, and induced anti-inflammatory macrophages. BAM15 is proposed to be used as an adjuvant therapy against sepsis hyperinflammation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Elevation of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) reflects the inflammatory state that has been shown to play a key role in obesity and its comorbidities. Objective: Our study aimed to compare the changes of circulating irisin levels in an obese diabetic population who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) versus a control-matched population who underwent usual medical care plus diabetes support education (DSE) program. In addition, we aimed to explore the association between circulating irisin and hs-CRP levels after the interventions. Methods: In a prospective controlled trial, we studied 58 obese individuals with type 2 diabetes before and 12 months after intervention. Twenty-nine subjects underwent LRYGB and 29 subjects received DSE. Results: At 12-month follow-up, compared with the DSE group, patients who underwent LRYGB lost more weight (LRYGB; -33.4 ± 11.2, and DSE; 0.2 ± 4.9 kg; P < .001), fat mass (P < .001), and fat-free mass (P < .05). Circulating irisin (P < .05) and hs-CRP level (P < .05) were also significantly lower. Within the LRYGB group, the reduction of irisin level was positively associated with the changes of hs-CRP levels (r = 0.39, P < .05). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that LRYGB significantly reduces circulating irisin levels compared with usual medical care and DSE, in an obese diabetic population. After LRYGB, the irisin reduction significantly correlates with the reduction of hs-CRP. The elevation of circulating irisin levels suggests irisin resistance in the obese state and its decrease after LRYGB might reflect the resolution of irisin resistance. Future investigations are needed to confirm and explore the mechanisms of irisin resistance in obesity, its resolution after LRYGB, and the pathophysiological significance.",medical,Surgery

Cast irons with varying Mo content from 0.12 to 7.66 wt% under the other alloying elements with basic composition were prepared. The solidification sequences were investigated by means of thermal analysis methods. After annealing, the specimens were hardened from 1050 °C by liquid nitrogen spray and subsequently tempered at 400–600 °C. It was found that the solidification sequence of all specimens started with primary austenite dendrite (γp) and was followed by eutectic reactions. The first eutectic reactions began with L1→(γ+MC) and are followed by L2→(γ+M7C3) for specimens with Mo less than 1.17 wt% and L2→(γ+M2C) for specimens with Mo more than 3.02 wt%, respectively. As Mo content rose, the solidification temperature range of (γ+MC) eutectic decreased but that of (γ+M2C) eutectic increased when the Mo content rose over 3.02 wt%. The area fraction of (γ+MC) eutectic decreased while (γ+M2C) eutectic increased with an increase in Mo content. With respect to heat treatment behavior, hardness in the as-hardened state increased proportionally but volume fraction of retained austenite (Vγ) dropped progressively as Mo content increased. All the tempered hardness curves showed more or less secondary hardening depending on the Mo content. The maximum tempered hardness (HTmax) was obtained at 525 °C tempering where the Vγ value was less than 3%. The highest values of HTmax, 913 HV30 for macro-hardness and 890 HV0.1 for micro-hardness, were obtained, respectively, in the specimen with 4.98 wt%Mo.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

As an atmospheric pollutant, Fly ash (FA) is worth considering as a potential source of silicon, whereas the conventional magnesiothermic reaction to extract silicon from FA for LIBs is complex, costly and energy consuming. Herein, FA is employed directly as “green” and advanced anode of LIBs after being anchored on the carbon micro-sheets (FA/C) via low cost and solvent-free approach. Owing to the remarkably enhanced electric conductivity and mechanical properties, the resulting battery delivers an excellent capacity of 688 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, ultrahigh capacity retention of 97.9% over 6000 cycles and effectively mitigated volume variation, outperforming many Si-based anodes reported. Remarkably, the full battery with LiFePO4 cathode displays ideal rate capability and long-term durability, demonstrative of great potential in practical application. Moreover, this low cost, free of organic solvents, harsh acids and surfactants method can be extended to FA/graphite and FA/MXene composites, thus providing an insight for sustainable recycling of fly ash and construction of durable LIBs.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

Prior studies have provided mixed results for the ability to replace true unenhanced (TUE) images with virtual unenhanced (VUE) images when characterizing renal lesions by dual-energy CT (DECT). Detector-based dual-layer DECT (dlDECT) systems may optimize performance of VUE images for this purpose. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to compare dual-phase dlDECT examinations evaluated using VUE and TUE images in differentiating cystic and solid renal masses. METHODS. This retrospective study included 110 patients (mean age, 64.3 ± 11.8 years; 46 women, 64 men) who underwent renal-mass protocol dlDECT between July 2018 and February 2022. TUE, VUE, and nephrographic phase image sets were reconstructed. Lesions were diagnosed as solid masses by histopathology or MRI. Lesions were diagnosed as cysts by composite criteria reflecting findings from MRI, ultrasound, and the TUE and nephrographic phase images of the dlDECT examinations. One radiologist measured lesions’ attenuation on all dlDECT image sets. Lesion characterization was compared between use of VUE and TUE images, including when considering enhancement of 20 HU or greater to indicate presence of a solid mass. RESULTS. The analysis included 219 lesions (33 solid masses; 186 cysts [132 simple, 20 septate, 34 hyperattenuating]). TUE and VUE attenuation were significantly different for solid masses (33.4 ± 7.1 HU vs 35.4 ± 8.6 HU, p = .002), simple cysts (10.8 ± 5.6 HU vs 7.1 ± 8.1 HU, p < .001), and hyperattenuating cysts (56.3 ± 21.0 HU vs 47.6 ± 16.3 HU, p < .001), but not septate cysts (13.6 ± 8.1 HU vs 14.0 ± 6.8 HU, p = .79). Frequency of enhancement 20 HU or greater when using TUE and VUE images was 90.9% and 90.9% in solid masses, 0.0% and 9.1% in simple cysts, 15.0% and 10.0% in septate cysts, and 11.8% and 38.2% in hyperattenuating cysts. All solid lesions were concordant in terms of enhancement 20 HU or greater when using TUE and VUE images. Twelve simple cysts and nine hyperattenuating cysts showed enhancement of 20 HU or greater when using VUE but not TUE images. CONCLUSION. Use of VUE images reliably detected enhancement in solid masses. However, VUE images underestimated attenuation of simple and hyperattenuating cysts, leading to false-positive findings of enhancement by such lesions. CLINICAL IMPACT. The findings do not support replacement of TUE acquisitions with VUE images when characterizing renal lesions by dlDECT.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Methods: A cross-sectional study of fourth-year medical students (n = 73) and sixth-year medical students (n = 85) was conducted at the School of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. The medical students (n = 158) who met the eligibility criteria were recruited into the study. LTBI was detected by using QFT-Plus and some of the participants had a tuberculin skin test (TST). The TST was interpreted after 48–72 h. The participants who tested positive by QFT-Plus were considered to have LTBI. Demographic information and data on occupational TB exposure were collected via a questionnaire. A multivariate logistic regression was used to test for associations between independent variables and results of the QFT-Plus. Results: A total of 158 participants were included in this study. The overall prevalence of LTBI was 6.3% (n = 10) as determined by QFT-Plus. The LTBI prevalence was higher in the sixth-year medical students (9.4%) compared to the fourth-year medical students (2.7%). Higher risk of LTBI was associated with sixth-year medical students (odds ratio, 3.69 [95%CI, 0.75–17.96]), but this was not significant. Moreover, history of occupational TB exposure without PPE yielded an odds ratio of 2.98 [95%CI, 0.68–13.12] but it was not statistically significant due to the small sample size. One hundred thirty-nine (88%) participants were BCG vaccinated as per the national vaccination requirements. No abnormal chest X-rays were found for any of the positive participants. Of the 158 participants, 41 (25.9%) of them had TST. Of the 41 participants, 6 (14.6%) tested positive at a cut-off of ≥ 10 mm for TST, which was concordant with QFT-Plus results. The agreement between the two tests was 0.57 using kappa coefficients. Conclusion: The screening of TB infection in new healthcare workers (HCWs), especially medical students, is essential to reduce future nosocomial TB incidences in the hospitals. This study showed that there was a high prevalence of LTBI among sixth-year medical students compared to fourth-year medical students. Our results suggest that tendency of higher LTBI prevalence might be associated with advanced clinical years, thus tailored public health education strategy and infection control in tertiary care hospitals for new healthcare workers in TB endemic countries may prevent nosocomial TB disease from developing in the future. Therefore, active surveillance should be done for all new HCWs, and TB preventive therapy should be administered to recent converters.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Enhancement of the properties of carbon-black-filled natural rubber compounds containing soybean oil cured with peroxide through the addition of coagents,"Hayichelaeh C., Boonkerd K.",2022-11-01,"Aging properties, Carbon black filled rubber, Co-agents, Distillate aromatic extracts, Natural rubber compounds, Rubber processing, Thermal aging property, Triallyl isocyanurate, Trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, Coagent, Natural rubber, Ozone resistance, Soybean oil, Thermal aging properties","Due to the hazard of the commercial rubber processing oil such as distillate aromatic extract (DAE), many rubber researchers play attention to find the green alternatives. Vegetable oils seem to gain a lot of attraction for this. It is not just only due to their environmentally friendly nature but also their abundance and affordable cost. The use of soybean oil (SBO) for the carbon black-filled rubber compounds was focused here and comparatively discussed with the use of DAE. Furthermore, this work also proposed the way to improve the mechanical properties and environmental endurance of the rubber compounds containing SBO by adding coagents. There were two types of coagent including trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA) and triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) used here. It was found that the cure time, cure rate index, and cure reaction rate constant of SBO-added rubber compounds with and without coagents were higher than those of DAE-added rubber compounds, whereas the activation energy of SBO-added rubber compounds was lower than the one with DAE. Without coagent, the mechanical properties of rubber compounds with DAE and SBO are equal. However, the addition of coagents improved the mechanical properties of rubber compounds containing SBO. The modulus at 100% strain, modulus at 200% strain, and tensile strength of TMPTMA-added rubber compounds increased by 41%, 48%, and 15%, respectively, whereas the rubber compounds with TAIC increased by 7%, 8%, and 20%, respectively, when compared to the one with SBO alone. Interesting, the SBO-added rubber compounds with and without coagents showed better thermal aging and ozone resistances than the DAE-added rubber compounds. All results showed that the presence of coagents especially TMPTMA gave the SBO-added rubber compound with the superior performance to the DAE-added rubber compound and the SBO-added rubber compound without coagent.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

This study aimed to explore FA composition in BM of lactating women following dietary restrictions due to infant allergic conditions. Materials and Methods: Thai lactating mothers of term infants who were on exclusion diets were recruited. Mature BM was collected before and after a period (at least 2 weeks) of dietary restriction. FA in BM was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Fifty lactating women 33.7 ± 3.6 years of age were enrolled. Thirty-three percent of the lactating mothers restricted more than eight food items. Most common dietary restriction were cow's milk (88%) and eggs (74%). After the period of dietary exclusion, total polyunsaturated FA showed no significant change, while saturated FA (SFA) declined, and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased. A decrease in fat intake was associated with an increase in arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content in BM (r = -0.37, r = -0.36; p < 0.05). However, a rise in ARA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and DHA intake was associated with an increase in linoleic acid and EPA in BM, respectively (r = 0.38, r = 0.55 and r = 0.41; p < 0.05). Infant weight-for-age z-score did not significantly change after the period of maternal dietary exclusion. Conclusion: Maternal exclusion diet resulted in lower SFA and higher MUFA composition in BM. Further study should explore the long-term outcomes of maternal dietary restriction on infant and child health.","Nursing, medical","Pediatrics, Health Policy, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternity and Midwifery"

Instead of relying on human to perform repetitive tasks, an automated system can perform such tasks with higher productivity and lower operating cost. In a logistics industry, one such common task is the determination of size and dimension of boxes that arrive at the warehouse for inventory management purposes. Traditionally, a worker would need to perform the measurement manually, which can be labor intensive and the result is prone to human error. In this paper, we propose an automated, volumetric measurement system for rectangular parcel box based on single LiDAR depth camera. The system relies on captured depth information and applies flood fill algorithm to detect the top plane in order to extract the width, length, and height dimensions of the box. Additional height accuracy can be attained by using grid sampling and adding manual offset to account for box deformation. Based on our test case scenarios, the accuracy of the system shows a measurement error of <5% across the different dimensions and an average processing time of 1.01 seconds.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Media Technology, Instrumentation"

Therefore, novel diagnostic markers and treatment options are required. Recently, an inhibitor for immune checkpoint program death ligand-1 (PD-L1), was approved by the FDA, and used in HNSCC patients. Histatins (HTNs), one of the common antimicrobial peptides in saliva, have demonstrated wound healing and antifungal capabilities and other functions on the oral epithelium. Dysregulation of HTN1 and HTN3 has also been reported in HNSCC through genomic and proteomic studies. This study aimed to investigate the association between histatins (HTN1 and HTN3) and PD-L1 in advanced HNSCC. Patients and Methods: Data of gene expression in HNSCC were collected from TCGA and analyzed using a data-mining platform website (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/). Tissue microarrays containing 98 samples of HNSCC patients and non-neoplastic controls were immunolabeled against PD-L1, HTN1, and HTN3. The immunohistochemistry results were quantified using ImageJ. Results: The expression of PD-L1 and HTN1 was significantly higher in tumors than normal tissues (p<0.001), but no significant difference was found regarding HTN3. Metastatic HNSCC samples exhibited significantly higher expression of PD-L1 (p<0.018), compared to the non-metastatic group. Association between HTN1 and HTN3 was found using Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.603, p<0.001). No overall survival difference was evident among our samples. Conclusion: PD-L1 and HTN1 are associated with the progression of HNSCC. PD-L1 expression correlated with that of HTN3.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown. Study Design: Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting & Participants: Adult (aged ≥18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value <3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤100 or >100 mL/day). Interventions: Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4-5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is <3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression. Outcome: The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis. Results: A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315-417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147-247] vs 133 [IQR, 41-197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24-0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group. Limitations: Not double-masked. Conclusions: Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4-5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

Methods: We designed a retrospective cohort study and enroled a sample of post-AS-COVID and post-MS-COVID patients, whose INF were treated at a German level 1 trauma centre. The primary predictor variable was COVID severity presurgery (AS-COVD vs. MS-COVID). The main outcome variable was PVS detected in ES/IP. Other study variables were separated into demographic, clinical, and operative. Descriptive, bi- and multivariate statistics were computed, and statistical significance was set at P≤ 0.05. Results: The study sample comprised 15 INF patients (53.3% females; 46.7% post-AS-COVID) with a mean age of 42.2 ± 22.7 years (range, 18–85). 13.3% ES and 53.3% IP were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2.

Multiple linear regression models refuted the associations between PVS and the other parameters (i.e. age, gender, time to treatment, length of hospital stay, lengths of ES/IP placement). Conclusions: Despite a relative low sample size, our findings suggest PVS via endonasal materials removed from cured COVID-19 patients, especially those healed from MS-COVID. This PVS may trigger re-infection and surgical site infections and/or transmission to other humans, and thereby, requires further investigations.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

In the present study, we aim to improve the properties of PVA based hydrogels by combining it with collagen hydrolysate (CH) and silk sericin which are biocompatible proteins and are expected to assist in improving biomedical applications of PVA. Various blends of the polymers were used to prepare hydrogels through the precipitation process and the physical and biological properties were evaluated particularly for controlled release and wound healing applications. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were used to characterize the structure of the hydrogels. Results indicate good interactions and potential crosslinking between PVA and proteins leading to changes in the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the hydrogels. Hydrogels containing both CH and sericin (10P3S5C1G) had comparable properties to neat PVA but with increased water content. Although addition of the proteins leads to marginal decrease in the mechanical strength of the hydrogels, the properties were still in the acceptable range, i.e., tensile strength (3.98 MPa), percentage elongation (365%), and elasticity (2.25 N/mm2). Biological tests showed the superiority of 10P3S5C1G blended hydrogel compared to other blends. Patch test evaluation conducted on healthy volunteers to investigate the safety of 10P3S5C1G showed that about 90% were negative and doubtful reactions, while the remaining 10% were weak reactions. Accordingly, the effects of 10P3S5C1G on human wound healing might be examined in future studies.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In parallel to vaccine development, identifying potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 has become an urgent need to combat COVID-19. One of the most attractive drug targets for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents is the main protease (Mpro), which plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle. This study aimed to elucidate a series of twenty-one 12-dithiocarbamate-14-deoxyandrographolide analogues as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors using in vitro and in silico studies. These compounds were initially screened for the inhibitory activity toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by in vitro enzyme-based assay. We found that compounds 3k, 3l, 3m and 3t showed promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with >50% inhibition at 10 μM. Afterward, the binding mode of each compound in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was explored by molecular docking. The optimum docked complexes were then chosen and subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The MD results suggested that all studied complexes were stable along the simulation time, and most of the compounds could fit well with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, particularly at S1, S2 and S4 subsites. The per-residue decomposition free energy calculations indicated that the hot-spot residues essential for ligand binding were T25, H41, C44, S46, M49, C145, H163, M165, E166, L167, D187, R188, Q189 and T190.

Low-temperature alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2: The effect of alcohol type,"Meesattham S., Kim-Lohsoontorn P.",2022-06-29,"1-propanol, Alcohol-assisted, CO 2 emission, CO2 conversion, CO2 utilization, Low-temperature methanol synthesis, Lows-temperatures, Methanol selectivity, Methanol synthesis, N-alcohols, Alcohol-assisted, CO2, CO2 conversion, CO2 utilization, Low-temperature methanol synthesis, Methanol","Carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to higher-value products is a promising pathway to mitigate CO2 emissions. Methanol is a high-value-chain chemical in industries that can be produced through CO2 hydrogenation, which is an exothermic reaction. Due to thermodynamic limitations, a typical synthesis temperature between 250 °C and 300 °C results in a low conversion of CO2 at equilibrium. To enhance the CO2 conversion, high pressures of 50–100 bar are required, which inevitably causes the process to be energy-intensive. In this study, an alternative method called alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis is investigated. In this method, alcohol is used as a catalytic solvent and helps decrease the reaction temperature and pressure (150 °C and 50 bar) and significantly increases methanol yield. Ethanol is used as the alcohol due to its reactivity, providing a high methanol yield (47.80%) with 63.93% CO2 conversion and 67.54% methanol selectivity. However, due to unwanted side reactions, ethanol generates ethyl acetate as a byproduct that forms an azeotrope with methanol, leading to difficulty in product purification. The effects of alcohol type (molecular weight and structure), including ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, iso-butanol, tert-butanol and 1-pentanol, on CO2 conversion, methanol yield and byproducts are investigated. It is found that smaller-molecule alcohols provide a higher methanol yield. Moreover, n-alcohols provide a higher methanol yield than branched alcohols, and the byproducts of the reaction with n-alcohols do not form an azeotrope with methanol. Therefore, 1-propanol is compared with ethanol providing 26.55% methanol yield, 69.02% CO2 conversion and 70.82% methanol selectivity.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The mechanisms of single altered gene causing two different diseases are unclear. Additionally, novel treatments specifically targeting mutated JAK2 proteins are needed. In this study, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were virally transduced to express wild-type JAK2 (JAK2WT), JAK2p.V617F (JAK2V617F) or JAK2p.N542_E543del (JAK2exon12) under a doxycycline-inducible system. The modified iPSCs which were differentiated into megakaryocytes in the presence vs. absence of doxycycline were compared to ensure that the differences were solely from mutated JAK2 expressions. The JAK2V617-expressing iPSCs yielded significantly higher numbers of megakaryocytes consistent with the ET phenotype, while there was no enhancement by JAK2exon12 expression compatible with the pure erythrocytosis in humans. Capillary Western analyses revealed significantly greater JAK2 phosphorylation in iPSCs carrying JAK2V617F but not in JAK2WT and JAK2exon12 iPSCs. Activation of STAT3, STAT5 and AKT was increased by JAK2V617F, while they were decreased in JAK2exon12 iPSCs. Notably, interferon alpha and/or arsenic trioxide inhibited megakaryocytes proliferation and reduced JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AKT phosphorylation in mutant JAK2-expressing iPSCs compared with those without induction. In conclusion, JAK2V617F expression in iPSCs preferentially promoted megakaryocytes with a signaling profile distinctive from JAK2exon12 expression. Treatments with interferon alpha or arsenic trioxide preferentially suppressed the mutated over wild-type JAK2 signaling. This iPSC model is helpful in mechanistic studies and novel therapy screen for myeloproliferative neoplasm.",medical,Hematology

Penaeus monodon Interferon Regulatory Factor (PmIRF) Activates IFNs and Antimicrobial Peptide Expression via a STING-Dependent DNA Sensing Pathway,"Soponpong S., Amparyup P., Kawai T., Tassanakajon A.",2022-01-10,"Animals, Antimicrobial Peptides, Cell Line, Cells, Cultured, DNA, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Silencing, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Humans, Immunity, Innate, Interferon Regulatory Factors, Interferons, Membrane Proteins, Penaeidae, Signal Transduction, antiviral response, DNA sensing pathway, interferon, IRF, shrimp immunity, STING","Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors found in both vertebrates and invertebrates that were recently identified and found to play an important role in antiviral immunity in black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which P. monodon IRF (PmIRF) regulates the immune-related genes downstream of the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. Depletion of PmIRF by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of the IFN-like factors PmVago1, PmVago4, and PmVago5 and antilipopolysaccharide factor 6 (ALFPm6) in shrimp. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells transfected with PmIRF or co-transfected with DEAD-box polypeptide (PmDDX41) and simulator of IFN genes (PmSTING) expression plasmids, the promoter activity of IFN-β, nuclear factor (NF-κB), and ALFPm6 was synergistically enhanced following stimulation with the nucleic acid mimics deoxyadenylic–deoxythymidylic acid sodium salt [poly(dA:dT)] and high molecular weight (HMW) polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)]. Both nucleic acid mimics also significantly induced PmSTING, PmIRF, and ALFPm6 gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PmIRF interacted with PmSTING in cells stimulated with poly(dA:dT). PmSTING, PmIRF, and PmDDX41 were localized in the cytoplasm of unstimulated HEK293T cells and PmIRF and PmDDX41 were translocated to the nucleus upon stimulation with the nucleic acid mimics while PmSTING remained in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that PmIRF transduces the pathogen signal via the PmDDX41–PmSTING DNA sensing pathway to induce downstream production of interferon-like molecules and antimicrobial peptides.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Demographic data, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile were obtained from the Thai National Health Examination Survey V database. The performances of WHtR, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and BMI z-score were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristics. Among 2644 adolescents, metabolic syndrome was identified in 4.27%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of WHtR, waist circumference, BMI, and BMI z-score were comparable (0.924-0.960). Performance of WHtR was more constant across age groups compared with other parameters. Using the cutoff value of WHtR at 0.5 resulted in the sensitivity and specificity of 98.5%/83.4% and 88.9%/86.0% in males and females, respectively. In conclusion, the cutoff value of WHtR at 0.5 provided good sensitivity and specificity for identifying metabolic syndrome in both genders. However, the other clinical risk factors or more definite scores should be considered when further assessment.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

As a result of this, establishing a mechanism for selectively detecting the Cu2+ ion in an aqueous medium is crucial. A new triphenylamine-pyrenyl salicylic acid probe (Compound 3) was produced utilizing the Sonograshira reaction, the Suzuki cross-coupling process combined with a hydrolysis reaction for Cu2+ detection with a fluorescent turn-off mode. In the presence of Cu2+, Compound 3 operated as both a highly selective and highly sensitive fluorescent Cu2+ sensor in a 100% aqueous medium. Consequently, the fluorescence intensity of Compound 3 showed a strong linear relationship with the Cu2+ ion concentration in the 10 to 1000 pM range. The detection limit of the approach was 5.22 pM, which was less than the maximum Cu2+ level in drinking water, as suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency of 19 µM. (EPA). Therefore, Compound 3 was successfully used to determine the concentration of Cu2+ in real samples.","water engineeringneering, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

There were two comparison groups vaccinated with the homologous CoronaVac (N = 79) and AZD1222 (N = 78) regimen. All sera samples were tested for anti-receptor-binding-domain IgG (anti-RBD IgG) using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The neutralizing activity in a subset of serum samples was tested against the original Wuhan strain and variants of concern, B.1.1.7, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 vaccine induced higher levels of anti-RBD IgG than that of two-dose homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccines (p < 0.001). Sera samples of the CoronaVac/AZD1222 vaccine recipients elicited higher neutralizing antibody activity against the original Wuhan and all variants of concern than in the recipients of the two-dose CoronaVac. The heterologous CoronaVac followed by AZD1222 is an alternative regimen to combat with the SARS-CoV-2 variants in case of vaccine shortage with improved immunogenicity compared to the homologous CoronaVac regimen.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Herein, optimal conditions for fabricating high-molecular-weight chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol hybrid hydrogels using gamma irradiation at 10, 25, and 30 kGy were investigated by studying the water uptake behavior, the pore size on the surface, and thermal stability. Furthermore, the crosslinking mechanism of irradiated hydrogels was examined via solid-state 13C NMR spectrum. The swelling ratio of the gamma-irradiated CS/PVA hydrogel was pH-dependent; particularly, the hybrid hydrogel exhibited high swelling ratios under acidic conditions than those under basic conditions due to the protonation of amino groups on CS-backbone in acidic environments. In addition, amoxicillin was used as a model drug in the in vitro drug release investigations in pH-simulated gastric fluid and deionized water at 37 °C. To identify the drug release mechanism, several kinetic models composing zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Hixson–Crowell, and Korsmeyer–Peppas models were used. The findings suggested that drug release is mediated by a non-Fickian transport mechanism.

The proposed numerical study also considers the ETS FRP bar‒concrete joints with long bond (embedment) length. First, a trapezoidal bond model describing the bond stress‒slip curves of ETS FRP‒concrete interfaces is adopted. Second, nonlinear FE models incorporating the developed bond model analysing the bond behaviour of the ETS FRP bar‒concrete joints are validated against the pull-out test results. The reliable FE models are then used in a parametric study to investigate the effects of key features, such as the properties of adhesives, FRP bars, and concrete, on the bond performance of the ETS FRP bar‒concrete interfaces. The analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the FE models. Expressions for the maximum bond force and the effective bond (embedment) length are rationally formulated based on the parametric study.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In the proposed approach, if a utility needs to reduce electrical load consumption, a DLC signal is sent to a smart meter (SM) either via utility’s communication infrastructure. SM communicates with a group of smart plugs attached to selected domestic appliances to individually reduce the output voltage. The electrical consumption of selected appliances can be reduced without turning them OFF. Hence, the peak demand of a residential house can be reduced without turning off selected power-intensive loads, like in a classic direct load control (DLC) approach used by several electric utilities. The proposed dynamic voltage control is operated can be done within a certain limit defined set by international standards to avoid any possible negative impacts on domestic appliances. The results indicated that the proposed DLC could reduce the peak electricity demand up to around 32% using both voltage control and renewable energy. The proposed approach is expected to give flexibility to utilities to control the electrical demand of homes while ensuring participants remain more comfortable during a DR event.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Here, we report that PFOA deteriorates female reproduction at multiple development stages. Oocyte meiosis and preimplantation development are severely impaired by PFOA with oxidative stress being a contributor. Supplementing with antioxidant melatonin partially rescues oocyte meiotic maturation and non-apoptotic demise. The attenuation in ovarian follicle development however can be improved by metformin but not melatonin. Importantly, metformin blunts PFOA-induced fetal growth retardation (FGR) and such protective effect could be recapitulated by transplantation of fecal material and pharmacological activation of AMPK. Mechanistically, PFOA causes gut microbiota dysbiosis, which might thereby rewire host metabolism of L-phenylalanine, histamine and L-palmitoylcarnitine that triggers hyperphenylalaninaemia, inflammation and ferroptosis to initiate FGR. Deregulated serine metabolism by the gut microbe constitutes an alternative mechanism underlying PFOA-induced FGR in that modulation of serine in dam's diet phenocopied the FGR. Our study expands the understanding of risk factors that impair human reproductive health, and proposes restoration of gut microbiota diversity and intervention of metabolism as therapeutics mitigating health risks predisposed by environmental perturbation.","geobase; related topics, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Maternal microbiome is associated with proper development of infants. The aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiome profiles among Thai healthy pregnant women and its associated factors. Methods: A multicenter, open trial prospective study was performed at three hospitals in Northern, Central, and Northeastern regions of Thailand. Thai healthy pregnant women attending antenatal clinics were recruited. Fecal samples of subjects at the third trimester of pregnancy were collected with sterilized techniques. The gut microbiome profiles and bacterial diversity were assessed using 16Ss RNA gene sequencing. Demographic data, dietary intake, and anthropometric data were recorded and analyzed. Results: There were 86 healthy pregnant women. The dominant of gut microbiome profiles were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Pregnant women in the Central region had significantly higher of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae than those in other regions (p < 0.001). Pregnant women in the Northern region significantly consumed more glutinous rice than those in other regions (p < 0.001). Glutinous rice intake was positively correlated with Bacteroidetes (rho = 0.405, p = 0.01) and negatively correlated with Firmicutes (rho = − 0.440, p = 0.001). Alpha diversity was not correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain. Conclusions: The gut microbiome profiles mainly found in Thai healthy pregnant women were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The gut microbiome profiles in pregnant women found in this study possibly depended on dietary patterns.

The results proved that the choice of peptidase and substrate both have a significant effect on the hydrolysates in different physicochemical, structural and functional properties. Size exclusion-HPLC was used to fractionate the MBP and ABP hydrolysates. The results demonstrated that Alcalase hydrolysates included smaller peptides than Flavourzyme hydrolysates, and the chromatogram patterns of the two peptidases were similar. The peptides with the most potent antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory properties were identified using MALDI-TOF-MS. The fraction (F4) of MBPHA exhibited the highest levels of metal chelating activity. The Flavourzyme hydrolysates fraction (F2) and the ABPHA fraction (F2) showed the highest ABTS radical scavenging activity and ACE-inhibitory activity, respectively.

Additions of 10 wt% ZrO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2–Al2O3 into Cu/ZnO were investigated in low-temperature methanol synthesis using ethanol as catalytic solvent. Suitable zeolite (ZSM-5 and ferrierite) for methanol dehydration was also determined. Ethanol-assisted method offered high methanol yield and Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst provided the highest CO2 conversion (82.1%) and methanol yield (60.8%) at 150 °C and 50 bar since ZrO2 decreased CuO crystallite sizes and increased surface areas of the catalyst. For methanol dehydration to DME, zeolite's strong acidity related to DME formation. The Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 - Ferrierite provided the highest DME productivity at 0.44 mmolDME/gcat. In addition, DME synthesis from CO2 and H2 through ethanol-assisted methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration can be a potential method to simultaneously produce DME and ethylene. Under the operating conditions, ethylene was produced as a valued by-product of 5.65 mmolEthylene/gcat from dehydration of ethanol. In this study, rather high methanol yield was obtained from ethanol-assisted method. However, DME yield can be further improved by increasing synthesis temperature.","process equipment, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

While biofilm formation is a crucial virulence factor for Candida colonization, existing information on biofilm formation capability of Candida in cancer patients is scarce. Objective: To evaluate biofilm formation capability of Candida spp. colonized in xerostomic post-radiotherapy HNC patients. Design: Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species were previously isolated from xerostomic post-radiation cancer patients and healthy individuals. Biofilm mass and biofilm metabolic activity were investigated by crystal violet and MTT assays, respectively. Their relationship with clinical parameters was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests. Results: A total of 109 and 45 Candida isolates from 64 cancer patients and 34 controls, respectively, were evaluated. Both biofilm mass and metabolic activity of Candida isolates from cancer patients were higher than those from controls. The between-group differences were statistically significant in C. albicans (p < 0.001) for biofilm mass, and in C. tropicalis (p = 0.01) for biofilm metabolic activity. Overall, C. tropicalis was the best biofilm producers in both groups. Additionally, we found that higher biofilm formation among C. albicans was associated with low saliva buffering capacity. Conclusions: C. albicans and C. tropicalis isolated from xerostomic post-radiation cancer patients had higher biofilm formation capability than those from healthy individuals. Our findings suggest that, in addition to compromised host factors, higher biofilm formation capability may also contribute to the pathogenesis of oral candidiasis in HNC patients. This novel information potentially adds to proper management for these patients.","medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all), Cell Biology"

We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors related to sleep impairments, and the associations of sleep impairments with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in Thai adolescents with SLE. Methods: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQA), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ 4.0 Core Scales were administered to 57 participants with SLE aged 13–18 years to evaluate sleep, depression, and HRQOL, respectively. Participants were divided into “good sleep” (PSQI scores <5) and “poor sleep” groups (PSQI scores ≥5). Participants with body mass index (BMI) >23 kg/m2 were classified into the high BMI group. Findings: Eighteen participants (31.6%) were in the poor sleep group.

En(a−) individuals can form anti-Ena when exposed to GPA. A Thai patient formed an antibody that reacted against all reagent red blood cells (RBCs). The patient received incompatible blood resulting in a fatal haemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR). This study aimed to characterize the antibody detected in the patient and investigate the cause of HTR. Materials and Methods: Blood samples from the patient and three of his family members were investigated. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) and DNA-microarray were used for genotyping. Standard haemagglutination techniques were used for phenotyping and antibody investigations. Results: DNA sequencing showed the patient was homozygous for GYPA*M c.295delG (p.Val99Ter) predicting En(a−). Three family members were heterozygous for GYPA c.295delG. MPS and DNA-microarray predicted the patient was N− discordant with the N+ RBC phenotype. The patient's plasma was positive with enzyme/chemical-treated reagent RBCs but failed to react with En(a−) and MkMk RBCs. Conclusion: The GYPA c.295delG variant prevented GPA expression on RBCs resulting in En(a−) phenotype. The N+ phenotype result was probably due to the anti-N typing reagent detecting ‘N’ (MNS30) on GPB. The patient's alloantibody has anti-Ena specificity.,medical,Hematology
BERTFOREX: Cascading Model for Forex Market Forecasting Using Fundamental and Technical Indicator Data Based on BERT,"Pornwattanavichai A., Maneeroj S., Boonsiri S.",2022-01-01,"Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer, Characteristic fluctuations, Deep learning, Exchange rate forecasting, Foreign exchange, Foreign exchange rates, Hidden patterns, Market forecasting, Technical indicator, Time series forecasting, BERT, deep learning, forex, Time series forecasting","Foreign exchange (Forex) rate forecasting is presently pursued by many researchers as it plays an important role in financial technology and business. The challenge of Forex research lies in its characteristics, fluctuation, non-linearity, and random walk phenomena. Several related studies generate forecasting signals using fundamental data (FD) and technical indicator data (TI) to support Forex. FD is an indicator of country economic conditions, while TI shows the price pattern-based signal. However, these two indicators pose two major limitations on their deployment. First, modeling a sequential neural network causes gradient vanishing and information loss. Second, FD exerts a significant impact on currency price upon its quarterly update and release. The second limitation is known as FD releasing problem. Moreover, Forex forecasting using FD and TI is typically conducted in an equal aggregation manner, resulting in inaccurate prediction due to unequal data changing frequency. In this work, we propose a cascading model for forex market forecasting using FD and TI based on BERT (BERTFOREX). The processing step of BERTFOREX are as follows: 1) BERT is applied to FD for extracting the hidden patterns over the designated period. 2) These extracted hidden patterns of FD are aggregated as additional weights to TI since FD frequency changes slower than that of TI. 3) BERT is again applied to extract the aggregated pattern within TI and FD over other influencing days. 4) To demonstrate the efficiency of BERTFOREX, the aggregated pattern is fed into a simple neural network for forecasting. The proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of percentage of correct signals, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Methods A prospective case-control study including 20 unrelated Thai acetaminophen-related SJS/TEN patients with SOC and 60 Thai healthy volunteers, recruited at three university hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand, from September 2014 to August 2019. HLA genes were analysed using PCR amplification followed by hybridisation with sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes with bead-based typing kits. The carrier and gene frequencies of individual HLA alleles in patients were compared with those in control volunteers based on dominant assumption using Fisher's exact test. Results Among HLA class I polymorphisms, HLA-A∗33:03, HLA-B∗44:03 and HLA-C∗07:01 were significantly associated with acetaminophen-related SJS/TEN and SOC with high ORs (95% CI, corrected p value; Pc) in carrier frequency of 5.4 (1.8 to 16.3, Pc=0.0274), 9.0 (95% CI 2.7 to 30.4, Pc=0.0034), and 9.3 (2.8 to 30.2, Pc=0.0022), respectively. There were no significant HLA class II associations with the disease after corrected for a total number of alleles tested. Conclusion HLA-B∗44:03 was strongly associated with acetaminophen-related SJS/TEN patients who developed SOC in Thai population. In addition, we also found moderate to strong associations with HLA-A∗33:03 and HLA-C∗07:01 suggesting their potential roles in the pathogenesis of SOC in acetaminophen-related SJS/TEN.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Immunological insights into the resistance of Nile tilapia strains to an infection with tilapia lake virus,"Adamek M., Rebl A., Matras M., Lodder C., El Rahman S., Stachnik M., Rakus K., Bauer J., Falco A., Jung-Schroers V., Piewbang C., Techangamsuwan S., Surachetpong W., Reichert M., Tetens J., Steinhagen D.",2022-05-01,"Animals, Cichlids, DNA Viruses, Fish Diseases, Humans, RNA Virus Infections, RNA Viruses, Tilapia, Disease resistance, Innate immunity, mx1, Nile tilapia, Tilapia lake virus","The emergence of viral diseases affecting fish and causing very high mortality can lead to the disruption of aquaculture production. Recently, this occurred in Nile tilapia aquaculture where a disease caused by a systemic infection with a novel virus named tilapia lake virus (TiLV) caused havoc in cultured populations. With mortality surpassing 90% in young tilapia, the disease caused by TiLV has become a serious challenge for global tilapia aquaculture. In order to partly mitigate the losses, we explored the natural resistance to TiLV-induced disease in three genetic strains of tilapia which were kept at the University of Göttingen, Germany. We used two strains originating from Nilotic regions (Lake Mansala (MAN) and Lake Turkana (ELM)) and one from an unknown location (DRE). We were able to show that the virus is capable of overcoming the natural resistance of tilapia when injected, providing inaccurate mortality results that might complicate finding the resistant strains. Using the cohabitation infection model, we found an ELM strain that did not develop any clinical signs of the infection, which resulted in nearly 100% survival rate. The other two strains (DRE and MAN) showed severe clinical signs and much lower survival rates of 29.3% in the DRE strain and 6.7% in the MAN strain. The disease resistance of tilapia from the ELM strain was correlated with lower viral loads both at the mucosa and internal tissues. Our results suggest that the lower viral load could be caused by a higher magnitude of a mx1-based antiviral response in the initial phase of infection. The lower pro-inflammatory responses also found in the resistant strain might additionally contribute to its protection from developing pathological changes related to the disease. In conclusion, our results suggest the possibility of using TiLV-resistant strains as an ad hoc, cost-effective solution to the TiLV challenge. However, as the fish from the disease-resistant strain still retained significant virus loads in liver and brain and thus could become persistent virus carriers, they should be used within an integrative approach also combining biosecurity, diagnostics and vaccination measures.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

It is urgent to search for new agents to treat such an infection. Our previous study isolated a soil bacterium (Brevibacillus sp. SPR-20), showing the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus TISTR 517 and MRSA strains. The present study aimed to purify and characterize anti-MRSA substances produced by SPR-20. The result showed that five active substances (P1–P5) were found, and they were identified by LC-MS/MS that provided the peptide sequences of 14–15 residues. Circular dichroism showed that all peptides contained β-strand and disordered conformations as the major secondary structures. Only P1–P4 adopted more α-helix conformations when incubated with 50 mM SDS. These anti-MRSA peptides could inhibit S. aureus and MRSA in concentrations of 2–32 μg/mL. P1 (NH2-VVVNVLVKVLPPPVV-COOH) had the highest activity and was identified as a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The stability study revealed that P1 was stable in response to temperature, proteolytic enzymes, surfactant, and pH. The electron micrograph showed that P1 induced bacterial membrane damage when treated at 1× MIC in the first hour of incubation. The killing kinetics of P1 was dependent on concentration and time. Mechanisms of P1 on tested pathogens involved membrane permeability, leakage of genetic material, and cell lysis. The P1 peptide at a concentration up to 32 μg/mL showed hemolysis of less than 10%, supporting its safety for human erythrocytes. This study provides promising anti-MRSA peptides that might be developed for effective antibiotics in the post-antibiotic era.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The results showed that the hydrophobicity of the obtained HBFCs was related to surface roughness and the roughness profile of the surface. HBFCs obtained using 10 phr OMC-20A with 35 phr FS-H15 in hybrid coatings and fabricated by four dipping provided high roughness surfaces (Rq) at 546.67 nm with a micro-nano-binary structure and a low surface energy at 2.35 mN/m leading to superhydrophobic surfaces on the coated glass and cement boards demonstrating 151.34° and 150.88° water contact angles, respectively.

Novel development of cationic surfactant-based mucoadhesive nanovaccine for direct immersion vaccination against Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis in red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.),"Thangsunan P., Kitiyodom S., Srisapoome P., Pirarat N., Yata T., Thangsunan P., Boonrungsiman S., Bunnoy A., Rodkhum C.",2022-08-01,"Animals, Cichlids, Fish Diseases, Francisella, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Immersion, Surface-Active Agents, Tilapia, Vaccination, Cationic surfactant, Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis, Immersion vaccination, Nanovaccine, Tilapia","Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis (Fno) is one of the infectious diseases that causes economic losses associated with tilapia mortality. Even though direct immersion administration of vaccines is more practicable for small fish and fry compared with oral and injection vaccination in the fields, the efficacy is still insufficient due to lower potency of antigen uptake. Herein, we accomplished the development of a mucoadhesive nanovaccine platform using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), a cationic surfactant, to improve the efficiency of immersion vaccination against Fno in tilapia. Cationic Fno nanovaccine (CAT-Fno-NV) was prepared though emulsification using an ultrasonic method. In our investigation, the CAT-Fno-NV increased the opportunity of Fno vaccine uptake by extending the contact time between vaccine and mucosal surface of fish gills and enhancing the protective efficacy against Fno infection. Fish were vaccinated with the CAT-Fno-NV by a direct immersion protocol. The challenge trial by Fno injection revealed that CAT-Fno-NV at the concentration 1:100 ratio (approximately 1 × 106 cfu/mL) had the highest efficacy to protect fish from Fno infection at day 30 after post challenge period according to the total number of Fno detected in head kidney, spleen and liver. A significant upregulation of IgM gene was observed in gills, skin, head kidney, serum and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and spleen tissues treated with WC and CAT-Fno-NV (1:100) vaccines, while IgT gene was highly expressed in only gills and skin tissues for treated WC and CAT-Fno-NV (1:100) groups. We anticipate that the cationic surfactant-based nanovaccine developed in this study could become an efficient alternative for direct immersion vaccination to induce humoral immune responses against Fno in vaccinated tilapia.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The disease is mainly caused by Aeromonas veronii. Vaccine is proposed to be a major impact tool for sustainable control and prevention strategies. Vaccination by immersion has many benefits over injection. However, the conventional immersion method suffers from a low potency due to the inefficient uptake of antigens across mucosal tissue. Here, we developed a chitosan-polymer based nanovaccine together with an efficient delivery vehicle to enhance the immunogenicity of immersion vaccination, increasing bioavailability and inducing local immune responses during transit to mucosal inductive immune sites. The physiochemical properties of nanovaccine, which was modified on surface particle by using a mucoadhesive polymer, were assessed for size, zeta potential, and particle distribution. Our study demonstrated by SEM image and microscopic fluorescence image that nanovaccine greatly increased the binding and penetrating ability into gills when compared with formalin killed vaccine. The nano-sized particles were well dispersed in water and trapped in core nanoparticle as confirmed by TEM image. The efficacy of vaccine was performed by immersion challenge with virulent A.veronii after 30 days post vaccination in tilapia. The result revealed a high level of mortality in the control, empty-polymeric nanovaccine and formalin killed bacterin vaccine groups. A high relative percentage survival (RPS) of vaccinated fish was noted with chitosan-polymer based nanovaccine. Our studies indicated that this chitosan-polymer based nanovaccine derived from cell fragments and supernatant was the improved version of the conventional formalin killed vaccine. The chitosan polymer based particle could increase the efficacy of nanovaccine toward the target mucosal membrane and enhance protection against A. veronii infection in red tilapia.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

For the coronavirus, bats are suspected to be the origin of the pandemic. Consequently, the spotlight has fallen on zoonotic diseases, and the focus now expands to organisms other than viruses. Microsporidia is a single-cell organism that can infect a wide range of hosts such as insects, mammals, and humans. Its pathogenicity differs among species, and host immunological status plays an important role in infectivity and disease severity. Disseminated disease from microsporidiosis can be fatal, especially among patients with a defective immune system. Recently, there were two Trachipleistophora hominis, a microsporidia species which can survive in insects, case reports in Thailand, one patient had disseminated microsporidiosis. This review gathered data of disseminated microsporidiosis and T. hominis infections in humans covering the biological and clinical aspects. There was a total of 22 cases of disseminated microsporidiosis reports worldwide. Ten microsporidia species were identified. Maximum likelihood tree results showed some possible correlations with zoonotic transmissions. For T. hominis, there are currently eight case reports in humans, seven of which had Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It is observed that risks are higher for the immunocompromised to acquire such infections, however, future studies should look into the entire life cycle, to identify the route of transmission and establish preventive measures, especially among the high-risk groups.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

This study discusses whether carbon nanotube (CNT) can be used as an additive to enhance bonding strength between concrete and CFRP. In this study, two CNT types: single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), were mixed with two different types of epoxies. CNTs were added at 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.00% by weight of epoxy to obtain the optimal performance. Single-shear test were conducted to investigate bonding behavior including bond strength, ultimate slip, effective bond length, bond stress-slip relationship, interfacial fracture energy, and crack formation between CFRP plate and concrete. The results showed that epoxy modified by 0.5% SWCNTs and 1.0% MWCNTs by weight of epoxy enhance the ultimate load and slip, bond strength, and interfacial fracture energy when compared to plain epoxy. However, high density epoxy modified with SWCNTs/MWCNTs showed diminished bonding properties.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether 5 sessions of acupuncture treatment is non-inferior to 10 sessions for migraine. Methods: We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial across five hospitals in Thailand. Migraine patients were randomly assigned into two groups: treatment with 5 sessions of acupuncture (group A) or 10 sessions of acupuncture (group B). Acupuncture was performed twice a week. We measured the number of migraine days, average pain severity according to a 0–10 numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, comparing 4 weeks after treatment versus baseline. Results: Of 156 patients, 83 and 73 patients were assigned to groups A and B, respectively. Comparing 4 weeks after treatment with baseline, the mean reduction in the number of headache days in groups A and B was 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8 to 7.9) days and 6.4 (95% CI 4.5 to 8.4) days, respectively (p = 0.97). The mean difference between the reduction in headache days of the two groups was −0.1 (95% CI −2.5 to 2.4) days, which included the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of −1. The mean reduction of NPRS scores in groups A and B was 4.5 (95% CI 3.8 to 5.1) and 3.8 (95% CI 3.1 to 4.5), respectively (p = 0.17). Both groups showed an improvement in quality of life. Conclusion: Both 5 and 10 sessions of acupuncture were associated with apparent benefits in terms of preventing migraine attacks, reducing the severity of the headache and improving quality of life, based on comparisons between baseline and follow-up in both study groups. Although we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of 5 sessions versus 10 sessions of acupuncture, the effects in the two groups were not significantly different and the temporal effects appeared to last for at least 1 month.

We describe the likelihood of cure after a peritonitis episode, exploring its association with various patient, peritonitis, and treatment characteristics. Study Design: Observational prospective cohort study. Setting & Participants: 1,631 peritonitis episodes (1,190 patients, 126 facilities) in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Exposure: Patient characteristics (demographics, patient history, laboratory values), peritonitis characteristics (organism category, concomitant exit-site infection), dialysis center characteristics (use of icodextrin and low glucose degradation product solutions, policies regarding antibiotic self-administration), and peritonitis treatment characteristics (antibiotic used). Outcome: Cure, defined as absence of death, transfer to hemodialysis (HD), PD catheter removal, relapse, or recurrent peritonitis within 50 days of a peritonitis episode. Analytical Approach: Mixed-effects logistic models. Results: Overall, 65% of episodes resulted in a cure. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for cure were similar across countries (range, 54%-68%), by age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes status. Compared with Gram-positive peritonitis, the odds of cure were lower for Gram-negative (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.30-0.57]), polymicrobial (AOR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.20-0.47]), and fungal (AOR, 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00-0.07]) peritonitis. Odds of cure were higher with automated PD versus continuous ambulatory PD (AOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.02-1.82]), facility icodextrin use (AOR per 10% greater icodextrin use, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.12]), empirical aminoglycoside use (AOR, 3.95 [95% CI, 1.23-12.68]), and ciprofloxacin use versus ceftazidime use for Gram-negative peritonitis (AOR, 5.73 [95% CI, 1.07-30.61]). Prior peritonitis episodes (AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.99]) and concomitant exit-site infection (AOR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.26-0.64]) were associated with a lower odds of cure. Limitations: Sample selection may be biased and generalizability may be limited. Residual confounding and confounding by indication limit inferences. Use of facility-level treatment variables may not capture patient-level treatments. Conclusions: Outcomes after peritonitis vary by patient characteristics, peritonitis characteristics, and modifiable peritonitis treatment practices. Differences in the odds of cure across infecting organisms and antibiotic regimens suggest that organism-specific treatment considerations warrant further investigation.",medical,Nephrology

Napier grass is a highly productive and effective lignocellulosic biomass, which is an important substrate of the second-generation biofuels. In addition, several processes are required in the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic materials; thus, co-culture fermentation can shorten the production process. This experimental research utilizes Trichoderma reesei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae co-culture fermentation in the bioethanol production of Napier grass using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation technology. To improve ethanol yield, Napier grass was pretreated with 3% (w/w) sodium hydroxide. An orthogonal experimental design was employed to optimize the Napier grass content, mixed crude co-culture loading, and incubation time for maximum bioethanol production. The results showed that pretreatment increased cellulose contents from 52.85% to 82%. The optimal fermentation condition was 15 g Napier grass, 15 g mixed crude co-culture, and 7 days incubation time, which maximizes the bioethanol yield of 16.90 g/L. Furthermore, the fermentation was upscaled 20-fold, and experiments were performed with and without supplemented sugar using laboratory-scale optimal fermentation conditions. The novelty of this research lies in the use of a mixed crude co-culture of T. reesei and S. cerevisiae to produce bioethanol from Napier grass with the maximum bioethanol concentration of 25.02 and 33.24 g/L under unadded and added sugar conditions and to reduce operational step and capital costs.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous)"

Heat treatment processes were then carried out. The size, circularity and the area fraction of the gamma prime phase were characterized via scanning electron microscopy after solution treatment, precipitation aging and long-term heating processes. The addition of ruthenium seems to provide a stronger effect than adding rhenium by increasing the area fraction of the gamma prime phase after precipitation aging. Furthermore, rhenium and/or ruthenium additions maintain the precipitation of the gamma prime particles in a cubic shape. For phase stability analyses, the alloys were subsequently heated at 1173 K in intervals up to 1080 ks. The study showed that the coarsening rate of γ′ particles can be significantly retarded with the addition of rhenium and/or ruthenium, and topologically close-packed phase can occur with excessive rhenium addition. In addition, the highest addition of ruthenium content in this study strongly exhibited high gamma prime phase stability. Thus, increasing the content of ruthenium and decreasing the content of rhenium can inhibit the formation of the topologically close-packed phase.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Proteins belonging to the family of ESAT-6 secretion (Esx) systems play critical roles in the virulence of most pathogenic mycobacterial species and are associated with drug resistance. However, no clinical applications can detect and discriminate the expression of species-specific variants of these proteins in clinical samples, such as early growth cultures, for rapid diagnosis of specific mycobacterial infections, which may require distinct interventions. Conventional immunoassay approaches are not suitable for this purpose due to the significant degree of conservation of Esx proteins among species. Herein we describe the development of a novel immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry assay that can distinguish Esx proteins that are expressed by slow-growing mycobacterial species commonly detected in clinical isolates. This approach uses custom antibodies raised against single semi-conserved peptide regions in M. tuberculosis (Mtb) EsxB and EsxN to capture corresponding peptides from protein orthologs of mycobacteria associated with human respiratory infections, including Mtb, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii, M. gordonae, and M. marinum, to detect these species in standard clinical cultures at the first sign mycobacterial growth to allow rapid disease diagnosis.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

As such, PA+CA produced more dominant biofilms on the pulmonary epithelial surface (NCI-H292) (confocal fluorescent extracellular matrix staining) with dominant psl upregulation, as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), after 8 h of experiments than PA alone. With a proteomic analysis, rhamnosyltransferase RhlB protein (Psl-associated quorum-sensing protein) was found to be among the high-abundance proteins in PA+CA than in PA biofilms, supporting psl-mediated biofilms in PA+CA on the cell surface. Additionally, PA+CA increased supernatant cytokines (IL-8 and IL-13, but not TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) with a similar upregulation of TLR-4, TLR-5, and TLR-9 (by PCR) compared with PA-stimulated cells. The intratracheal administration of PA+CA induced a greater severity of sepsis (serum creatinine, alanine transaminase, serum cytokines, and histology score) and prominent biofilms (fluorescent staining) with psl upregulation (PCR). In comparison with PA+CA biofilms on glass slides, PA+CA biofilms on biotic surfaces were more prominent (fluorescent staining). In conclusion, PA+CA induced Psl-predominant biofilms on the pulmonary cell surface and in mice with acute pneumonia, and these biofilms were more prominent than those induced by PA alone, highlighting the impact of Candida on rapid interkingdom biofilm production.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The PEC membranes were used as separators in a two-compartment setup where ANI monomer and ammonium persulfate (APS) oxidant diffused through the membranes to form polyaniline (PANI). APS and ANI having different distributions throughout the membranes, the reaction led to the asymmetric polymerization of PANI on one face of each PEC membrane thus producing Janus membranes. Due to the excess PANI content, the membrane displayed distinct asymmetric electrical conductivities on each face. Interestingly, very different ANI polymerizations were obtained when nonstoichiometric PEC membranes having different molar ratio of cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes (P+:P− represents PDADMAC:PSS) were used and transport of APS was fastest through the 2:1 PEC when compared to the 1:2 PEC. In all experiments, the polymerization was most intense on the ANI side of the membranes. Also, the influence of NaCl both during PEC fabrication and during polymerization was studied and found to have some effect on the solute permeability. Results showed that a higher content of PANI was formed on PEC membranes having excess P+ and with no NaCl added during PEC fabrication. Although X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of PANI on both sides of each membrane, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that both sides of each membrane had different PANI content deposited. Electrical conductivity measurements using a four-point probe setup also showed that the PEC–PANI exhibits asymmetric electrical property on different sides. © 2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Analyses included Wilcoxon-Ranks and multivariate logistic analysis. Most of 408 respondents supported ATI trials, with slightly higher approval of, and willingness to participate in, trials using time to rebound versus sustained viremia criteria. Less than half of respondents anticipated disclosing trial participation to partners and over half indicated uncertainty or unwillingness about whether partners would be willing to use PrEP. Willingness to participate was higher among those who rated higher trial approval, lower anticipated burden, and those expecting to make the decision independently.

In terms of pain control, intraoperative regional anesthesia and postoperative opioid-sparing analgesia are recommended. For open spine surgery, we aimed to combine thoracic epidural analgesia to reduce pain and opioid-related side effects, thereby hastening recovery. PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the length of hospital stay after open complete laminectomy with fusion between general anesthesia and combined general anesthesia involving a single thoracic epidural injection. DESIGN: A randomized single-blinded controlled study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-eight patients scheduled for elective open laminectomy with fusion between I and III levels were selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: LOS, postoperative pain, patient-controlled morphine consumption at 24 hours, patient satisfaction score, and other opioid-related side effects were recorded. METHODS: Patients were randomly selected to receive standard general anesthesia (GA) or GA combined with a single-shot thoracic epidural at T11–T12 or T12–L1, a block with 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, and 4 mg of morphine. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic variables between groups. LOS was significantly lower in the combined epidural and/or GA than in the control group (3.78±0.81 [mean±standard deviation] and 4.79±1.51 days, respectively; p=.017). Numeric rating score (at rest) at the post-anesthesia care unit, 24 hours postoperative morphine consumption (mg), operating time, and blood loss were significantly lower in the epidural group. Patients who received combined epidural and/or GA were more likely to report higher patient satisfaction (p=.008). However, the incidence of intraoperative hypotension was significantly higher in the epidural group (72.2% vs. 21.1%, p=.003). The incidences of adverse events and surgical field rating scores did not differ between the 2 patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined lower thoracic epidural and/or GA in patients undergoing elective lumbar spine surgery was associated with decreased LOS.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Neurology (clinical)"

Machine learning methods for traffic prediction usually treat traffic conditions as time-series due to obvious temporal patterns. Recently, spatial relationships among roads in a road network have also been used to improve traffic prediction. This study proposes a novel method to predict traffic conditions such as speed using a graph convolutional neural network with a spectral adjacency matrix (GCN-Spectral). Unlike a spatial adjacency matrix representing physical connections between road segments, a spectral matrix represents the correlation between road segments in terms of traffic conditions. The GCN-Spectral model is evaluated by comparing with a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP), as a non-spatial model, and a graph convolutional neural network with a spatial adjacency matrix (GCN-Spatial). The data used in this study are GPS probe data collected from taxis in Bangkok. Empirical results show that the GCN-Spectral with a combination matrix model mostly outperforms GCN-Spatial models in the Bangkok dataset. However, MLP performs the best in most cases.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, decision sciences, sociology","Management Information Systems, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management, Management Science and Operations Research, Education, Communication"

The results from PLS-SEM from the responses of 423 consumers show that the perceived functional value significantly impacts ethical concern and consumer purchase intention. The perceived emotional value is also positively correlated with ethical concern but showed no correlation with consumer purchase intention. However, the influence of the perceived social value on ethical concern and purchase intention was not supported. Meanwhile, the ethical concern is a strong predictor of green purchase intention which mediates a positive relationship between functional value and intention, as well as between emotional value and intention. However, no mediation effect was found between ethical concern and social value. These findings offer contributions toward extending the knowledge on how these multidimensional consumer values coincide and influence behavioral intention. This research makes a practical contribution to industry practitioners and policymakers to promote green product attributes by linking functional and emotional perceptions with ethical considerations such as fair trade, cruelty-free and green formulation, eco-labeling, and green packaging, which may in turn increase purchase intention toward green cosmetics and personal care products that could induce a more sustainable production and consumption pattern.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

In this work, C/C composite xerogel electrodes possessing trimodal structure were prepared from resorcinol, formaldehyde, and cotton fibers. Sufficiently high carbonization temperatures had to be reached to obtain electrodes possessing high electrical double layer capacitance. The addition of cotton fibers lowered effective carbonization temperatures and created macropores, which facilitated transport of carbonization gases and heat transfer in pores located deep in the samples. Cotton fibers also prevented collapse of mesopores during vacuum drying. Samples with cotton fibers added had 27–40% more mesopore volume.

As a result, advanced thermochemical technologies, such as catalytic pyrolysis, have become a promising approach to solve plastic waste management issues. This work aims to assess inexpensive catalysts derived from waste biomass for pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste for high-value products. Conventional thermal pyrolysis at high temperatures, i.e. 800 °C only increased the gas yield (up to 52 wt% from the 32 wt% obtained at 500 °C) but had no significant effect on the proportion of individual compounds in the gas fraction. A two-stage catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste at 600 °C (first stage) combined with biochar catalyst held isothermally at 800 °C (second stage) significantly enhanced the cracking process compared to thermal pyrolysis. In presence of the biochar catalyst, the gas yield increased up to 85 wt% mainly by an increase in the yield of hydrogen (from 0.2 wt% to 3.3 wt%) and methane (from 1.4 wt% to 55 wt%).

Prolonged use of corticosteroids can cause numerous adverse effects and may decrease progression-free survival among patients treated with ICPis. We sought to determine whether a shorter duration of corticosteroids was equally efficacious and safe as compared with a longer duration. Methods We used data from an international multicenter cohort study of patients diagnosed with ICPi-AKI from 29 centers across nine countries. We examined whether a shorter duration of corticosteroids (28 days or less) was associated with a higher rate of recurrent ICPi-AKI or death within 30 days following completion of corticosteroid treatment as compared with a longer duration (29-84 days). Results Of 165 patients treated with corticosteroids, 56 (34%) received a shorter duration of treatment and 109 (66%) received a longer duration. Patients in the shorter versus longer duration groups were similar with respect to baseline and ICPi-AKI characteristics. Five of 56 patients (8.9%) in the shorter duration group and 12 of 109 (11%) in the longer duration group developed recurrent ICPi-AKI or died (p=0.90). Nadir serum creatinine in the first 14, 28, and 90 days following completion of corticosteroid treatment was similar between groups (p=0.40, p=0.56, and p=0.89, respectively). Conclusion A shorter duration of corticosteroids (28 days or less) may be safe for patients with ICPi-AKI. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Oncology, Pharmacology, Cancer Research"

This study aims to report the cascade of care (CoC) for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among people living with HIV receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: Patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database Low Intensity Transfer (TAHOD-LITE) cohort, on ART, and with follow-up data from 2010 to 2019 were included. Patients were determined as positive for HCV or HBV co-infection if they ever tested positive for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) or HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), respectively. Results: In total, 39% (8612/22 340) of the adult HIV cohort had undergone HBsAg testing, with 8% (672/8612) testing positive. HBV CoC demonstrated that 71% (474/672) of those with HBsAg positive results initiated treatment, 67% (318/474) of those on treatment had HBV DNA testing to evaluate treatment progression, and 18% (58/318) of those tested reached viral suppression. Of the cohort, 37% (8231/22 340) had anti-HCV testing, of whom 10% (779/8231) tested positive. The HCV CoC showed that 68% (526/779) of those with positive anti-HCV tests had HCV RNA tests, of whom 51% (267/526) had detectable HCV RNA. Among those with detectable HCV RNA, 65% (174/267) initiated HCV treatment. Of the 40% (69/174) who initiated HCV treatment, 90% (62/69) reached sustained virological response. Conclusion: Our findings identified less frequent testing in the healthcare system and limited access to treatment as gaps in the CoC for viral hepatitis. More routine HCV RNA and HBV DNA testing is required for patients with positive screening tests to identify those in need of treatment.",medical,"Health Policy, Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"
"Lowered Quality of Life in Long COVID Is Predicted by Affective Symptoms, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Inflammation and Neuroimmunotoxic Pathways","Maes M., Al-Rubaye H.T., Almulla A.F., Al-Hadrawi D.S., Stoyanova K., Kubera M., Al-Hakeim H.K.",2022-08-01,"Affective Symptoms, Biomarkers, Calcium, COVID-19, Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic, Female, Humans, Inflammation, Quality of Life, depression, depression, inflammation, Long COVID, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, neuro-immune, psychiatry","The physio-affective phenome of Long COVID-19 is predicted by (a) immune-inflammatory biomarkers of the acute infectious phase, including peak body temperature (PBT) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), and (b) the subsequent activation of immune and oxidative stress pathways during Long COVID. The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.","medicalcal geography, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

MXene and AuNPs increase the surface area of conductive thread electrode and facilitate anti-cortisol immobilization leading to enhanced sensor sensitivity. Anti-cortisol is immobilized on L-cys/AuNPs/MXene modified electrode by using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide coupling agents. The electrochemical detection of cortisol is based on the decrease of oxidation current towards the antigen-antibody binding interaction owing to blocking of electron transfer process by cortisol. Under the optimal conditions, this immunosensor offers high sensitivity, a wide linearity of 5–180 ng mL−1 and a detection limit of 0.54 ng mL−1 with negligible effect from interferences. Furthermore, this immunosensor provides high reproducibility and long-term storage stability (≥6 weeks). Ultimately, this system is successfully applied for the detection of cortisol in artificial sweat with satisfactory results. Hence, this platform might be suitable to apply as a wearable electrochemical sensor for sweat cortisol by integrating on a wristband.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Angklung, an Indonesian musical instrument, has been used for music activities for the elderly in Thailand with the hand signs method. Unfortunately, music activity is not widely used because the experts with the hand sign skills are few and not enough for demanding in the aging healthcare. At the same time, technologies of remote systems using the Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed to assist the elderly in supporting and improving their quality of life. This paper will introduce 'Angklung Smart Band,' an IoT-based system to support Angklung music activities for the elderly in Thailand. This work aims at setting up Angklung music activities for the elderly by using technology instead of hand signs. The system is composed of a web application, IoT devices, and Angklung musical instruments connected together via a wireless network. We did a preliminary study with the experts to improve experiences and system performance. After that, we asked the music experts to use the smart band to conduct the music activities experiment with the elderly for three days and give us feedback. The results found that the smart band could assist the Angklung music experts and help with the shortage of music expertise in aged care facilities or nursing homes.","fluidex; related topics, Business, decision sciences, engineering, sociology","Management of Technology and Innovation, Information Systems and Management, Engineering (miscellaneous), Development, Transportation, Urban Studies"

Correlation analyses indicated a relationship between specific CGAs, antioxidant activities and color parameters among coffees. PLS analysis revealed that the high contents of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in green coffees did not correlate with antioxidant activities. Results from CGAs contents and PCA analysis provided a linkage to previous research relating important components and quality indices of both green and roasted coffees as affected by postharvest drying.

We aimed to identify HCC surveillance barriers from both physician's and patient's perspectives and assess the effectiveness of physician education using social networks. A nationwide survey with 513 physicians and another single-center survey with 315 HCC-risk patients were conducted. Barriers to suboptimal surveillance were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. We educated 143 physicians by sending brief notes on HCC surveillance guidelines via social networks and re-evaluated their knowledge after 60 days using t test. Surveys showed 458 (86.3%), 254 (47.8%), and 225 (42.4%) physicians recommended surveillance in patients with cirrhosis, at-risk hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infection, respectively. Only 228 (42.9%) and 241 (38.0%) respondents adhered to recommended surveillance tools and interval, respectively. The main surveillance barriers among physicians were the lack of knowledge and resource limitations. The lack of a doctor's prescription was identified as a major barrier by patient' perspectives (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8, P = .024). Education via social networks enhanced physicians' knowledge, with pre-and post-education scores for guideline awareness of 63.0% versus 84.3% (P < .001) and for surveillance indication and tools of 40.0% versus 63.0% (P = .001), and 42.0% versus 59.3% (P = .015), respectively.

Tilapia Lake Virus was not detected in non-tilapine species within tilapia polyculture systems of Bangladesh,"Debnath P.P., Dinh-Hung N., Taengphu S., Nguyen V.V., Delamare-Deboutteville J., Senapin S., Vishnumurthy Mohan C., Dong H.T., Rodkhum C.",2022-01-01,"Animals, Bangladesh, Cichlids, Fish Diseases, RNA Viruses, Tilapia, Bangladesh, carp species, nile tilapia, polyculture, susceptibility, TiLV, walking catfish","Sixteen countries, including Bangladesh, have reported the presence of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), an emerging tilapia pathogen. Fish polyculture is a common farming practice in Bangladesh. Some unusual mortalities reported in species co-cultivated with TiLV-infected tilapia led us to investigate whether any of the co-cultivated species would also test positive for TiLV and whether they were susceptible to TiLV infection under controlled laboratory experiments. Using 183 samples obtained from 15 farms in six districts across Bangladesh, we determined that 20% of the farms tested positive for TiLV in tilapia, while 15 co-cultivated fish species and seven other invertebrates (e.g. insects and crustaceans) considered potential carriers all tested negative. Of the six representative fish species experimentally infected with TiLV, only Nile tilapia showed the typical clinical signs of the disease, with 70% mortality within 12 days. By contrast, four carp species and one catfish species challenged with TiLV showed no signs of TiLV infection. Challenged tilapia were confirmed as TiLV-positive by RT-qPCR, while challenged carp and walking catfish all tested negative. Overall, our field and laboratory findings indicate that species used in polycultures are not susceptible to TiLV. Although current evidence suggests that TiLV is likely host-specific to tilapia, targeted surveillance for TiLV in other fish species in polyculture systems should continue, in order to prepare for a possible future scenario where TiLV mutates and/or adapts to new host(s).","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

Genetic defects underlying different complete blood count (CBC) alterations remain to be defined. Objective: We aimed to evaluate mutations and impacts on abnormal blood counts in MDS and MDS/MPN. Method: MDS and MDS/MPN patients were recruited and sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing. Clinical parameters, especially CBC, were evaluated for the association with genetic abnormalities and clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 168 patients with myeloid neoplasms were recruited (92 cases of low-risk MDS, 57 cases of high-risk MDS and 19 cases of MDS/MPN). Compared to low-risk MDS and MDS/MPN, patients with high-risk MDS were presented with more severe neutropenia with 17.5% showing absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) lower than 0.5 × 109/L. Patients with MDS/MPN more commonly harboured mutations and had a higher number of mutations per case than low-risk MDS (94.7% vs. 56.5%; p < 0.001 and 3 vs. 1; p < 0.001, respectively).

The cross-linking was activated by means of an acetylating agent comprising isopropenyl acetate (IPA) to form a cross-linking mixture (CLM). The cross-linking was confirmed by FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and the esterification reactions were further studied using model compounds. When the KL lignin was mixed with the CLM, partial esterification occurred to yield a homogeneous viscous liquid that could easily be poured into a mold, as the first step in the procedure. Without any additions, the mold was heated and the material transformed into a thermoset by reaction of the two carboxylic acid-derivatives of AdA and KL in the second step.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, Materials Science, energy","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Energy (all)"

The aim of this mechanistic review is to examine: (a) the role of redox-sensitive transcription factors and enzymes, ROS/RNS production, and the activity of cellular antioxidants in the activation and performance of macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer cells; (b) the involvement of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), paraoxonase-1 (PON1), and oxidized phospholipids in regulating the immune response; and (c) the detrimental effects of hypernitrosylation and chronic nitro-oxidative stress on the immune response. The redox changes during immune-inflammatory responses are orchestrated by the actions of nuclear factor-κB, HIF1α, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. The performance and survival of individual immune cells is under redox control and depends on intracellular and extracellular levels of ROS/RNS. They are heavily influenced by cellular antioxidants including the glutathione and thioredoxin systems, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and the HDL/ApoA1/PON1 complex. Chronic nitro-oxidative stress and hypernitrosylation inhibit the activity of those antioxidant systems, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial functions, and the metabolism of immune cells. In conclusion, redox-associated mechanisms modulate metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, macrophage and T helper cell polarization, phagocytosis, production of pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokines, immune training and tolerance, chemotaxis, pathogen sensing, antiviral and antibacterial effects, Toll-like receptor activity, and endotoxin tolerance.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

C. odorata extracts, 0–20% weight by volume (w/v), in 20% (w/v) gelatin solutions, were spun at an operating voltage of 8 kV and flow rate of 0.5 mL/h. The distance between the needle tip and collector was fixed at 10 cm. The average diameters of the electro-spun fibers obtained did not exhibit significant difference when the concentration of the C. odorata extract was equal to or less than 10% (w/v). This was true in the case of both cross-linked and uncross-linked fibers with 0.04% (w/w) glutaraldehyde. The average diameters of the fibers obtained increased significantly when the concentration of the C. odorata extract was increased from 10% to 20% (w/v). All the uncross-linked fibers had smaller average diameters than those of the cross-linked fibers under all conditions. An increase in the C. odorata content of the fibers provided more hydrophilicity to the fiber surfaces. The novel finding from this study was that the gelatin fibers fabricated with C. odorata extract exhibited 180 times greater water adsorption than those of the commercial healing and covering films used presently. Moreover, all the fibers collected showed excellent antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, but not against the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Materials Science (miscellaneous), Polymers and Plastics, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The main obstacles consisted of low productivity and cell viability. In this work, the immobilization technique was applied to improve cell culture over the free cell fermentation. Three types of carbonized biomass, cassava rhizome charcoal (CRC), bamboo charcoal (BC), and coconut shell activated carbon (CSAC), were selected and used as carriers for the immobilization of Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026. They were characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to expose their surface and chemical properties. The results pointed out that the immobilized cell onto BC can produce butanol higher than the free cell while lessened by 8.7% and 19.7% in CRC and CSAC, respectively. However, CRC showed the highest cell efficiency after eight sequential reuse cycles. The improvement in butanol production is due to the surface area and the pore size of each of the carbonized materials. This work revealed the potential of carbonized biomass as a carrier, which can result in repeated inoculum and improved cell viability.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

"Sericin-mediated improvement of dysmorphic cardiac mitochondria from hypercholesterolaemia is associated with maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, energy production, and mitochondrial structure","Rujimongkon K., Ampawong S., Isarangkul D., Reamtong O., Aramwit P.",2022-01-01,"Animals, Hypercholesterolemia, Mitochondria, Mitochondrial Dynamics, Proteomics, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Sericins, cocoon, heart, mitochondrial proteome, proteomics, Silkworm","Context: Sericin is a component protein in the silkworm cocoon [Bombyx mori Linnaeus (Bombycidae)] that improves dysmorphic cardiac mitochondria under hypercholesterolemic conditions. This is the first study to explore cardiac mitochondrial proteins associated with sericin treatment. Objective: To investigate the mechanism of action of sericin in cardiac mitochondria under hypercholesterolaemia. Materials and methods: Hypercholesterolaemia was induced in Wistar rats by feeding them 6% cholesterol-containing chow for 6 weeks. The hypercholesterolemic rats were separated into 2 groups (n = 6 for each): the sericin-treated (1,000 mg/kg daily) and nontreated groups. The treatment conditions were maintained for 4 weeks prior to cardiac mitochondria isolation. The mitochondrial structure was evaluated by immunolabeling electron microscopy, and differential mitochondrial protein expression was determined and quantitated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Results: A 32.22 ± 2.9% increase in the percent striated area of cardiac muscle was observed in sericin-treated hypercholesterolemic rats compared to the nontreatment group (4.18 ± 1.11%). Alterations in mitochondrial proteins, including upregulation of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and reduction of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit (NDUFS1) expression, are correlated with a reduction in mitochondrial apoptosis under sericin treatment. Differential proteomic observation also revealed that sericin may improve mitochondrial energy production by upregulating acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1) and NADH dehydrogenase 1α subcomplex subunit 10 (NDUFA10) expression. Discussion and conclusions: Sericin treatment could improve the dysmorphic mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and energy production of cardiac mitochondria under hypercholesterolaemia. These results suggest that sericin may be an alternative treatment molecule that is related to cardiac mitochondrial abnormalities.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

To control the potential risk of viral infection through contaminated waters, a rapid, reliable tool to assess the infectivity of pathogenic viruses is required. Recently, an advanced approach (i.e., capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR) was developed to discriminate intact viruses (potentially infectious) from inactivated viruses. In this approach, samples were pretreated with capsid integrity reagents (e.g., monoazide dyes or metal compounds) before (RT −)qPCR. These reagents can only penetrate inactivated viruses with compromised capsids to bind to viral genomes and prevent their amplification, but they cannot enter viruses with intact capsids. Therefore, only viral genomes of intact viruses were amplified or detected by (RT-)qPCR after capsid integrity treatment. In this study, we reviewed recent progress in the development and application of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR to assess the potential infectivity of viruses (including non-enveloped and enveloped viruses with different genome structures [RNA and DNA]) in water. The efficiency of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR has been shown to depend on various factors, such as conditions of integrity reagent treatment, types of viruses, environmental matrices, and the capsid structure of viruses after disinfection treatments (e.g., UV, heat, and chlorine). For the application of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR in real-world samples, the use of suitable virus concentration methods and process controls is important to control the efficiency of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR. In addition, potential future applications of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR for determining the mechanism of disinfection treatment on viral structure (e.g., capsid or genome) and a combination of capsid integrity treatment and next-generation sequencing (NGS) (capsid integrity NGS) for monitoring the community of intact pathogenic viruses in water are also discussed. This review provides essential information on the application of capsid integrity (RT-)qPCR as an efficient tool for monitoring the presence of pathogenic viruses with intact capsids in water.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Emergency repairs can be accomplished using zirconia primer, adhesive agent, and resin composite when the fracture of zirconia exposes the zirconia framework. Phosphate-containing primers play an important role in zirconia surface treatment. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of multiple applications of phosphate-containing primer on shear bond strength between zirconia and resin composite. In this case, 78 zirconia discs were sandblasted by alumina particles; the zirconia was then randomized into six groups for single application and multiple applications of phosphate-containing primer according follows; group 1: no application, group 2: one application, group 3: two applications, group 4: three applications, group 5: four applications, and group 6: five applications. Adhesive was applied on the zirconia surface and the resin composite was bonded. Shear bond strength was assessed using a universal testing machine. The de-bonded surface was examined using a stereomicroscope. The shear bond strengths were statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni. Group 1 had the lowest shear bond strength with a significant difference compared to groups 2–6, whereas group 4 had the highest shear bond strength, with no significant difference compared to groups 5–6. The failure mode revealed 100% adhesive failure in all groups. In conclusion, to maximize shear bond strength at zirconia and resin composite interfaces, sandblasted zirconia surfaces should be treated with three applications of phosphate-containing primer prior to the adhesive agent.","chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Although the major bottleneck faced by fermentation was the attainment of dilute propionic acid, the reactive extraction technique was proven experimentally for its effective recovery of dilute acid. Therefore, to promote the commercial production of propionic acid via fermentation, an optimal process design and process evaluations in terms of economics, energy requirement, and CO2equivalent emissions are required, which could be thoroughly assessed using process simulation. According to the simulated results, the bio-based production is economically attractive-the best production scenario provides an NPV of 118 million USD, a % IRR of 18.2%, and a payout period of 7.12 years. Furthermore, the bio-based production results in substantially less CO2emissions with a 34% reduction when compared to the petroleum-based production. Thus, the shift of propionic acid production from petroleum-based to bio-based could be promoted given the effectiveness of the acid-recovery technique and less CO2emissions as demonstrated in this study.","mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The model is a critical state soil model extended for unsaturated soils using Bishop's effective stress tensor, the state boundary surface (SBS) moving with the change in the degree of saturation, and a rational soil-water characteristic curve that takes account of density and hydraulic hysteresis. Comparisons with published experimental data validate the proposed model. The simulation results show that the model adequately captures the hydraulic collapse behavior under both isotropic and anisotropic stress conditions. The effects of density, mean net stress, and deviatoric stress on the hydraulic collapse behavior are further investigated through a parametric calculation, and the mechanics of the wetting–induced instability are discussed. The effects of suction history, namely repeated wetting and drying cycles, on the deformation and failure, are also presented. The proposed model provides a validated method for modeling hydromechanical collapse in unsaturated soil and provides a better understanding of the mechanisms involved.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science, earth sciences","Computational Mechanics, Materials Science (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanics of Materials"

This study focuses on Digit Backward Span (DBS) and Digit Forward Span (DFS), subtests related to the cognitive attention domain in MoCA. We develop a model and identify the most relevant speech features for the domain from a recorded voice from these subtests in the Thai MoCA. We rank features by their importance and found that using a subset of important features has higher predictive power than using the entire feature set in impairment in the attention domain. The most important features in both tests are the median duration of voice and the duration of voice.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Information Systems, Software, Decision Sciences (miscellaneous), Information Systems and Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications"

Biorefineries, like petro-based refineries, offer a green and sustainable option for producing marketable biobased goods through decarbonization pathways, hence upgrading the bioeconomy. In the context of the industrial revolution, economic and environmental sustainability are critical in adopting biorefinery systems. However, biorefineries still face numerous hurdles. There are numerous technological, economic, ecological, sociological and long-term issues throughout the biorefinery production chain. The key difficulties facing biorefineries today are acceptance in the present market of the ‘fossil-based economy’, the composition and availability of feedstock, the quantities needed to meet the market demand, the efficiency of the resource recovery, techno-economic viability and sustainability. Life cycle assessment may provide a thorough input on the environmental setting during process optimization, minimizing the biorefinery project's environmental impact. In this review, we outline the bottlenecks and obstacles that biorefineries face while producing biofuels from biomass, as well as how biotechnology and modern technology might help researchers to overcome them. Biorefineries need to optimize their biomass usage to generate products that properly fit the market expectations. These items should be cost-effective when compared with fossil fuels. Currently, 85–90% of petroleum refinery output is used to make fuels, with only 10–15% going to the petrochemical industry to make organic compounds. To precisely match market demands, the biorefinery should produce the same proportion of fuels and organic compounds. To overcome the challenges, biofermentation, membrane technologies and oxidation processes, among other developing technologies, are drawing interest in several areas of biorefinery. Biorefinery systems necessitate a systematic process for identifying impacts and assessing their long-term viability. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, energy","Bioengineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Full-thickness biopsies of PE skin and uninvolved (UN) skin were obtained from psoriasis patients for RNA-seq. Several potential differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PE skin compared to those in the UN skin were identified. These DEGs enhanced functions such as angiogenesis, growth of epithelial tissue, chemotaxis and homing of cells, growth of connective tissues, and degranulation of myeloid cells beneath the PE skin. Moreover, the canonical pathways of IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-22 signaling were enriched by the DEGs. Finally, we proposed that inflammation in the PE skin might be driven by the IL-36/TLR9 axis or IL-6/Th17 axis and potentiated by IL-36α, IL-36γ, IL-17C, IL-8, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, S100A15, SERPINB4, and hBD-2.

In this work, two different synthesis methods (sol-gel and incipient wetness impregnation) were used to synthesize iron oxide supported on silica catalysts (Fe2O3/SiO2) with metal loadings ranging from 0.5 to 10 %wt. The catalysts were tested for the selective oxidation of H2S, changing the operating conditions like O2/H2S (0.5–2.5), temperature (170–250°C), and water content (0–50%). The optimum condition was O2/H2S = 0.5 and no water at 230 °C with the conversion of approximately 100%, the selectivity of 97%, and the deactivation of 0.6%. A detailed characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts’ surface revealed the presence of four deactivation mechanisms: metal surface reduction, oxygen vacancy loss, pore plugging, and sintering. Among the observed deactivation mechanisms, the sintering showed the highest impact on catalytic activity and deactivation. The sol-gel catalysts (SG) showed the highest metal-oxide/support interaction, which reduced the metal-oxide nanoparticles sintering compared with the incipient wetness impregnation method (IWI), reporting a lower sintering, higher activity, and selectivity, lower deactivation rates and lower sensitivity to the operating conditions.

Napabucasin (NB), a phytochemical compound, has been reported as potential anti-cancer agent, however, Akt and mTOR targeting mechanisms remain unclear. Method: Apoptosis induction was investigated by Hoechst 33342/PI double staining and annexin V/PI staining with flowcytometry. Autophagy was evaluated by monodansylcadaverine staining and Western blot analysis. Binding affinity of NB and essential signaling proteins (PI3K, Akt, and mTOR) was investigated using molecular docking and confirmed by Western blot analysis. Result: A structure modification from changing methyl moiety of acetyl group of NB to hydroxyl moiety of carboxyl group of NB derivative (napabucasin-acid or NB-acid) greatly affected the compound activities. NB showed more potent anti-cancer activity. NB reduced cell viability with an approximately 20 times lower IC50 and inhibited the colony formation capacity much more than NB-acid treated cells. NB induced cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by decrease Bcl‑2 and Mcl-1 and clevage of PARP, while NB-acid show lesser effect on Mcl-1. NB was found to strongly induce autophagy indicated by acidic vesicle staining and the LC3B conversion. Interestingly, computational molecular docking analysis further demonstrated that NB directly bound to Akt and mTOR (complex 1 and 2) proteins at their critical sites indicating that NB targets the upstream regulators of apoptosis and autophagy. The docking results were confirmed by decrease of p-Akt/Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR, and c-Myc a downstream target of Akt protein levels. Conclusion: Results show for the first time that NB exerts an anti-cancer activity through the direct interaction to Akt and mTOR proteins. The methyl moiety of acetyl group of NB is required for its potent anti-cancer activities. These data encourage further development of NB compounds for Akt and mTOR driven cancers.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

However, the optimal timepoint for vaccination in pregnancy to afford maximal protection to newborns is yet to be elucidated. This multi-country analysis aimed to model the impact of timing of vaccination during pregnancy on infant antibody titers at birth. Methods: A multi-country analysis on a cohort of mother-infant pairs (n=698) vaccinated between 19.6-37.1 weeks gestation was conducted. Data taken from four parent studies on pertussis vaccination during pregnancy were modelled using natural cubic splines and linear mixed models to study the association of both gestational age at vaccination and the interval between vaccination and delivery with pertussis-specific cord blood antibody levels after pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. Results: Term born infants on average achieve the highest antibody levels at birth if women are vaccinated before 31 weeks’ gestation. When considering both term and preterm deliveries, an interval of at least 7.5 weeks between vaccination and delivery is required to achieve the highest cord blood antibody levels. The models show that vaccinating earlier than these timeframes will also provide the infant with equally high antibody levels at birth. Conclusions: Vaccinating in the second and early third trimester results in the highest antibody levels at birth. Vaccinating earlier within this window is needed to provide equal benefits to both term and preterm born infants.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The data controller must gain explicit consent from the data subject before collecting and processing the data. Hence, consent management is an essential component of a software system. This research proposes a set of formal models for consent management that take Privacy by Design (PbD) into account. We used the Event-B method to formalize the proposed models close to a real system. The Rodin platform proved each Event-B model to be corrected and deadlock-free. We also described how developers could transform Event-B models into the actual codes and demonstrated this result by mapping Event-B models into class diagrams. The proposed models meet consent compliance and privacy awareness requirements. In particular, the models cover certain aspects of privacy, including managing the consent of data subjects and controlling authorized access based on the data subject's consent.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Software, Theoretical Computer Science, Logic, Computational Theory and Mathematics"
International Remittances and Women’s Reproductive Health Care: Evidence from Pakistan,"Mahmood T., Kumar R., Rehman A.U., Pongpanich S.",2022-01-01,"Delivery of Health Care, Female, Humans, Pakistan, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Pregnancy, Reproductive Health, Socioeconomic Factors, Health care decision making, mother health care utilization, Pakistan, propensity score matching, remittances","This paper determines the effect of international remittances on the healthcare utilization of childbearing mothers in Pakistan using the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) survey, 2018–19. The study reports a significant and positive effect of international remittances on the healthcare outcomes of childbearing mothers. Importantly, the remittance-receiving households have 0.615, 0.208 and 0.306 times the odds of the non-receiving households, utilizing prenatal healthcare, postnatal healthcare, and healthcare decision making, respectively, and all of them are statistically significant. Consequently, the analysis confirms that remittance receiving-households do in fact influence and increase the likelihood of utilizing prenatal healthcare, postnatal healthcare and decisions about medical treatment for women. As regression-based estimation of remittances is prone to selection bias due to the nature of the non-experimental data set, we also used propensity score matching methods, which also confirmed a significant and positive effect of international remittances on healthcare outcomes of the childbearing mothers. Thus, financial support or social development programs by the government or non-governmental organization are pivotal in enhancing the healthcare outcomes and ultimately the living standards of childbearing mothers.","medical, Health Professions","Health Informatics, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health Information Management"

Fecal samples (n = 1,475) were collected from ducks over a 6-month period. Overall, the detection rate of S. enterica was 5.4% and the highest fecal shedding rate was noted in 4-day-old ducklings (28.8%). Then, S. enterica shedding decreased to 10, 8, 4.7, and 0.7% when ducks reached the ages of 10 d, 17 d, 3 wk, and 4 wk, respectively. Seventy-nine isolates were recovered and Salmonella Amsterdam was the predominant serovar (79.7%). With respect to colistin-resistant E. coli, mcr-positive E. coli (colistin MICs = 8–16 μg/mL) was noted in ducks at the ages of 16 wk (6.0%) and 24 wk (18.7%). mcr-1 was the most common (75.7%), followed by mcr-3 (13.5%), and mcr-1 and mcr-3 co-carriage (10.8%). Most S. enterica isolates were susceptible to antibiotics and multidrug resistant (MDR) was found in only a single isolate. However, as many as 89.2% of mcr-positive E. coli were defined as MDR. Almost all S. enterica isolates (97.5–100%) carried several virulence genes involving in invasion, intracellular survival, and iron metabolism. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis revealed that several mcr-positive E. coli isolates were clonally unrelated. Conjugative transfer of mcr-1, mcr-3 as well as co-transfer of mcr-1 and mcr-3 was observed with the frequencies ranging from 10−8 to 10−3. All mcr-1 resided on IncI2, while mcr-3 was associated with IncF and IncX4 plasmids. Our study provides the evidence of fecal shedding pattern of S. enterica and mcr-positive E. coli from meat-type ducks, highlighting the importance of duck farming in the dissemination of pathogenic bacteria that are potentially hazardous to human.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

The ideal classification for the diagnosis and the optimal management strategies, including conservative management, surgical approach, implant constructs, need for spinal fusion, and implant removal, are controversial and currently being investigated. This article reviews the current literature to provide updated evidence on these topics. Posterior ligamentous complex integrity plays an important role in the classification and decision-making process of treatment. A brace is not necessarily required in conservatively treated patients. Regarding surgical management, current evidence advocates posterior-only short segment instrumentation with intermediate screw. Cementoplasty is another option for vertebral augmentation at the fractured level. Spinal fusion is not necessary for this type of injury. Minimally invasive surgery techniques provide equivalent outcomes and can safely replace open approaches. Implant removal after stabilization may provide some benefits, especially in younger patients.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

Prior studies reporting the severity of NAFLD amongst non-obese patients were heterogenous. Our study, using data from the largest biopsy-proven NAFLD international registry within Asia, aims to characterize the demographic, metabolic and histological differences between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients. Methods: 1812 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients across nine countries in Asia assessed between 2006 and 2019 were pooled into a curated clinical registry. Demographic, metabolic and histological differences between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients were evaluated. The performance of Fibrosis-4 index for liver fibrosis (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) to identify advanced liver disease across the varying obesity subgroups was compared. A random forest analysis was performed to identify novel predictors of fibrosis and steatohepatitis in non-obese patients. Findings: One-fifth (21.6%) of NAFLD patients were non-obese. Non-obese NAFLD patients had lower proportions of NASH (50.5% vs 56.5%, p = 0.033) and advanced fibrosis (14.0% vs 18.7%, p = 0.033). Metabolic syndrome in non-obese individuals was associated with NASH (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.01–2.54, p = 0.047) and advanced fibrosis (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.99–3.54, p = 0.051). FIB-4 performed better than the NFS score (AUROC 81.5% vs 73.7%, p < 0.001) when classifying patients with F2–4 fibrosis amongst non-obese NAFLD patients. Haemoglobin, GGT, waist circumference and cholesterol are additional variables found on random forest analysis useful for identifying non-obese NAFLD patients with advanced liver disease. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of non-obese NAFLD patients has NASH or advanced fibrosis. FIB-4, compared to NFS better identifies non-obese NAFLD patients with advanced liver disease. Serum GGT, cholesterol, haemoglobin and waist circumference, which are neither components of NFS nor FIB-4, are important biomarkers for advanced liver disease in non-obese patients.","gastroenterology, medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"
Association of breast feeding and birth interval with child mortality in Pakistan: A cross-sectional study using nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey data,"Amir-Ud-Din R., Mahmood H.Z., Abbas F., Muzammil M., Kumar R., Pongpanich S.",2022-01-11,"Adult, Birth Intervals, Breast Feeding, Child, Child Mortality, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant Mortality, Infant, Newborn, Middle Aged, Pakistan, Risk Factors, Rural Population, Socioeconomic Factors, community child health, health policy, public health","Objectives This study analysed the association between breast feeding (BF) and birth interval (BI) (both succeeding and preceding) with neonatal mortality (NM), infant mortality (IM) and under-5 mortality (U5M). Design This cross-sectional study used data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017-2018. Settings All provinces, Islamabad and Federally Administered Tribal Areas were included in the analysis. Participants A total of 12 769 children born to ever-married multiparous women aged 30-49 years who gave live birth within 5 years preceding the interview. Multiple births are not included. Data analysis Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used. Results We found that BF was associated with nearly 98% lower risk of NM (OR 0.015; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.03; p<0.001), 96% lower risk of IM (OR 0.038; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.06; p<0.001) and 94% lower risk of U5M (OR 0.050; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.08; p<0.001). Compared with optimal preceding birth interval (PBI) (36+ months), short PBI (<18 months) was associated with around six times higher risk of NM (OR 5.661; 95% CI: 2.78 to 11.53; p<0.001), over five times risk of IM (OR 4.704; 95% CI: 2.70 to 8.19; p<0.001) and over five times risk of U5M (OR 4.745; 95% CI: 2.79 to 8.07; p<0.001). Disaggregating the data by child's gender, place of residence and mother's occupational status showed that being ever breast fed was associated with a smaller risk of NM, IM and U5M in all three disaggregations. However, the risk of smaller PBI <18 months was generally more pronounced in female children (NM and U5M) or when the children lived in rural areas (NM, IM and U5M). PBI <18 months was associated with greater risk of NM and IM, and smaller risk of U5M when mothers did a paid job. Conclusion This study's significance lies in the fact that it has found BF and BI to be consistent protective factors against NM, IM and U5M. Given Pakistan's economic constraints, optimal BF and BI are the most cost-effective interventions to reduce child mortality.",medical,Medicine (all)
Robust Processing Advantage for Binomial Phrases with Variant Conjunctions,"Chantavarin S., Morgan E., Ferreira F.",2022-09-01,"Cognition, Eye-Tracking Technology, Humans, Memory, Reading, Semantics, Binomials, Eye tracking, Multiword chunks, Predictability, Self-paced reading, Sentence processing","Prior research has shown that various types of conventional multiword chunks are processed faster than matched novel strings, but it is unclear whether this processing advantage extends to variant multiword chunks that are less formulaic. To determine whether the processing advantage of multiword chunks accommodates variations in the canonical phrasal template, we examined the robustness of the processing advantage (i.e., predictability) of binomial phrases with non-canonical conjunctions (e.g., salt and also pepper; salt as well as pepper). Results from the cloze study (Experiment 1) showed that there was a high tendency of producing the canonical conjunct (pepper), even in the binomials that contained non-formulaic conjunctions. Consistent with these findings, results from two eye tracking studies (Experiments 2a and 2b) showed that canonical conjuncts were read faster than novel conjuncts that were matched on word length (e.g., paprika), even in the binomials with variant conjunctions. This robust online processing advantage was replicated in a self-paced reading study that compared all three conjunction types (Experiment 3). Taken together, these findings show that binomials with variant function words also receive facilitated processing relative to matched novel strings, even though both types of strings are neither conventional nor relatively frequent. Exploratory analyses revealed that this processing speed advantage was driven by the lexical–semantic association between the canonical conjuncts (salt–pepper), rather than lexical and phrasal frequency. Overall, these results highlight flexibility in the processing of multiword chunks that current models of multiword storage and processing must take into account.","psychology, neuroscience, computer science","Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence"

In this study, using a novel straightforward electroless deposition method, multi-elemental alloys (FeCoNiCuZn) supported on graphite were prepared with controlled metal loading (HEA/g-X; X = 40, 80, 100) without any high temperature post-treatments. These materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, and showed a composition ranging from 11 at.% to 31 at.% for each metallic element, a total metal loading varying from 1.3 to 5.2 at.% (5.9 to 21.5 wt.%), homogeneous distribution, and an amorphous structure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate the surface dynamics and the effect of the solution pH during the electrochemical hydrogenation of nitrobenzene using the HEA/g-40 material. The nitrobenzene conversion (>9 mmolNB gcat-1 h−1) and aniline production (≈ 4 mmolAN gcat-1 h−1) rates in Na2SO4 solution (at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) demonstrated a strong dependence on the applied potential. After comparing the results in alkaline medium (KOH), a competitive adsorption of species (nitrobenzene and H2O) was observed, showing a synergistic effect that greatly improved the selectivity of the nitrobenzene hydrogenation to aniline, from 23% in Na2SO4 to an outstanding 94% in KOH at the same applied potential, surpassing the results of a platinum electrode (34% in KOH). These results provide insightful information regarding the nature of the active sites involved in each step of the reaction mechanism, and gives useful means to develop new, tailored multifunctional HEA electrocatalyst materials.","corrosion, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

Methods: Using a prospective non-randomised comparative study design, we enrolled a cohort of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients undergoing MFR. The predictor variables were osteofixation system (conventional titanium plates [CTiP] vs. ultrasound-assisted resorbable plates [USaRP]). The main outcomes were the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on four different surfaces. Other study variables were categorised into demographic, anatomical, and operative. Descriptive, bi- and multivariate statistics were computed. Results: The sample consisted of 11 patients (27.3% females, 63.6% right side, 72.7% displaced fractures) with a mean age of 52.7 ± 20.1 years (range, 19–85). Viral spread was, on average, 1.9 ± 0.4 m. from the operative field, including most oral and orbital retractors’ tips (81.8% and 72.7%) and no virus was found at 3 m from the operative field, but no significant difference was found between 2 osteofixation types. On binary adjustments, significantly broader contamination was linked to centrolateral MFR (P = 0.034; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 to 1.02), and displaced MFR > 45 min (P = 0.022; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.03). Conclusions: USaRP, albeit presumably heavily aerosol-producing, cause similar SARS-CoV-2 distribution to CTiP. Non-surgical operating room (OR) staff should stay ≥ 3 m from the operative field, if the patient is SARS-CoV-2-positive. Enoral and orbital instruments are a potential virus source, especially during displaced MFR > 45 min and/or centrolateral MFR, emphasising an importance of appropriate patient screening and OR organisation.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and contrasting group validity of the Thai Version of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 among women with breast cancer who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Methods: Twenty-eight breast cancer patients and 28 healthy controls participated in the study. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability were assessed using Cronbach a and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Concurrent validity was assessed via the Spearman correlation coefficient of the total scale of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and the Total Neuropathy Score clinical version (TNSc), and contrasting group validity was assessed via the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and inter-rater reliability of the Thai Version of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 was high to excellent (Cronbach a = 0.89, ICC = 0.84-0.95 and 0.78-0.94, respectively). However, the concurrent validity between the Thai Version of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 and TNSc was not considered statistically significant. Contrasting group validity demonstrated statistically significant differences between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: The results support that the Thai Version of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 is reliable and valid in measuring TIPN symptoms in Thai women with breast cancer. The findings suggest that the Thai Version of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 may be used to distinguish TIPN symptoms between healthy controls and women with breast cancer undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

The AM-TiO2-SiO2/ITO-PET synthesized via soft method exhibited a high performance toward the production of CH4, H2 and CO gases, a decrease of the gases production after being used once. This behavior was analyzed and explained from surface phenomenon approaches employing experimental and theoretical means XRD (experimental and theoretical), Raman, FTIR, PL, binding energies (Ebinding), DFT-Koopman descriptors and theoretical Gibbs free energy. The analysis proposes that surfaces with superficial SiO2 groups are more affine to some target molecules (T-M). This affinity promotes faster adsorption and reaction, but contributes to the obstruction in the mechanizing reaction. The formation of second-order links (Van der Waals and Hydrogen bonds) between affine T-M and catalytic surfaces will result in molecular blocking and will lead to catalyst deactivation. Finally, the production of CO on AM-TiO2-SiO2/ITO-PET is kinetically favorable due to the disorder on the AM-TiO2 surface. This specific chemical photoreduction pathway, promoted by the superficial disorder, is also assisted by second-order links (Van der Waals and Hydrogen bonds).","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

It is widely treated with phototherapy using narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB). The therapeutic mechanisms of NB-UVB, however, remain unclear, particularly in the early phases of the disease. Objective: To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of NB-UVB on psoriasis in a model of perilesional psoriasis. Methods: Psoriatic patients that received NB-UVB treatment and were evaluated with the psoriasis area and severity index were included in the study. Skin biopsies obtained before and after treatment were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses for genome-wide transcriptome profiling to gain further insights into the signaling pathways underlying the improvement of psoriasis with therapeutic intervention. Results: Our findings revealed that NB-UVB treatment may exert its effects by suppressing nuclear factor kappa B, which leads to upregulation of the sirtuin signaling pathway, as well as by decreasing the function of major upstream regulators associated with proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, which blocks the expression of downstream toll-like receptors. Psoriasis improvement after NB-UVB treatment was associated with decreased expression of NFKBIZ, SERPINB4, ATG13, and CTSS and increased expression of SKP1 gene. Our results also highlighted the expression of proposed genes associated with the modulation of autoinflammation. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply advanced molecular techniques to explore the effects of phototherapy on psoriasis in the early-phase, providing new insights into the disease pathogenesis and novel genetic information for the development of new therapeutic modalities and potential treatment targets.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"

The syngas from the reforming process has high temperature and pressure and thus, it can be used as fuel for the SOFC. The performance of an integrated system was determined through the Aspen Plus simulator in which the electrochemical equations were also included. The developed model was employed to examine the performance of the integrated system with respect to the wider ranges of operation of the reformer and SOFC. In this work, the desired power output of an SOFC stack is set as 10 kW and thus, the area of an SOFC is determined. A smaller area is required as it normally leads to a lower fabrication cost for the SOFC. The simulation results revealed that the smallest SOFC area can be provided when the reformer is operated at 800°C and 240 atm with a ratio of supercritical water to glycerol as 50 whereas the SOFC operation is at 900°C and 4 atm with the current density as 7000 A/m2. Under these operating conditions, the integrated system can provide the cell voltage, required area, fuel utilization, and SOFC efficiency as 1 V, 1.42 m2, 75% and 61%, respectively. From the exergy analysis, it was found that the compressor, heater, and turbine are the highest exergy destruction units whereas the reformer has the lowest exergy destruction, followed by the SOFC stack.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, very few small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have adopted BDA because they lack the relevant knowledge, which makes BDA development expensive and unsuitable. A big data maturity model (BDMM) is a tool for assessing the stage for using big data in a company, and it acts as a guide for improvement. However, most BDMMs are designed for large enterprises using rule-based scoring, which is static over time. Developing a suitable BDMM for SMEs is a challenging task for professionals in terms of acquiring small-scale expertise owing to the lack of case studies for verifying the maturity level. This study proposes a new BDMM for Thai SMEs and a new methodology for developing a dynamic model using latent class analysis (LCA), which explains the behaviour of each latent class and provides non-rule-based scoring. We define four types of capabilities in SMEs: organizational and attitude factors, information technology, technology, and people readiness. Data are collected from 135 SMEs in Thailand. We introduce a methodology for developing multiple building stages of the BDMM. Further, we experiment with several clusters suitable for SMEs using statistic-based and data visualization approaches. The proposed BDMM is validated via a secondary evaluation of 11 firms, nine months after the initial evaluation. Further, we introduce a web-based application for respondents to obtain their firm's assessment results. The visualization-based result helps the respondents compare their business with other companies at the same or higher maturity level. In summary, SMEs can use the proposed BDMM to plan for continuous self-improvement and thus optimize their business using BDA to maximize its value to the organization.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Engineering (all), Computer Science Applications, Artificial Intelligence"

The Nano-ZnO incorporated membrane demonstrated a superior quality execution contrasted with neat PEES membrane. We discovered that the rejection of As(III) and As (V) were > 85% and > 98% separately, and an expanded permeability of 559.28 ± 2 Lm−2 h−1 and 297.95 ± 2 Lm−2 h−1 individually was seen at pH 10. Fluoride and nitrate particles additionally indicated the most extreme expulsion efficiencies were > 89% and > 75% separately. The prepared membrane samples were incubated in water (40 °C) and sodium hypochlorite solution (active chlorine concentration 400 mg/L) for up to 10 days to determine the stability of polymer membrane matrix. The general outcomes inferred that the nano-ZnO incorporated PEES membrane gave remarkable result to eliminate dangerous metal ions with moderate permeability.","geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
A systematic review on pharmacists’ turnover and turnover intention,"Thin S.M., Chongmelaxme B., Watcharadamrongkun S., Kanjanarach T., Sorofman B.A., Kittisopee T.",2022-11-01,"Humans, Intention, Job Satisfaction, Pharmaceutical Services, Pharmacies, Pharmacists, Community, Hospital, Pharmacist, Turnover, Turnover intention","Background: Turnover is an important issue in all healthcare professions including pharmacy practice settings. A high turnover rate of pharmacists, not only has negative financial impact, but also reduces quality of care and patient safety. The high turnover also increases workload and job stress which can increase job errors and decrease job efficiency and performance in pharmacy practices. Objectives: To systematically review the extent of pharmacists' turnover and their intention to leave their jobs or the pharmacy profession. Methods: An electronic search was performed from database inception to December 19, 2020 using the following 6 databases; PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ERIC, and ERIC-EBSCO. Articles were included if they were relevant to reports of pharmacist turnover or turnover intention. Only research studies were included, but not editorials, letters, or review articles. Results: Twenty-eight studies were contained within this systematic review. Using the QualSyst assessment tool to assess the included article qualities, all studies demonstrated good quality with quality assessment score of 0.75. Fifteen studies (53.6%) were conducted from the US, 3 studies (10.7%) from Taiwan, 2 studies (7.1%) from the UK, and the remaining studies from Lithuania, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. The turnover of the pharmacists from their jobs ranged from 8.6 to 17%, and the turnover from the pharmacy profession was in the range of 6–9%. The turnover intention of the pharmacists in their jobs was from 13% to 61.2%, and the turnover intention in the pharmacy profession was 6.5%–18.8%. Hospital pharmacists had significantly higher turnover intentions than community ones. The turnover intention rates of both hospital and community pharmacists have gradually increased over time in both European countries and Asian countries. Conclusion: Based on the included articles, pharmacists' turnover rate appeared to increase over time. However, based on the heterogeneity of studies, further research is warranted to confirm this and to help to identify the potential causes of turnover intention since intention was related to behavior.","Health Professions, pharmacology","Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Science"
Design and Development of an NLP-Based Mental Health Pre-screening Tool for Undergraduate Students in Thailand: A Usability Study,"Pangsrisomboon P., Pyae A., Thawitsri N., Liulak S.",2022-01-01,"Health assessments, Language processing, Mental health, Natural language processing, Natural languages, Screening tool, Undergraduate students, Usability, User friendly, Users' experiences, Mental health, Natural language processing, Usability, User experience","Fear of stigmatization has been a barrier for Thai undergraduate students to actively reach out to health practitioners for support when they experience a mental health problem. Commercially available mental health systems struggle to find a balance between effective clinical diagnostic capability and engaging user experience. In natural ambience, it is proven that users could better articulate their thoughts, which results in a higher efficacy of prescreening results in mental health assessment. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are promising to enable this by developing a human-like digital assistant for mental health. The usability and user interface design of such mental health assessment tool should support the frictionless interaction while being compatible with the Thai context (e.g., language). To fill these gaps, in this study, we developed an NLP-based digital healthcare assistant as a pre-screening tool that can be used to detect undergraduate students’ anxiety levels and identify their needs for psychological support. We conducted a pilot usability evaluation of the system focusing on the system’s usability effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability. The findings can be concluded that creating a natural and user-friendly experience for users, with flexibility that allowed for individual preferences through a chat-based NLP system, results in an engaging user experience and less friction towards the adoption of the tool. These findings can be used to support the future development of an effective and user-friendly pre-screening tool for this particular user group.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Mathematics (all)"

New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) jorunnamycin A (22-(4′py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4′py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 22-(4′py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4′py)-JA. In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4′py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4′py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4′py)-JA exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

A clear understanding of how MAIT cells in the mucosae function and their role in host immunity is still lacking. Therefore, our aim was to investigate MAIT cell distribution and their characteristics in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal tissue based on Vα7.2+CD161hi identification. We showed that Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells are present in both intraepithelial layer and lamina propriae of the GI mucosa, but have different abundance at each GI site. Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells were most abundant in the duodenum, but had the lowest reactivity to MR1-5-OP-RU tetramers when compared with Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells at other GI tissue sites. Striking discrepancies between MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer reactive cells and Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells were observed along each GI tissue sites. Vα7.2+CD161hi TCR repertoire was most diverse in the ileum. Similar dominant profiles of TRBV usage were observed among peripheral blood, duodenum, ileum, and colon. Some TRBV chains were detected at certain intestinal sites and not elsewhere. The frequency of peripheral blood Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells correlated with mucosal Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells in lamina propriae ileum and lamina propriae colon. The frequency of peripheral blood Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells in Helicobacter pylori-infected individuals was significantly lower than uninfected individuals, but this was not observed with gastric Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells. This study illustrates the biology of Vα7.2+CD161hi T cells in the GI mucosa and provides a basis for understanding MAIT cells in the mucosa and MAIT-related GI diseases.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Cell Biology"

The pigment concentration distributions were obtained by a separating method of skin pigment components with independent component analysis from the skin image. This method can extract the concentration of melanin and hemoglobin components, which are the main pigments that make up skin tone. Based on this concentration, we developed a procedure to reproduce a skin mockup with a multi-layered structure that is determined by mapping the absorbance of melanin and hemoglobin to CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) subtractive color mixing. In our proposed method, the multi-layered structure with different pigments in each layer contributes greatly to the accurate reproduction of skin tones. We use a UV printer because the printer is capable of layered fabrication by using UV-curable inks. As the result, subjective evaluation showed that the artificial skin reproduced by our method has a more skin-like appearance than that produced using conventional printing.","fluidex; related topics, medical, computer science, engineering","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The structure presents advantageous optical properties, in particular, for near- and mid-infrared optical applications. Scanning electron microscopy shows that although the stems of GaAs/GaAsP and GaAs/GaAsBi core-shell NWs preserve the hexagonal prism shape, the GaAs/GaAsPBi core-shell NWs develop a quasi-three-fold orientational symmetry affected by the hexagonal prismatic core. Detailed structural analyses of a GaAs/GaAsPBi core-shell stem show that it crystallized with zincblende structure with a nominal shell composition of GaAs0.617P0.362Bi0.021. Photoluminescence of GaAs/GaAsPBi core-shell NWs shows the luminescent peak at 1.02 eV with high internal quantum efficiency at room temperature (IQERT ∼ 6%) superior to those of MBE-grown GaAs core NWs and GaAsPBi multiple quantum wells earlier reported. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy performed on the GaAs/GaAsPBi core-shell NWs yields an estimated bandgap different from the optically measured value.

It was found that most of the studied AMP-PZ-MEA solvents precipitated at high AMP and PZ concentrations and at high CO2 loading. The minimum possible MEA concentration (which can maintain a clear solvent) was 1.5 M for 6 M total amine concentration. It was also observed that an increase of AMP and/or PZ concentration in the 6 M blends induced the solvent precipitation. MEA was the only amine component that can be added to the blends to elevate the total amine concentration from 6 M to 7 M. As a result, the six AMP-PZ-MEA blends were suggested: 2:2.5:1.5, 1.3:3.2:1.5, 0.95:3.55:1.5 (for 6 M) and 2:2.5:2.5, 1.3:3.2:2.5, and 0.95:3.55:2.5 (for 7 M). The proposed blends are corresponding to PZ:AMP molar ratio of 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75, which are much higher than that of the first-generation AMP-PZ-MEA solvents. Regarding the visualized observation, there was no solid sediments observed throughout precipitation and CO2 absorption studies of the six blends. Interestingly, densities of the proposed blends were close to that of 5 M MEA, while their viscosities were much higher than that of 5 M MEA but were close to that of MDEA-PZ and AMP-PZ. Additionally, CO2 absorption capacities of the proposed 6 M and 7 M blends were 56-58% and 64-71% higher than that of 5 M MEA. These numbers are much higher than those of the first-generation AMP-PZ-MEA solvents.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, geobase; related topics, environmental, energy, engineering","Pollution, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The point-of-care testing (POCT) device for HIV/HCV DNA detection is promptly needed for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease progression. Here, the alternating-current electroluminescence (ACEL) technique is proposed as a sensitive POCT sensing platform for HIV/HCV cDNA detection. A conductance-based light emission modulated by the hybridization between a pyrrolidinyl PNA probe and the DNA target enabled the DNA detection in a label-free format. Enhanced electroluminescence was observed in the presence of the target DNA due to the increased proton conductivity. Under the optimal conditions, the linearity range from 1 nM to 1 μM was achieved for HIV and HCV cDNA with LODs of 1.86 pM (HIV cDNA) and 1.96 pM (HCV cDNA). The spiked HIV/HCV cDNA in healthy human serum was successfully detected, demonstrating the feasibility of the developed device for the detection of cDNA in real biological samples. Additionally, simultaneous HIV/HCV cDNA detection on a single ACEL device employing a 2x2-array detection zone design. The cross-reactivity with other viral DNA was shown to be minimal due to the high specificity of the PNA probes used. Finally, the negative and positive samples from the patient's serum were tested and the results were in 100% agreement with the commercial kit based-on real-time PCR method, thus illustrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the developed sensor.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

Unfortunately, neither an anti-HFMD drug nor a vaccine is currently available. Rupintrivir in phase II clinical trial candidate for rhinovirus showed highly potent antiviral activities against enteroviruses as an inhibitor for 3C protease (3Cpro). In the present study, we focused on designing 50 novel rupintrivir analogs against CV-A16 and EV-A71 3Cpro using computational tools. From their predicted binding affinities, the five compounds with functional group modifications at P1′, P2, P3, and P4 sites, namely P1′-1, P2-m3, P3-4, P4-5, and P4-19, could bind with both CV-A16 and EV-A71 3Cpro better than rupintrivir. Subsequently, these five analogs were studied by 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Among them, P2-m3, the derivative with meta-aminomethyl-benzyl group at the P2 site, showed the greatest potential to interact with the 3Cpro target by delivering the highest number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and contact atoms. It formed the hydrogen bonds with L127 and K130 residues at the P2 site stronger than rupintrivir, supported by significantly lower MM/PB(GB)SA binding free energies. Elucidation of designed rupintrivir analogs in our study provides the basis for developing compounds that can be candidate compounds for further HFMD treatment.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCV-cAg) level was determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− as a redox solution. In the presence of HCV-cAg, the DPV current response decreased with increasing HCV-cAg concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the change in current response provides a good linear correlation with the logarithm of HCV-cAg concentration in the range 0.05 to 1000 pg mL−1 (RSD < 5%), and the limit of detection was 0.015 pg mL−1 (or 0.71 fmol L−1). Furthermore, the proposed immunosensor has been utilized to quantify HCV-cAg in human serum samples with reliable results compared with standard immunoassays (% relative error < 10%). This sensor offers a simple, sensitive, selective, disposable, and inexpensive means for determination of HCV-cAg in human serum samples.

Eligibility criteria involved participants with flatfoot engaging in the SFE compared to other forms of intervention or control groups without specific intervention. Relevant studies published before the end of June 2022 were identified from databases. A meta-analysis was performed by calculating the mean differences (MD) and standard MD (SMD) using the random effects model. Six trials with 201 patients (out of 609 records) that met selection criteria were reviewed. Five of the six trials implemented distinct interventions in the control group such as shoe insoles and muscle strengthening exercises, while in the remaining trial, controls received no intervention. The SFE group significantly reduced the navicular drop test (NDT) values (MD: −0.23; 95% confidence interval: −0.45 to −0.02; p = 0.04) and the foot posture index (FPI-6) score (MD: −0.67; 95% confidence interval: −0.98 to −0.36; p < 0.0001) when compared to the control group. The muscle hypertrophy did not differ significantly between the groups. The SFE may contribute more benefits than other intervention as it affects flatfoot individuals’ foot alignment.

The elevated presence of this parasite in the domestic cat (Felis catus), and its close contact with humans, make it necessary to obtain reliable diagnostic methods to detect positive animals as a public health measure. For this reason, in this study, the diagnostic performance of five different recombinant antigen-based techniques was assessed to diagnose T. gondii infection in cat blood plasma samples. Specifically, four T. gondii recombinant antigens (GRA7, truncated GRA7, SAG2, and truncated SAG2) and a chimeric antigen (SAG1-GRA8) were used. A time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) was developed for each antigen, and the results of each of these techniques were compared with those obtained by a commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and a modified agglutination test (MAT) as reference techniques. The TRFIA based on SAG1-GRA8 antigen showed better discrimination between seropositive and seronegative cats (p < 0.001), as well as a better area under the curve (0.95), sensitivity (93.6%), and specificity (89.5%) values for the optimal cut-off, versus the other TRFIAs. In addition, SAG1-GRA8 TRFIA showed substantial agreement (kappa value = 0.78) and a moderate significant correlation (Spearman's correlation: r = 0.62, p < 0.001) compared with the reference techniques. On the other hand, since plasma samples were obtained from 101 cats in Bangkok city and four of them were Neospora caninum seropositive by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFAT), this is the first time that anti-N. caninum antibodies are detected in cats in Thailand.

Biomedical event extraction on input text corpora using combination technique based capsule network,"Devendra Kumar R.N., Srihari K., Arvind C., Viriyasitavat W.",2022-12-01,"Biomedical event extraction, Biomedical trigger, Capsule network, Conventional methods, Events extractions, Language processing, Machine-learning, Natural languages, Subtask, Text corpora, Biomedical event extraction, biomedical triggers, CapsNet, machine learning","Biomedical Event Extraction (BEE) is a demanding and prominent technology that attracts the researchers and scientists in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The conventional method relies mostly on external NLP packages and manual designed features, where the features engineering is complex and large. In addition, the conventional methods on BEE uses a pipeline process that splits a task into many sub-tasks, however, the relationship between these sub-tasks is not defined. In this paper, such limitations are avoided using the combination technique that relies on Capsule Network (CapsNet) to perform a task. The CapsNet is used for the extraction of feature representation from the input corpora and then the combination technique reconstructs the events from RNN output. This method extracts the tasks from a BEE over several annotated corpora that extract the events from the molecular level in case of multi-level events. The proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art models over various text corpora datasets. The results show an improved rate of accuracy of CapsNet classification over cancer biomedical events than the existing methods.","mixing and separation, Multidisciplinary",Multidisciplinary

However, RRC is rarely used for producing red stoneware tiles due to firing temperature requirements. Present work aims to improve the properties of red stoneware tiles derived from RRC by the addition of iron oxide (Fe2O3). The samples composed of RRC, kaolin, and potassium feldspar with different contents of Fe2O3, were prepared by dry pressing method and fired at 1000–1200 °C. The water absorption and apparent porosity of samples decreased with increasing the content of Fe2O3 and firing temperature. Moreover, adding Fe2O3 up to a total content of 8.05 wt% not only enhanced the flexural strength and reduced the firing temperature but also reduced the water absorption to lower than 1.5% after firing at 1150 °C. Conversely, the flexural strength reduced when a total content of Fe2O3 up to 9.99 wt%. In addition, the evidence of excess Fe2O3 was observed in microstructure and XRD results.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

The evaluation of their cytotoxicity using MTT assay indicated that almost all derivatives exhibited significantly superior inhibitory activity against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 compared to the parental molecule sorafenib (1). Among the series, 5r was the most potent anti-HepG2 agent with IC50 = 1.04 µM, which was almost 5-fold more active than sorafenib (IC50 = 5.06 µM), while the cytotoxic activity against human embryonal lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 remained comparable to sorafenib. The synthetic derivative 5r, thus, possessed 5.2-time higher selectivity index (SI) than that of sorafenib. Molecular docking studies revealed an efficient interaction of 5r at the same sorafenib's binding region in both B-Raf and VEGFR-2 with lower binding energies than those of sorafenib, consistent with its cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, 5r was proven to induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner similar to sorafenib. In addition, the prediction using SwissADME suggested that 5r possessed appropriate drug properties conforming to Veber's studies. These findings revealed that the newly designed meta-ureidophenoxy-1,2,3-triazole hybrid scaffold was a promising structural feature for an efficient inhibition of HepG2.

There are numerous genotype-phenotype publications involving many patients and kindreds. Here, we identified six Thai individuals in two families with nonsyndromic tooth agenesis, performed exome sequencing, and conducted functional experiments. Family 1 had four affected members carrying the heterozygous PAX9 variant, c.59C>T (p.Pro20Leu). The p.Pro20Leu was previously reported in two families having four and three affected members. These seven cases and Proband-1 had agenesis of at least three third molars. Family 2 comprised two affected members with agenesis of all 12 molars. Both individuals were heterozygous for c.230G>A (p.Arg77Gln) in PAX9, which has not been reported previously. This variant is predicted to be damaging, evolutionarily conserved, and resides in the PAX9 linking peptide. The BMP4 RNA levels in Proband-1′s leukocytes were not significantly different from those in the controls, whereas BMP4 levels observed in Proband-2 were significantly increased. Moreover, the p.Arg77Gln variant demonstrated nuclear localization similar to the wild-type but resulted in significantly impaired transactivation of BMP4, a PAX9 downstream gene. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the PAX9 p.Pro20Leu is highly associated with absent third molars, while the novel PAX9 p.Arg77Gln impairs BMP4 transactivation and is associated with total molar agenesis.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

This study investigated the molecular targets of N,N-bis (5-ethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl) methylamine (EMD) for metastatic inhibition. Materials and Methods: Proteins were analyzed by proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. Protein protein interaction (PPI) networks were created with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and hub genes were used to determine dominant pathways. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses validated the proteomic results and investigated signaling pathways in NCI-H23 lung cancer cells. Results: A total of 1,751 proteins were common to the control, EMD and N,N-bis(5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzyl) methylamine (MeMD) groups; 1,980 different proteins were categorized using metastatic capacity category and analyzed for unique proteins affected by EMD. Fifteen proteins were associated with cell adhesion and six with cell migration. Nectin cell adhesion molecule 2 (NECTIN2) was expressed in the control and MeMD-Treated groups but not the EMD-Treated group, suggesting NECTIN2 as an EMD target. PPI network showed association of NECTIN2 with proteins regulating cancer metastasis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways revealed that NECTIN2 is an upstream target of cytoskeletal regulation via SRC signaling. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that EMD suppressed NECTIN2, and its downstream targets, including p-SRC (Y146 and Y527) and the epithelial-To-mesenchymal transition markers tight junction protein 1, vimentin, β-catenin, snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1), and SNAI2, while increasing E-cadherin.

Water flooding is applied as the method to increase more oil as well as the surfactant injection, one of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology. To increase the production rate, the water flooding and surfactant injection with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) have been studied and compared the results for oil production by using the simulation with ECLIPSE. Therefore, the aim of this work is to simulate the surfactant flooding by using SDBS with various conditions such as the injection rate and the period of injection for Sansai area in Fang oilfield and to compare this technique of oil recovery with the conventional water flooding and natural flow. From the results, it shows that the surfactant method with SDBS provides the highest recovery factor at 26.7%. Also, the parameters such as injection rate are studied that the oil recovery can increase with an increase in injection rate. For the injection period of 1, 2 and 3 years of SDBS injection, the results present that 3-year injection can provide the highest oil recovery at 33.1%. However, the maximum difference of oil recovery factor is less than 5%. Therefore, in term of economic consideration, 1-year injection period might be better. This work can be used for the further study in applying this technology in this field in future.","engineering, coastal engineering","Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

PSI from Ring-OLE,"Chongchitmate W., Ishai Y., Lu S., Ostrovsky R.",2022-11-07,"A-RINGS, Input set, Intersection protocols, Private set intersection, Psi-sum, Ring-ole, Secure computation, Set intersection, SIMPLE protocol, State of the art, private set intersection, psi-sum, ring-ole","Private set intersection (PSI) is one of the most extensively studied instances of secure computation. PSI allows two parties to compute the intersection of their input sets without revealing anything else. Other useful variants include PSI-Payload, where the output includes payloads associated with members of the intersection, and PSI-Sum, where the output includes the sum of the payloads instead of individual ones. In this work, we make two related contributions. First, we construct simple and efficient protocols for PSI and PSI-Payload from a ring version of oblivious linear function evaluation (ring-OLE) that can be efficiently realized using recent ring-LPN based protocols. A standard OLE over a field F allows a sender with a,b F to deliver ax + b to a receiver who holds x F. Ring-OLE generalizes this to a ring F, in particular, a polynomial ring over F. Our second contribution is an efficient general reduction of a variant of PSI-Sum to PSI-Payload and secure inner product. Our protocols have better communication cost than state-of-the-art PSI protocols, especially when requiring security against malicious parties and when allowing input-independent preprocessing. Compared to previous maliciously secure PSI protocols that have a similar computational cost, our online communication is 2x better for small sets (28-212 elements) and 20% better for large sets (220-224). Our protocol is also simpler to describe and implement. We obtain even bigger improvements over the state of the art (4-5x better running time) for our variant of PSI-Sum.","computer scienceuter theory, includes computer scienceutational logic, automata theory, switching theory, programming theory, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Computer Networks and Communications"

Many studies have established changes in immune-inflammatory and antibody levels, but few studies measured the soluble receptor for the advanced glycation end product (sRAGE), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), calcium, and magnesium in COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate serum advanced glycation end-product receptor (sRAGE) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and chest CT scan abnormalities (CCTA) in COVID-19. Methods: sRAGE, ACE2, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, magnesium, and albumin were measured in 60 COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls. Results: COVID-19 is characterized by significantly increased IL-6, CRP, IL-10, sRAGE, ACE2, and lowered SpO2, albumin, magnesium, and calcium. COVID-19 with CCTAs showed lower SpO2 and albumin. SpO2 was significantly inversely correlated with IL-6, IL-10, CRP, sRAGE, and ACE2, and positively with albumin, magnesium, and calcium. Neural networks showed that a combination of calcium, IL-6, CRP, and sRAGE yielded an accuracy of 100% in detecting COVID-19 patients, with calcium being the most important predictor followed by IL-6 and CRP. Patients with positive IgG results showed a significant elevation in the serum level of IL-6, sRAGE, and ACE2 compared to the negatively IgG patient subgroup. Conclusion: The results show that immune-inflammatory and RAGE pathways biomarkers may be used as an external validating criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

The obtained excess properties revealed that there was a strong contraction of liquid mixture through intermolecular interaction and/or preference molecular packing. Also, Gibbs free energy for activation of viscous flow was a key parameter affecting liquid viscosity. It was suggested that refractive index should be considered with density for a molar polarizability and a free molar volume for CO2 physical solubility.

There is also evidence that neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with ECS abnormalities as well as oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways. The goal of this mechanistic review is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the ECS's regulation of redox signalling, as well as the mechanisms by which activated oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways may impair ECS-mediated signalling. Cannabinoid receptor (CB)1 activation and upregulation of brain CB2 receptors reduce oxidative stress in the brain, resulting in less tissue damage and less neuroinflammation. Chronically high levels of oxidative stress may impair CB1 and CB2 receptor activity. CB1 activation in peripheral cells increases nitrosative stress and inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) activity, reducing mitochondrial activity. Upregulation of CB2 in the peripheral and central nervous systems may reduce iNOS, nitrosative stress, and neuroinflammation. Nitrosative stress may have an impact on CB1 and CB2-mediated signalling. Peripheral immune activation, which frequently occurs in response to nitro-oxidative stress, may result in increased expression of CB2 receptors on T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, reducing the production of inflammatory products and limiting the duration and intensity of the immune and oxidative stress response. In conclusion, high levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress may compromise or even abolish ECS-mediated redox pathway regulation. Future research in neuropsychiatric disorders like mood disorders and deficit schizophrenia should explore abnormalities in these intertwined signalling pathways.","pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"

Although the durability under swelling/shrinking reversibility and repeatability are also needed, the plausible fabrication processes were still under investigation. The present work proposes a simple approach to achieve persistently reversible multi-responsive hydrogels by crosslinking the two responsive interpenetrating networks (IPNs), so-called crosslinked network IPN (CN-IPNs). The combination of two responsive hydrogels, i.e., pH-responsive chitosan (CS) crosslinked with diacid, and thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) crosslinked with divinyl, is a good model for CN-IPNs. The further crosslinking of both networks via thiol-ene Click results in CS/PNIPAM in the form of CN-IPNs hydrogel. The hydrogel obtained expresses the persistently reversible pH-/thermo-responsiveness as evidenced from the maintaining appearances and the dimensional stability including the mechanical strength even after several pH and thermal treatment cycles.

In this study, we measured a urinary chlorpyrifos metabolite and used high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) to identify biological perturbations associated with chlorpyrifos exposure among pregnant women in Thailand, who are disparately exposed to high levels of OP insecticides. Methods: This study included 50 participants from the Study of Asian Women and their Offspring's Development and Environmental Exposures (SAWASDEE). We used liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry to conduct metabolic profiling on first trimester serum samples collected from participants to evaluate metabolic perturbations in relation to chlorpyrifos exposures. We measured 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a specific metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl, in first trimester urine samples to assess the levels of exposures. Following an untargeted metabolome-wide association study workflow, we used generalized linear models, pathway enrichment analyses, and chemical annotation to identify significant metabolites and pathways associated with urinary TCPy levels. Results: In the 50 SAWASDEE participants, the median urinary TCPy level was 4.36 μg TCPy/g creatinine. In total, 691 unique metabolic features were found significantly associated with TCPy levels (p < 0.05) after controlling for confounding factors. Pathway analysis of metabolic features associated with TCPy indicated perturbations in 24 metabolic pathways, most closely linked to the production of reactive oxygen species and cellular damage. These pathways include tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid oxidation and peroxisome metabolism, cytochromes P450 metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and vitamin B3 metabolism. We confirmed the chemical identities of 25 metabolites associated with TCPy levels, including glutathione, cystine, arachidic acid, itaconate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Discussion: The metabolic perturbations associated with TCPy levels were related to oxidative stress, cellular damage and repair, and systemic inflammation, which could ultimately contribute to health outcomes, including neurodevelopmental deficits in the child. These findings support the future development of sensitive biomarkers to investigate the metabolic underpinnings related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and to understand its link to adverse outcomes in children.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Despite effective conventional wound healing medicines, the exploration of alternative medicines are continuing process as researchers seek for the approach to reduce the cost of wound healing management. In present study, wound healing properties of ethanolic extract of Baeckea frutescens leaves were determined by evaluating their cytotoxicity, proliferation and migration rate on two types of cells, keratinocytes (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (BJ). Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of this plant were determined by DPPH scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total phenolics content (TPC) assays. The phytochemistry of the extract was evaluated by phytochemicals screening and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis. Results of this study indicated Baeckea frutescens extract increased the rate of proliferation and migration on both HaCat and BJ cells within their nontoxic doses. The extract also possessed a very good antioxidant property as demonstrated with high DPPH radical scavenging, FRAP and TPC values, comparable to that of Green tea extract, a widely known antioxidant. The phytochemistry analyses and LCMS exhibited the presence saponins, flavonoids, tannins and steroids in Baeckea frutescens extract possibly responsible to their antioxidant and wound healing properties.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Novel hybrid natural rubber nanocomposites with carbon nanotube and cellulose nanofiber for strain-sensitive sensor,"Krainoi A., Boonkerd K.",2022-11-01,"Cellulose nanofibers, Conductive elastomers, Hybrid fillers, Latex mixing, Master batch, Mixing method, Nanofiller, Property, Rubber nanocomposites, Sensitive sensors, Carbon nanotube, Cellulose nanofiber, Conductive elastomer, Natural rubber, Sensor","A natural rubber (NR) filled with hybrid filler of carbon nanotube (CNT) and cellulose nanofiller (CNF) was prepared by masterbatch latex mixing method. The proportion of CNT:CNF was varied at 1:0.05, 1:0.5, and 1:1. The properties, including mechanical, electrical, and strain sensitivity, of the hybrid NR nanocomposites for use as a sensor were investigated. Raman spectrum confirmed the interaction between CNT and CNF, as indicated by the upshift in the D and G bands and the decrease in ID/IG ratio with the increased proportion of CNF. In addition, the particle analyzer presented the finest dispersion of CNT in the CNT–CNF1:0.05 hybrid, whereas the agglomeration of CNT and CNF particles occurred with the high proportion of CNF owing to the interaction between CNT and CNF particles. Moreover, the good dispersion of CNT in the NR/CNT–CNF1:0.05 resulted in an improved electrical conductivity. Although the high CNF proportion caused the increased interaction between the functional groups of CNT and CNF, it induced a stable and flexible conducting network in the hybrid NR nanocomposites, which promoted the strain-sensitive property for the application of NR nanocomposites as sensors.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

Since PDAs often change color upon exposure to organic solvents, most of previous studies used water as a medium. This presents a problem for detecting organic acids and bases with limited solubility in water. In this contribution, we explore the applications of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites as colorimetric sensors for detecting organic acid-base in various organic solvents and food products. Owning to its high color stability, this class of PDA materials can be dispersed in tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, and ethanol while the blue phase remains. We have found that the sensitivity of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites to acid-base varies with the solvent properties. The sensors prepared by dispersing in different solvents can detect acid-base at different concentrations. Raman spectroscopy carried out directly in the liquid suspensions reveals the mechanisms of color transition in each system. Fine-tuning of the sensitivity can also be achieved by varying the ZnO ratios within nanocomposites. The ability to control the sensitivity allows the utilization of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites for semi-quantitative analysis of acid-base in food products. Solid-state sensors fabricated by embedding in nylon filters can determine the concentration of sorbic acid in fruit juices. The freshness of milk can be indicated via naked-eye detection as well. Our study expands the applications of PDA materials as colorimetric sensors for food industries.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"
Amygdala Underlies the Environment Dependency of Defense Responses Induced via Superior Colliculus,"Isa K., Tokuoka K., Ikeda S., Karimi S., Kobayashi K., Sooksawate T., Isa T.",2022-01-07,"Amygdala, Animals, Fear, Male, Mice, Optogenetics, Superior Colliculi, amygdala, cuneiform nucleus, escape behavior, flight response, mouse, optogenetics, pathway-selective, superior colliculus","In our previous study, we showed that the defense responses induced by the selective optogenetic activation of the uncrossed output pathway from the deeper layer of the superior colliculus were environment dependent in the mouse. In a small closed box, the stimulus frequently induced flight (fast forward run away) responses, while in a large open field, the stimulus tended to induce backward retreat responses. We tested a hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in such environment dependency of the innate defense responses. For this purpose, we made a bilateral lesion of the amygdala induced by the ibotenic acid injections in male mice. As a result, in the mice with lesions of substantial portions of the basolateral and basomedial complex, the flight responses in the closed box disappeared and retreat responses were mainly induced. The retreat responses on the open platform were unchanged. Classically, the amygdala has been considered to be involved in the memory-dependent contextual modulation of the fear responses. In contrast, the present results suggest a novel view on the role of the amygdala in which the amygdala plays a key role in sensing the current environmental setting for making a quick decision of action upon emergency, which is critical for survival in the natural environment.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience","Neuroscience (miscellaneous), Sensory Systems, Cognitive Neuroscience, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The beam formulation is developed based upon Timoshenko hypothesis and modified couple stress theory. The uncertainty of Young’s modulus is modelled as a homogeneous Gaussian random field over a one-dimensional space occupied by the beam axis. Within the framework of SSIGA, the random field, represented by Karhunen-Loève expansion, is discretized by the univariate non-uniform B-spline basis functions. The arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion is subsequently adopted to predict the statistical characteristics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) of the stochastic deflection. Finally, a numerical study on a representative cantilever microbeam is presented to demonstrate the significance of integrating the material uncertainty in the analysis of micro-scaled beams.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

Despite the silent clinical manifestation, gut translocation of microbial molecules can induce systemic inflammation that might be an endogenous exacerbating factor of systemic lupus erythematosus. In contrast, circulatory immune-complex deposition and the effect of medications on the gut, an organ with an extremely large surface area, of patients with active lupus might cause gut translocation of microbial molecules, which worsens lupus severity. Likewise, the imbalance of gut microbiota may initiate lupus and/or interfere with gut integrity which results in microbial translocation and lupus exacerbation. Moreover, immune hyper-responsiveness of innate immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils) is demonstrated in a lupus model from the loss of inhibitory Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcgRIIb), which induces prominent responses through the cross-link between activating-FcgRs and innate immune receptors. The immune hyper-responsiveness can cause cell death, especially apoptosis and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), which possibly exacerbates lupus, partly through the enhanced exposure of the self-antigens. Leaky gut monitoring and treatments (such as probiotics) might be beneficial in lupus. Here, we discuss the current information on leaky gut in lupus.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Aggregators might have to pay electricity supply-demand imbalance charges when generated and consumed energies contracted at the day-ahead supply-demand market are different from those at the current day operation due to distribution network constraints such as voltage and power flow limitations. Therefore, the information on network constraints is very important for aggregators to determine their day-ahead schedules. In this paper, we evaluated the relationship between aggregator supply-demand schedules and the distribution system operation. It was assumed that the reverse power flow limitations due to network constraints are notified to the aggregators by distribution system operator (DSO). Two cases of the aggregators’ schedules of PV systems and stationary BESSs were compared in the simulations. In addition, aggregator strategies for making adequate schedules were evaluated.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

TB causes chronic disease which may cause physical disability, mental and socioeconomic problems in TB patients. Mental disorders may occur after TB infection or co-exist with the disease. This study assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients and its association with treatment outcome. Methods: This is a single-center prospective study. Pulmonary TB patients who were treated at a tertiary hospital, in both outpatient and in-patient settings, were enrolled into the study. Demographic data and Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score at baseline and at least 2 months after diagnosis were collected to evaluate the probability of depression and anxiety. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the data. Association between suspicious mental disorder and treatment outcome were evaluated at the end of each participant's treatment. Results: One hundred and three participants were enrolled into the study on March 2018 to October 2019. The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety (Thai HADS score ≥11 from both test) were 7.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Unsuccessful treatment outcome rate was 10.7% (11/103). From the multivariate analysis, people previously treated/relapsed (aOR (95%CI): 7.04 (1.19–41.85), p = 0.03) and probable depression/anxiety with Thai HADS score ≥11 (10.12 (1.54–66.45), p = 0.02) were associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome. Conclusions: In this study, Thai HADS score could identify probable depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients, and its association with unfavorable treatment outcome. Clinicians should keep in mind that pulmonary TB can affect the mental status of the patients and therefore, should evaluate them and provide appropriate treatment.",medical,Infectious Diseases

At present, TILs are used for immunotherapy in various cancers. Knowledge on adoptive transfer of TILs in ovarian cancer is still limited, especially regarding TIL expansion methods. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the quality of T cell clones between two expansion methods for ovarian cancer TILs. We show that TILs stimulated with the mitogenic stimulation method (low dose IL-2 with anti-human CD3/CD28) and the standard stimulation method (high dose IL-2 only) both increased total number of T cells. TCR repertoire analyses revealed different TCR repertoire patterns between TIL-expanded T cells that were stimulated with the standard stimulation method (high dose IL-2 only) and the mitogenic stimulation method (low dose IL-2 with anti-human CD3/CD28). Regardless, when TILs were expanded using the standard stimulation method (high dose IL-2 only), the predominant T cell receptor beta variable (TRBV) chains that were used in both TIL-expanded clones of the CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations were similar. In addition, there were also TIL-expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones that were dominant in only one or the other subpopulations. These results reveal the bias in TIL quality after being stimulated with different protocols. Further studies are required to understand the selection of TIL expansion, in order for a more efficacy adoptive transfer treatment.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Methods: Fifty-one Thai patients with mixed dementia who received galantamine for at least 6 months were recruited. CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 polymorphisms were detected by TaqMan® Genotyping Assay. UGT1A1 and APOE polymorphism was detected by direct Sanger sequencing technique and restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Cpss of galantamine was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Associations of genetic and non-genetic factors with Cpss and clinical outcomes (change in cognitive function as measured by the Thai Mental State Examination (ΔTMSE) scores) were determined by using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The multivariate regression model revealed that patients who carried one or more detrimental allelic variant (CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and UGT1A1) showed a tendency toward a higher galantamine adjusted Cpss (B = 34.559, 95% CI = 0.741–68.377, p value = 0.045). Logistic regression analysis also revealed CYP2D6*10 carriers were significantly associated with higher ΔTMSE (B = 5.227, 95% CI = 2.395–8.060, p value = 0.001). UGT1A1 mutant alleles and non-genetic factors including concomitant use of statin drugs and higher education level can attenuate therapeutic outcomes of galantamine. Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic-related genes including CYP2D6*10 and UGT1A1 mutant alleles were significantly associated with galantamine adjusted Cpss and cognitive function. Determination of Cpss and genotype could be an adjunct examination to provide further explanation in interindividual variability of galantamine therapeutic outcome.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

In the past decade, air pollution sources in Vietnam have noticeably increased, resulting to the elevated concentrations of ambient air pollutants particularly fine PM or PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). Hence, investigating the short-term association between PM2.5 and MBDs is worthwhile. In this study, a quasi-Poisson time-series regression analysis was used to investigate the association between PM2.5 exposure and daily hospitalizations for MBDs to the Ho Chi Minh City Mental Health Hospital during 2017–2020. A natural cubic spline smooth function for time was used to screen out long-term and seasonality trends. Stratified analyses were also performed by sex, age, and season. During study period, 9,986 hospitalizations for MBDs were recorded and included in the analysis. Results suggested that a 10 μg/m3 daily increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a statistically significant 2.96% (95% confidence interval: 0.23%–5.76%) increase in hospitalizations for MBDs. The effects of PM2.5 exposure on hospital admissions were more pronounced in female patients and the middle-age group (35–59 years).

PAN/bio-based PU electrospun fiber mats at 75/25 were prepared via electrospinning technique using Taguchi experimental design with three parameters and four levels. It was found that all fiber mats illustrated smooth and continuous fiber. The properties of the electrospun fiber mats were optimized in accordance with the grey relational method. Furthermore, the fiber mats prepared from 14 wt% polymer concentration, 25 kV of applied voltage, and 16 cm of distance from tip to collector were determined to be the most suitable fabrication condition exhibiting an ionic conductivity of 3.11 mS/cm, the tensile strength of 44.16 MPa, and electrolyte uptake of 1,971%. Moreover, the fiber mats showed no dimensional change at a temperature of 150°C because of the incorporation of bio-based PU in the polymer network. The electrochemical stability of the Zn-ion battery with the developed separator was greater than that of the commercial glass fiber separator. Thus, the PAN/bio-based PU electrospun fiber can be considered a promising candidate as a separator for Zn-ion batteries.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

This research aimed to investigate the effect of nonthermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) argon and helium plasma on tapioca starch's physicochemical properties and techno-functionality. Dry starch samples were treated with plasma generated from argon and helium gases at different voltage levels (10 and 15 kV) for 5, 10, and 15 min. The treatment did not destroy the starch's crystalline structure, as evidenced by the birefringence under polarized light. Scanning electron micrographs showed dented starch granules. A marginal decrease in pH value of all treated samples was noted. A reduction in amylose and amylopectin molecular weight and increased reducing sugars were observed in the treated samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed a slight change in the 1047/1022 cm−1 absorbance ratio, indicating a change in short-range ordered degree of starch, while X-ray diffractometry showed a decrease in crystallinity. A significant reduction in peak viscosity, breakdown, and setback was observed. The gelatinized plasma-treated starch dispersion showed less shear-thinning and less thixotropic with increasing voltage and treatment times.

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model. The findings indicate that the proposed model delivers 85% more accurate privacy than the benchmark model.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence"
Scaffold-Free Cartilage Construct from Infrapatellar Fat Pad Stem Cells for Cartilage Restoration,"Sriwatananukulkit O., Tawonsawatruk T., Rattanapinyopituk K., Luangwattanawilai T., Srikaew N., Hemstapat R.",2022-03-01,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, Articular cartilages, Cartilage regeneration, Cells constructs, Infrapatellar fat pad, Mesenchymal stromal cells, Osteochondral defects, Pain, Post-implantation, Stem-cell, Adipose Tissue, Animals, Cartilage, Articular, Chondrogenesis, Pain, Rats, Stem Cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cartilage regeneration, infrapatellar fat pad, osteochondral defect, pain","Once damaged, the articular cartilage has a very limited intrinsic capacity for self-renewal due to its avascular nature. If left untreated, damaged cartilage can lead to progressive degeneration of bone and eventually causes pain. Infrapatellar fat pad adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (IPFP-ASCs) has a potential role for cartilage restoration. However, the therapeutic role for IPFP-ASCs remains to be evaluated in an appropriate osteochondral defect model. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential of using a three-dimensional (3D) cartilage construct of IPFP-ASCs as a promising source of cells to restore articular cartilage and to attenuate pain associated with the cartilage defect in an osteochondral defect model. The chondrogenic differentiation potential of the 3D cartilage construct derived from IPFP-ASCs was determined before implantation and postimplantation by gene expression and immunohistochemistry analysis. Pain-related behavior was also assessed by using a weight-bearing test. A significant pain-Associated with the osteochondral defect was observed in this model in all groups postinduction; however, this pain can spontaneously resolve within 3 weeks postimplantation regardless of implantation of IPFP-ASCs constructs. The expression of SOX9 and COL2A1 genes in addition to protein expression were strongly expressed in 3D construct IPFP-ASCs. The existence of mature chondrocytes, along with significant (p < 0.05) positive immunostaining for type II collagen and aggrecan, were identified in the implanted site for up to 12 weeks compared with the untreated group, indicating hyaline cartilage regeneration. Taken together, this study demonstrated the successful outcome of osteochondral regeneration with scaffold-free IPFP-ASCs constructs in an osteochondral defect rat model. It provides novel and interesting insights into the current hypothesis that 3D construct IPFP-ASCs may offer potential benefits as an alternative approach to repair the cartilage defect. This study provides evidence of using the human 3D scaffold-free infrapatellar fat pad adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (IPFP-ASCs) construct to restore the full-Thickness osteochondral defect in a rat model. This study showed that chondrogenic features of the construct could be retained for up to 12 weeks postimplantation. The results of this proof-of-concept study support that human 3D scaffold-free IPFP-ASCs construct has potential benefits in promoting the hyaline-like native cartilage restoration, which may be beneficial as a tissue-specific stem cell for cell-based cartilage therapy. There are several clinical advantages of IPFP-ASC including ease and minimal invasive harvesting, chondrogenic inducible property, and tissue-specific progenitors in the knee.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, engineering","Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"
Stasis and diversity in living fossils: Species delimitation and evolution of lingulid brachiopods,"Goto R., Takano T., Seike K., Yamashita M., Paulay G., Rodgers K.S., Hunter C.L., Tongkerd P., Sato S., Hong J.-S., Endo K.",2022-10-01,"Animals, Far East, Fossils, Hydrozoa, Invertebrates, Phylogeny, Biogeography, Cryptic species, DNA barcoding, Indo-West Pacific, Isthmus of Panama, Lingula","The Lingulidae are often considered living fossils, because they have shown little morphological change since the Paleozoic. Limited morphological variation has also made the taxonomic study of living lingulids challenging. We investigated species diversity and phylogenetic relationships of extant lingulids and show that they are substantially more diverse than realized, demonstrating that morphological stasis was commonly accompanied by speciation. Species delimitation based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences from 194 specimens sampled from East Asia, Australia, Oceania, and the Americas suggested 14–22 species in the lingulids (9–17 species in Lingula and 4–5 species in Glottidia), in contrast to the 11–12 species currently recognized globally in the family. Four-gene phylogenetic analyses supported the sister relationship between Lingula and Glottidia. Within Lingula, L. adamsi, which possesses large, brownish shells, was recovered as sister to all remaining Lingula species, which have more or less greenish shells. Within the greenish Lingula clade, the ‘L. anatina’ complex was sister to the clade that includes the ‘L. reevei’ complex. The ‘L. anatina’ complex was further separated into two major clades with partly separate ranges centered on (i) temperate East Asia, and (ii) the tropical west-central Pacific. Within Glottidia, Pacific species were nested within Atlantic species. Time-calibrated phylogenetic analyses suggested that Lingula likely originated in the early Cretaceous contrary to a previously proposed hypothesis advocating a Cenozoic origin. The separation of Lingula and Glottidia appears to date from the Mesozoic, not from the Carboniferous, contrary to a previous hypothesis. Overall, our results uncovered substantial cryptic diversity in lingulids, which will form the basis for conservation and further taxonomic revision.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

In this experimentation, all the quaternary blends were prepared by keeping the volume percentage of diesel fuel at 50% v/v, while concentrations of Mahua oil-based biodiesel, waste Palm oil-based biodiesel, and t-butyl peroxide were varied by volume. The prepared blends were utilized on a constant-speed single-cylinder 4-stroke turbocharged diesel engine for comprehensive analysis in contrast to diesel fuel. The obtained results depicted that the quaternary blend of 50% diesel fuel (D)/20% mixed biodiesel (MB)/30% t-butyl peroxide (TB) (D50-MB20TB30) at advanced injection timing of 25°bTDC has shown a 2.66% increment in exhaust gas temperature and a 2.12% reduction in brake thermal efficiency compared to diesel fuel. At peak load, emission parameters such as carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbon, and smoke opacity for D50-MB20TB30 were found to be respectively 4.59%, 3.47% and 5.03% lower than those of diesel fuel, although there was a slight increment by 0.83% of nitrogen oxide compared to diesel fuel. Considering combustion behaviours, heat release rate, cylinder pressure, and ignition delay were also observed to be 1.14%, 2.21%, and 8.34% lesser than conventional diesel fuel at 100% load, respectively. In closing, using the D50-MB20TB30 quaternary blend combined with advanced injection timing of 25°bTDC could offer a significant efficiency in improving the engine performance and reducing pollutant emissions, contributing to sustainable development and environment protection.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

A series of monometallic Fe, Co, and Ni and bimetallic CoMo, NiMo, and FeMo supported on MgO was prepared and tested for catalytic conversion of biogas in a fixed-bed reactor at 900 °C and 1 atm. Among the monometallic catalysts, Co/MgO shows the highest production yields of H2 and CNTs with excellent catalyst stability. Ni/MgO has a steadily deactivation with time on stream, while Fe/MgO exhibits the lowest catalytic performance due to the oxidation of iron species by CO2, resulting in a severe catalyst deactivation. For the bimetallic catalysts, the addition of Mo would greatly increase the production yields of H2 and CNTs due to the higher metal dispersion and SMSI effects. NiMo/MgO can achieve a remarkable 100%CO2 conversion, and 95%CH4 conversion, producing gas products comprising of H2 up to 74%v/v with H2/CO=3.1. NiMo/MgO and CoMo/MgO catalysts provided the higher yields of H2 and CNTs than FeMo/MgO catalyst, while FeMo/MgO produced the high graphitic CNTs due to the high solubility of carbon in Fe. The stability test under an extremely high GHSV of 600,000ml/g-h reveals that NiMo/MgO shows the excellent stability. CoMo/MgO is rapidly deactivated due to a large carbon deposition, while FeMo/MgO still suffers from CO2 oxidation, resulting in a severe deactivation. The long-term stability for 10h confirms that NiMo/MgO can perform the excellent catalytic performance. The process shows a high potential for simultaneous production of H2 and CNTs from abundant and renewable biogas.","process equipment, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

However, the nega-tive consequences of flooding on the local people and workers in industrial zones have been little studied. This study focuses on the impacts of flooding after 2011 on the well-being of residents in industrial zones in terms of their work and livelihoods. Community-based research was used to explore the effects of floods on 647 respondents who worked in Rojana Industrial Park (N = 247) and those who lived around the park (N = 400). A questionnaire survey was conducted in February 2020. The results showed adverse impacts on the economy, accommodation, and well-being of both the local inhabitants and workers, whose monthly incomes and overtime jobs decreased signif-icantly compared to before the disaster. However, local people suffered more from low incomes than workers of the company, as the employees’ work status was maintained during the crisis. Japanese company culture is investigated as a factor in the higher resilience and recovery levels of company employees than the Rojana community. In addition, the workers were evacuated to other accommodations until the company recovered, while locals remained in their flooded homes. In addition, most respondents reported that mental health impacts were more likely to affect their mental health. For effective recovery and flood risk management, the government should follow up on em-ployment, accommodation, and livelihood after a sud-den flood, especially for the local people. A greater understanding of community risk, community engage-ment, and awareness-raising activities can enhance readiness, response, recovery, and resilience in disaster management by government, businesses, and local communities.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

The key parameters affecting the grafting efficiency of NR-g-NaAA were investigated in terms of the fill factor (FF) of the chamber, mixing time, and NaAA content. Lastly, the grafted sample (with a suitable grafting efficiency) was crosslinked using peroxide curing to produce X(NR-g-NaAA) as a hydrophilic NR sample. Results showed that grafting efficiency of the NR-g-NaAA samples tended to decrease with increasing FF and NaAA contents owing to the higher chain-scission reaction rather than the free-radical generation on the NR molecules in the mastication step, while the optimal mixing time was only 4 min. The remarkable improvement in the hydrophilicity of NR by grafting with NaAA was established via the presence of C = O vibration of the ionized carboxylate group (–COO−) of NaAA located at 1559 cm−1. Increasing the grafting efficiency up to 69% resulted in a marked decrease in the water contact angle from 103° to 72° and enhanced the water swelling of the X(NR-g-NaAA) sample.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Occupational factors have previously been mentioned as contributing to decreased kidney function and the development of chronic kidney disease of unknown cause. Sea salt workers are one of the occupations facing high outdoor temperatures and a highly, intensive workload. Objective. The purpose of the study was to examine whether the kidney function of sea salt workers at the beginning of the harvest season differs from kidney function at the end of the harvest season and to identify factors that can predict the change of kidney function. Material and methods. Data were collected from salt workers (n=50) who were between 18–60 years of age without hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease in Samut Sakhon province, Thailand. Urine specific gravity (USG) was used for hydration status and the estimated glomerular filter rate (eGFR) was used to measure kidney function. The mixed model was used to find differences over the harvest season and prediction of factors. Results. On average, the eGFR was estimated to decrease by 15.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 over the harvest season. The decline in eGFR of sea salt workers with moderate and heavy workloads were significantly faster than their light workload counterparts after controlling for other covariates. Similarly, dehydration (USG ≥ 1.030) significantly accelerated the rate of kidney function loss. Conclusions. Our study confirmed exposure to heat over the harvest season leads to decreased eGFR in sea salt workers. The rate of change of eGFR could be predicted by workload and hydration status. Workers with dehydration who performed medium to heavy workloads in farms showed faster kidney function decline than those who performed light workload.",medical,Medicine (all)

In this paper, the impact of PWM methods on the reliability of the dc-link capacitors in three-level NPC inverters is investigated by considering the capacitor power loss and their thermal stress. The evaluation results indicate that the PWM method which aims at minimizing the switching loss may introduce a significant power loss in the dc-link capacitors due to high amplitude of the low-frequency neutral-point (NP) voltage fluctuation. In that case, the thermal stress of the dc-link capacitors can be significantly increased, especially when the discontinuous modulation scheme is applied, affecting the reliability of the dc-link capacitors.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Electrical and Electronic Engineering

The long-term stability test for 7h shows that the catalysts promoted with Mo, Zr, and W could provide almost complete CO2 conversion at 900°C and under a high GHSV of 45,000ml/g-h. The analysis of spent catalysts shows that deposited carbon composed of well-structured multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with high graphitization (IG/ID = 2.14), compared to the commercial CNTs (IG/ID = 0.74). The as-synthesized CNTs could achieve 91%w/w purity without any purification. The process test at high temperature of 1000°C, provides higher graphitization (IG/ID = 3.76) with compensation of lower yield of CNTs.

Anti-aging strategies aim to mitigate, delay and reverse aging-associated diseases, thereby improving quality of life and reducing the burden of age-related pathologies. The natural dietary antioxidant supplementation offers substantial pharmacological and therapeutic effects against various disease conditions. Astaxanthin is one such natural carotenoid with superior antioxidant activity than other carotenoids, as well as well as vitamins C and E, and additionally, it is known to exhibit a plethora of pharmacological effects. The present review summarizes the protective molecular mechanisms of actions of astaxanthin on age-related diseases of multiple organs such as Neurodegenerative diseases [Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Status Epilepticus (SE)], Bone Related Diseases [Osteoarthritis (OA) and Osteoporosis], Cancers [Colon cancer, Prostate cancer, Breast cancer, and Lung Cancer], Cardiovascular disorders [Hypertension, Atherosclerosis and Myocardial infarction (MI)], Diabetes associated complications [Diabetic nephropathy (DN), Diabetic neuropathy, and Diabetic retinopathy (DR)], Eye disorders [Age related macular degeneration (AMD), Dry eye disease (DED), Cataract and Uveitis], Gastric Disorders [Gastritis, Colitis, and Functional dyspepsia], Kidney Disorders [Nephrolithiasis, Renal fibrosis, Renal Ischemia reperfusion (RIR), Acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperuricemia], Liver Diseases [Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Alcoholic Liver Disease (AFLD), Liver fibrosis, and Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion (IR) Injury], Pulmonary Disorders [Pulmonary Fibrosis, Acute Lung injury (ALI), and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)], Muscle disorders (skeletal muscle atrophy), Skin diseases [Atopic dermatitis (ATD), Skin Photoaging, and Wound healing].

Novel BiVO4-nanosheet-supported MoS2-nanoflake-heterostructure with synergistic enhanced photocatalytic removal of tetracycline under visible light irradiation,"Koutavarapu R., Jang W.Y., Rao M.C., Arumugam M., Shim J.",2022-10-01,"Antibacterials, Bismuth-based semiconductor, In-situ hydrothermal synthesis, Nano-flakes, Photo-catalytic removal, Photocatalytic performance, Synergistic interface, Tetracycline, Visible light, Visible-light irradiation, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bismuth, Catalysis, Light, Molybdenum, Tetracycline, Vanadates, Bismuth-based semiconductor, In-situ hydrothermal synthesis, MoS2, Synergistic interface, Tetracycline, Visible light","This paper describes a simple in-situ hydrothermal technique for the production of BiVO4/MoS2 binary nanocomposites as visible-light-driven catalysts. The as-prepared samples were analyzed by structural, morphological, compositional, optical, surface area, and photocurrent analyses. The lattice fringe spaces at 0.304 nm and 0.612 nm were indexed to the (112) and (002) crystal planes of BiVO4 and MoS2, respectively. Antibacterial photocatalytic capabilities were assessed using tetracycline (TC). Consequently, it was observed that the BiVO4/MoS2 nanocomposite demonstrated improved antibacterial removal ability compared with the pristine samples. The BiVO4/MoS2 nanocomposite exhibited 97.46% removal of TC compared with the pure BiVO4 (43.76%) and MoS2 (35.28%) samples within 90 min. Thus, the photocatalytic performance was observed to follow the given order: BiVO4/MoS2 nanocomposite > BiVO4 > MoS2. The removal of TC after 90 min of irradiation was approximately 97.46%, 96.62%, 95.59%, and 94.45% after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cycles, respectively. Thus, the recycling tests revealed the stability of the photocatalyst, which exhibited a TC removal efficiency of 94.45% without distinct decay, even after the 4th cycle. According to the trapping results, hydroxyl radicals and holes were the key species and demonstrated a greater influence on the photocatalytic performance than superoxide radicals. The increased activity of the BiVO4/MoS2 nanocomposite may be attributed to its large surface area and tunable bandgap, which accelerate the charge-transport characteristics of the photocatalytic system. This insight and synergetic effects can provide a new approach for the development of novel heterostructure photocatalysts.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Moreover, its continuous supply increases the quality of life and indeed the economic development of a country. The power sector in Pakistan is continuously under stress due to the imbalance between the demand and supply of energy. Pakistan has abundant renewable energy resources, i.e., solar, hydro, wind, etc., which are the main elements of green energy. This study first evaluates the existing power sector in Pakistan. Then, we proposed a peer-to-peer energy trading framework that helps in reducing the stress on the power sector in Pakistan by meeting the local energy demands of the consumers with the help of local energy generation. In the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading market, a novel method for determining the uniform energy trading price is proposed. This proposed pricing method increases the utilities of the market participants i.e., saving in energy bills for consumers and profitability for the sellers. The proposed study assumes that solar energy is provided from the energy producer side. Solar energy penetration on various ratios starting from 14% to 35% is tested on environment and consumer satisfaction levels. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed method and the results suggest that a 35% penetration of solar in each subdivision can be helpful to decrease the current stress on Pakistans' power sector. Furthermore, it also helps in reducing the carbon emission footprint.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Bio-fuel production from catalytic fast pyrolysis of Jatropha wastes using pyroprobe GC/MS and drop tube pyrolyzer,"Kaewpengkrow P.R., Atong D., Sricharoenchaikul V.",2022-08-01,"Bio-oils, Catalytic upgrading, Drop tubes, Fast pyrolysis, Jatropha wastes, Oxygenated compounds, Pd/activated carbon catalysts, Pyrolyze, Thermal conversion, ]+ catalyst, Bio-oil, Catalytic upgrading, Fast pyrolysis, Jatropha wastes, Thermal conversion","The effects of temperature and catalytic activity on the decomposition of Jatropha waste to bio-oil under rapid pyrolysis were investigated in this study. The pyrolytic conversion of Jatropha wastes was performed at the temperature range of 400–700 °C. The reactions were conducted and compared between two operations, an analytical pyroprobe GC/MS (µg-scale reactor) and a larger scale, drop tube pyrolyzer. Added catalysts were modified metal (Ce, Co, Ni, and Pd) over activated carbon (Ac) support. In non-catalytic trials, Jatropha wastes pyrolyzed at 600 °C yielded vapor products of mainly oxygenated compounds of acid-ester, aldehyde, and ketone. Addition of Ni/Ac and Pd/Ac catalysts resulted in significantly higher aromatic and total hydrocarbon (aliphatic and cyclic) fractions. The findings suggested that these catalysts are suitable for further investigation with a scaled-up fast pyrolysis sequential process, a drop tube reactor, to convert Jatropha waste into bio-oil as well as various gaseous and solid byproducts depending on the operating conditions. In this case, the maximum liquid products (bio-oil) yield of 40 wt% was obtained at the reaction temperature of 600 °C and particle size of 0.125–0.425 mm with the presence of Ac. Reaction at 600 °C with Pd/Ac catalyst yielded bio-oil with the highest HHV of 29.20 MJ/kg with a pH of 6.78. Analysis of bio-oil by GC/MS revealed the main favorable products as phenols, aromatics, and hydrocarbons which increased almost two folds from base case with Ni/Ac and Pd/Ac addition. Since low oxygenated compounds, high aromatics, and hydrocarbon compounds of bio-oil are desirable, the results indicate that the bio-oil at the optimized condition can be readily applied as biofuel. Moreover, the obtained biochar as a co-product from fast pyrolysis of Jatropha wastes can be used as an alternative solid fuel.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

Oxygen electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals are of prime importance. Trimetallic catalysts have demonstrated reliable activities but their average performance, difficult synthesis techniques, and high synthesis costs limit their widespread use. Herein, the facile ball milling technique is introduced as an efficient and low-cost method for the synthesis of catalysts based on trimetallic NiFeCo nanometer-scale particles distributed over a CNT-graphene-like (NiFeCo-NC) structure. NiFeCo-NC is synthesized instantaneously from ball milling of melamine with industrial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with trimetallic particles. Results demonstrate that the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst, synthesized from 2 g of melamine per 1 g of each metal salt, performed well in both ORR and OER. The potential difference between the half-wave reduction potential of the ORR (E1/2) and the oxidation potential at 10 mA cm−2 (E10) in OER reveals a better performance of the NiFeCo-NC2 as a bifunctional catalyst than other synthesized materials and reference catalysts. A zinc-air battery (ZAB) having the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst performs better than the batteries using other catalysts. The NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst also exhibits excellent methanol tolerance, revealing its applicability for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. Ball milling offers a simple, effective, versatile, and cost-effective mechano-chemical procedure for the concomitant one-pot mixing-synthesis of materials.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

This study compared the newly formed tissue and angiogenesis-related bone healing after sinus floor augmentation using large or small DBBM particles. Materials and Methods: Overall 32 patients were randomly divided into two groups using either large (1–2 mm) or small (0.25–1 mm) DBBM particles for sinus floor augmentation. After 6 months, the mineralized tissue volume was calculated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. The newly formed tissue composition was histomorphometrically analyzed. Angiogenesis was also examined by means of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Implant failure and marginal bone loss were measured at a 1-year follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed using independent samples t-test. Results: Micro-CT analysis demonstrated that grafting with large particles resulted in higher bone volume (6.99 ± 2.72 mm3, p = 0.002) and Bone Volume/Tissue Volume (0.25 ± 0.1, p = 0.03) compared with small particles (3.76 ± 1.83 mm3 and 0.14 ± 0.13, respectively). Small particles showed higher non-mineralized tissue volume (26.31 mm3) compared with large particle group (17.4 ± 5.34 mm3) with p = 0.001. The histological data revealed significantly higher area of newly formed bone (32.15% ± 14.04% for the large particle and 15.99% ± 14.12% for the small particle groups, p = 0.004). Likewise, non-mineralized tissue was significantly greater in the small particle group (66.48% ± 20.97%) compared with the large particle group (44.36%, p = 0.016). Moreover, use of large particles resulted in a significantly higher VEGF staining intensity score and VEFG positive cells. No implant failure was recorded in both groups, while no difference was found in terms of marginal bone loss at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Sinus floor augmentation using large DBBM particles resulted in more angiogenesis expression, higher bone volume, and new bone formation at 6 months after sinus augmentation. However, clinical outcomes with regards to implant placement were similar in both groups.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"

More Bartonella species are being identified as the cause of human diseases, and several of them have been linked to domestic and wild animals. Bats are outstanding reservoirs for Bartonella species because of their wide distribution, mobility, roosting behaviour, and long life span. Here, we carried out a PCR-based survey on bats that were collected from 19 sampling sites in eight provinces of Thailand from February 2018 to April 2021. Bartonella infection was investigated in a total of 459 bats that belong to 24 different bat species (21 species of which had never been previously studied in Thailand). PCR diagnostics revealed that 115 out of 459 (25.5%) blood samples tested positive for Bartonella. The nucleotide identities of the Bartonella 16S rRNA sequences in this study were between 95.78-99.66% identical to those of known zoonotic species (Bartonella ancashensis, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella bacilliformis and Bartonella australis) as well as to an unidentified Bartonella spp. In addition, the citrate synthase (gltA) and RNA polymerase-beta subunit (rpoB) genes of Bartonella were sequenced and analyzed in positive samples. The gltA and rpoB gene sequences from Hipposideros gentilis and Rhinolophus coelophyllus bat samples showed low nucleotide identity (<95%) compared to those of the currently deposited sequences in the GenBank database, indicating the possibility of new Bartonella species. The phylogenetic inference and genetic diversity were generated and indicated a close relationship with other Bartonella species previously discovered in Asian bats. Overall, the current study demonstrates the primary evidence pointing to a potential novel Bartonella species in bats. This discovery also contributes to our current understanding of the geographical distribution, genetic diversity, and host ranges of bat-related Bartonella.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

This meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively examine the impact of all phosphate lowering agents on various aspects of clinical and laboratory outcomes in CKD patients. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials until July 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effects of each phosphate lowering agent with controls, comprising placebo and all other phosphate lowering agents. Various clinical and laboratory outcomes were analyzed. Random effects model was used to compute the standardized mean difference for continuous variables and the risk ratio (RR) for binary variables. Results: This meta-analysis included 127 RCTs with 20,215 patients. Sevelamer and lanthanum significantly reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.610, 95% CI 0.401–0.929 and 0.467, 95% CI 0.337–0.647, respectively) but not cardiovascular (CV) mortality or CV events. Hospitalization rates were significantly diminished by sevelamer (RR 0.527; 95% CI 0.308–0.902). Certain phosphate lowering agents improved biochemical parameters including serum phosphate, calcium, coronary artery calcium scores, fibroblast growth factor-23, bone biomarkers, and lipid profiles. Intact parathyroid hormone and bone mineral density were not significantly changed. Conclusions: In addition to decreasing serum phosphate levels, various beneficial effects on clinical and laboratory parameters of phosphate lowering agents might play potential roles in diminishing morbidity and mortality in CKD patients.

Fundamental knowledge regarding the properties of CF is required to formulate food products with desirable qualities. This study aimed to investigate the pasting properties, thermal properties, and viscoelastic behavior of CF, containing rice flour (RF), mung bean flour (MF), and mung bean protein concentrate (MPC). The protein contents of the CF were 17.6%-23.6% on a wet basis. Findings: The CF containing the highest proportion of RF had the highest pasting temperature, peak viscosity, breakdown, setback, and melting enthalpy of retrograded amylopectin. The deconvoluted thermogram from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) clearly distinguished the endotherms that arose from starch gelatinization, protein denaturation, and melting of the amylose−lipid complex. The gelatinization endotherm of CF was mainly governed by RF. CF containing a higher proportion of RF and MPC had stronger elastic behavior. Conclusions: The type and composition of the flour greatly affected the physicochemical and viscoelastic properties of the CF. RF played an important role in the pasting and thermal properties of the CF samples. Combining RF and MPC could be used to enhance the elastic behavior of dough from CF systems. Significance and Novelty: Deconvoluted DSC peaks provided insight into the multiple thermal transitions that occurred during the processing of CF-based foods. The overall results from this study could help in the formulation of food containing rice−mung bean CF in excess water or in a dough system.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, chemistry","Food Science, Organic Chemistry"

The damage was great-est to the industrial sector, accounting for more than 70% of the estimated economic damage, and the re-sulting disruption of the supply chains of global companies has spread not only throughout Thailand but to other countries around the world. In order to reduce such damage, it is necessary to prepare a flood man-ual that makes use of past flood experiences or a business continuity planning (BCP) that assumes floods. In addition, business continuity management (BCM) is needed to establish and enhance BCP. Thus, it is es-sential to obtain flood information on the scale of an industrial park. Therefore, in this study, to provide detailed flood information as above, in addition to a flood inundation analysis model for the Chao Phraya River Basin, a detailed model on the scale of an industrial park was developed. Specifically, we developed a 40 m mesh industrial park-scale model based on survey data using a local aerial laser and the local river channel shape. Furthermore, using the flood discharge and river discharge output obtained from a 1 km mesh model of the Chao Phraya River Basin as inputs for the industrial park scale model for the surrounding boundary conditions, we obtained a more precise inundation analysis. As a result, the flood risk information obtained from the above analysis model can be useful for BCP/BCM. In addition, detailed flood risk information such as road inundation conditions can be obtained at any location, which could be useful in creating evacuation plans for employees.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

The results were compared with that of a conventionally unsafe TD, tetramethyl thiuram disulfide (TMTD) combined with MBT, to evaluate the efficiencies of these nitrosamine-safe TD accelerators for industrial applications. The curing and mechanical properties of rubber vulcanization were investigated to understand the synergism between MBT and nitrosoamine-safe TDs. The results indicate that novel TDs combined with MBT significantly improve the curing characteristics and mechanical properties following to the TDs with smaller molecular size and higher basicity. The MBT/BPTD system had higher modulus values because BPTD has a higher molar mass, which facilitates a better distribution of accelerators in the rubber matrix. Overall, the MBT/EPTD accelerator systems with equal molar ratios can compete with the curing rates, tensile strengths, and moduli of unsafe TMTD accelerator systems in the vulcanization of rubber.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

To address these difficulties, many techniques have been proposed including inhibitor addition, artificial SEI, and Zn electrode modification. As a result, some researchers believe that using non-proton donor electrolytes or nonaqueous electrolytes can fundamentally solve these problems. Herein, the efforts to apply nonaqueous electrolytes such as organic electrolytes, room-temperature ionic liquids, and deep-eutectic solvents to ZIBs are described. An understanding of the mechanisms of nonaqueous ZIBs (NZIBs) regarding zinc plating/stripping and intercalation/deintercalation is also highlighted. Importantly, research gaps are identified in order to pave the way for future study. In addition, an attempt is made to offer a viewpoint on critical topics as well as a benchmarking and enhancement of NZIB technologies.","corrosion, energy, engineering, chemistry","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electrochemistry"

With the rise of various industrial wastes and with the emergence of COVID-19 wastes, a sustainable approach is needed to mitigate the growing concern about wastes. Thermochemical treatment technologies in the form of direct combustion, torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification have been identified to have vital roles in the value-creation of various waste streams. Moreover, the alignment of thermochemical processes for waste mitigation concerning the circular economy framework needs to be established. Accordingly, a comprehensive review of the different thermochemical treatment options for industrial and the novel COVID-19 medical wastes streams is conducted in this study. This review focuses on highlighting the instrumental role of thermochemical conversion platforms in achieving a circular economy in the industrial sector. Various strategies in waste mitigation through various thermochemical processes such as management, recovery, reduction, and treatment are discussed. The results show that thermochemical technologies are beneficial in addressing the sustainability concerns on mitigating wastes from the industrial sector and wastes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. This also includes the current issues faced as well as future perspectives of the thermochemical conversion technologies.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, waste management and pollution policy, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, there is no evidence to support this assertion. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the effect of the alkasite restorative material on the pH of Streptococcus mutans biofilm and dentin hardness. Methods: Streptococcus mutans biofilms were formed on Filtek™ Z350 (FZ, a resin composite) and Cention® N (CN, the alkasite restorative material) and their pH determined after 24 h. Hydroxide, fluoride, and calcium-ions released from the materials were determined at 6 h, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Dentin specimens were prepared from 14 human molars and divided into four quadrants. Quadrant 1 was a sound dentin control, quadrants 2–4 were chemically demineralized, and a cylinder of FZ and CN placed on the surfaces of quadrants 2 and 4, respectively. The microhardness of quadrants 1 and 3 were measured at depths of 20, 40, and 60 µm from the occlusal surface, and similarly of quadrants 2 and 4, after 30 days. Independent t-test, Mann–Whitney-U, and repeated-measure-ANOVA were used for data analysis. Results: The pH of biofilm on CN (4.45) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that on FZ (4.06). The quantity of all ions released from CN was significantly higher than from FZ. The hardness of demineralized dentin under CN was significantly higher than that of demineralized dentin at all depths, and higher than that of demineralized dentin under FZ at 20 and 40 µm. Conclusions: CN released hydroxide, fluoride, and calcium ions, which was associated with raising the biofilm pH and the hardness of demineralized dentin. All results indicated that CN had the potential to reduce the incidence of secondary caries.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of additional analgesic methods combined with periarticular injection (PAI) analgesia for TKA. Methods: Using retrospective cohort data, patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia and PAI were divided into 4 groups. Group A (control) comprised 66 patients; group B (73 patients) had additional adductor canal block; group C (70 patients) obtained additional femoral nerve block, and group D (73 patients) received additional adductor canal block and intrathecal morphine. Propensity score matching was applied to compare visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, cumulative morphine use (CMU), knee flexion angle, straight leg raise, length of hospital stay, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Results: There was no significant difference regarding VAS and morphine use, when either group B or C was compared with group A. Group D had significantly lower VAS than groups A, B, and C during the first 24 hours after surgery and required significantly less CMU than groups A and B. However, the pain score of group D increased afterward, with significantly longer length of hospital stay than groups A and B. There was no difference in straight leg raise among the groups. Conclusion: Additional peripheral nerve block to PAI provides no benefit for patients undergoing TKA. Adjuvant intrathecal morphine could significantly reduce the VAS and CMU in the acute postoperative period; however, rebound pain with prolonged hospital stays was observed.","orthopedic surgery, medical",Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

Its Optical Signal Noise Ratio (OSNR) is linear to input power, and thus degrades over lower inputs causing thicker data waveforms at longer SMFs. Across higher inputs, the dominant effect is data pattern shown as multiple overshoots of bit 1. The longer Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) and slow SOA's response worsen pattern effect. Our SOA's response is approximate 60 ps. Comparing at 10-11 Bit Error Rate (BER), the SOA's Input Power Dynamic Range (IPDR) is reduced from 9.75 dB using shorter PRBS7 to 3.4 dB using PRBS31. The BER results of 1-channel amplification at 6 SOA's inputs confirm both OSNR degradation and pattern effect. The optimal input with minimum BER is -13 dBm, corresponding to 40-km SMF's attenuation. All BER curves of 4-channel amplification after 10, 20, 30 and 40-km SMFs are plotted. As SMF expands, the additional penalties due to Chromatic Dispersion (CD) at 10-9 BER rise from 0.25 dB to 1 dB. Comparing 1 and 4-channel amplifications, the additional penalties due to Cross Gain Modulation (XGM) are 2-2.25 dB. Ultimately, our pre-amplifier SOA can extend the 10-km limit of 100GBASE-LR4 link to 40 km with a total penalty of 5.75 dB. Furthermore, it can be applied as the inline-amplifier to achieve 80-km distance, based on 10-12 BER result at -5 dBm received power by QSFP28 transceiver.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture, Information Systems, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Especially in education, detecting learners' confusion and resolving it timely is crucial for effective teaching. Most research on facial expression recognition has only focused on detecting six basic emotions that do not include confusion. Even though the problem of detecting confusion has recently received more attention from researchers, analysis of both the spatial and temporal information with sufficient data is still short. In this study, we present a spatial-temporal network for detecting confusion in video images that was trained on the BAUM-1 database that collected by Zhalehpour et al. in 2017, which is, as far as we know, the largest public video dataset of labelled confusion images. The model includes the ResNet-18 Convolutional Neural Network for learning spatial information from facial images, and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) for learning temporal information. By cascading two deep learning structures, our method reaches a more accurate result (73%) on the BAUM-1a database than the baseline LSTM network (67%). We also tested with our CUPIC-Confusion video dataset, which was collected from recording 15 participants' faces while they were watching a confusing video in an uncontrolled environment. The proposed model predicted one instance from 30 consecutive facial images within 0.04 sec. with 66% accuracy, while the baseline model took 0.02 sec. with 47%. Our method can be applied to any task that gains benefit from the automatic detection of confusion, such as supporting teachers or speakers to recognize confusion in their audience without manually observing them, improving human-machine interaction tasks, and supporting those who have difficulties with confusion perception.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, medical, sociology","Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Information Systems and Management, Health Informatics, Transportation, Public Administration"

The large rock salt deposits of the Maha Sarakham Formation represent a very promising location. Designing salt caverns is still a complex issue. In this paper, the stability of typical cavern shapes (spherical, cylindrical, teardrop, bulb, and pear) was evaluated based on displacement, von Mises stress, safety factor, and volume change. The analysis aimed to find the optimal cavern shape for salt deposits at Ban Nong Plue, Borabue district, Maha Sarakham province, northeast Thailand. The Finite Element simulations investigating the cavern stability are carried out for a time span of 600 years (> 500 years is considered permanent storage). The bulb-shaped cavern yielded the best results, indicating that it constitutes the optimal shape in the given geological conditions. The stability of all analyzed caverns showed a dependence on the operating stage. Each stability factor exhibited large differences between the periods of cavern construction/brine discharge and pre-pressurization by CO2 injection. A lower cavern pressure negatively affected the evaluated factors. The results can be useful in planning future cavern fields for CO2 storage (and other gases) in salt deposits.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy, engineering","Pollution, Energy (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Membrane-permeable trehalose improves the freezing ability and developmental competence of in-vitro matured feline oocytes,"Arayatham S., Buntasana S., Padungros P., Tharasanit T.",2022-03-15,"Animals, Blastocyst, Cats, Cryopreservation, Fertilization in Vitro, Freezing, In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques, Oocytes, Trehalose, Cat, Cryopreservation, Oocyte, Trehalose hexaacetate","Oocytes are highly sensitive to cryopreservation, which frequently results in an irreversible loss of developmental competence. We examined the effect of membrane-permeable trehalose on the freezing ability of feline oocytes matured in vitro. In Experiment 1, intracellular trehalose (trehalose hexaacetate; Tre-(OAc)6) was synthesized from trehalose precursor and subjected to spectroscopic characterization. The membrane permeability of the Tre-(OAc)6 was investigated by incubating oocytes with different concentrations of Tre-(OAc)6 (3, 15, and 30 mM). Optimum concentration and the toxicity of Tre-(OAc)6 were assessed in Experiment 2. The effects of Tre-(OAc)6 on freezing ability in terms of apoptotic gene expression and developmental competence of in-vitro matured oocytes were examined in Experiments 3 and 4, respectively. The Tre-(OAc)6 permeated into the ooplasm of cat oocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The highest concentration of intracellular trehalose was detected when the oocytes were incubated for 24 h with 30 mM Tre-(OAc)6. For the toxicity test, incubation of oocytes with 3 mM Tre-(OAc)6 for 24 h did not affect maturation rate and embryo development. However, high doses of Tre-(OAc)6 (15 and 30 mM) significantly reduced maturation and fertilization rates (p < 0.05). In addition, frozen-thawed oocytes treated with 3 mM Tre-(OAc)6 significantly upregulated anti-apoptotic (BCL-2) gene expression compared with the control (0 mM) and other Tre-(OAc)6 concentrations (15 and 30 mM). Oocyte maturation in the presence of 3 mM Tre-(OAc)6 prior to cryopreservation significantly improved oocyte developmental competence in terms of cleavage and blastocyst rates when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Our results lead us to infer that increasing the levels of intracellular trehalose by Tre-(OAc)6 during oocyte maturation improves the freezing ability of feline oocytes, albeit at specific concentrations.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

In Thailand, there is only one study that reported the occurrence of Mycoplasma suis without other haemoplasma species. In this study, we examined the molecular occurrence and genetic diversity of porcine haemoplasmas in Thai domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) from commercial farms using a PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene, DNA sequencing, nucleotide sequence type (ntST) analysis and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 665 blood samples were collected from pigs at thirteen farms located in eight provinces of Thailand during 2019–2020. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and tested by PCR. The frequency of haemoplasma infection was 37.1% (247/665, 95% CI: 33.5%–40.9%) in all pigs. Among 247 PCR positive samples, 194 were sequenced and analysed by nucleotide BLAST, ntST diversity, phylogenetic trees and ntST networks. The results of this genetic analysis indicated that at least four species with 27 nucleotide sequence types (Mycoplasma suis, Mycoplasma parvum, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemosuis and a putative novel species) of porcine haemoplasmas were identified. Thus, it appears that haemoplasmas show a high genetic diversity in the Thai pig population. In addition, a putative novel species was genetically characterized by other markers, namely, the 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA (rnpB) genes. For phylogenetic analysis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haemosuis was placed into the Mycoplasma haemofelis group, and the three remaining species were placed into the Mycoplasma suis group in all trees containing the 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and rnpB genes. Further studies, such as pathobiology and epidemiology, should be conducted to better characterize this putative novel species.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

The H2 production performance was evaluated in batch fermentation, and revealed that this strain can grow and produce H2 at a broad range of temperatures (15–40 °C), pH (4–10), and initial glucose concentrations (5–60 g/L). The maximum H2 yield (3.11 molH2/molglucose) was obtained at 37 °C, pH 8, and an initial glucose concentration of 10 g/L. Furthermore, this strain could utilize various carbon sources, including xylose, xylan, starch, mannose, glycerol, and avicel cellulose, amongst others. Additionally, CUEA01 was compatible with agro-industrial wastes and could achieve a maximum CHP of 4639 mL/L and 4024 mL/L from sugarcane molasses and cassava pulp, respectively. This demonstrates that CUEA01 has a potential for H2 fermentation from complex organic wastes since it can secrete enzyme cocktails that consolidate the fermentation process.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, the existing Explainable Recommendation systems face one of these two limitations. The first limitation is the utilization of a pre-defined feature set to represent the users/items' preferences. By representing the preferences with a pre-defined feature set, the uniqueness of each user will be limited by the characteristics of the pre-defined set. For the other limitation, the user/item preference representation in existing models is constructed from the entire past interactions. This can mislead the model because the user's preferences change over the interaction's characteristics. Therefore, the entire past interactions might not be able to represent the user's preferences for the target interaction. In this paper, we proposed an Explainable Recommendation system, which represents the user's preferences with a personalized feature set and is able to adapt the target user/item preference representation to suit the target interaction's characteristics. By representing the users/items' preferences with a personalized feature set, the proposed method is able to give the score of importance in the rating contribution to each feature and uses these scores to assume the reasons for the user's decision. To make the representation suitable to the target interaction's characteristics, the proposed model utilizes only the target interaction's information to represent the preferences of users/items. The proposed method also is not relying on the entire past interactions to avoid the bias of dominant features in the past interactions. For the experiment, the proposed method consistently outperforms all baselines on three benchmark datasets. We also analyze the explanation resulting from the proposed model to support our assumptions that the preferences of the user are unique and dynamically change over the interaction's characteristics.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Lignocellulosic wastes were added to an alkaline medium and autoclaved, which led to a combined alkaline and hydrothermal pretreatment. For biosurfactant production, alkaliphilic Brevibacterium casei NK8 was added to the medium without pH neutralization. Among several lignocellulosic wastes, the media with corn husk, coconut oil cake, and defatted rice bran gave the highest biosurfactant concentrations (1.14–1.32 g L−1). These wastes provided a relatively high concentration of soluble substrates in the pretreated liquid, while solid residues swelled. The bacterium could use the pretreated liquid and solid residues for growth and biosurfactant production. The produced biosurfactants in cell-free broth could be applied directly or after lignin removal. The residual lignin decreased biosurfactant performance in terms of surface tension, contact angle, and oil displacement; conversely, lignin enhanced the biosurfactant emulsification capacity. Cell-free broths with and without lignin were appropriate for different tasks. Biosurfactants synthesized from different lignocellulosic wastes were similar and were identified as a mixture of zwitterionic lipopeptides and phospholipids. The surface tension of the crude biosurfactant solution was extremely low, ranging between 25.9 and 27.6 mN m−1 over a wide range of pH values (1–11), salinities (2–10% NaCl), and temperatures (4–121 °C).

In this study, the physicochemical properties and bioactivity of levan synthesized by recombinant levansucrase from Erwinia tasmaniensis were investigated. The synthesis conditions, including the enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, and temperature, were optimized. The obtained levan generally appeared as a cloudy suspension. However, it could transform into a hydrogel at concentrations exceeding 10 % (w/v). Then, ultrasonication was utilized to reduce the molecular weight and increase the bioavailability of levan. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) indicated that the size of levan was significantly decreased by ultrasonication, whereas Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray powder diffraction revealed that the chemical structure of levan was not changed. Finally, the bioactivities of both levan forms were examined using human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells. The result clearly illustrated that sonicated levan had higher antiproliferative activity in Saos-2 cells than original levan. Sonicated levan also activated Toll-like receptor expression at the mRNA level. These findings suggested the important beneficial applications of sonicated levan for the development of cancer therapies.",biochemistryistry,"Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

Given the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) variability on SEA climate, this study examines SST representation in climate models to investigate its potential contribution to the resulting model biases over the Philippines. Observed SST over SEA is first characterized by its spatial patterns and temporal variability. An analysis of the SST representation over SEA and its potential influence on modelled climate over the Philippines in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) is then conducted, followed by an assessment of the potential influence of SST representation in CMIP5 GCMs on downscaled regional climate output. Our results show that GCMs with well represented SSTs (i.e., low bias, well captured variability, and pattern) can produce climate simulations well over the Philippines. Whether or not the GCMs with poor SST representation can perform well is inconclusive. During boreal winter (summer), climate variables with high (low) spatial correlation with model SST get poor (better) spatial correlation with observed climate. Over west of the Philippines, where model SST seasonal variability is captured well, models also adequately simulate climate variables. Results suggest that the negative temperature biases, and positive precipitation and wind speed biases, in both GCMs and downscaled simulations, are associated with negative model SST biases. These findings give a better understanding on how SST potentially influences modelled climatology over the Philippines.",earth sciences,Atmospheric Science

Helicene-Hydrazide Encapsulated Ethyl Cellulose as a Potential Fluorescence Sensor for Highly Specific Detection of Nonanal in Aqueous Solutions and a Proof-of-Concept Clinical Study in Lung Fluid,"Jongkhumkrong J., Thaveesangsakulthai I., Sukbangnop W., Kulsing C., Sooksimuang T., Aonbangkhen C., Sahasithiwat S., Sriprasart T., Palaga T., Chantaravisoot N., Tomapatanaget B.",2022-01-01,"Dye-encapsulated ethyl cellulose nanosensor, Ethyl cellulose, Fluorescence sensors, Helicene dye, Helicenes, Heptanal, Long-chain aldehyde, Lung Cancer, Self-assembly nanoparticles, Specific detection, dye-encapsulated ethyl cellulose nanosensors, fluorescence sensor, helicene dyes, long-chain aldehyde, self-assembly nanoparticles","Over the past years, lung cancer has been one of the vital cancer-related mortalities worldwide and has inevitably exhibited the highest death rate with the subsequent need for facile and convenient diagnosis approaches to identify the severity of cancer. Previous research has reported long-chain aldehyde compounds such as hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and nonanal as potential biomarkers of lung cancer. Herein, the helicene dye-encapsulated ethyl cellulose (EC@dye-NH) nanosensors have been applied for the potentially sensitive and specific detection of long-chain aldehydes in aqueous media. The sensors contain the intrinsic hydrazide group of dye-NH, which is capable of reacting an aldehyde group via imine formation and the EC backbone. This offers the synergistic forces of hydrophobic interactions with alkyl long-chain aldehydes, which could induce self-assembly encapsulation of EC@dye-NH nanosensors and strong fluorescence responses. The addition of long-chain aldehyde would induce the complete micellar-like nanoparticle formation within 15 min in acetate buffer pH 5.0. The limit of detection (LOD) values of EC@dye-NH nanosensors toward heptanal, octanal, and nonanal were 40, 100, and 10 μM, respectively, without interference from the lung fluid matrices and short-chain aldehydes. For practical applicability, this sensing platform was developed for quantification of the long-chain aldehydes in lung fluid samples with 98-101% recoveries. This EC@dye-NH nanosensor was applied to quantify nonanal contents in lung fluid samples. The results of this method based on EC@dye-NH nanosensors were then validated using standard gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which gave results consistent with the proposed method. With intracellular imaging application, the EC@dye-NH nanosensors demonstrated excellent intracellular uptake and strong green fluorescence emission upon introducing the nonanal into the lung cancer cells (A549). Thus, the developed nanosensing approach served as the potential fluorescent probes in medical and biological fields, especially for lung cancer disease diagnosis based on highly selective and sensitive detection of long-chain aldehydes.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The ultrasonically assisted surface modification of the CeO2 nanospindles in NaBH4 led to particle collisions and surface reduction that resulted in an increase in the number of surface-active sites of exposed Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies. The surface modified CeO2 nanospindles showed an improvement of catalytic activity for DMC formation, yielding 17.90 mmol·gcat−1 with 100 % DMC selectivity. This study offers a simple and effective method to modify a CeO2 surface, and it can further be applied for other chemical activities.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, medical, physics, chemistry","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

In this study, five resveratrol derivatives were evaluated for anticancer activity and Akt/mTOR targeting activity in non-small lung cancer cell lines. The effects of resveratrol derivatives on cell proliferation were assessed by 2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nucleus staining, and colony formation assay. Furthermore, the effect of resveratrol derivatives on proliferation-related protein expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. For the structure–activity relationship (SAR), results reveal that two derivatives of resveratrol which are 4,4′-(ethane-1,2-diyl) bis(2-methoxyphenol) (RD2) and the 4-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethyl)-2-methoxyphenol (RD3) had very similar structures but exerted different cytotoxicity. The IC50 of RD2 and RD3 were 108.6 ± 10.82 and more than 200 µM in the A549 cell line and 103.5 ± 6.08 and more than 200 µM in H23 cells, respectively. RD2 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis when compared with the control, while RD3 caused minimal effects. Cells treated with RD2 exhibited apoptotic nuclei in a concomitant with the reduction of cellular p-Akt and p-mTOR. RD3 had minimal effects on such proteins. According to these results, molecular docking analysis revealed a high-affinity interaction between RD2 and an Akt molecule at the ATP-binding and the allosteric sites, indicating this RD2 as a potential Akt inhibitor. This study provides useful information of resveratrol derivatives RD2 for treating lung cancer via Akt/mTOR inhibition.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of corporal punishment of children in Myanmar and associated factors. Participant and setting: This study is a secondary data analysis of the 2015–2016 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS). The study targeted 13,235 (weighted) children between 2 and 14 years old. Methods: Corporal punishment of children by caregivers was assessed using six questions that utilized UNICEF's child disciplinary module. Multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify associated factors. Results: Nearly half of the children in the study (44.5 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 42.60, 46.50) were found to have been subjected to corporal punishment, and the most common form of corporal punishment was “spanking, hitting, or slapping the child on the bottom with a bare hand” (29.1 %; 95 % CI: 27.53, 30.80). Multivariable analyses revealed that a child's sex, age, education level, location of residence, and number of family members; the primary caregiver's sex and attitude toward corporal punishment; and the family's socio-economic status were all factors significantly associated with corporal punishment. The prevalence of corporal punishment of children in Myanmar was high, and many significant predictors were identified. Conclusion: The implementation of child protection policies and the promotion of nonviolent parenting methods should be conducted immediately to community members. Community education should particularly focus on uneducated caregivers and families with low socioeconomic status.","medical, psychology","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

Methods: A cross–sectional descriptive study obtained the baseline data from the project named the Thailand Parental Supply and Use of Alcohol, Cigarettes & Drugs Longitudinal Study Cohort in Secondary School Students in 2018. The sample size was 1187 students who have ever sipped or drank alcohol in the past 12 months. Pearson’s Chi square, binary logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression are applied in the analysis. Results: A single source of parental supply is not significantly associated with any alcohol-related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder, while parental supply with peers and siblings supply of alcohol plays an important role in both outcomes. The increasing number of sources of alcohol supply increases the risk of alcohol–related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder. Other risk factors found in both associations included binge drinking, alcohol flushing, low household economic status, distance from the student’s family, and poor academic performance. Gender, exposure to alcohol ads on social media and location of residency were not associated with alcohol–related harms or severity of alcohol use disorder.

Most of the systems offer either one-way or two-way authentication for recording the attendance.In this project, we aim to upgrade the customary used individual authentication systems into a single, integrated contactless and biometric-based identity system. To achieve this, a facial recognition mechanism along with the card strap of RFID and fingerprint authentication mechanism(optional) are combined into a singular attendance managing system which can provide the flexibility to use multi-optional biometric identification methods to verify one's identity and mark their attendance. To address the Covid 19 pandemic situation, the system is also equipped with a contactless InfraRed (IR) thermal sensor to detect the temperature of each employee before they mark attendance. As a result, it automates the manual temperature monitoring method of employees without the involvement of another person. The resultant attendance is recorded data in a cloud service platform (Amazon Web Services(AWS)) in real-Time and later analyze the stored attendance data using a Database platform.

As opposed to the negatively charged DNA probes, the charges on the PNA probes may be fine-tuned by incorporating amino acids with charged side chains. The contribution of electrostatic effects to the interaction between PNA probes and nanomaterials has been largely overlooked. This work reveals that electrostatic effects substantially enhanced the quenching of dye-labeled conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA probes by several nanomaterials including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and silver nanoparticles. The fluorescence quenching and the color change from red to purple in the case of AuNPs because of aggregation were inhibited in the presence of complementary nucleic acid targets. Thus, fluorescence and colorimetric assays for DNA and RNA that can distinguish even single-base-mismatched nucleic acids with improved sensitivity over conventional DNA probes were established. Both the GO- and AuNP-based sensing platforms have been successfully applied for the detection of real DNA and RNA samples in vitro and in living cells.

The screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) was simply fabricated and modified using different nanomaterials for each heavy metal. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) mode on the smartphone, the signal peaks were presented at + 10 mV for As(III), + 350 mV for Cr(VI), 0 mV for Hg(II), − 900 mV for Cd(II), and − 680 mV vs. Ag/AgCl for Pb(II).

Here we examine the capability of booster vaccination following CoronaVac/AZD1222 prime to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses. A total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 for 4–5 months were enrolled, to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a third dose. Reactogenicity was recorded. Immunogenicity analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-binding antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The NAb titers against omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were determined using the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) and total interferon-γ responses were measured to observe the T-cell activation. A substantial loss in neutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4–5 months after receiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, a significant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities toward delta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222. In addition, individuals boosted with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines develop a T-cell response to spike protein, whereas those boosted with AZD1222 did not. Reactogenicity was mild to moderate without serious adverse events. Our findings demonstrated that mRNA booster vaccination is able to overcome waning immunity to provide antibodies that neutralize omicron BA.1 and BA.2, as well as a T-cell response.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Methods: A convenience survey was conducted by emailing a link to a three-question electronic survey to clinicians in many countries, mostly through radiology and radiation protection contacts. Results: 505 responses were received from 24 countries. 293 respondents (58%) understand that current regulations do not limit the number of CT scans that can be prescribed for a single patient in a year. When asked whether there should be a regulation to limit the number of CT scans that can be prescribed for a single patient in one year, only a small fraction (143, 28%) answered ‘No’, 182 (36%) answered ‘Maybe’ and 166 (33%) answered ‘Yes’. Most respondents (337; 67%) think that radiation risk should form part of the consideration when deciding whether to request a CT exam. A minority (138; 27%) think the decision should be based only on the medical indication for the CT exam. Comparison among the 4 countries (South Korea, Hungary, USA and Canada) with the largest number of respondents indicated wide variations in responses. Conclusions: A majority of the surveyed clinicians consider radiation risk, in addition to clinical factors, when prescribing CT exams.

Enhancing dye wastewater treatment efficiency in ozonation membrane contactors by chloro– and fluoro–organosilanes’ functionality on hydrophobic PVDF membrane modification,"My Hanh Le T., Nuisin R., Mongkolnavin R., Painmanakul P., Sairiam S.",2022-05-01,"1h,1h, 2h, 2h–perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane, Azo-dyes, Membrane contactor, Membrane grafting, Membrane modification, Methyltrichloroalkylsilane, Ozonation membrane contactor, P.V.D.F, Plasma activation, PVDF membrane, 1H,1H, 2H, 2H–perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane, Azo dye, Membrane grafting, Methyltrichloroalkylsilane, Ozonation membrane contactor, Plasma activation","This work investigated the decolorization of dye wastewater using an ozonation membrane contactor. The hydrophobicity of a PVDF membrane was developed by applying novel plasma activation followed by grafting with methyltrichloroalkylsilane (PVDF–MTCS) and 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H–perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PVDF–FAS–C8) at different grafting times and grafting agent concentrations. After hydrophobic membrane modifications, the ozonation membrane performances were improved. The ozone flux of PVDF–FAS–C8 was higher and more stable, maintaining 88% of the initial flux after 20 h, compared to 79% and 53% for the PVDF − MTCS and original membranes, respectively. After 90 mins, COD removals of Direct Blue 71 (DB 71) and Reactive Red 239 (RR 239) by the ozonation membrane contactor using PVDF–FAS–C8 were 62.5% and 67.5%, and TOC removals were 20% and 23%, respectively, with almost complete decolorization. The releases of sulfate and nitrate ions confirmed the dye mineralization. By applying a PVDF − FAS − C8 membrane, energy consumption was 33.2% lower than when using the original membrane. The findings exhibited that the performance of ozonation membrane contactor improved was due to the role of the functionality on modified PVDF membranes. The PVDF − MTCS membrane had a higher silicon composition and better surface roughness than the PVDF − FAS − C8 membrane. The water contact angle (WCA) of the PVDF − MTCS membrane was higher than that of the PVDF − FAS − C8 membrane, increasing from 74.7° (original) to 126.0° and 112.7°, respectively, after 6 h of grafting, leading to reduced membrane wetting.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Filtration and Separation"

Treatment is challenging due to the disease's resistance to antifungal drugs. Surgical resection is frequently attempted in cases of pythiosis; however, it can be technically challenging. This report presents two dogs with decreased appetite, abdominal pain, progressive haematochezia, tenesmus and significant weight loss. With the medical histories of both being young canines, living in areas with access to natural water resources and with the main chronic gastrointestinal symptoms having not responded to symptomatic treatment, pythiosis was taken into consideration. Abdominal ultrasound revealed severe, diffuse thickening and loss of normal layering of the colonic wall. These findings led to a differential diagnosis between intestinal neoplasia and fungal disease. Full-thickness biopsies were later performed, and immunohistochemistry staining was suggested for colonic pythiosis. Medical treatment for pythiosis was successful with a combination of oral terbinafine and prednisolone. However, therapy with itraconazole in case 1 did not improve the clinical signs, and in case 2, itraconazole was used after all clinical signs have improved for clinical control. Since then, there has been no recurrence of clinical signs until the time of preparing this report (19 months for case 1, 11 months for case 2 since the cessation of treatment).

The current research examines the behavior of shredded E-waste fine aggregate concrete strengthened by the use of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) confinement under axial compressive load. The main objective of this study is to investigate the structural behavior of circular and non-circular concrete specimens by partial replacement of E-waste as fine aggregates and confined with CFRP sheets. Tests were performed on a total of 36 concrete specimens. The parameters considered were cross-sectional geometry of circular, rectangular and square concrete specimens, 20% partial replacement of fine aggregates by E-waste, the effect of the corner in case of non-circular specimens, and the number of CFRP sheets. These tests portrayed that the partial replacement of fine aggregates by E-waste aggregates results in decreasing axial compressive strength of concrete specimens. However, the external CFRP confinement increases the axial strength of specimens (a maximum of 71% for circular specimens, 33% for square specimens, and 25% for rectangular specimens). It was also observed that partial replacement of natural fine aggregates by E-waste increased the failure time. For the case of square and rectangular concrete specimens, the ultimate strength was lower than circular specimens for both (with and without CFRP confinement) specimens. Finally, existing strength and strain models developed for FRP-confined concrete were used for theoretical calculations. The theoretical declaration of the existing models indicates that a few of the ultimate strain models lie on the high side and few of the ultimate strain models on the low side in comparison with the experimental findings.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

The 49.32 kDa recombinant EiCh protein was expressed in vitro in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) after which inclusion bodies were successfully solubilized and refolded. Ab initio protein modelling revealed secondary and tertiary structures. Secondary structure was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Antigenicity of the chimeric EiCh protein was exhibited by strong reactivity with serum from striped catfish and Nile tilapia experimentally infected with E. ictaluri. Furthermore, immunogenicity of the chimeric EiCh protein was investigated in vivo in Nile tilapia juveniles and it was found that the protein could strongly induce production of specific antibodies conferring agglutination activity and partially protected Nile tilapia juveniles with a relative survival percentage (RPS) of 42%.

Whilst the literature shows the promise of mindfulness-based applications for users, there is limited research into location-based games (LBGs) for mindfulness. To address this gap, in this study, a questionnaire was administered to Pokémon GO game players to gauge mindfulness and better understand which aspects of their play contributed to their mindfulness. The findings suggest that the Pokémon GO game is promising to promote players’ mindfulness through gameplay. Further, the findings shed light on the level of mindfulness as measured by player’s attention, focus, awareness, and acceptance in the gameplay. Lastly, the application of LBGs deserves a wider interest and attention from researchers due to their demonstrated potential to promote people’s psychological well-being by improving mindfulness.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science, Business, decision sciences","Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Strategy and Management, Information Systems and Management"

Rodent malaria parasites were isolated from African thicket rats and initially characterized by scientists at the University of Edinburgh, UK, particularly by Drs. Richard Carter, David Walliker, and colleagues. Through their efforts and elegant work, many rodent malaria parasite species, subspecies, and strains are now available. Because of the ease of maintaining these parasites in laboratory mice, genetic crosses can be performed to map the parasite and host genes contributing to parasite growth and disease severity. Recombinant DNA technologies are now available to manipulate the parasite genomes and to study gene functions efficiently. In this chapter, we provide a brief history of the isolation and species identification of rodent malaria parasites. We also discuss some recent studies to further characterize the different developing stages of the parasites including parasite genomes and chromosomes. Although there are differences between rodent and human malaria parasite infections, the knowledge gained from studies of rodent malaria parasites has contributed greatly to our understanding of and the fight against human malaria.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

This work presents the first device that integrates a potentiometric ion-selective electrode (ISE) with distance-based colorimetric detection for the simultaneous analysis of K+ and Cl− ions at the point of care (POC). This hybrid sensing device was designed in a two-dimensional configuration using a plastic transparency sheet containing a stencil printed K+-ISE and a paper substrate for distance-based colorimetric detection of Cl−. K+ quantification was performed using a low-cost (<$25) lab-made Wi-Fi supported potentiometer with a custom smartphone application while Cl− ions were quantified with an instrument-free distance-based paper analytical device (dPAD). The total analysis time is 5 min once the sample is added. The K+-ISE showed a sensitivity of 55.89 ± 2.52 mV/decade from 0.1 to 100 mM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mM. The linear working range for Cl− detection was 0.5–50 mM whereas the LOD was 0.16 ± 0.05 mM. The proof-of-concept application of the sensing hybrid device was demonstrated in human urine and artificial sweat samples containing K+ and Cl− ions at physiologically relevant ranges. The recoveries were found to be 88–108% for K+ and 90–104% for Cl−, showing the potential use of the proposed device for low-cost routine analysis of biological samples at POC.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Biochemistry, Spectroscopy"

Immediate treatment should be directed to stimulate corneal wound healing, control infection, and minimize self-trauma while eliminating the underlying causes. Aim: This retrospective study was aimed to compare the difference in non-infectious deep corneal wound healing time between cases treated with medical therapy alone and those treated with medical therapy combined with a nictitating membrane flap. Methods: The medical records at the Ophthalmology Clinic, Small Animal Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University between January 2018 and March 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-six eyes (from 65 dogs) diagnosed with non-infectious deep ulcerative keratitis from the medical treatment group (n = 34) and the combined treatment group (n = 32) were included. The combined treatment group was prescribed the same conservative medical administrations plus a surgical nictitating membrane flap for 14 days. Results: Healing time was defined as the duration of time from the day that the dog had been diagnosed with deep ulcerative keratitis by a fluorescein staining test to the day that the corneal fluorescein stain was negative. Overall, the mean age of dogs with deep ulcerative keratitis was 10.49 ± 4.7 years. The disease was commonly evident in females more than males. Shih Tzu was the most prevalent dog breed. The corneal healing time between dogs receiving medical therapy alone and those receiving combined treatment was not statistically significant (p = 0.386). Healing times were not significantly different between sex and breed (p = 0.41). The median corneal healing time for dogs older than 10 years in the combined treatments group (29.5 days; ranging from 20 to 46 days) was longer than for those receiving medical therapy alone (21 days; ranging from 9.5 to 30.5 days). Conclusion: Supportive therapy including a nictitating membrane flap is suggested in dogs prone to deep corneal ulcers not involving infection. Even though the healing time is not statistically significant, a nictitating membrane flap acts as a tissue bandage to reduce friction over the cornea, and it also alleviates the healing process by moistening the ocular surface.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

However, this has been mostly conducted in high-income countries, which means there is a dearth of performance investigations in low- and middle-income countries with different socio-economic settings. This study evaluated the applicability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA monitoring in wastewater (n = 132) to inform COVID-19 infection in the city of Bangkok, Thailand using CDC N1 and N2 RT-qPCR assays. Wastewater influents (n = 112) and effluents (n = 20) were collected from 19 centralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) comprising four large, four medium, and 11 small WWTPs during seven sampling events from January to April 2021 prior to the third COVID-19 resurgence that was officially declared in April 2021. The CDC N1 assay showed higher detection rates and mostly lower Ct values than the CDC N2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected at the first event when new reported cases were low. Increased positive detection rates preceded an increase in the number of newly reported cases and increased over time with the reported infection incidence. Wastewater surveillance (both positive rates and viral loads) showed strongest correlation with daily new COVID-19 cases at 22–24 days lag (Spearman's Rho = 0.85–1.00). Large WWTPs (serving 432,000–580,000 of the population) exhibited similar trends of viral loads and new cases to those from all 19 WWTPs, emphasizing that routine monitoring of the four large WWTPs could provide sufficient information for the city-scale dynamics. Higher sampling frequency at fewer sites, i.e., at the four representative WWTPs, is therefore suggested especially during the subsiding period of the outbreak to indicate the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, acting as an early warning of COVID-19 resurgence.",environmental,"Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The Cu-incorporated and Fe-incorporated MnxOy were prepared by impregnation and solvothermal processes. From XRD, XPS, and XAS analyses, the obtained MnxOy consisted of MnO2 and mixed phases of Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 from impregnation and solvothermal methods, respectively. The Cu-incorporated and Fe-incorporated MnxOy included CuO and Fe2O3, respectively, through both methods. Addition of Cu and Fe decreased the BET surface area and increased the pore sizes as compared to the pristine MnO2. With the Fe : Mn molar ratio of 0.20 : 1, the Fe-incorporated MnxOy from the solvothermal method presented the highest cathodic peaks under the cyclic voltammogram of HPR and OR at around 0.59 V of 11.59 mA cm−2 and −0.59 V of −12.33 mA cm−2, respectively. Compared to the Cu-incorporated ones, the highest HPR peak at 0.68 V of 9.20 mA cm−2 and the highest OR peak at −0.59 V of −6.99 mA cm−2 were obtained from the Cu-incorporated MnxOy prepared through the solvothermal method at the Cu : Mn molar ratio of 0.15 : 1. Incorporating Cu or Fe into MnO2 brought the improvement of electrocatalytic activity for HPR and OR. The Cu-incorporated and Fe-incorporated MnxOy from both methods showed a higher power density of μ-DMFC than the pristine MnO2.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Electrochemistry"
Data efficient reinforcement learning and adaptive optimal perimeter control of network traffic dynamics,"Chen C., Huang Y.P., Lam W.H.K., Pan T.L., Hsu S.C., Sumalee A., Zhong R.X.",2022-09-01,"Adaptive optimal perimeter control, Closed loop stability, Data measurements, Data resolutions, Experience replay, Heterogeneous data, Heterogeneous data resolution, Integral reinforcement learning, Macroscopic fundamental diagram, Reinforcement learnings, Adaptive optimal perimeter control, Closed-loop stability, Experience replay, Heterogeneous data resolution, Integral reinforcement learning, Macroscopic fundamental diagram","Existing data-driven and feedback traffic control strategies do not consider the heterogeneity of real-time data measurements. Besides, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic control usually converge slowly for lacking data efficiency. Moreover, conventional optimal perimeter control schemes require exact knowledge of the system dynamics and thus they would be fragile to endogenous uncertainties. To handle these challenges, this work proposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to learning the macroscopic traffic dynamics for adaptive optimal perimeter control. This work makes the following primary contributions to the transportation literature: (a) A continuous-time control is developed with discrete gain updates to adapt to the discrete-time sensor data. Different from the conventional RL approaches, the reinforcement interval of the proposed IRL method can be varying with respect to the real-time resolution of data measurements. Approximate optimization methods are carried out to address the curse of dimensionality of the optimal control problem with consideration on the resolution of data measurement. (b) To reduce the sampling complexity and use the available data more efficiently, the experience replay (ER) technique is introduced to the IRL algorithm. (c) The proposed method relaxes the requirement on model calibration in a “model-free” manner that enables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time performance via a data-driven RL algorithm. (d) The convergence of the IRL based algorithms and the stability of the controlled traffic dynamics are proven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and then approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational complexity. Both state and input constraints are considered while no model linearization is required. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","fluidex; related topics, transport and communicatons, engineering, sociology, decision sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Transportation, Management Science and Operations Research"

However, the effect of growth media on root tensile strength and Young's modulus has rarely been investigated. We studied the effects of three contrasting growth media (hydroponic, rice husk ash, and lateritic soil) on the biomechanical properties of the fibrous roots of two contrasting vetiver species (Chrysopogon nemoralis and Chrysopogon zizanioides). After growing in the different media for 7 weeks, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of both species were measured via uniaxial tensile tests. Roots grown in the ash were the strongest (10.21 ± 0.8 and 9.46 ± 1.1 MPa for C. nemoralis and C. zizanioides, respectively) and stiffest (275.98 ± 20.6 and 172.74 ± 26.3 MPa, respectively), followed by those grown in the soil (9.1 ± 0.9 and 6.18 ± 0.5 MPa for strength; 182.3 ± 16.9 and 81.88 ± 5.3 MPa for modulus) and then those grown hydroponically (5.99 ± 0.5 and 5.87 ± 0.5 MPa for strength; 107.06 ± 10.8 and 82.13 ± 7.8 MPa for modulus). Irrespective of the growth treatments, root strength and modulus were correlated with root diameter by a negative power law model (R2 ranged between 0.11 and 0.68; p-value <0.05). The shape and scale factors of the strength–diameter and modulus–diameter correlations were different among the growth treatments. We caution the use of the tensile properties of roots grown in artificial media and laboratory conditions for predicting root reinforcement to natural soil on slopes.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Nature and Landscape Conservation, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

The formation of wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structures of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) was confirmed by Powder X-ray diffraction spectra and the average crystallite size was determined to be 10 ± 2 nm. HRTEM analysis confirmed the homogeneous distribution of RE-CdS NPs over the G sheets. The photocatalytic behaviour of the RE-CdS decorated G sheets was studied using a textile dye methylene blue (MB) under sunlight. The result indicates that among the various RE-CdS nanocomposites studied, Cerium-cadmium sulfide-reduced graphene oxide (Ce–CdS-G) shows highest MB degradation of 99.0 ± 0.4% within 90 min under sunlight. The result confirms that RE-CdS-G nanocatalyst efficiently accelerates the separation and slows down the recombination rate in photo excited charge carriers. The catalytic activity was retained over 80% of its original value even after four successive runs and the present method can be employed for the large-scale synthesis of RE-CdS-G nanocatalyst.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

From room temperature to 700 °C, the in situ annealing measurements identify the different Mn diffusion effects in three temperature ranges. First, between room temperature and 300 °C, the XRD profiles show the reorganization of Mn atoms from interstitials to IrMn lattice points. Second, between 300 and 400 °C, we observed the diffusion of Mn atoms from the IrMn thin film to the surface, causing the atomic Mn/Ir ratio to drop from 10 to 7. The MnO appeared on the film surface in this temperature range. Third, from 400 to 700 °C, the O content in the IrMn thin film increases to 8%, while the Mn/Ir ratio continuously decreases from 7 to 5.

In this work, non-metals (B, O, P, and S) doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was prepared via solid-state polycondensation of urea for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into highly needed methane (CH4) with water under UV light irradiation. The various physicochemical characterization results reveal the successful incorporation of B, O, P, and S elements in the g-C3N4 matrix. The maximum CH4 yield of 55.10 nmol/(mLH2O.gcat) over S-doped g-C3N4 has been obtained for CO2 reduction after 7 h of irradiation. This amount of CH4 production was 1.9, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.4-folds higher than B, O, P and bare g-C3N4 samples. The doping of S did not enlarge the surface area and photon absorption ability of the g-C3N4 sample, but this significant improvement was evidently due to effective charge separation and migration. The observed results imply that the doping of non-metal elements provides improved charge separation and is an effective way to boost photocatalyst performance. This work offers an auspicious approach to design non-metal doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts for renewable fuel production and would be promising for other energy application.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a suitable methodology for generating promastigote cultures containing a high proportion and number of L. orientalis metacyclic promastigotes. Various media, i.e., Schneider’s insect medium, Medium 199 and Grace’s insect medium, supplemented with various quantities of dithiothreitol, Basal Medium Eagle vitamins, pooled human urine, and fetal bovine serum, were optimized for metacyclogenesis. The results revealed that the optimum culture medium and conditions of those tested were Schneider’s insect medium supplemented with 100 μM dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Basal Medium Eagle vitamins, 2% (v/v) pooled human urine, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, pH 5.0 at 26°C. We also demonstrated that L. orientalis metacyclic promastigotes could be purified and enriched by negative selection using peanut lectin. Under these culture conditions, the highest yield of metacyclic promastigotes was obtained with a significantly higher percentage of parasite survival, resistance to complement-mediated lysis, and infection index in THP-1 macrophage cells compared to parasites cultured without media supplements at neutral pH.

A systematic framework is presented to enable elegant determination of essential strain and stress measures. Then, the virtual work principle is employed to derive governing equations and boundary conditions. Some remarks are given on the numerical implementation with the isogeometric approach. In addition, to facilitate the verification of the derivation, the isogeometric approach is also applied to two-dimensional problems of the modified couple stress theory, and the implementation is detailed. Two comprehensive examples are used to investigate the size-dependent behavior of planar arbitrarily curved microbeams. Several rigorous tests are designed to examine the accuracy of the derived beam formulation and the validity of kinematic assumptions of the Euler-Bernoulli beam model. Finally, the robustness and efficiency of the isogeometric implementation for the proposed beam formulation are verified.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

The shotgun metagenomic sequencing further identified bacterial and viral pathogens, and ARGs. The predominant bacterial pathogens (>0.5 % relative abundance) were the Burkholderia cepacia complex, Arcobacter butzleri, Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the Enterobacter cloacae complex. The viruses (0.28 %–0.67 % abundance in all microbial sequences) comprised mainly vertebrate viruses and bacteriophages, with encephalomyocarditis virus (33.3 %–58.2 % abundance in viral sequences), hepatitis C virus genotype 1, human alphaherpesvirus 1, and human betaherpesvirus 6A among the human viral pathogens. The 15 ARG types contained 611 ARG subtypes, including those resistant to beta-lactam, which was the most diverse and abundant group (206 subtypes; 17.0 %–27.5 %), aminoglycoside (94 subtypes; 9.6 %–15.3 %), tetracycline (80 subtypes; 15.6 %–20.2 %), and macrolide (79 subtypes; 14.5 %–32.1 %). Interestingly, the abundance of ARGs associated with resistance to beta-lactam, trimethoprim, and sulphonamide, as well as A. butzleri and crAssphage, at the cultural sites was significantly different from the other sites (p < 0.05). We demonstrated the benefits of using NGS to deliver insights into microbial communities, and antimicrobial resistance, both of which pose a risk to human health.

The dominant interactions of IBP between MIL-53(Al) were hydrogen bonding between the Al-OH(OH2) node of MIL-53(Al), the carboxylic groups of IBP, and the carboxylic group of terephthalic acid of MIL-53(Al). AM25 exhibited high selectivity for IBP against the background matrix of wastewater obtained from a hospital, and it could be applied at a low concentration range (μg/L). An increase in the empty bed contact time (38.7 min to 96.9 min) of fixed-bed systems for the adsorption of IBP on AM25 could improve the usage rate and fractional bed utilization; moreover, the breakthrough removal percentage was increased up to 98.1%. The multi-layer log-Thomas model can be fitted well for all breakthrough curves.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Due to the absence of epidemiological data in Southeast Asia, we aimed to determine Thai LHON patients’ characteristics (demographic data, mutation types, and prognoses) as the first study in this region. Methods: This retrospective chart review enrolled all Thai LHON patients confirmed by three mitochondrial DNA mutations (G11778A, T14484C, and G3460A) between January 1997 and December 2016. Patients with more than one year of follow-up were included in a visual progression analysis. The Mann–Whitney U-test was applied to compare groups, and prognosis-associated factors were analysed with the generalized estimating equation. Results: In all, 229 patients were enrolled, with only nineteen females. Most mutations were of the G11778A type (91%), with T14484C accounting for the remainder. The age at onset of G11778A (21.9 years; interquartile range [IQR] 14.9, 33.5) was younger than that of T14484C (33.0 years; IQR 19.4, 37.5). Of 45 patients, the T14484C group demonstrated good vision recovery, whereas the G11778A group did not improve (difference in logMAR −0.7 and IQR −1.5, −0.2 versus logMAR 0.0 and IQR −0.3, 0.2, respectively; P value.001). The G11778A mutation, male, and older age were related to poor prognoses. Conclusions: The leading mutation in Thai LHON patients is the G11778A missense, followed by T14484C, while G3460A was not detected. The vast majority of patients were young adult males. The G11778A mutation, older age, and male gender are associated with poor vision outcomes.Key message The G11778A missense mutation is the most common among Thai LHON patients, followed by T14484C, while G3460A was not found. The G11778A mutation, older age, and male gender are associated with poor vision outcomes.",medical,Medicine (all)
Electron beam-cured linseed oil - Diacrylate blends as a green alternative to overprint varnishes: Monitoring curing efficiency and surface coating properties,"Kempanichkul A., Piroonpan T., Kongkaoropham P., Wongkrongsak S., Katemake P., Pasanphan W.",2022-10-01,"Curing efficiency, Diacrylates, Electron beam curing, Electron-beam, Green coating, Linseed oil, Overprint varnish, Overprint varnishes, Surface adhesion, Tripropylene glycol diacrylate, Diacrylate, Electron beam curing, Green coatings, Linseed oil, Overprint varnish (OPV)","Electron beam (EB)-cured unsaturated vegetable oil and diacrylate was formulated as an alternative and green overprint varnish (OPV) for coatings in a finishing process. Linseed oil (LO) was applied with tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) in different ratios to obtain EB-curable LO-based OPV (eLOPV). The eLOPV were irradiated by EB for curing using various absorbed doses of 10–100 kGy. Change of the functional groups, chemical structure and transition temperature of EB-cured eLOPV were characterized by FTIR, 13C-NMR and DSC. The curing efficacy was assessed by measuring conversion, gel fraction, swelling degree and by characterizing surface properties using solvent rub-test and cross-cut tape test methods. The EB-cured eLOPV exhibited great surface adhesion on substrates. The surface morphologies of the EB-cured eLOPV on papers and plywood sheets were observed by SEM. The results indicate that the eLOPV (LO-TPGDA blend 40: 60 w/w) was completely cured using EB at 30 kGy. Th optical properties were observed via yellowness and whiteness indexes according to ASTM E 313. Color difference and gloss value were measured using colorimeter and gloss meter, respectively. The eLOPV provide good surface qualities, i.e, good surface adhesion, low yellowness, homogeneous cured surface, high gloss value, and hydrophobic surface. Aiming at well-optimized formula and effective EB-curing process, the synthetic chemical can be reduced at least 50% w/w by using vegetable oil without photo-initiator. The utilization of LO and EB curing technology is a promising strategy for bio-/green-coatings approach.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics",Radiation

We also assessed other factors, including tablet integrity, food, and pharmacogenetics. Methods: During the 3HP treatment, blood and urine samples were collected in week 4. Isoniazid and rifapentine levels were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography technique. The genetic variation of arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) were assessed by the MassARRAY®. Safety and clinical outcomes at week 48 were monitored. Results: A total of 12 children with LTBI (age 3.8 [range 2.1-4.9 years old]) completed the treatment (isoniazid and rifapentine dose 25.0 [range 21.7-26.8] and 25.7 [range 20.7-32.1] mg/kg, respectively). No serious adverse events or active TB occurred. Tablet integrity was associated with decreased area under the concentration-time curve (91 vs 73 mg.h/l, P= 0.026) and increased apparent oral clearance of isoniazid (0.27 vs 0.32 l/h/kg, P= 0.019) and decreased rifapentine's renal clearance (CLR, 0.005 vs 0.003 l/h, P= 0.014). Food was associated with increased CLR of isoniazid (3.45 vs 8.95 l/h, P= 0.006) but not rifapentine. Variability in NAT2 and AADAC did not affect the pharmacokinetics of both drugs. Conclusion: There is high variability in the pharmacokinetic profiles of isoniazid and rifapentine in young children with LTBI. The variability was partly influenced by tablet integrity and food, but not pharmacogenetics. Further study in a larger cohort is warranted to display the relationship of these factors to treatment outcomes.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The different inoculation promoted operational performance, stability, and organic loading rate (OLR) differently. The produced biogas and methane varied significantly with OLR (p < 0.05). The maximum gas productivities between 0.42–0.48 L-biogas/g VSadded and 0.27–0.34 L-CH4/g VSadded were obtained at OLR of 1.0–1.5 g VS/L day. Later, the increase in OLR to 2.0 and 2.4 g VS/L day decreased biogas and methane yields by 24.85–39.65% and 11.66–52.89%. Co-inoculation of COM and ANS was a promising strategy that encouraged more stability in CSTR3 than the other reactors. Consequently, the methanogenic performance was developed in all digesters, depicted clearly by high methane content between 52.94 and 59.30% in produced biogas. A similar microbial structure was found in each CSTR-dominated predominantly by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Formicates. About 0.5–3.0% of the whole populations were archaea identified distinctly to Methanocorpusculum, Methanospirillum, and Methanosaeta. This finding confirmed the importance of seed inoculation to practical gas productivity and confined organic loading capacity of Napier grass biomethanation in single-stage wet and mono-substrate digestion processes.","energy, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Energy (miscellaneous)"

Methods: This retrospective study enrolled two cohorts of SCOVIDS-PIs with vs. without CMD during a one-year period. The predictor variables were demographic, dental, anesthetic, and laboratory parameters. The main outcome was presence of CMD until six post-PI months (yes/no). Appropriate statistics were computed with α = 95%. Results: The sample comprised 176 subjects aged 59.2 ± 17.2 years (range, 27–89; 11.9% with CMDs; 30.1% females). CMDs were significantly associated with (1) bilateral posterior tooth loss (P = 0; number needed to screen [NNS] = 1.6), (2) dentofacial skeletal class II/convex face (P =.01; NNS = 2.2), and (3) peak CRP during intensive care ≥ 40 mg/l (P =.01; NNS = 3.5). With combined predictors, NNS became 2 to 4.3. Conclusions: Three predictors of CMDs in SCOVIDS-PIs: bilateral molar loss, convex face, and CRP ≥ 40 mg/l, indicate CMD screening and/or referral to a CMD specialist, regardless of patients’ age, gender, underlying CMDs, or previous dental checkups. Screening ∼2 to 4 “SCOVIDS-PIs with ≥ one predictor” will identify one CMD events/patients during the first six post-PI months.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs and cats during COVID-19 quarantine at private veterinary hospitals in Thailand. From April to May 2021, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in three out of 35 dogs and one out of nine cats from four out of 17 households with confirmed COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from one of the nasal, oral, rectal and environmental swabs of dog-A (15 years old, mixed breed, male dog), cat-B (1 year old, domestic shorthair, male cat), dog-C (2 years old, mixed breed, female dog) and dog-D (4 years old, Pomeranian, female dog). The animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 4 to 30 days after pet owners were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. The animals consecutively tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for 4 to 10 days. One dog (dog-A) showed mild clinical signs, while the other dogs and a cat remained asymptomatic during quarantine at the hospitals. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in both the dogs and cat by surrogate virus neutralization tests. Phylogenetic and genomic mutation analyses of whole genome sequences of three SARS-CoV-2 strains from the dogs and cat revealed SARS-CoV-2 of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage). Our findings are suggestive of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19-positive households and contamination of viral RNA in the environment. Public awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pet dogs and cats in close contact with COVID-19 patients should be raised.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Although bocavirus infections in humans and animals present a broad range of clinical symptoms including neurologic diseases, the neuropathology caused by FBoV infection in cats is unknown. This study aims to investigate the presence of bocavirus in the brain samples of 78 cats showing neurologic deficits and 41 healthy cats using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to present the pathological findings of FBoV infection in brain tissues. Only five (6.41%, five out of 78) cats with neurological deficit were FBoV positive on PCR screening and were characterized as FBoV-1 (four out of five) and FBoV-3 (one out of five) by sequencing. Among FBoV-positive cases, viral DNA were detected by PCR in the cerebrum and brain stem of all FBoV-positive cases and rarely detected in the cerebellum of some cases. Histologically, all FBoV-positive cases revealed a variety of inflammatory responses. Among these, 80% (four out of five cases) showed multifocal neuronal vacuolation, mainly found in the cerebrum and brain stem. Eosinophilic inclusion-like materials were found within the nuclei of glial cells in the FBoV-3-positive case. In situ hybridization revealed FBoV DNA in oligodendroglia and vacuolated neurons detected using dual labelling with Olig-2 and NeuN immunohistochemistry, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of FBoV-3 virions in the nuclei of glial cells. Apart from localization in brain tissues, the FBoV DNA were also detected in multiple lymph nodes (five out of five) and some intestines (two out of five) of such positive cases, suggesting both parenteral and enteral infections. Complete genome sequence analysis revealed genetic diversity of detected FBoV-1, which were closely related to the strains found in China and Hong Kong, while the detected FBoV-3 presented distant monophyletic clade to previously detected FBoV-3 sequences. The FBoVs, together, should be considered a neurotropic virus and a possible cause for neuronal vacuolation in cats with neurologic deficits.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

This retrospective study investigated the real-world outcomes of 3-different cytarabine doses from the multicenter Thai AML registry database. Patients and Methods: The intermediate- and adverse-risk AML patients (N = 258) who achieved complete remission and proceeded to single-agent cytarabine consolidation were enrolled. Results: The median relapse-free survival (RFS) using IDAC 1.5 g/m2, high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) 2 g/m2, and HiDAC 3 g/m2 were 12.6, 11.7, and 13 months, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) using IDAC 1.5 g/m2, HiDAC 2 g/m2, and HiDAC 3 g/m2 were 34.9, 22.7, and 23.7 months, respectively. No significant difference in RFS and OS was detected between the 3 doses. Secondary AML, white blood cell > 100×109/L and the adverse-risk AML were independent prognostic factors for inferior survival (P= .008, P < .001, P= .014). Patients who completed 3 to 4 cycles of consolidation had significantly superior RFS and OS (P< .001, P< .001). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 72.9% of IDAC, 73.8% of HiDAC 2 g/m2, and 78.1% of HiDAC 3 g/m2 without statistical significance. However, the incidence of septic shock was significantly higher after HiDAC 3 g/m2 compared to IDAC regimen (8% vs. 3%, P= .037). Conclusion: IDAC is an appropriate regimen for postremission chemotherapy for intermediate- and adverse-risk AML. The higher dosing levels may not produce any benefits to patients and may increase incidence of septic shock. The number of consolidation cycles may impact on survivals rather than the intensity of cytarabine.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Oncology, Cancer Research"

The disease has a devastating impact on a range of cultured and wild freshwater fish species e.g. Lates calcarifer (Asian sea bass), which is a serious economic losses to the freshwater aquaculture in Thailand. The disease can be prevented by an efficacious vaccine, however, no licensed effective vaccine is available to date. Current study was based on the development of a novel mucoadhesive nano-encapsulated vaccine (EncapFlavoNP++), where, cationic lipid-based nanoparticles were combined with an antigen obtained from F. oreochromis. Various parameters including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), physiochemical properties; zeta potential, and polydispersity index were determined. The TEM results depicted well-formed circular-shaped nano-encapsulates complexed with cationic lipid surfactants. The average diameter of the molecules was 200 nm, having a zeta potential of 31.82 mV, while, the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.31. The in vivo study lasted for 8 weeks, the immunologic and protective potentials of the prepared molecules were determined by challenging the fish for 8 weeks. The most effective dilutions of EncapFlavoNP++ solution were 1:100 and 1:200, which significantly improved the efficacy of the immunity by increasing the level of antibody specific to F. oreochromis. A trend of upregulation was found in the immune-related genes including immunoglobulin M heavy chain (IgM), major histocompatibility complex class IIα molecules (MHC-IIα), and dendritic cell specific transcript (DCs) in gills, skin, liver, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), head kidneys, and spleen as compared to the control group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Upon immunization with EncapFlavoNP++ solution at the dilution of 1:100 and 1:200, the significant increase in survival rate (SR) and relative percent survival (RPS) were found in fish challenged with virulent F. oreochromis bacterium (SR 72.50% and RPS 62.07) and (SR 65.83% and RPS 52.87), respectively as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). It can be concluded that immunization with EncapFlavoNP++ solution has significant immunologic and protective effects against Columnaris disease. Furthermore, the prepared vaccine candidate has more potential as compared to whole-cell immersion vaccination (FK-WC). It can be used on a large scale in the freshwater aquaculture industry to boost immunity against Columnaris disease.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The key features of the bonding-based approach were first formulated and then validated by comparing their mechanism with the actual shear resistance mechanism of a strengthening system. Thereafter, a finite element method (FEM) incorporating the bonding-based approach was used to simulate the shear behaviors of ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams. Conversely, the shear crack angle model for ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams was empirically developed to enhance the accuracy of the prediction. The experimental data recently investigated by the authors regarding pullout tests and beam tests were utilized to verify the numerical and analytical results. The analyses indicate that the FE model coupled with the bonding-based approach is a universal and powerful method for simulating the behavior of ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams with and without anchorage. The results demonstrate the great potential of the analytical model, established on the basis of the bond mechanism, for assessment of the shear resistance of ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In this study, the effect of magnetized water on the growth and secondary metabolite production of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) suspension cells was evaluated. Magnetized water was generated by passing water through a magnetic field (400 mT) at a 6 L/min flow rate. The suspension cells exposed to magnetized water for 10 (M2, 1.37 g) and 5 min (M1, 1.23 g) showed 21% and 9% higher biomass accumulation, respectively, compared with the control cells after 5 days. Compared with that in the control cells, the biomass was increased by approximately 43% when the cells were exposed to M2 (3.01 g) after 28 days. In addition, the use of magnetized water altered the accumulation pattern of isoflavonoids after 5 days of treatment. Isoflavonoid accumulation was the highest after treatment with M2 for 5 days and yielded 4.20 mg/g dry weight (DW) daidzein, 0.58 mg/g DW genistein, and 3.98 mg/g DW kwakhurin. When the cells were maintained in the treatment for a relatively long duration (28 days), a short span of magnetization (M1) resulted in the highest accumulation of isoflavonoids with the amounts of 3.51, 0.55, and 2.58 mg/g DW for daidzein, genistein, and kwakhurin, respectively. After 28 days of exposure to magnetized water, the expression of 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase and 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase increased, and this phenomenon coincided with the increased amount of isoflavonoids in the suspension cells. The magnetized water-treated PM cells also exhibited higher antioxidant activities than the control cells. The lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration (37.93 mg/mL) was observed in the cells treated with magnetized water after 15 min (M3). The enhanced total antioxidant activity of the cells treated with M3 may be attributed to the presence of other compounds in addition to isoflavonoids. This study represents an innovative attempt at a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach that can enhance the growth, secondary metabolite production, and antioxidant activity of PM suspension cells.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science
Enhanced productivity of extracellular free fatty acids by gene disruptions of acyl-ACP synthetase and S-layer protein in Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803","Background: Based on known metabolic response to excess free fatty acid (FFA) products, cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 preferentially both recycles via FFA recycling process and secrets them into medium. Engineered cyanobacteria with well growth and highly secreted FFA capability are considered best resources for biofuel production and sustainable biotechnology. In this study, to achieve the higher FFA secretion goal, we successfully constructs Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutants disrupting genes related to FFA recycling reaction (aas gene encoding acyl–acyl carrier protein synthetase), and surface layer protein (encoded by sll1951). Results: Three Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 engineered strains, including two single mutants lacking aas (KA) and sll1951 (KS), and one double mutant lacking both aas and sll1951 (KAS), significantly secreted FFAs higher than that of wild type (WT). Certain increase of secreted FFAs was noted when cells were exposed to nitrogen-deficient conditions, BG11-half N and BG11-N conditions, with the exception of strain KS. Under BG11-N condition at day 10, strain KAS strikingly secreted FFAs products up to 40%w/DCW or 238.1 mg/L, with trace amounts of PHB. Unexpectedly, strain KS, with S-layer disruption, appeared to have endured longer in BG11-N growth medium. This strain KS significantly acclimated to the BG11-N environment by accumulating a greater glycogen pool with lower FFA production, whereas strain KA favored higher PHB and intracellular lipid accumulations with moderate FFA secretion. Conclusions: Mutations of both aas and sll1951 genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 significantly improved the productivity of secreted FFAs, especially under nitrogen deprivation.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, energy, Immunology, environmental","Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Energy (miscellaneous), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
More Prominent Inflammatory Response to Pachyman Than to Whole‐Glucan Particle and Oat‐β‐Glucans in Dextran Sulfate‐Induced Mucositis Mice and Mouse Injection through Proinflammatory Macrophages,"Hiengrach P., Visitchanakun P., Finkelman M.A., Chancharoenthana W., Leelahavanichkul A.",2022-04-01,"Animals, Avena, beta-Glucans, Cytokines, Dextran Sulfate, Glucans, Interleukin-6, Lipopolysaccharides, Macrophages, Mice, Mucositis, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, DSS‐induced mucositis, extracellular flux, mice, microbiome, proinflammatory macrophages, β‐glucans","(1→3)‐β‐D‐glucans (BG) (the glucose polymers) are recognized as pathogen motifs, and different forms of BGs are reported to have various effects. Here, different BGs, including Pachyman (BG with very few (1→6)‐linkages), whole‐glucan particles (BG with many (1→6)‐glycosidic bonds), and Oat‐BG (BG with (1→4)‐linkages), were tested. In comparison with dextran sulfate solution (DSS) alone in mice, DSS with each of these BGs did not alter the weight loss, stool consistency, colon injury (histology and cytokines), endotoxemia, serum BG, and fecal microbiome but Pachy-man–DSS‐treated mice demonstrated the highest serum cytokine elicitation (TNF‐α and IL‐6). Like-wise, a tail vein injection of Pachyman together with intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the highest levels of these cytokines at 3 h post‐injection than LPS alone or LPS with other BGs. With bone marrow‐derived macrophages, BG induced only TNF‐α (most prominent with Pachyman), while LPS with BG additively increased several cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐6, and IL‐10); inflammatory genes (iNOS, IL‐1β, Syk, and NF‐κB); and cell energy alterations (extracellular flux analysis). In conclusion, Pachyman induced the highest LPS proinflammatory synergistic effect on macrophages, followed by WGP, possibly through Syk‐associated interactions between the Dectin‐1 and TLR‐4 signal transduction pathways. Selection of the proper form of BGs for specific clinical conditions might be beneficial.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Finding defects at an early stage of work can reduce cost and time of the rework. In order to conduct testing while there are incomplete classes in a system, stubs and drivers are introduced to temporarily replace incomplete classes. Development of stubs and drivers can take time and effort as a result testers usually try to use tools to mitigate them. Luengruengroj and Suwannasart [1] proposed an automated stubs-and-drivers generator. However, their generator aimed to help testers during integration testing. Our study presents an approach to generate stubs and drivers for system testing. Our approach uses a class diagram, sequence diagrams, and a Requirements Traceability Matrix as input. Class diagram is used to indicate classes' attributes and create a list of method signatures. Whereas sequence diagrams are used to indicate interaction between objects and produce a call graph. In addition, our approach uses the Requirements Traceability Matrix to discover system functions. After a call graph and the method signatures are extracted, they are used to generate classes of stubs and drivers along with test input values. Consequently, stubs and drivers are exported for system testing.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Control and Optimization"

Moreover, it is unclear whether risk factors for caries differ between breast milk-fed and formula milk-fed infants. Aim: To investigate dental caries in 13- to 18-month-old infants receiving breast milk or formula milk feeding and associated risk factors. Design: One hundred and sixty-six 13- to 18-month-old infants were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Information on feeding practices, demographics, and potential risk factors was collected using a caregiver questionnaire. Carious lesions were identified by visual and tactile examination. The Chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis. Results: The prevalence of caries in breast milk- and formula milk-fed infants was 31.8% and 36.0%, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (p =.579). Among all children, having dental plaque deposition on more than one third of the crown (adjusted OR (aOR): 15.11%; 95% CI: 6.11–37.35) and sleeping while milk feeding (aOR: 2.20%; 95%CI: 1.01–4.77) were associated with dental caries. In subgroup analysis, however, sleeping while milk feeding increased caries risk in the formula milk-fed group only (aOR: 2.95%; 95%CI: 1.07–8.12). Conclusions: The type of milk feeding was not associated with dental caries, whereas dental plaque and sleeping while milk feeding increased the odds of having dental caries in this population.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Due to its similarity of clinical symptoms with those of head trauma, clinical diagnosis of post-TBI hypopituitarism is challenging. To date, there is no standardized screening protocol for children with history of brain injury. This article demonstrates a case of 14-year-old boy with severe head trauma who developed refractory seizures with episodic hypoglycemia and weight loss. We aimed to focus on the prevalence, clinical courses and clinical implementations of each hormonal axis in children with post-traumatic brain injury hypopituitarism. We also aim to raise awareness of this condition to pediatricians in light of enhancing patient care. Methods: We have searched for original articles, published in English between year 2000 and 2021. There are 20 related articles, authors reviewed all the articles independently. Results: Prevalence of post-traumatic hypopituitarism ranges from 5-57% in children. Growth hormone is the most commonly affected hormone. The highest prevalence is 42.3% at more than 12 months after the brain injury. The symptoms and severity range from asymptomatic to requiring long-term hormonal therapy. Although normalization of pituitary function is demonstrated at various times after the injury, hormone replacement therapy is still required in some patients. Conclusions: This is the first report that demonstrates a presenting symptom of hypopituitarism mimic traumatic brain symptoms which result in it being overlooked. This case emphasizes the need to develop pituitary function screening protocols for children with TBI. We have proposed our pituitary screening protocol for children with TBI in this article.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

Methods: Participants were patients with schizophrenia aged 18–65 years receiving treatment in five tertiary hospitals. Disability was defined by a score of 10 or more of the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, version 2.0 (12-item WHODAS 2.0). Other data being collected included socio-demographic data, course of illness, antipsychotics, antipsychotic drug attitudes, behavioral/psychiatric symptoms, alcohol use, social supports, and quality of life at five visits, including weeks 0 (baseline), 24, 48, 72, and 96. Results: Of the 158 enrolled patients, we analyzed the data of 119 participants who were reassessed at least once during the follow-up. These 119 participants (70% male) had median age and age at psychotic onset of 38 and 22 years, respectively. Disability was found in 43 (36.1%) participants at baseline and 72 (64.7%) participants at week 96.

This retrospective study aimed to determine whether these features are poor prognostic factors independent of older age and adverse cytogenetics, which are commonly associated with a poor prognosis. Methods: The characteristics and real-world outcomes of sAML and AML-MRC from the Thai AML registry database were investigated. Results: From a total of 992 newly diagnosed AML patients, 315 (31.8%) patients were classified into sAML or AML-MRC subtypes. Older age, low white blood cell (WBC) count, low bone marrow blast, and adverse cytogenetic risk were commonly present in sAML and AML-MRC compared to de novo AML. Complete remission after 7 + 3 induction therapy occurred in 42.3% of patients with sAML or AML-MRC and 62.4% of de novo AML (P < .001). The median overall survival (OS) of sAML, AML-MRC, and de novo AML were 6.9, 7.0, and 12.2 months, respectively (P < .001). The independent prognostic factors for inferior OS were older age, intermediate-risk or adverse-risk cytogenetics, WBC count > 100 × 109/L, poor performance status, and a subgroup of AML-MRC with the morphologic criteria of multilineage dysplasia (AML-MRC-M). In addition, sAML, AML-MRC, and a WBC count > 100 × 109/L were pre-treatment prognostic factors associated with poor relapse-free survival (P = .006, P = .017, and P < .001, respectively). Conclusion: Both sAML and AML-MRC are independently associated with poor outcomes in Thai patients.

The synthesis and fabrication of CZO thin films by various techniques have been reported, but the sol-gel technique for both spin and dip coating has attracted much attention due to its safety, low cost and simple deposition equipment on a large surface-area. Motivated by the fact that reviews on CZO thin films have not been reported yet, this review summarizes the main chemical processes used in the fabrication of CZO thin films with special focus on the sol-gel synthesis involving several chemical and physical parameters such as solvent, additive, solution stirring and aging time, substrate and coating method which includes both dip and spin coating. It also highlights the various parameters influencing the structural, morphological, electronic, optical, vibrational and magnetic properties of the CZO thin films. For this purpose, a summary of various parameters of CZO thin films, reported in the literature survey of the past ten years (2010–2020), is tabulated and discussed. The influence of Cu doping on the synthesis and properties of CZO thin films is also reviewed. The structural, electronic, optical, magnetic and vibrational properties, as well as the elemental composition and surface morphology of the CZO thin films are also discussed. At the end of this review, an outlook is presented to gain more insights into the combined effects of the method-preparation-dopant combination on the properties of CZO thin films for future potential applications. This review should be a useful benchmark for researchers to explore the various physicochemical properties of CZO, their dependence on the experimental conditions and applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Using an inductive method, 21 research questions emerged under five non-predefined key themes, grouping them according to which: (1) characterise marine plastic pollution in Southeast Asia; (2) explore its movement and fate across the region; (3) describe the biological and chemical modifications marine plastic pollution undergoes; (4) detail its environmental, social, and economic impacts; and, finally, (5) target regional policies and possible solutions. Questions relating to these research priority areas highlight the importance of better understanding the fate of marine plastic pollution, its degradation, and the impacts and risks it can generate across communities and different ecosystem services. Knowledge of these aspects will help support actions which currently suffer from transboundary problems, lack of responsibility, and inaction to tackle the issue from its point source in the region. Being profoundly affected by marine plastic pollution, Southeast Asian countries provide an opportunity to test the effectiveness of innovative and socially inclusive changes in marine plastic governance, as well as both high and low-tech solutions, which can offer insights and actionable models to the rest of the world.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Traditional fermented foods are considered safe due to their long-standing consumption history, despite not having been evaluated for hygiene and microbiologically safety. Since Kapi is produced by natural fermentation, the microbiota differs depending on the raw material and production method. To control the quality of Kapi to a certain level, it is important to understand the microbiota of the product. In the present study, 27 Kapi samples purchased from wet markets and supermarkets were evaluated for microbiological safety and their microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. From the physicochemical analysis, the Kapi sample purchased at the wet market had a larger variation in pH and sodium chloride. Moreover, Kapi purchased from the wet market had a higher detection rate of E. coli, coliforms, and Bacillus group than those purchased from the supermarket.

Acid mine drainage potential of waste rocks in a gold mine (Thailand): application of a weathering cell test and multivariate statistical analysis,"Charuseiam Y., Chotpantarat S., Sutthirat C.",2022-03-01,"Ecosystem, Gold, Metals, Heavy, Mining, Thailand, Acid mine drainage, Gold mine, Heavy metals, Principal component analysis (PCA), Waste rock, Weathering cell test","In the process of gold mining, large amounts of broken waste rocks are produced and left at the surface under atmospheric conditions, which may generate acid mine drainage (AMD). This study aimed to predict the AMD generation potential and determine the concentrations of potentially toxic metals at three dump sites for a gold mine in Thailand. The AMD generation potentials of waste rock samples collected from the oxide, transition and sulfide dump sites was determined using the weathering cell test. The kinetic test had a 7-d cycle and was run for ~ 21 cycles; the effluent pH, conductivity, redox potential and levels of sulfate, and major and trace metals (i.e., As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) present in each cycle were measured. Some samples generated significant amounts of AMD, especially the massive sulfide samples from the transition and sulfide dump sites. The effluent water pH in the oxide and sulfide dump sites was neutral to slightly alkaline (pH ~ 6–9), while it was acidic to neutral (pH ~ 3–7) in the transition dump site. The transition dump site samples generated significantly higher acidity and sulfate levels than those from the oxide and sulfide dump sites. Furthermore, some waste rock samples, including the massive sulfide from the transition dump site, released relatively high amounts of heavy metals; in addition, sulfate reached levels (9.48 mg kg−1 of waste rock) high enough to pose a risk to ecosystems. The long-term acid generation suggested that some waste rock samples from sulfide dump site and transition dump site will continue to generate acid for long periods. Based on data from the weathering cell test and multivariate statistical analysis, the transition dump site potentially generates a lower pH leachate than other waste rock dumps.","pollution and waste management - non-radioactive, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

The Mpro forms a functional dimer and exhibits a pH-dependent enzyme activity and dimerization. Here, we report a molecular dynamics (MD) investigation to gain insights into the structural stability of the enzyme dimer at neutral and acidic pH. Our data shows larger changes in structure of the protein with the acidic pH than that with the neutral pH. Structural analysis of MD trajectories reveals a substantial increase in intersubunit separation, the loss of domain contacts, binding free energy and interaction energy of the dimer which implies the protein instability and tendency of dimer dissociation at acidic pH. The loss in the interaction energy is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions. We have identified the intersubunit hydrogen-bonding residues involved in the decreased dimer stability. These findings may be helpful for rational drug design and target evaluation against COVID-19.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"
"Utilizing the built-in electric field of p-n heterojunction to spatially separate the photogenerated charges in C, N co-doped Co3O4/CdS photocatalysts","Chen T., Yang C., Rajendran S., Sawangphruk M., Zhang X., Qin J.",2022-01-01,"Built-in electric fields, C, N co-doped co3O4, Co-doped, Composited, P-n heterojunctions, P-n type heterojunction, Photo-catalytic, Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, Photogenerated charge, SIMPLE method, Built-in electric field, CdS, CN-CoO, P-n type heterojunction, Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution","As one of the most effective strategies for the storage and utilization of solar energy, the development of photocatalytic technology has received extensive attention. The core work, the design and modification of photocatalysts, is very significance. Herein, we prepared C, N co-doped Co3O4 (CN-CoO) by a simple method and composited it with CdS to form CN-CoO/CdS p-n type heterojunctions. The prepared materials are characterized by numerous tests, such as XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, and photoelectrochemical measurement. Due to the excellent electrochemical performance of CN-CoO and the built-in electric field in CN-CoO/CdS, the efficient separation of photogenerated charges is realized. Compared with CdS (1.11 ns), the average carrier lifetimes of the 15%CN-CoO/CdS (1.63 ns) is prolonged, which enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the composite materials. The hydrogen evolution rate of the optimal 15%CN-CoO/CdS is 6.78-fold greater than that of pristine CdS, and is as high as 64.36 mmol·g−1·h−1. Meanwhile, the 15%CN-CoO/CdS exhibits outstanding chemical stability after cyclic hydrogen production experiment for 30 h, and its apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) reaches 27.47% under monochromatic light at 405 nm. In addition, the formation process and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism of the CN-CoO/CdS p-n type heterojunctions are analyzed and discussed. This work provides a new idea for the construction of efficient photocatalytic heterojunctions through the modification and combination of semiconductors.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"
Reimbursement Savings Associated With Tissue Versus Mechanical Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Thailand,"Kittayarak C., Reifenberger M., Chan S., Keuffel E.L.",2022-11-01,"Anticoagulants, Aortic Valve, Aortic Valve Stenosis, Humans, Thailand, Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, health economics, health systems policy, reimbursement, surgical aortic valve replacement","Objectives: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is an indicated treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Although mechanical valves are typically more durable, tissue SAVR valves do not require lifetime anticoagulation monitoring and may have lower rates of expensive sequelae. This economic evaluation estimates payer costs to the 3 largest Thai health insurance mechanisms for tissue versus mechanical SAVR. Methods: A deterministic and Monte Carlo simulation model based on literature and expert opinion estimated total payer costs for tissue and mechanical valves over a 25-year duration for 3 separate age cohorts (45, 55, and 65 years). Reimbursements levels for hospitalization services were from the Thai Diagnosis Related Groups. Separate models are generated for the 3 main Thai health insurance mechanisms. Results: The discounted expected 25-year reduction in payer savings associated with tissue SAVR are $2540, $2529, and $2311 per surgery for patients aged 45, 55, and 65 years, respectively, for the largest Thai insurer. Expected cost reductions associated with tissue SAVR are larger for each of the other schemes and generally decrease with patient age. Most savings accrue within 10 years of surgery. Reoperation costs are larger with tissue valves, but reductions in complications and anticoagulation monitoring more than offset these expenditures. Results are robust to multiple sensitivity and scenario analyses. Conclusions: Coverage and reimbursement of tissue valves can financially benefit Thai insurers and reduce expenditures in the Thai health system compared with mechanical valves. As tissue valve technology evolves and reoperation rates decline, the financial benefit associated with tissue valves will increase.","Economics, pharmacology, medical","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous), Health Policy"

We assessed the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume and its associated factors among people with HIV (PWH).Design:A cross-sectional study.Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study among PWH aged at least 50 years and age-matched and sex-matched HIV-negative older individuals in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants underwent a noncontrast, cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and EAT between March 2016 and June 2017. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to investigate HIV-related factors, cardiac and metabolic markers associated with EAT volume.Results:Median age was 55 years [interquartile range (IQR) 52-60] and 63% were men. Median duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was 16 years with 97% had HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml and median CD4+cell count of 617 cells/μl. Median EAT volume was significantly higher in PWH [99 (IQR 75-122) cm3] than HIV-negative individuals [93 (IQR 69-117) cm3], P = 0.022. In adjusted model, factors associated with EAT volume included male sex (P = 0.045), older age (P < 0.001), abnormal waist circumference (P < 0.001) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.01). In addition, higher CAC score was independently associated with EAT volume. Higher mean EAT volume was seen in PWH with severe liver steatosis than those without steatosis (P = 0.018). In adjusted PWH-only model, duration of HIV was significantly associated with higher EAT volume (P = 0.028).Conclusion:In an aging cohort, PWH had higher EAT volume than HIV-negative controls. EAT was also independently associated with central fat accumulation, insulin resistance, liver steatosis and CAC score.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

In affective disorders, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies disclosed new pathway phenotypes, including an ROI—reoccurrence of illness (ROI)—oxidative stress latent construct. The aim of the present study is to delineate a) whether ACEs sensitize the M1 macrophage, the T helper cells (Th)1, Th2, and Th17, the IRS (immune-inflammatory-responses system), the CIRS (compensatory immunoregulatory system), and the neuroimmunotoxic and growth factor (GF) profiles and whether they are associated with ROI and the phenome of affective disorders and b) the molecular pathways underpinning the effects of the ACEs. We collected supernatants of stimulated (5 µg/mL of PHA and 25 µg/mL of LPS) and unstimulated diluted whole blood in 20 healthy controls and 30 depressed patients and measured a panel of 27 cytokines/GF using a Luminex method. ACEs (comprising mental and physical trauma, mental neglect, domestic violence, family history of mental disease, and parent loss) are accompanied by the increased stimulated, but not unstimulated, production of M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, IRS, neuroimmunotoxic, and GF profiles and are strongly corre-lated with ROI and the phenome. A latent vector extracted from the ROI features (recurrent episodes and suicidal behaviors) and the IRS/neuroimmunotoxic/GF profiles explains 66.8% of the variance in the phenome and completely mediates the effects of ACEs on the phenome. Enrichment analysis showed that the ACE-associated sensitization of immune/GF profiles involves JAK-STAT, nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α, G-protein coupled receptor, PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK, and hypoxia signaling. In summary, the ACE-induced sensitization of immune pathways and secondary immune hits predicts the phenome of affective disorders.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of the F8W test and the F8W test with a dual-tasking in predicting future falls in older adults. Methods: Eighty older adults between the ages of 60 and 80 were recruited. At the beginning of the study, participants completed the standard F8W test, F8W test with a cognitive task, and F8W test with a motor task. The number of falls was documented during a six-month follow-up. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare the accuracy for predicting falls. The cut-off points and the psychometric properties of the tests were computed. Results: The F8W test with a motor task had the highest accuracy for predicting falls in older adults, with an AUC of 0.74 (95%CI = 0.63–0.83). The F8W with a motor task's optimal cut-off score was >12 s, with a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 65.0%. Conclusion: The F8W with a motor task was a more potent tool for detecting fall risk than the standard F8W or the F8W with a cognitive task.

In this study, we investigated the profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with HCC and PBMCs from a co-culture model using transcriptomic analysis. The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were then characterized and integrated as cancer-induced lncRNAs. Among them, three up-regulating DElncRNAs including MIR4435-2HG, SNHG9 and lnc-LCP2-1 and one down-regulating, lnc-POLD3-2, were identified. The functional analysis showed that these enriched lncRNAs were mainly associated with carcinogenesis and immune responses. Following further validation in PBMCs samples (100 HBV-related HCC, 100 chronic hepatitis B and 100 healthy controls), MIR4435-2HG, lnc-POLD3-2 and their combination were revealed to be sensitive biomarkers in discriminating HCC from non-HCC (AUROC = 0.78, 0.80, and 0.87, respectively), particularly among individuals with normal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. Additionally, high circulating SNHG9 expression was shown to be an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC. These results indicate that determining these lncRNAs in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HBV-related HCC.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Although reservoir sediments can be excavated, nonetheless, sizeable dumping lands for such excavated sediments are unavailable at this time. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the destructive and nondestructive properties and microstructural characteristics of reservoir sediments solidified with fly ash–cement blend for reuse as construction materials. The obtained natural sediment was classified as well-graded sand with silt. The destructive experiments comprised unconfined compression, indirect tension, California bearing ratio, resilient modulus, and durability against wet–dry cycle tests, while the nondestructive experiments included a free–free resonance test. Microstructural investigations consisting of X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry were performed to verify the macroscale test results. The results showed that fly ash–cement blend exhibited increased strength values on the order of 2 to 9 times that of unsolidified sediments. Using fly ash-blended cement was more effective than using sole cement or sole fly ash, and mixtures with 10% fly ash delivered the best strength and modulus values. Various functional empirical correlations were proposed. Utilizing six wet–dry cycles is acceptable because the strength of the samples subjected to the six wet–dry cycles was lower than the given value. The results of the peak intensities of calcium silicate hydrate, mass losses, calcium contents, and scanning electron microscopy images derived from the microstructural investigations confirmed the macroscale test results.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

Nowadays, there are three methods for wax prevention: mechanical, thermal and chemical methods. The advantage of applying chemical is easy to utilise. Pour point reduction is one of the mechanisms to reduce wax deposition. Moreover, water is produced along with oil leading to form emulsion. Emulsion is the mixing between crude oil and water with emulsifier from crude oil itself. In this study, the objectives are to select potential chemicals for pour point reduction and to investigate the effect emulsion on pour point. The potential chemical selection has been made by running experiment and comparing the effect of pour point on oil and emulsion varying from 0 to 20% water cut. Later, the experiment continues to apply with 40 and 60% water cut to investigate the effect of amount of water cut. There are two groups of chemicals, solvents which are n-heptane and n-hexane and crystal modifiers. From the results, it reveals that both solvents at higher concentration can reduce pour point effectively. However, the crystal modifiers have less effect on pour point reduction. Furthermore, an increasing of percentage of water cut is also one of factors to increase pour point, whilst the effect of chemical on pour point reduction will be reduced. From this study, the problem of wax deposition from crude oil production can be lowered with the pour point reducing agent such as n-heptane and this can be applied in the field for practical oil production in the future.","engineering, coastal engineering","Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

Forty groundwater samples were collected at different locations in the dry and wet seasons during March and August of 2019, respectively. The hydrochemical facies illustrate that the major groundwater types in both seasons mainly consisted of Ca–Na–HCO3, Ca–HCO3–Cl and Na–HCO3 types. The concentration of As ranged from <0.300 to 183.00 μg/L, accounting for 22% (18 of 80 samples), exceeding the WHO guidelines of 10 μg/L. The spatial distribution of As was distinctly predominant as a hot spot in some areas during the wet season. The wells may have been contaminated from human activity and thus constituted a point source in the adjacent area. For Pb, its concentration in all the wells were not exceeded 10 μg/L of the WHO guidelines, appearing as a background concentration in this area. Most of the wells were shown to be in an oxidation state, supporting AsV mobility. Moreover, the area also had a nearly neutral pH that promoted AsV desorption, while the presence of undissolved Pb in the aquifers tended to increase. Furthermore, chemical applications to agricultural processes could release the As composition into the groundwater. The health risk resulting from oral consumption was at a higher risk level than dermal contact. The non-carcinogenic risk affecting the adult population exceeded the threshold level by approximately 27.5% of the wells, while for the children group, the risk level was within the limit. Total cancer risk (TCR) of adult residents exceeded the acceptable risk level (1 × 10−6) in all wells, causing carcinogenic health effects. Therefore, health surveillance is important in monitoring the toxic effects on the local residents who use groundwater from these contaminated wells. Furthermore, a sanitation service and an alternative treatment of the water supply will be needed, especially in wells with high As levels.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; groundwater, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

This widespread practicality combined with the computation complexity of these problems has led to a significant amount of research through the years. In this paper, a learning enhanced golden ball algorithm is developed to address the vehicle routing problem with backhaul and time windows. The meta-heuristic is inspired by competitive soccer league concepts. Many modifications to previous golden ball algorithm implementations were required but three new elements have been developed. First, a forbidden list technique improves the initial solutions used by the algorithm. Second, a new operator, flexible crossover, is proposed to improve solutions. Finally, a structural change to the sequence of operations was implemented to increase the search domain and thereby reduce the chance of having the algorithm get stuck at a local optimum. The algorithm was applied to 45 well-known standard problems from the literature that other researchers have used to test different approaches. So, each instance has best-known solutions that have been improved through the years using a variety of approaches. The algorithm proposed here found equivalent or superior solutions to 40 of the 45 problems. Further, stable solutions were found for larger problems using a desktop computer in less than two hours so this could be useful in practice.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Under these optimised extraction conditions, good linearity between 5.00 and 30.0 µg L−1 was achieved along with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.25 µg L−1 and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 3.79 µg L−1. Furthermore, the reusability of the NPC-PBZ-m column was found up to 8 cycles making it a new cost-effective material for herbicide enrichment. Finally, this developed method was successfully applied to analyse ATZ in water samples from rice fields, fish farms, and natural canal water, with 98–117% relative recoveries. These results indicate that NPC-PBZ-m with our proposed method is feasible and demonstrates its potential application as an effective adsorbent for herbicide enrichment.","mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Soil Science, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Tapioca starch/PVA plastic films with water hyacinth powder: Enhanced stability in direct contact with moisture,"Chokboribal J., Nantachai T., Jongnimitphaiboon K., Chumprasert S., Suchaiya V.",2022-01-01,"%moisture, Alcohol waters, Plastic thin film, Powder films, Resistance to biodegradation, Tapioca starch, Thermoplastic starch, Thermoplastic starch/PVA blend, Thin-films, Water Hyacinth, Natural fiber, Plastic thin film, Resistance to biodegradation, Thermoplastic starch/PVA blend, Water hyacinth","Thermoplastic starch/polyvinyl alcohol (TS/PVA) composite is high potential plastic material but its applications are restricted owing to its strong hydrophilicity. In this study, different amounts of cellulosic fibers in the form of powder were added to TS/PVA blend with the aim of slowing down the biodegradation rate of TS/PVA films in an environment with direct moisture contact. Water hyacinth as waste biomass is considered as a readily available and low-cost source of natural cellulosic fibers. Water hyacinth powder (WHp) was prepared from fresh water hyacinth leaves and petioles with bleaching as the only treatment carried out. TS/PVA films were prepared by sol–gel casting. A preliminary study revealed that the [7:20]-TS/PVA films containing 7% w/v of tapioca starch and 20% w/w (of starch dry weight) PVA are of highest potential in term of tensile properties. A series of [7:20/x]-TS/PVA/WHp films were prepared, where “x” refers to the percentage by weight of WHp (with respect to starch dry weight) added to the TS/PVA blend and ranges from 10, 15, 20 to 25%. It is found that, although the addition of WHp results in inferior tensile properties, the films’ elasticities are partially recovered when higher amount of WHp is added. Differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed that glass transition temperatures of the films with WHp additive is slightly higher than that of the film without the additive. The best tensile properties are observed in the [7:20/20]-TS/PVA/WHp films with the ultimate tensile strength of 14.20 ± 0.08 MPa. The resistances of the [7:20/x]-TS/PVA/WHp films to biodegradation in direct contact with moisture were assessed by burying in moisture-rich soil for weeks. All of the [7:20/x]-TS/PVA/WHp films are biodegradable but degrades at significantly slower rate than that observed in the [7:20]-TS/PVA films. The 2-week cumulative extent of biodegradation of the [7:20/20]-TS/PVA/WHp films reduces to 54.91%. From fabrication perspective, the incorporation of WHp at 20% w/w enhances the films’ stabilities against moisture to the greatest extent while retains usable elasticity for a range of applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Porphyromonas gingivalis Induces Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Femur in Mice,"Wu S., Li F., Tan J., Ye X., Le Y., Liu N., Everts V., Wan Q.",2022-06-22,"Animals, Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw, Diphosphonates, Femur, Imidazoles, Mice, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Zoledronic Acid, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the femur, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), osteoclasts, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Zoledronic acid","One of the most prominent characteristics of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw(BRONJ) is its site-specificity. Osteonecrosis tends to occur specifically in maxillofacial bones, in spite of a systemic administration of the medicine. Previous studies suggested rich blood supply and fast bone turnover might be reasons for BRONJ. Yet, a sound scientific basis explaining its occurrence is still lacking. The present study aimed to explore the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), an important oral pathogen, on the site-specificity of bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with zoledronic acid (ZA) or saline for 3 weeks. In the third week, the right mandibular first molars were extracted and circular bone defects with a diameter of 1 mm were created in right femurs. After the operation, drug administration was continued, and P. gingivalis suspension was applied to the oral cavities and femur defects. The mice were killed after four or eight weeks postoperatively. The right mandibles and femurs were harvested for micro-CT and histological analyses. A poor healing of bone defects of both jaws and femurs was noted in mice injected with both ZA and P. gingivalis. Micro-CT analysis showed a decreased bone volume, and histological staining showed an increased number of empty osteocyte lacunae, a decreased collagen regeneration, an increased inflammatory infiltration and a decreased number of osteoclasts. In addition, the left femurs were collected for isolation of osteoclast precursors (OCPs). The osteoclastogenesis potential of OCPs was analyzed in vitro. OCPs extracted from mice of ZA-treated groups were shown to have a lower osteoclast differentiation potential and the expression level of related genes and proteins was declined. In conclusion, we established a mouse model of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of both the jaw and femur. P. gingivalis could inhibit the healing of femur defects under the administration of ZA. These findings suggest that P. gingivalis in the oral cavity might be one of the steering compounds for BRONJ to occur.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

It is extended to unsaturated soils by applying Bishop's effective stress and using the effective degree of saturation as an independent state variable. Then, a critical state model for unsaturated clay and sand is formulated based on the unified state boundary surface. The model combines a rational soil–water characteristic curve incorporating packing density and hydraulic hysteresis. The model is validated by comparing the calculated results and results of extensive experiments, including one-dimensional and isotropic compression tests, triaxial shearing tests, and soaking-collapse tests under isotropic and anisotropic stress conditions on sand, clay, and mixed soil under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The proposed unified soil model presents a noble and universal framework for the rational description of broad soils’ behavior, in which the state boundary surface plays a central role. The model accurately predicts the compression, shearing, and soaking-induced collapse behaviors of various soil types in saturated and unsaturated conditions.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

In this study, we developed a chitosan nanoparticle TiLV immersion vaccine and assessed the efficacy of the vaccine in laboratory and field trials. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the inactivated vaccine had a particle size of 210.3 nm, while the nano inactivated vaccine had a spherical shape with a diameter of 120.4 nm. Further analysis using fluorescent staining and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the mucoadhesive properties of the nanovaccine (CN-KV) through fish gills. We assessed the efficacy of an immersion-based TiLV nanovaccine using a cohabitation challenge model. The fish that received the nanovaccine showed better relative percent survival (RPS) at 68.17% compared with the RPS of the inactivated virus vaccine (KV) group at 25.01%. The CN-KV group also showed a higher TiLV-specific antibody response than the control and KV groups (p < 0.05). Importantly, under field conditions, the fish receiving the CN-KV nanovaccine had better RPS at 52.2% than the nonvaccinated control group. Taken together, the CN-KV nanovaccinated fish showed better survival and antibody response than the control and KV groups both under laboratory control challenge conditions and field trials. The newly developed immersion-based nanovaccine is easy to administer in small fish, is less labor-intensive, and allows for mass vaccination to protect fish from TiLV infection.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The difference between CAVs and regular human-piloted vehicles (RHVs) is driving behavior. The driving behavior of CAVs is expected to be more standardized than that of RHVs. Therefore, we assume that when the penetration ratio of CAVs increases in the lane flow, the mean lane capacity will increase, and the lane capacity variance will decrease. The mean and the variance of lane travel time decrease when the penetration ratio increases. Following this assumption, the difference in the stochastic properties between CAVs and RHVs is considered in a traffic assignment model. The traffic assignment model is formulated as a variational inequality problem. The network design problem with equilibrium constraints was solved by a simulated annealing algorithm in a test network.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering","Transportation, Engineering (all)"

The results demonstrated that GQDs can be curved with an external electric field (EEF). The curvature of GQDs varies with the field strength and size of GQDs. The curvature of GQDs is in the following order C96H24 > C54H18 > C24H12. The electronic structure (HOMO-LUMO gap) of GQDs is also affected by EEF. The bandgap becomes narrower when applied a stronger electric field. Therefore, the electronic property of GQDs can be tuned by EEF. We also found the HOMO-LUMO gap of GQDs to be varied with its curvature. Thus, an external electric field can induce the curvature of GQDs and can be used to modify its electronic structure.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry","Physics and Astronomy (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Microalgae have been proposed as a suitable biological platform to reduce carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, while also creating commercial sources of high-value compounds such as medicines, cosmetics, food, feed, and biofuel. Industrialization of microalgae culture and valorization is still limited by significant challenges in scaling up the production processes due to economic constraints and productivity capacities. Therefore, a boost in resource usage efficiency is required. This enhancement not only lowers manufacturing costs but also enhancing the long-term viability of microalgae-based products. Using wastewater as a nutrient source is a great way to reduce manufacturing costs. Furthermore, water scarcity is one of the most important global challenges. In recent decades, industrialization, globalization, and population growth have all impacted freshwater resources. Moreover, high amounts of organic and inorganic toxins in the water due to the disposal of waste into rivers can have severe impacts on human and animal health. Microalgae cultures are a sustainable solution to tertiary and quaternary treatments since they have the ability to digest complex contaminants.

However, maintaining two plasmids in a single bacterial cell is not desirable; therefore, a single plasmid harboring both the PstDNV capsid and the dsRNA-YHV-pro gene was constructed under the regulation of a single T7 promoter, designated pET28a-Linked cpPstDNV-dspro. Following induction, this novel construct expressed an approximately 37-kDa recombinant protein associated with a roughly 400-bp dsRNA (Linked cpPstDNV-dspro). Under a transmission electron microscope, the virus-like particles (VLP; Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro) obtained were seen to be monodispersed, similar to the native PstDNV virion. A nuclease digestion assay indicated dsRNA molecules were both encapsulated and present outside the Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro. In addition, the amount of dsRNA produced from this strategy was higher than that obtained with a co-expression strategy. In a YHV infection challenge, the Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro was more effective in delaying and reducing mortality than other constructs tested. Lastly, the linked construct provides protection for the dsRNA cargo from nucleolytic enzymes present in the shrimp hemolymph.

Most of these countries do not include meningococcal immunization in their routine vaccination programs, except for high-risk groups such as immunocompromised people and pilgrims. It is difficult to estimate the epidemiology of IMD in the highly diverse Asia-Pacific region, but available evidence indicate serogroup B is increasingly dominant. Disease surveillance systems differ by country. IMD is not a notifiable disease in some of them.

Due to the wide distribution and morphological similarities of Curcuma species, the classification of some species is debated and nomenclature is inconsistent among countries. In this study, to elucidate specific molecular markers of medicinally used Curcuma species in Asia, and to solve the confusion on the reported botanical origin of crude drugs, molecular analysis based on the intron length polymorphism (ILP) in genes encoding diketide-CoA synthase and curcumin synthase and the trnK intron sequences was performed using 59 plant specimens and 42 crude drug samples from 13 Curcuma species, obtained from Asian countries. The ILP patterns of the respective species from both plant specimens and crude drug samples revealed high consistency in C. aromatica, C. zedoaria, C. phaeocaulis, C. aeruginosa, C. wenyujin, and C. zanthorrhiza, but showed intraspecies polymorphism in C. longa, C. kwangsiensis, C. amada, C. mangga and C. comosa. The C. longa specimens and samples were separated into three subgroups which were highly consistent with their geographical origins. Based on the ILP markers and the trnK intron sequences, the botanical origins of “Khamin oi” from Thailand were correctly determined to be C. longa or a hybrid between C. longa and other species, and “Wan narn kum” from Thailand and “Kasturi manjal” from India were correctly determined to be C. zanthorrhiza.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, pharmacology, medical, chemistry","Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Organic Chemistry"

TIGE is a group of clinical and academic gynaecologists with a particular interest in endometriosis. Endometriosis is an oestrogen-dependent inflammatory disease which causes chronic symptoms such as dysmenorrhoea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia and subfertility, and it is common in reproductive-age women. There is limited overall data on its prevalence in different clinical settings in Thailand, but it is clear that the disease causes significant problems for patients in terms of their working lives, fertility, and quality of life, as well as placing a great burden on national healthcare resources. Decisions about selecting the appropriate treatment for women with endometriosis depend on many factors including the age of the patient, the extent and severity of disease, concomitant conditions, economic status, patient preference, access to medication, and fertility need. Several hormonal treatments are available but no consensus has been reached about the best option for long-term prevention of recurrence. Bearing in mind differences in environment, genetics, and access to the healthcare system, this treatment guideline has been tailored to the particular circumstances of Thai women.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology
Global transcriptome analyses and regulatory mechanisms in Halothece sp.

The cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece) exhibits remarkable halotolerance and was used to examine stress-responsive regulatory mechanisms. The effects of five different stimuli on Halothece transcriptomes were examined using RNA sequencing. In response to diverse stresses, there were both common and stress-specific transcriptional responses. A common upregulated gene set under all stresses consisted of nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also found that osmotic stress elicited the largest set of DEGs. Salt- and osmotic-responsive regulatory mechanisms shared common pathways. DEGs that were upregulated under salt stress encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and related machineries. Furthermore, DEGs encoding two-component system (TCS) factors, transcriptional factors, scaffolds for protein–protein interactions, transporters, protein turnover factors, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes were also identified under salt stress. Notably, one-carbon (1C) metabolism factors, glycine betaine (GB) synthesis enzymes, and GB transporters were upregulated under salt stress. Metabolic analyses revealed that GB accumulated under salt stress, while mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G) accumulated under salt or osmotic stress. None of the nutrient starvations induced GB nor M2G accumulation. These results suggested that GB and M2G are two osmoprotectants that contribute to halotolerance. Based on our results, we proposed regulatory mechanisms that are crucial for halotolerance, which are coordinated with the GB, M2G, 1C, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways. 1C metabolism directly fulfills the high metabolite requirements for halotolerance together with the ancillary role of several metabolic pathways. Key Points • Global transcriptome surveys together with molecular and metabolite analyses provide insights into regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance • Regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance coordinated with the two key osmoprotectants, one carbon, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways • The findings have translational relevance in genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of halotolerance","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Shophouses were built with typical designs in a massive number in Bangkok during the 1960s and 1970s. They are now deteriorating, but still occupy a great proportion of the land near the city center. To make shophouse renovation easy for mass adoption and application will allow Bangkok’s population to have more choices of housing that suit their lifestyle and support their wellbeing. It challenges the mainstream perception of seeing only the choices of living in a condominium near the center or in a suburban house. By observation and literature review, the research categorized typical features and problems of old shophouses into four groups; (i) space and form, (ii) climate, (iii) wellbeing, and (iv) construction. After case studies, designing, and constructing a prototype renovation design, the research concluded with design strategies to increase the space flexibility, climatic responsiveness, safety, aesthetics, and hygiene. Taking procedural and legal limitations, and the minimal involvement of professionals and the authority into account, maintaining particular features of existing buildings as much as possible and adding new features as little as possible were also suggested. These strategies would promote mass renovation of shophouses. By reducing demolition and supporting urban redevelopment, they would potentially help reviving urban heritage and reducing carbon footprint.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology, arts","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Cultural Studies, Building and Construction, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)"

A sequential recommender system with drift detection was proposed, where drift points are indicated by comparing characteristics of consecutive items. The model leverages drift points to retrieve only interactions with preferences relevant to the current user preference. Nonetheless, the number of utilized items is pre-defined and may not be optimal. It is also not a unified architecture that requires optimizing each part individually. Recently, a Content-Based Transformer has been proposed to consider only items with similar characteristics by leveraging a similarity function. Content-Based Transformer is trained in an end-to-end approach and can be applied for the sequential recommendation task, where the drift of the user preference is indicated as the point where the item-s group changes. However, Content-Based Transformer provides the item-s group as the hard label, ignoring the item characteristics in a real-world scenario where items can exist in many groups. For instance, most movies have multiple genres. This work proposes a unified sequential recommender system that detects the personalized drift pattern of user preference. It groups similar items with soft labels and utilizes the optimal amount of items. The model is trained in an end-to-end approach to jointly optimize for group items with similar characteristics and deliver relevant recommendations. We conducted the experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with Content-Based Transformers and related methods. The evaluation results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the baselines.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This situation poses a challenge to many countries, including developed ones, on how to dispose of PW. Accordingly, PW was utilized in this study to replace coarse aggregates partially in high-volume fly-ash (HVFA) concrete. However, PW decreased the strength and durability of concrete. To address this issue, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were added to mitigate the negative consequences of PW and HVFA on concrete's properties. The objective of this study is to investigate the influences of PW and GNP contents on the durability and deformation of HVFA concrete. Response-surface methodology (RSM) was used to design and optimize a series of cement mixes to achieve the most desirable properties. Independent variables included PW content as partial replacement for coarse aggregates (0%, 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60% by volume), fly ash as partial substitute for cement (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% by volume), and GNPs as additives (0%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.225%, and 0.3%). The considered responses were concrete unit weight, modulus of elasticity (MoE), and Cantabro abrasion loss at 300 revolutions. Results showed that PW and HVFA decreased concrete unit weight and MoE but increased Cantabro abrasion loss. By contrast, GNPs increased concrete unit weight and MoE but decreased Cantabro abrasion loss. PW and HVFA also increased the compressive toughness and porosity of concrete, while GNPs increased its stiffness but decreased its compressive toughness and porosity. The mathematical models developed to predict the unit weight, MoE, and abrasion resistance of concrete were significant, with errors of less than 6%. An optimized mix was achieved by partially replacing 12.44% of coarse aggregates with PW and 24.57% of cement with fly ash and adding 0.279% GNPs with a desirability of 100%.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"

The textile dye waste remediation is crucial as it may contain several toxic elements. The utilization of bacterial consortium for bioremediation has acquired consideration, over the utilization of single strains. In this study, a microbial consortium containing three bacterial sp. (Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacillus borstelensis and Bacillus firmus) was tested for its degrading ability of the textile RR 170 dye. The bacterial consortium degraded the dye effectively at lower concentrations and the efficiency decreased as the dye concentration increased. SEM analysis revealed that, with dye treatment, the consortium appeared as tightly packed clumps with rough cell surface and were able to produce EPS and biofilms. EPS production was higher at 40 mg/l, 100 mg/l and 200 mg/l of the dye treatment conditions. Interestingly, the maximum biofilm formation was observed only at 40 μg/ml of the dye treatment, which indicates that RR 170 dye concentration affects the biofilm formation independent of EPS levels. The UV–vis spectroscopy, HPLC, FTIR and 2D-FTIR analyses confirmed the decolorization and biodegradation of RR 170 dye by the bacterial consortium. Toxicological studies performed with the dye and their degraded products in Allium cepa root cells revealed that, whereas the RR 170 dye induced genotoxic stress, the degraded dye products showed no significant genotoxic effects in root cells. Together, the investigated bacterial consortium decolorized and degraded the RR 170 dye resulting in metabolites that are non-toxic to the living cells.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

We also demonstrate how to plot the 12 major scores in a single RADAR graph, which displays all features in a two-dimensional plot. These graphs allow the characteristics of a patient to be displayed as an idiomatic fingerprint, allowing one to estimate the key traits and severity of the illness at a glance.

Whether the increased accuracy leads to a corresponding improvement in clinical outcomes has not yet been systematically investigated. The aim of this critical review was to investigate whether the use of CAIS can lead to reduction of complications as well as improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) when compared with conventional freehand implant surgery. A comprehensive online search was conducted to identify studies where implants were installed with static computer-assisted implant surgery (s-CAIS)or dynamic computer-assisted implant surgery(d-CAIS) or combinations of the two, either compared with conventional free-hand implant placement or not. Seventy-seven studies were finally included in qualitative analysis, while data from three studies assessing postsurgical pain were suitable for a meta-analysis. Only a small number of the available studies were comparative. The current evidence does not suggest any difference with regard to intraoperative complications, immediate postsurgical healing, osseointegration success, and survival of implants placed with CAIS or freehand protocols. Intraoperative and early healing events as reported by patients in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) did not differ significantly between CAIS used with flap elevation and conventional implant placement. There is limited evidence that increased accuracy of placement with CAIS is correlated with superior esthetic outcomes. Use of CAIS does not significantly reduce the length of surgeries in cases of single implants and partially edentulous patients, although there appears to be a more favorable impact in fully edentulous patients. Although CAIS alone does not seem to improve healing and the clinical and PRO, to the extent that it can increase the utilization of flapless surgery and predictability of immediacy protocols, its use may indirectly lead to substantial improvements in all of the above parameters.",dentistry,Periodontics

The porous PBSA matrices were fabricated via solvent casting and particulate leaching method using Tween20 as a pore generator, and the matrices were capable of absorbing the drug solution within 3 s prior to the release. The Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were successfully synthesized via co-precipitation method and successfully coated with pectin through the electrostatic attraction. The 5-fluorouracil, the model drug, was successfully loaded onto the pectin coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles through the hydrogen bonding. Under magnetic fields, the drug diffusion coefficient increased by the factors of 2 and 5 by the 157 and 247 mT permanent magnets, respectively, whereas the drug release duration was reduced. This was due to the magnetic attraction between the magnetic particles and the magnets. Under the combined electric voltage of 3 V and the magnetic flux of 157 mT, the drug diffusion coefficient increased and the release duration was reduced further, due to the combined driving forces between the magnetic attraction, the electrostatic repulsion of the negative charged pectin layer, and the electro-osmosis. The present work demonstrates the potentials and benefits of the porous matrices along with the combined magnetic and electric fields in the transdermal drug delivery.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

At present, the provision of a SOC estimation for zinc-air flow batteries (ZAFBs) is still at its early stage of development. This work sets out to develop the SOC estimator for ZAFBs. The estimator is based-on a linear parameter varying (LPV) model integrated with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The LPV model is constructed from multiple linear time-invariant (LTI) models with battery current and SOC as scheduling parameters. It is observed that the response data for ZAFBs have an exceptionally flat profile related to SOC change; dynamic differentiation only occurs when SOC is almost depleted. For this reason, the estimation of SOC converges to the true value when SOC is near depletion. In this work, it is shown that by appropriate tuning, the SOC estimation performance of the LPV model combined with EKF performs well as the absolute errors of soc. estimation lie under 2 % after true SOC convergence. The LPV model with the EKF algorithm is also compared with the Luenberger observer (LO). The proposed estimator can surpass the LO estimator. Overall, this SOC estimator provides a systematic way to fulfill the requirements of a battery management system.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

An Effective Pricing Mechanism for Electricity Trading Considering Customer Preference and Reserved Price in Direct P2P Electricity Market Under Uncertainty in Grid Supply,"Amin W., Ahmad F., Umer K., Khawaja A.H., Afzal M., Ahmad S.A., Chaitusaney S.",2022-01-01,"Consumer, Peer to peer, Peer-to-peer computing, Peer-to-peer market, Power distributions, Power systems economics, Pricing mechanism, Renewable energy source, Small scale, Small-scale seller, Uncertainty, consumers, game theory, peer-to-peer market, Pricing mechanism, small-scale sellers","Meeting electricity demand by the generation of electricity from locally distributed energy sources has gained much success over the years. Among different frameworks for such renewable generation and consumption, peer-to-peer (P2P) markets have proved to be an efficient solution. As the pricing mechanism is an integral part of P2P markets, optimal price determination for electricity trading that ensures the profitability of the participants is the key to success in such markets. In addition to profitability, the pricing mechanism should be able to incorporate users' reserved prices and grid supply uncertainty to be implementable in developing countries. To achieve this objective and based on participants' preferences, an effective game-theoretic model is proposed to formulate the trading pairs among consumers and sellers. Then, keeping in view the participants' reserved prices for electricity trading, an effective and novel method based on the game-theoretic approach is proposed to determine the electricity price in the direct P2P electricity market. The proposed model is evaluated on a market having 22 participants. Among these, 11 participants act as electricity consumers, and the other 11 act as sellers. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective as it further reduces the electricity bills for consumers from 5% to 8% and increases the revenues of sellers from 13% to 15% as compared to other proposed mid-range auction and uniform pricing models.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

We aimed to determine red blood cell-derived microparticles (RMPs) and phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposing red blood cells (RBCs) and evaluate their use for diagnosing GH and NGH patients. Methods: All patients received a physical assessment and urological examination. Dysmorphic RBCs (dRBCs) and acanthocytes were examined using a light microscope. The urinary RMPs and PS-exposing RBCs were determined using flow cytometry. Results: The ratio of RMPs to RBCs was higher in GH patients (n = 29) than in NGH patients (n = 29) (1.06 vs. 0.18). The value of the sum of the PS-exposing RBCs plus RMPs divided by the number of RBCs was higher in GH patients than in NGH patients (48.3% vs. 19.4%). The percentage of RBCs was higher in GH patients than in NGH patients (54.5% vs. 21.8%). Similarly, both the percentages of acanthocytes and of non-acanthocytes were higher in GH patients than in NGH patients (29% vs. 7.7% and 25.4% vs. 14.2%, respectively). The ROC-AUC of the number of PS-exposing RBCs plus RMPs divided by the number of RBCs was 0.9 (95% CI, 0.82–0.97), and the RMPs:RBCs ratio was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79–0.98). The ROC-AUCs of the dRBCs and acanthocytes were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78–0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.8–0.97), respectively. Conclusions: Patients with GH have higher numbers of urinary RMPs and PS-exposing RBCs. These parameters have the potential to be predictive tools for classifying GH in the future.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology, Cell Biology"

This study aims to assess the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the heterologous adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as AZ) and the inactivated vaccine regimen (CoronaVac; hereafter referred to as CV) in healthy Thai adults immunized between June and September 2021. Our study showed that adverse events following homologous CV-CV and AZ-AZ, and heterologous CV-AZ and AZ-CV combinations, were mild and well tolerated overall. Receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody responses and neutralizing activities against wild-type and variants of concern after two-dose vaccination were higher in the heterologous CV-AZ and homologous AZ-AZ groups compared to the CV-CV and AZ-CV groups. Conversely, the spike-specific IgA response was detected only in the CV-AZ group after two doses of vaccination. The total interferon gamma response was detected in both the CV-AZ and AZ-CV groups after the two-dose vaccination. Given the shorter completion time of two doses, heterologous CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1-S can be considered as an alternative regimen to homologous efficacy-proven ChAdOx1-S in countries with circulating variants. Additional studies on the efficacy and durability of immune responses induced by heterologous vaccine regimens are warranted.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

Using polyvinyl alcohol-ionic hydrogels containing a wound healing agent to manage wounds in different environments,"Napavichayanun S., Yamdech R., Pienpinijtham P., Srichana T., Chencharoenwong S., Reddy N., Aramwit P.",2022-08-01,"Humans, Hydrogels, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Skin, Wound Healing, eosin, hydrogels, ionic, pH, polyvinyl alcohol, PVA, sericin, wound, wound care, wound dressing, wound healing, wound infection","Objective: To explore the effects of pH on properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-ionic hydrogels containing wound healing promoters. Method: PVA was combined with a natural wound healing promoter (silk sericin (SS)), and an anionic agent (eosin (ES)) or cationic agent (methylene blue (MB)), and made into hydrogels. Properties of the hydrogels and behaviour at different pHs were investigated. Results: The density and gel fraction of PVA/SS-ES hydrogel and PVA/SS-MB hydrogel were considerably lower compared with hydrogel without SS. The swelling ratio and degradation of the hydrogels increased with increasing SS concentration in all pH solutions. The influence of SS in interrupting long-chain PVA molecules was confirmed based on changes in Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The SS released from the gels was found to interact with the ionic agent and influenced the release profile of the ionic agent. Surprisingly, the anionic agent in PVA/SS-ES hydrogel showed 70% release in high pH solution whereas the cationic agent in PVA/SS-MB hydrogel showed 86% release in low pH solution. Moreover, the active agent could accumulate on the skin layer and had a positive effect on a specific wound area. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained in this study, it is suggested to use anionic hydrogels containing wound healing promoter for wounds at high pH and cationic hydrogels containing wound healing promoter for wounds with low pH. Ability to improve wound healing using a natural healing agent combined with ionic agents and controlling the pH of hydrogels will help in developing quick and low-cost treatment for wounds.

The model was trained with patients' clinical information and 25-component Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). The target is having NCS/NCSE, and the ground truth is the diagnosis following the Salzburg criteria. As a result, the final model presents a promising performance, with an 86.7%recall rate during internal validation and a 13.3 % false-negative rate. This performance suggests that our model could be a screening tool. It would reduce the prone of underdiagnosis, provided that its performance resulting from external validation is satisfied.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, computer science","Information Systems and Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems"

As enoxaparin is currently used to inhibit vascular thrombosis, this study aimed to investigate whether enoxaparin also reduced inflammation and NETs in COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 infection were classified into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe (n = 10 for all groups). Plasma was collected from patients and healthy donors (n = 10). Neutrophils isolated from healthy controls were incubated with COVID-19 or healthy plasma, and with or without enoxaparin pretreatment in vitro. Neutrophils and plasma isolated from patients treated with enoxaparin were also investigated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and NET products such as dsDNA, NE, MPO–DNA and Histone–DNA complexes in plasma and supernatants were measured using immunofluorescence staining and ELISA kits. The expression of inflammatory signaling genes by neutrophils (RELA, SYK, ERK and PKC) was measured using real-time qPCR. The levels of NET products were elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients, particularly in the severe group (p < 0.01). Moreover, plasma from the severe group enhanced NET formation (p < 0.01) from neutrophils in vitro. Enoxaparin pretreatment in vitro decreased plasma-induced NETs in a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the expression of inflammatory genes (p < 0.05). Patients treated with prophylactic enoxaparin showed lower inflammatory cytokine levels and expression of inflammatory genes (p < 0.05). Increased NETs were associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients with severe pneumonia, and could be used as biomarkers to assess disease severity. Enoxaparin pretreatment inhibited NETs and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and these effects mostly persisted in patients treated with prophylactic enoxaparin.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

According to several studies, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an essential role in lung cancer metastasis. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential pharmacological effect of cycloartocarpin on the suppression of metastasis-related behaviors and EMT. An MTT assay was used to examine cell viability. Cell migration was determined using a wound healing assay. Anchorage-independent cell growth was also performed. Western blot analysis was used to identify the key signaling proteins involved in the regulation of EMT and migration. The results found that non-toxic concentrations of cycloartocarpin (10–20 μM) effectively suppressed cell migration and attenuated anchorage-independent growth in H292, A549, and H460 cells. Interestingly, these effects were consistent with the findings of Western blot analysis, which revealed that the level of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), phosphorylated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (p-AKT), and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) were significantly reduced, resulting in the inhibition of the EMT process, as evidenced by decreased N-cadherin, vimentin, and slug expression. Taken together, the results suggest that cycloartocarpin inhibits EMT by suppressing the FAK/AKT signaling pathway, which is involved in Cdc42 attenuation. Our findings demonstrated that cycloartocarpin has antimetastatic potential for further research and development in lung cancer therapy.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This study analyses the extent and patterns of under-five child undernutrition using Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 73 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: First, we mapped the prevalence of undernutrition in the developing world. Second, using the LISA (a local indicator of spatial association) technique, we analyzed the geographical patterns in undernutrition to highlight the localized hotspots (regions with high undernutrition prevalence surrounded by similar other regions), cold spots (regions with low undernutrition prevalence surrounded by similar other regions), and outliers (regions with high undernutrition surrounded by low undernutrition and vice versa). Third, we used Moran’s I to find global patterns in child undernutrition. Results: We find that South Asia has the highest under-five child undernutrition rates. The intra-country nutritional inequalities are highest in Burundi (stunting), Kenya (wasting), and Madagascar (underweight). The local indicator of spatial association (LISA) analysis suggests that South Asia, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and Sub-Saharan Africa are undernutrition hotspots and Europe and Central Asia and Latin America, and the Caribbean are undernutrition cold spots (regions with low undernutrition surrounded by similar other regions). Getis Ord-Gi* estimates generally support LISA analysis. Moran’s I and Geary’s C gave similar results about the global patterns of undernutrition. Geographically weighted regressions suggest that several socioeconomic indicators significantly explain child undernutrition. Conclusions: We found a significant within and across country variation in stunting, wasting and underweight rates among the under-five children’s population. The geospatial analysis also suggested that stunting, wasting, and underweight patterns exhibit clear regional patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated interventions at the regional level.",medical,"Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The whole worm extract (WWE) of P. illiciens was fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration chromatography. The results showed that WWE fraction and F2 were highly antigenic as well as F1 and F3, which were moderately antigenic. For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the antigenic molecules of WWE and all three fractions were mostly at molecular weights (MW) ranging from 11 to 150 kDa. Four antigenic proteins of 11, 18, 27 and 75 kDa detected in WWE and F1-F3 were found to give a reaction with sera from P. illiciens infected cats, and these proteins were also identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For immunolocalization observation, it was revealed that the P. illiciens antigen was present in high concentration in the cytoplasm of vitelline cells in the vitelline glands, the shell of the eggs and the eggs within the uterus, but not in other organs, i.e., tegument, muscle, parenchymal cells, testes and oral and ventral suckers of adult fluke.

The synthetic route chosen allowed the obtention of multi-phase materials and high entropy oxide (HEO) conditions, to be used as electrocatalysts, and to evaluate the effect of the crystal structure on the catalytic performance. The catalysts were characterized using physical methods scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry. The polycrystalline structure obtained at 500 °C (HEO500) showed the highest selectivity (above 45%), while the more crystalline catalyst (HEO800) exhibited the highest conversion (30%) and kinetic constant (k = 9.4 × 10−3 s−1). The catalytic performance of the materials demonstrated a strong correlation with the microstructure and surface properties, like crystallite size, initial crystal phase, oxygen vacancies concentration, and redox properties. All the HEO materials exhibited a better catalytic performance than the commercial benchmark, Pt/C 5% wt catalyst, which showed no selectivity towards aniline and low conversion in 1.0 M KOH solution at -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl. This improvement was attributed to the increase in the surface concentration of hydrogen found on the HEOs. These results highlight the importance of the surface defects on the activity and selectivity of multi-step surface-dependent catalytic hydrogenation reactions; and provide fundamental information on the importance of carefully choosing the synthesis and calcination conditions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

Therefore, Inca peanut oil (IPO) may be potentially used as an animal fat substitute in meat products. In the present study, the effects of substitution of chicken fat with IPO (0.5–1.5 g/100 g of ground chicken) on the nutritional, physicochemical, textural, and sensory properties of the resulting sausage was investigated. The findings revealed that saturated fat content, omega-6/omega-3 ratio, and the atherogenic and thrombogenic index values declined, whereas omega-3 fatty acid content increased. In addition, the use of 0.5 g/100 g IPO improved the emulsion stability without affecting the cooking loss and texture properties of sausages. In sausages containing 0.5–1.5 g/100 g IPO, there were no significant alterations in the textural properties or the protein carbonyl and thiol content. However, an increase in TBARS value was observed in the sausage containing 1.5 g/100 g IPO during 21 days of refrigerated storage. Moreover, substituting of chicken fat with IPO (0.5 g/100 g) did not affect the sausage sensory acceptability. These findings demonstrate that IPO use can increase the omega-3 fatty acid while lowering saturated fat content, as well as improve the omega-6/omega-3 ratio in chicken sausages.","mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

The average crystallite sizes of samples increased with the increase of TR and all samples showed high crystallinity with an inverse spinel cubic structure. The grain size increased with the increase of TR. On the other hand, all samples have polycrystalline structure and the brightest intensity at Miller's index (3 1 1). From the results of the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis, it was found that there was an increase in magnetic properties such as Hc, Mr and Ms along with the increase reaction temperature. For example, the saturation magnetization increased with the increase of TR. Next, the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor was explored by using an exchange-biased GMR sensor with the Wheatstone bridge method to detect Fe3O4 with variations of reaction temperature in an alcohol solution of 50 μg/ml. A DC in-plane magnetic field was used for this measurement. It was found that the Vout curve is sensitive to the presence of Fe3O4 and the maximum Vout appears at 2.8 Oe by applying an external field to the sensor of ± 95 Oe. The Vout difference increased with the increase of reaction temperature, which can be attributed to higher saturation magnetization, causing more difficult fringing of the magnetic field. The relationship between TR and |ΔV| is ΔV = 0.0175x + 0.49, in which |ΔV| linearly increases with the increase of reaction temperature. This study demonstrates the feasibility of Fe3O4-based detection using a GMR sensor and Fe3O4 as magnetic labels will be useful for potential bio-detection applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

Separation can be accomplished within 20 min, followed by detection using a cobalt phthalocyanine-modified screen-printed graphene electrode. All steps can be performed on the same device. With the beneficial features of low cost, high sensitivity, and portability, the proposed device is suitable as an alternative tool for the on-site determination of Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in cannabis oil.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Thailand started universal hepatitis B vaccination at birth in 1992 and achieved over 95% coverage in 1999. We explored the prevalence of hepatitis B and C viral infections and the associated factors among PWH from same-day antiretroviral therapy (SDART) service at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic, Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: We collected baseline characteristics from PWH enrolled in the SDART service between July 2017 and November 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV). Results: A total of 4011 newly diagnosed PWH who had HBsAg or anti-HCV results at baseline: 2941 men who have sex with men (MSM; 73.3%), 851 heterosexuals (21.2%), 215 transgender women (TGW; 5.4%), and 4 transgender men (0.1%). Median age was 27 years. Overall seroprevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV were 6.0 and 4.1%, respectively. Subgroup prevalence were 6.2 and 4.7% among MSM, 4.6 and 2.4% among heterosexuals, and 9.3 and 3.7% among TGW, respectively. Factors associated with HBsAg positivity were being MSM, TGW, born before 1992, CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, and alanine aminotransferase ≥ 62.5 U/L. Factors associated with anti-HCV positivity were being MSM, age > 30 years, alanine aminotransferase ≥ 62.5 U/L, creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min, and syphilis infection. Conclusions: Around 5–10% of newly diagnosed PWH in Bangkok had hepatitis B viral infection after 25 years of universal vaccination. Anti-HCV positivity was found in 4–5% of PWH who were MSM and TGW. As World Health Organization and Thailand national guidelines already support routine screening of hepatitis B and C viral infections in PWH and populations at increased risk of HIV including MSM and TGW, healthcare providers should reinforce this strategy and provide linkage to appropriate prevention and treatment interventions. Catch-up hepatitis B vaccination should be made available under national health coverage.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

This study aimed to develop a proper kinetics investigation method for the pyrolysis reaction. Here, a quasi-single reaction of pyrolysis was assumed to simplify the reactions. The model comparison among three favorite model-free methods including Ozawa-Flynn-Wall, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Friedman methods, was considered. From TGA results of three biomasses, i.e., corn cob, Napier grass, and sugarcane top and leaves, they indicated that using parameters values via Friedman method in a conversion range of 0.1–0.6 could give conversion curves mostly in good agreement with experimental results when deriving them in a polynomial order of 2 (quadratic) regression model and using a reaction order of 3. Another purpose of the study was to investigate effect of mixing different biomasses on kinetics of pyrolysis reaction by plotting the parameters in a ternary diagram of tri-component biomass which was mixture of the herein biomasses. The diagram indicated that mixtures with more high-hemicellulose biomass (like corn cob) would show less activation energy in a temperature range of 220–315 °C. While mixtures with more high-cellulose biomass (like sugarcane top and leaves) would show less activation energy in a temperature range of 315–400 °C.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

To that end, intravacuolar H. pylori were induced by the co-incubation of C. albicans with H. pylori under several stresses (acidic pH, non-H. pylori-enrichment media, and aerobic environments); the results were detectable by direct microscopy (wet mount) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Indeed, intravacuolar H. pylori were predominant under all stresses, especially the lower pH level (pH 2–3). Interestingly, the H. pylori (an amoxicillin-sensitive strain) inside C. albicans were protected from the antibiotic (amoxicillin), while extracellular H. pylori were neutralizable, as indicated by the culture. In parallel, the oral administration of intravacuolar H. pylori in mice caused H. pylori colonization in the stomach resulting in gastritis, as indicated by gastric histopathology and tissue cytokines, similar to the administration of free H. pylori (extra-Candida bacteria). In conclusion, Candida protected H. pylori from stresses and antibiotics, and the intravacuolar H. pylori were able to be released from the yeast cells, causing gastric inflammation with neutrophil accumulations.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Major neurocognitive psychosis: a novel schizophrenia endophenotype class that is based on machine learning and resembles Kraepelin's and Bleuler's conceptions,Maes M.,2022-01-01,"Endophenotypes, Humans, Machine Learning, Psychotic Disorders, Schizophrenia, Tryptophan, inflammation, neuroimmune, oxidative stress, psychiatry, psychosis, schizophrenia","The purpose of this study is to describe how to use the precision nomothetic psychiatry approach to a) delineate the associations between schizophrenia symptom domains, including negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, formal thought disorders, psychomotor retardation (PHEMFP), and cognitive dysfunctions and neuroimmunotoxic and neuro-oxidative pathways; and b) create a new endophenotype class based on these features. We show that all symptom domains (negative and PHEMFP) may be used to derive a single latent trait called overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS). In addition, neurocognitive test results may be used to extract a general cognitive decline (G-CoDe) index, based on executive function, attention, semantic and episodic memory, and delayed recall scores. According to partial least squares analysis, the impacts of adverse outcome pathways on OSOS are partially mediated by increasing G-CoDe severity. The adverse outcome pathways include neurotoxic cytokines and chemokines, oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, IgA responses to neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites, breakdown of the vascular and paracellular pathways with translocation of Gram-negative bacteria, and insufficient protection through lowered antioxidant levels and impairments in the innate immune system. Unsupervised machine learning identified a new schizophrenia endophenotype class, named major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP), which is characterized by increased negative symptoms and PHEMFP, G-CoDe and the above-mentioned adverse outcome pathways. Based on these pathways and phenome features, MNP is a distinct endophenotype class which is qualitatively different from simple psychosis (SP). It is impossible to draw any valid conclusions from research on schizophrenia that ignores the MNP and SP distinctions.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Objective: To determine immunologic response and reactogenicity of ID ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222,Oxford/AstraZeneca) as a booster dose after completion of 2-dose CoronaVac(SV) in healthy adult. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of adult aged 18–59 years who received 2-dose SV at 14–35 days apart for more than 2 months. Participants received ID AZD1222 at fractional low dose(1×1010 viral particles,0.1 ml). Antibody responses were evaluated by surrogate virus neutralization test(sVNT) against delta variant and wild type, and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain immunoglobulin G(anti-S-RBD IgG) at prior, day14, 28, 90, and 180 post booster. Solicited reactogenicity was collected for 7 days post-booster. Primary endpoint was the differences of sVNT against delta strain ≥ 80% inhibition at day14 and 90 compared with the parallel cohort study of 0.5-ml intramuscular(IM) route. Results: From August2021, 100 adults with median age of 46 years(IQR 41–52) participated. Prior to booster, geometric mean(GM) of sVNT against delta strain was 22.4% inhibition(95 %CI 18.7–26.9) and of anti-S-RBD IgG was 109.3 BAU/ml(95.4–125.1). Post ID booster, GMs of sVNT against delta strain were 95.5% inhibition (95%CI 94.2–96.8) at day14, 73.1% inhibition (66.7–80.2) at day90, and 22.7% inhibition (14.9–34.6) at day180. The differences of proportion of participants achieving sVNT against delta strain ≥ 80% inhibition in ID recipients versus IM were + 4.2% (95 %CI -2.0to10.5) at day14, and −37.3%(-54.2to-20.3) at day90. Anti-S-RBD IgG GMs were 2037.1 BAU/ml (95%CI 1770.9–2343.2) at day14 and 744.6 BAU/ml(650.1–852.9) at day90, respectively. Geometric mean ratios(GMRs) of anti-S-RBD IgG were 0.99(0.83–1.20) at day14, and 0.82(0.66–1.02) at day90. Only 18% reported feverish, compared with 37% of IM (p = 0.003). Common reactogenicity was erythema at injection site(53%) while 7% reported blister. Conclusion: Low-dose ID AZD1222 booster enhanced lower neutralizing antibodies at 3 months compared with IM route.

While our understandings of the aetiologies of AD have greatly expanded over the decades, there is no drug available to stop disease progression. Here, we demonstrate the potential of Passiflora edulis (P. edulis) pericarp extract in protecting against Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) models of AD. We show P. edulis pericarp protects against memory deficit and neuronal loss, and promotes longevity in the Aβ model of AD via stimulation of mitophagy, a selective cellular clearance of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. P. edulis pericarp also restores memory and increases neuronal resilience in a C. elegans Tau model of AD. While defective mitophagy-induced accumulation of damaged mitochondria contributes to AD progression, P. edulis pericarp improves mitochondrial quality and homeostasis through BNIP3/DCT1-dependent mitophagy and SOD-3-dependent mitochondrial resilience, both via increased nuclear translocation of the upstream transcriptional regulator FOXO3/DAF-16.

Methods: In this study, 120 specimens of 3Y-TZP, 5Y-PSZ, and Ti6Al4V were cemented to nanocomposite resin cylinders using PANAVIA™ V5 and Rely X™ U200. The bond area and resin cement thickness were controlled as per ISO 29022:2013 and 4049:2009. Each resin cement group was used with/without the Clearfil ceramic primer plus. The shear bond strength of the 12 groups was statistically analyzed using two and one-way ANOVA to determine the properties of the different materials and resin cements (α = 0.05). The mode of failure was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results: The titanium alloy groups showed better shear bond strength than the zirconia groups (p < 0.05). PANAVIA™ V5 without primer showed significantly lower shear bond strength than other cements in zirconia and titanium alloy specimens (p < 0.05). Titanium alloy with Rely X™ U200 with a Clearfil ceramic primer plus showed the highest shear bond strength (6.37 ± 1.60 MPa). SEM images showed mixed failures in zirconia groups and cohesive failures in titanium alloy groups. Conclusion: The titanium alloy showed better shear bond strength than zirconia when the Clearfil ceramic primer plus was used.

The nanocrystalline carbon was obtained as the major products from CO2 (≥96% selectivity, ∼1 μm thickness) without any liquid products. Upon applying the negative potential, nanoclustering of the self-limiting ultrathin metal oxide layers of metal particles on the highly conductive substrate could lead to formation of negatively charged metal clusters, which were well stabilized by the ternary electrolyte system containing [BMIm]+[BF4]-/propylene carbonate/water.

After implementing a two-stage objective detection algorithm (YOLO v4-tiny) and classification model (DenseNet-201), the ambiguous images (n = 48) were interpreted with 100% accuracy. The PAD integrated with customized-region convolutional neural networks can reduce the interpretation discrepancies in RBC antigen phenotyping in any laboratory.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"

One hundred and thirty five resin composite specimens were fabricated and thermocycled to replicate an aged resin composite. These aged resin composites were randomly separated into nine groups (n = 15) depending on the various surface contaminants and surface treatment techniques. These groups were as follows: group 1—no surface treatment; group 2—no saliva + adhesive agent; group 3—no saliva + morpholine + adhesive agent; group 4—no saliva + morpholine; group 5—saliva; group 6—saliva + adhesive agent; group 7—saliva + morpholine + adhesive agent; group 8—saliva + morpholine; and group 9—saliva + phosphoric acid + adhesive agent. A mold was covered on the top of the specimen center and then filled with resin composite. The shear bond strengths and failure modes were examined. The collected data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and the significance level was determined using Tukey’s test. Group 5 (3.31 ± 0.95 MPa) and group 6 (4.05 ± 0.93 MPa) showed the lowest bond strength statistically, while group 3 (23.66 ± 1.35 MPa) and group 7 (22.88 ± 1.96 MPa) showed the most significantly high bond strength. The bond strength in group 2 (16.41 ± 1.22 MPa) was significantly different from that in group 1 (9.83 ± 1.13 MPa), group 4 (10.71 ± 0.81 MPa), and group 8 (10.36 ± 1.53 MPa), while group 9’s (17.31 ± 1.48 MPa) SBS was not significantly different. In conclusion, the application of morpholine on aged resin composite with or without contamination with saliva prior to the application of the adhesive agent increased the bond strength of aged resin composite repaired with new resin composite (p < 0.05).","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Typically, the preparation of Grignard reagents and their subsequent reactions require anhydrous solvents and a protective inert atmosphere. A recent report showed that the reactions could be performed under mechanochemical conditions by ball-milling magnesium metal, an organic halide, and a small amount of an ethereal solvent together followed by the addition of an electrophile. Excellent results were reported for a broad range of substrates even when the reaction was performed under the ambient atmosphere, making the process highly appealing to a wide synthetic community. In this commentary, some safety aspects of this mechanochemical Grignard reaction are pointed out so that appropriate risk management plans can be devised to ensure its safe use.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, medical, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Chemical Health and Safety"
Survey of knowledge and attitude regarding induced abortion among nurses in a tertiary hospital in Thailand after amendment of the abortion act: a cross-sectional study,"Sinthuchai N., Rothmanee P., Meevasana V., Rongkapich R., Poolkumlung R., Saro S., Santibenchakul S., Jaisamrarn U.",2022-12-01,"Abortion, Induced, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Pregnancy, Surveys and Questionnaires, Tertiary Care Centers, Thailand, Attitude, Induced abortion, Knowledge, Muslim, Nurses, Thai abortion law, Unwanted pregnancy","Background: The abortion act in Thailand is approximately 60 years old. However, because of increasing problems due to unsafe abortions, the act was recently amended to accord a legal status for abortions. In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, most people follow the Islamic faith, according to which induced abortion is a sin for both the providers and the pregnant women. This may affect the attitude of the medical staff, such as registered nurses, who play an important role in abortion services. Our study aims to evaluate the knowledge of the amended abortion act, attitude toward abortions and the intentions behind them, and willingness to perform abortions among registered nurses. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2022 to February 2022 wherein a self-administrated questionnaire was electronically distributed to 450 registered nurses practicing at a tertiary hospital in the southernmost province of Thailand. Linear regression analysis and Fisher’s exact test were conducted to evaluate the association between basic characteristics, knowledge scores, and attitudes toward induced abortion. Results: A total of 375 nurses (83.3%) completed the survey. Most participants were Muslim (58.9%), and 18.7% of them correctly answered > 80% of the knowledge questions. Among all the participants, 41.4% had a favorable attitude toward induced abortion, of which 21.3% were willing to provide safe abortion services. Knowledge scores were independently associated with practicing in obstetrics-gynecology departments and a lower age. Participants practicing Buddhism and having good knowledge scores tended to have favorable attitudes toward abortion. Conclusions: Nurses in the southernmost province of Thailand lack knowledge regarding the amended abortion act and do not have a favorable moral attitude toward abortion. Favorable attitudes toward abortions, support toward intentions behind abortions, and a willingness to provide abortion services were all lesser among the Muslim participants than among the Buddhist participants. Compared with participants who scored lower, those with higher knowledge scores had a better moral attitude toward abortion and, in turn, demonstrated a greater intention to provide abortion services. Encouraging nurses to gain better knowledge may improve their attitude toward abortion, which may positively influence future medical practices.",medical,"Reproductive Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

Though they have served as an excellent protection source in minimizing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading, they have still emerged as major environmental pollutants nowadays. These non-degradable COVID-19 plastic wastes (CPW) were treated through incineration and landfilling process, which may lead to either the release of harmful gases or contaminating the surrounding environment. Further, they can cause numerous health hazards to the human and animal populations. These plastic wastes can be efficiently managed through thermochemical processes like pyrolysis or gasification, which assist in degrading the plastic waste and also effectively convert them into useful energy-yielding products. The pyrolysis process promotes the formation of liquid fuels and chemicals, whereas gasification leads to syngas and hydrogen fuel production. These energy-yielding products can help to compensate for the fossil fuels depletion in the near future. There are many insights explained in terms of the types of reactors and influential factors that can be adopted for the pyrolysis and gasification process, to produce high efficient energy products from the wastes. In addition, advanced technologies including co-gasification and two-stage gasification were also reviewed.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Grain size characteristics of terrigenous clastics in surface sediments of the Gulf of Thailand and their significance for sedimentary dynamic environment 泰国湾表层沉积物陆源碎屑的粒度特征及其展现的沉积动力环境,"Feng S., Liu Z., Sompongchaiyakul P., Lin B., Wiesner M.G.",2022-07-01,"Distribution characteristics, Dynamic environments, Fine sand, Grain size characteristics, Grain size distribution, Grainsize, Gulf of Thailand, Mekong River, Sedimentary dynamic environment, Surface sediments, grain size, Gulf of Thailand, sedimentary dynamic environment, surface sediments","The grain size characteristics of marine clastic sediments can directly reflect the marine sedimentary dynamic environment, thus can be used to study the variation of marine dynamic environment. In particular, the grain size distribution of surface sediments on the continental shelf plays an important role in studying the modern marine dynamic environment of coastal and water column bottom boundary layer. This research investigated the grain size distribution characteristics of terrigenous elastics in surface sediments collected from the Gulf of Thailand and the Mekong River estuary, to obtain the marine dynamic environmental processes affecting the particle sedimentation in specific sea areas. The results of grain size analysis show that the terrigenous elastics in surface sediments in the Gulf of Thailand are composed mainly of poorly sorted fine sand to fine silt, characterized mostly by positive skewness in frequency distribution patterns. The fine to very fine sand components are mainly distributed at the bay of Bangkok and shelves off Cambodia. The sediments off the Mekong River are fine sand and the sorting is better than that in the Gulf of Thailand. These grain size characteristics of surface sediments can serve as good proxies to explicitly indicate the environmental variations in this area. The well sorted medium sand with nearly normal distribution patterns in sediments off the Mekong River indicate the depositional environment under the influence of the waves. The poorly sorted medium sand to fine sand sediments in the bay of Bangkok and off Cambodia reflect the combined effect of tides and waves. The very fine sand to medium silt sediments with medium sorting and positive skewness in the east and west coast of the Gulf of Thailand reflect the controlling effect of tides. And the sediments in the central Gulf of Thailand with poorly sorting indicate the influence of surface currents. This study shows that the grain size distribution characteristics of terrigenous elastics in surface sediments of the Gulf of Thailand and off the Mekong River can be used to distinguish the control effects of different marine dynamic factors, and to reveal that the sedimentary dynamic environment in the Gulf of Thailand is mainly affected by tides, waves and currents and the sedimentary dynamic environment off the Mekong River is affected by waves.",earth sciences,Geology

The CO2 adsorption test was performed at 25°C and atmospheric pressure using 15/85 vol% of CO2/N2 at a 20-mL/minute flow rate. Desorption was carried out at 100°C under 20 mL/minute of N2 flow. The results show that the capacity and rate of CO2 adsorption obtained from all the amine-modified adsorbents were significantly increased with increasing amine loading due to carbamate formation. Desorption efficiency and heat duty for regeneration were also affected by the amount of amine loading. The more stable the carbamate produced, the higher the energy was required. They exhibited the highest adsorption-desorption performance at 60 wt% amines used for impregnation. Blended EAE/TEPA at different weight ratios at a total concentration at 60 wt% amines was impregnated on MCM-41 adsorbent. Sorbent impregnated with 50%/10% of EAE/TEPA showed the best performance of 4.25 mmolCO2/g at a high adsorption rate, a low heat duty of 12 kJ/mmolCO2 and with 9.4% reduction of regeneration efficiency after five repeated adsorption-desorption cycles.","environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

The average exposure concentration of total PCBs in the particle (PM2.5–10 and PM2.5) and gas phases were 53.51 ± 23.68, 65.41 ± 23.06, and 82.72 ± 78.61 ng/m3, respectively, and were all significantly (p < 0.05) higher for workers exposed during burning wires than those of the dismantling bulky-, small-, and internal e-waste parts. The dominant PCB congeners mainly found during e-waste dismantling were the low-chlorinated group, including PCB-28, -52, −77, −81, −105, −118, and −126. PCB-28 and -77 were observed as predominant co-congeners derived from mechanical dismantling, whereas PCB-52, -118, and −126 were the main species emitted from burning activities. The workers exposed to PCBs from burning wires were estimated to have the highest lifetime cancer risk of 1.64E-05, about 2.5- to 3.3-fold higher than those who dismantled bulky-, small- and internal e-waste parts. Consequently, workers should be recommended to wear high-efficiency respiratory protection masks to avoid direct exposure to PCBs and to reduce their possible carcinogenic risk.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Atmospheric Science"
Dietary anthocyanins inhibit insulin fibril formation and cytotoxicity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes,"Channuwong P., Salae K., Chongruchiroj S., Cheng H., Suantawee T., Thilavech T., Adisakwattana S.",2022-12-31,"3T3-L1 Cells, Animals, Anthocyanins, Glycosides, Insulin, Mice, Protein Structure, Secondary, Anthocyanins, Cyanidin, Cytotoxicity, Insulin fibrils, Malvidin","Insulin fibril formation decreases the effectiveness of insulin therapy and causes amyloidosis in diabetes. Studies suggest that phytochemicals are capable of inhibiting fibril formation. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effects of anthocyanins, including cyanidin, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R), malvidin, and malvidin-3-glucoside (M3G) on fibril formation. Our results revealed that anthocyanins (50–200 μM) significantly reduced the formation of insulin fibrils by increasing lag times and decreasing ThT fluorescence at the plateau phase. These findings were confirmed by TEM images, which showed reduced fibril length and number. Furthermore, FTIR analysis indicated that anthocyanins reduced the secondary structure transition of insulin from α-helix to β-sheet. Anthocyanins interacted with monomeric insulin (residues B8–B30) via H-bonds, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions, covering the fibril-prone segments of insulin (residues B12–B17). Based on the structure-activity analysis, the presence of glycosides and hydroxyl groups on phenyl rings increased intermolecular interaction, mediating the inhibitory effect of anthocyanins on fibril formation in the order of malvidin < cyanidin < M3G < C3G < C3R. Moreover, anthocyanins formed H-bonds with preformed insulin fibrils, except for malvidin. In preadipocytes, C3R, C3G, and cyanidin attenuated insulin fibril-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, anthocyanins are effective inhibitors of insulin fibril formation and cytotoxicity.",biochemistryistry,"Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

Using this approach, the solvent removal step and glycerol byproducts are eliminated. The highest fatty acid ethyl ester contents of 91.80 wt% ± 1.62 wt% and 86.44 wt% ± 2.12 wt%. were obtained under optimal conditions in batch and continuous reactors, respectively.

However, studies describing the impact of long-term ART and CD4 count recovery on TB incidence remain scarce due to limited follow up in previous studies. We evaluated TB incidence in a long-term cohort of PLWH on ART in Thailand. Methods: We conducted an analysis of PLWH aged ≥ 18 years who started ART between 1996 and December 2020. Participants were followed up every 6 months for routine HIV care. TB risk factors, body mass index (BMI), physical examination and full differential blood counts were evaluated at each clinic visit, and CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA every 12 months. Participants diagnosed with TB > 3 months after starting ART were classified as incident cases. Time to event models with death as a competing risk, were used to derive the TB cumulative incidence function (CIF) after ART initiation, and assess time-updated factors associated with incident TB using a six month lag. Results: A total of 2,636 PLWH contributing 24,229 person years (PY) of follow-up on ART were analysed. Median age was 32.0 (IQR 27.4–37.6) years; 67.5% were male. Median CD4 cell count at ART initiation was 264 (IQR 167–379) cells/mm3 and median follow-up duration was 7.6 (IQR 1.9–15.7) years. During follow-up, 113 PLWH developed TB. The probability of incident TB was 0.7%, 1.7%, 3.3% and 4.3%, at 1, 2, 5 and 7 years after ART initiation, respectively. TB CIF was highest among participants with CD4 < 50 cells/mm3. The overall crude incidence of TB was 4.66 (95% CI 3.87–5.60) per 1000 PY. Low CD4 count, BMI < 18 kg/m2, and substance use in the previous six months were significantly associated with incident TB. Incidence declined with time on suppressive ART, but remained higher than the Thai general population 7 years after ART initiation (2.2 vs 1.5/1000 PY, respectively). Conclusion: Despite a marked reduction in TB incidence following ART, ongoing TB risk remains high among PLWH, despite long-term suppressive ART. Those with low CD4 cell counts, who are underweight, or currently having substance abuse should be carefully monitored.",medical,Infectious Diseases

The lipid core can carry lipophilic compounds based on the function of the nanoemulsion. Therefore, a dual purpose nanoemulsion of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) exhibiting self-calcifying and carrier abilities can be developed. Methods: We employed an emulsification process to formulate LNPs with a specific charged surface. The LNPs were tested for their ability to calcify in simulated body fluid and encapsulate cholecalciferol (a model of active compound). The self-calcifying LNP was successfully fabricated using the emulsification process and stabilized using a mixture of polysorbate 80 and polysorbate 20. Results: The LNPs incubated in simulated body fluid bound to calcium and phosphate, subsequently forming CaP on the particle surface and resulting in approximately 180-nm CaP spheres with a lipid core.

Association between nocturnal hypoxemic burden and glucose metabolism,"Thanaviratananich S., Cheng H., Chirakalwasan N., Reutrakul S.",2022-09-01,"Adult, Blood Glucose, Glycated Hemoglobin A, Humans, Hypoxia, Oxygen, Polysomnography, Sleep, Apnea–hypopnea index, Glucose, Oxygen, Sleep apnea, Sleep-disordered breathing","Purpose: To evaluate the association between a novel integrated event-based and hypoxemia-based parameter of polysomnography (PSG), hypoxemic load or HL100, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Methods: Adult patients, who underwent an in-lab PSG at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with FBG or HbA1c levels, were included. Event-based parameter and hypoxemia-based parameter data were derived. HL100, defined as the integrated area of desaturation between the 100% oxygen saturation and the measured saturation levels during sleep divided by the total sleep time, was calculated by Python software. Demographic data and glycemic parameters within 1 year prior to PSG (FBG and HbA1c) were retrieved from chart review. Spearman correlation analysis and stepwise backward regression analysis were performed to determine independent predictors of FBG and HbA1c levels. Results: Of the 467 patients who underwent an in-lab PSG, 218 had FBG levels, 84 had HbA1c levels, and 118 had both values. All event-based and hypoxemia-based parameters, including HL100, were significantly correlated to FBG and HbA1c levels. Stepwise backward regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and diabetes status, revealed that log HL100 was significantly related to FBG (B = 23.9, p = 0.010), but none of log event-based or hypoxemia-based parameters were found to be significantly related HbA1c levels. Conclusions: HL100 was shown to be an independent predictor of FBG in this cohort, implying that any degree of desaturation below 100% could adversely affect glucose metabolism. HL100 may be useful for interpretation of sleep studies, risk stratification, and patient management purposes in the future.",medical,"Otorhinolaryngology, Neurology (clinical)"

In recent decades, many electrochemical biosensors have been created for pathogen detection. These biosensors for detecting infections have been comprehensively studied in terms of transduction elements, biorecognition components, and electrochemical methods. This review discusses the biorecognition components that may be used to identify pathogens. These include antibodies and aptamers. The integration of transducers and electrode changes in biosensor design is a major discussion topic. Pathogen detection methods can be categorized by sample preparation and secondary binding processes. Diagnostics in medicine, environmental monitoring, and biothreat detection can benefit from electrochemical biosensors to ensure food and water safety. Disposable and reusable biosensors for process monitoring, as well as multiplexed and conformal pathogen detection, are all included in this review. It is now possible to identify a wide range of diseases using biosensors that may be applied to food, bodily fluids, and even objects’ surfaces. The sensitivity of optical techniques may be superior to electrochemical approaches, but optical methods are prohibitively expensive and challenging for most end users to utilize. On the other hand, electrochemical approaches are simpler to use, but their efficacy in identifying infections is still far from satisfactory.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, engineering, physics","Analytical Chemistry, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Instrumentation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Clinical Biochemistry"

However, such technology tends to promisingly be implemented only in countries with developed economies, leaving behind countries with emerging economies. To increase the utilization of RAC in these emerging economy countries, this research program aims to investigate the applicability of using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique to predict onsite construction activities of RAC. The construction activities are modeled for the 909 dataset, which includes costs, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time. The results indicate that the mean absolute percentage error values of the RAC cost, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time (including recycled aggregate production and RAC production processes) are 1.98, 28.21, and 2.96, respectively. The mean squared error values of RAC cost, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time are 56,979, 20.9, and 0.56, respectively. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (R2) of RAC cost, concrete volume, and construction time of concrete were calculated at 0.999, 0.976, and 0.968, respectively. Both statistical values indicate that the ANN modeling technique is well implemented for constructing RAC. The results also indicate that ANN modeling can be effectively used in time series for predicting the construction activities of making RAC products. The outcomes offer benefits to stakeholders in construction activities, including improved cost estimations, reduced waste from less concrete going unused, and more accurate project scheduling. ANN modeling represents a relatively simple prediction and can be adopted in preconstruction stages, such as project planning and investment decision making, leading to sustainable construction.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Business","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Industrial Relations, Strategy and Management"
Effects of estrogen receptor β or G protein-coupled receptor 30 activation on anxiety-like behaviors in relation to GABAergic transmission in stress-ovariectomized rats,"Tongta S., Daendee S., Kalandakanond-Thongsong S.",2022-10-15,"Animals, Anti-Anxiety Agents, Anxiety, Estradiol, Estrogen Receptor alpha, Estrogen Receptor beta, Estrogens, Female, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Humans, NAD, Neurosteroids, Ovariectomy, Rats, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled, RNA, Messenger, Anxiety-like behavior, Chronic mild stress, Estrogen receptor β, G protein-coupled receptor 30, GABAergic system, Neurosteroid","For mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, stress and stressful events are considered as precipitating causes that may be enhanced by estrogen variability. This condition is proven by the higher vulnerability of women than men. Despite the complexity of underlying mechanisms, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system piques interest as its receptor contains multiple psychoactive modulatory sites including neurosteroids. Moreover, according to clinical and experimental reports, GABA-associated genes can be altered by stress and hormonal status. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) or G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) activation on anxiety/depression-like behaviors and the alterations in the GABA-associated gene of ovariectomized rats under chronic mild stress (CMS). Mild stressors were focused on because they represent a realistic simulation of daily life stress. In this study, ovariectomized rats were treated with vehicle, estradiol (E2), diarylpropionitrile (DPN; ERβ agonist) or G1 (GPR30 agonist) and exposed to 4-week CMS. The results showed that E2, DPN, and G1 treatments reduced anxiety-like behaviors without affecting depression-like behaviors. Concurrently, the GABA level and most GABA- and neurosteroid-associated mRNAs were altered by E2. Similar mRNA profiles were observed in DPN- and E2-administrations but not in G1 treatment. Collectively, these data suggest that estrogen exerts an anxiolytic-like action through either ERβ and/or GPR30 activation, and the modulatory effects of estrogen on GABAergic system are likely to be modulated through ERβ. The findings of this study therefore further provide insights into the roles of estrogen and daily mild stressors in GABA-related activity and behavioral responses, especially anxiety.",neuroscience,Neuroscience (all)

Estimating affinities of small molecules against targets of interest typically proceeds as a preliminary action for recent drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry. In this investigation, we employed machine learning models to provide a computationally affordable means for computer-aided screening to accelerate the discovery of potential drug compounds. In particular, we introduced a quantitative structure–activity-relationship (QSAR)-based multitask learning model to facilitate an in silico screening system of multitargeted drug development. Our method combines a recently developed graph-based neural network architecture, principal neighborhood aggregation (PNA), with a descriptor-based deep neural network supporting synergistic utilization of molecular graph and fingerprint features. The model was generated by more than ten-thousands affinity-reported ligands of seven crucial receptor tyrosine kinases in NSCLC from two public data sources. As a result, our multitask model demonstrated better performance than all other benchmark models, as well as achieving satisfying predictive ability regarding applicable QSAR criteria for most tasks within the model’s applicability. Since our model could potentially be a screening tool for practical use, we have provided a model implementation platform with a tutorial that is freely accessible hence, advising the first move in a long journey of cancer drug development.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Sensitive detection of trace level Cd (II) triggered by chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) “turn on”: Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as fluorometric paper-based sensor,"Naksen P., Boonruang S., Yuenyong N., Lee H.L., Ramachandran P., Anutrasakda W., Amatatongchai M., Pencharee S., Jarujamrus P.",2022-05-15,"Cadmium ion (cadmium ion), Cadmium ions, Chelation enhanced fluorescence, Enhanced fluorescence, Fluorescent sensors, Herbal medicines, Nitrogen doped graphene, Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot, Paper-based sensor, Cadmium, Fluorometry, Graphite, Humans, Nitrogen, Quantum Dots, Cadmium ion (Cd (II)), Chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF), Fluorescent sensor, Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs), Paper-based sensor","Cadmium ion (Cd (II)) is a highly toxic heavy metal usually found in natural water. Exposure to Cd (II) can produce serious effects in human organs such as Itai-Itai disease. Therefore, the maximum allowance levels of Cd (II) in drinking water and herbal medicines imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) are 3 μg L−1 and 300 μg kg−1, respectively. In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as a fluorescent sensor for Cd (II) determination was developed in both solution-based and paper-based systems. N-GQDs were synthesized from citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) via the hydrothermal method. The synthesized N-GQDs emitted intense blue fluorescence with a quantum yield (QY) of up to 80%. The functional groups on the surface of N-GQDs measured by FTIR were carboxyl (COO−), hydroxyl (OH−), and amine (NH2) groups, suggesting that they could be bound to Cd (II) for complexation. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs was gradually enhanced with the increase of Cd (II) concentration. This phenomenon was proved to result from the fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) based on the chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) mechanism. Under the optimum conditions in the solution-based and paper-based systems, the limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 1.09 and 0.59 μg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, the developed sensors showed relatively high selectivity toward Cd (II) over ten other metal cations and six other anions of different charges. The performance of the sensor in real water and herbal medicine samples exhibited no significant difference as compared to the results of the validation method (ICP-OES). Therefore, the developed sensors can be used as fluorescent sensors for Cd (II) determination with high sensitivity, high selectivity, short incubation time (5 min). As such, the paper-based strategy has excellent promising potential for practical analysis of Cd (II) in water and herbal medicine samples with a trace level of Cd (II) concentrations.","water engineeringneering, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Methods: A total of 1,161 abutment teeth in 260 patients treated with at least one single crown or fixed partial denture were recalled for clinical examination. Survival was defined as not having undergone extraction of abutments or renewal of prostheses. Secondary caries, pulp necrosis, or prosthesis detachment were recorded as complications. Survival and complications rates were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. Multivariable analysis of factors associated with failure or complications using Cox’s proportional hazard regression model was performed (α = 0.05). Results: Significant differences were observed in survival (p = 0.007), secondary caries (p = 0.000), and prosthesis detachment (p = 0.025) complications between luting agents. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates for 4-META/MMA-TBB resin were 95.2%, 90.5%, and 90.5%, while those of acid-base cements were 93.2%, 80.6, and 67.4%, respectively. Secondary caries and prosthesis detachment complications for 4-META/MMA-TBB resin were 1.9% and 0.5%, whereas those for acid-base cements were 15.2% and 4.3% respectively. Acid-base cements were associated with a 1.664-, 2.950-, 3.333-, and 4.444-times greater risk of failure, prosthesis renewal, secondary caries, and prosthesis detachment, respectively. Conclusion: 4-META/MMA-TBB resin has higher long-term survival rate with lesser caries, and prosthesis detachment than acid-base cements.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a One Health issue concerning humans, animals and the environment and a unified One Health approach is required to contain this problematic issue. Dogs and cats are popular pet animals and are known to carry many bacterial pathogens that are of public health importance, including Salmonella. However, data on AMR in companion animals is limited. Gap statement. Scant AMR data from bacteria originating from companion animals limits an accurate assessment of the impacts of pet-animal-related AMR on public health. Purpose. This study aimed to phenotypically and genetically investigate AMR in Salmonella isolated from pet dogs and cats in Thailand. Methodology. Salmonella enterica were isolated from pet dogs (n=159) and cats (n=19) in Thailand between 2016 and 2019. All isolates were serotyped. Phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance was examined. PCR-based replicon typing, replicon sequence typing and plasmid multilocus sequence typing were conducted to characterize plasmids. Results. Seventy-seven serovars were identified, with serovars Weltevreden (9.6%) and Stockholm (9.0%) the most common. Most of the isolates (34.3%) were multidrug-resistant. The serovar Stockholm was an ESBL-producer and carried the β-lactamase genes blaTEM-1and blaCTX-M-55.The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene, qnrS, was also detected (10.1%). Class 1 integrons carrying the dfrA12-aadA2 cassette array were most frequent (45.9%). Five plasmid replicon types as IncA/C (0.6%), N (1.1%), IncFIIA (28.7%), IncHI1 (2.2%), and IncI1 (3.4%) were identified. Based on the pMLST typing scheme (n=9), plasmids were assigned into five different STs including IncA/C-ST6 (n=1), IncH1-ST16 (n=4), IncI1-ST3 (n=1), IncI1-ST60 (n=1) and IncI1-ST136 (n=1). The ST 16 of IncHI1 plasmid was a novel plasmid ST. Subtyping F-type plasmids using the RST scheme (n=9) revealed four different combinations of replicons including S1:A-:B- (n=4), S1:A-:B22 (n=2), S3:A-:B- (n=1) and S-:A-:B47 (n=1). Conclusions. Our findings highlight the role of clinically healthy household dogs and cats as carriers of AMR Salmonella strains with different R plasmid. The implementation of AMR phenotypes instigation and genotypic monitoring and surveillance programmes in companion animals are imperative as integral components of the One Health framework.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Microbiology (medical)"

There are number of reasons which led to this negligence; hence, need of intelligent transportation system (ITS) gains more attention from researchers worldwide. For achieving such autonomy different sensors are involved in autonomous vehicles which can sense road conditions and warn the control system about possible hazards. This work is focused on designing one such sensor system which can detect and range multiple targets under the impact of adverse atmospheric conditions. A high-speed Linear Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (LFMCW) based Photonic Radar is proposed to detect multiple targets by integrating Mode division multiplexing (MDM). Reported results in terms of range frequency, Doppler frequency and range resolution are demonstrated using numerical simulations with the bandwidths of 1 and 4 GHz and under adverse atmospheric conditions carrying 75 dB/km of attenuation. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed photonic radar, moving targets are also demonstrated with different speed. System reported substantial range resolution of 15 cm using 1 GHz of bandwidth and 3 cm using 4 GHz of bandwidth.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, Mathematics, engineering, computer science","Biomaterials, Modeling and Simulation, Mechanics of Materials, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

We propose Deep Residual Spatiotemporal Translation Network (DR-STN), a novel unsupervised Deep Residual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DR-cGAN) model with an Online Hard Negative Mining (OHNM) approach. The proposed DR-cGAN provides a wider network to learn a mapping from spatial to temporal representations and enhance the perceptual quality of synthesized images from a generator. During DR-cGAN training, we take only the frames of normal events to produce their corresponding dense optical flow. At testing time, we compute the reconstruction error in local pixels between the synthesized and the real dense optical flow and then apply OHNM to remove false-positive detection results. Finally, a semantic region merging is introduced to integrate the intensities of all the individual abnormal objects into a full output frame. The proposed DR-STN has been extensively evaluated on publicly available benchmarks, including UCSD, UMN, and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating superior results over other state-of-the-art methods both in frame-level and pixel-level evaluations. The average Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of the frame-level evaluation for the three benchmarks is 96.73%. The improvement ratio of AUC in the frame level between DR-STN and state-of-the-art methods is 7.6%.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence"

We sought to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of ARBs in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through June 2020. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, and each study’s quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. The primary outcome was left ventricular mass reduction, and the secondary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Data were pooled using the random effects model. Results: A total of 1294 articles were screened. Five RCTs were included in the final analysis, enrolling 209 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (101 patients were in the ARB arm). ARB treatment was not associated with either significant left ventricular mass reduction (standardized mean difference: − 0.25; 95% CI: − 0.73, 0.22; p = 0.29) or change in LVEF (weighted mean difference: 0.73%; 95% CI: − 1.10%, 2.56%; p = 0.43). Subgroup analysis showed that losartan, one of the most investigated and commonly used ARBs, was also not associated with significant decreases of left ventricular mass (standardized mean difference: − 0.13; 95% CI: − 0.61, 0.36; p = 0.61). Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that ARB treatment is not associated with reduced left ventricular mass nor remarkable LVEF change among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further studies with a larger number of patients will be required to confirm these findings.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Pharmacology (medical)"

It is mostly performed to help diagnosing SLE in patients with insufficient clinical and serological profiles. However, most published studies on its utility are outdated and the results remain controversial. Objectives: To determine the diagnostic performance of LBT on non-lesion sun-protected (NLSP) and sun-exposed (NLSE) skin for SLE. Methods: Consecutively presenting patients with clinical and serological suspicion of SLE who had LBT performed on non-lesion skin during January 2012 to August 2021 were retrospectively studied. LBT performed on either NLSE or NLSP skin biopsies were all included. Laboratory characteristics, number, types and patterns of deposited immunoreactants and disease activity were also assessed. Results: LBT was performed in 57 patients with suspected SLE. LBT was positive in 18/57, 9/28 and 6/21 patients in overall non-lesion, NLSE and NLSP, respectively. Of all patients, 23 patients were diagnosed with SLE and 34 patients with other diseases. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of LBT on non-lesion skin was 56.5% and 88.2%, respectively. The ability of the test to discriminate between those with and without SLE, assessed by the area under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic curve, was 0.72 (0.61–0.84). The sensitivity and specificity of LBT on NLSE skin was 58.3% and 87.5% while those of NLSP skin, were 57.1% and 85.7%, respectively. We found no significant correlation between the positivity of LBT and overall disease activity. Types, number and pattern of deposited immunoreactants also showed no correlation with disease activity (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: Used as a diagnostic adjunct, non-lesion LBT is still of value for diagnosing SLE in inconclusive cases.",medical,Rheumatology

The database is developed using the advanced analysis based on beam-column and zero-length elements. The input variables are member cross-sections and parameters of the high-order nonlinear functions describing semi-rigid connection behaviors. Twelve machine learning algorithms, including three linear regression models, support vector machines, deep learning and seven tree-based ensemble algorithms, were evaluated. Three practical semi-rigid connected steel (including two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional space) structures were studied. The numerical results revealed that the distribution of the load-carrying capacity responses of the structures was non-normal and heavy-tailed. The class of linear regression methods was less efficient than the tree-based ensemble algorithms. Among the seven tree-based ensemble approaches, the extreme gradient boosting method presented the best performance in determining not only the lowest (mean squared, mean absolute and mean absolute percentage) errors but also the highest coefficient of determination. It was followed by the light gradient boosting machines and categorical gradient boosting algorithms. Three linear regression methods (linear regression, Lasso and Ridge), light gradient boosting machines, categorical gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting provided the competitive computing cost. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm was therefore recommended for the accurate prediction of load-carrying capacities of semi-rigid connected steel frames.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

The complexation abilities of CNT-RB with metal ions including Cu2+, Hg2+, Al3+, and Au3+ ions were investigated using DFT calculations. The interactions between metal ions and CNT-RB were also investigated. The calculated results point out that CNT-RB displays the strongest complexation ability with Au3+ ion compared with Cu2+, Hg2+, and Al3+ ions. The electronic properties reveal that after CNT-RB forms complexes with Au3+, the energy gap of CNT-RB is clearly modified. Subsequently, the CNT-RB was synthesized via an amidation reaction of carboxylic acid functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT-COOH) and rhodamine B-ethylenediamine (RB) in the addition of N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide as coupling reagents. The sensitivity and selectivity of CNT-RB nanosensor to metal ions, i.e., Na+, Ag+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pt2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Au3+, and Ru3+ ions were studied using the absorption and emission techniques. Experimental results are in good agreement with the computed results in which CNT-RB nanosensor displays high selectivity and sensitivity for Au3+ ion over the other metal ions. Therefore CNT-RB nanosensor could be applied as a naked-eye and fluorometric nanosensor for Au3+ ion detections.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This is due to the fact that a roadmap itself reflects only a snapshot of an organization's strategic plan based on the information at the point when a roadmap is developed. It is crucial for an organization to monitor changes in its business environment which may exert different effects on a roadmap and assess whether such changes are sufficiently relevant and significant. If so, then an updated version of a roadmap will be required. According to current practice, the roadmap meeting is scheduled periodically to review and keep the roadmap it up-to-date. However, this approach may not be sufficiently proactive in monitoring the status of a roadmap and allowing the management to make a timely decision on its revision. This article explores the conceptual approach called data-driven roadmapping using a data-driven computerized decision support system that can be semiautomated to reflect any changes in the business environment, providing recommendations as to whether a roadmap needs to be slightly adjusted, totally revised, or remain unchanged.","fluidex; related topics, Business, engineering","Strategy and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

We analyzed the 28-day and 90-day mortality in ACLF patients with or without underlying cirrhosis enrolled in the ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) database. Methods: A total of 1,621 patients were prospectively enrolled and 637 (39.3%) of these patients had cirrhosis. Baseline characteristics, complications and mortality were compared between patients with and without cirrhosis. Results: Alcohol consumption was more common in cirrhosis than non-cirrhosis (66.4% vs. 44.2%, p < 0.0001), while non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/cryptogenic CLD (10.9% vs 5.8%, p < 0.0001) and chronic HBV reactivation (18.8% vs 11.8%, p < 0.0001) were more common in non-cirrhosis. Only 0.8% of patients underwent liver transplantation. Overall, 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were 39.3% and 49.9%, respectively. Patients with cirrhosis had a greater chance of survival compared to those without cirrhosis both at 28-day (HR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.36–0.63, p < 0.0001) and 90-day (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.43–0.72, p < 0.0001), respectively. In alcohol CLD, non-cirrhosis patients had a higher 28-day (49.9% vs. 23.6%, p < 0.001) and 90-day (58.4% vs. 35.2%, p < 0.001) mortality rate than cirrhosis patients. ACLF patients with cirrhosis had longer mean survival than non-cirrhosis patients (25.5 vs. 18.8 days at 28-day and 65.2 vs. 41.2 days at 90-day). Exaggerated systemic inflammation might be the reason why non-cirrhosis patients had a poorer prognosis than those with cirrhosis after ACLF had occurred. Conclusions: The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates of ACLF patients without cirrhosis were significantly higher than those with cirrhosis in alcoholic CLD.

Here multi-tem per ature atomic displacement parameters (ADPs), derived from a single-crystal synchrotron diffraction experiment, are used to characterize low-frequency lattice vibrations in the α-FOX-7 layered structure. It is shown that despite the limited quality of the data, the extracted frequencies are reasonably close to those derived from inelastic scattering, Raman measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Vibrational anharmonicity is parameterized by the Grüneisen parameters, which are found to be very different for in-layer and out-of-layer vibrations.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The discovery of trypanosomes in bats emphasizes the importance of bats as an important reservoir. Interestingly, there is a hypothesis that bats are ancestral hosts of T. cruzi. Trypanosome diversity has never been investigated in bats in Thailand, despite being in a biodiversity hot spot. To gain a better understanding of the diversity and evolutionary relationship of trypanosomes, polymerase chain reaction-based surveys were carried out from 2018 to 2020 in 17 sites. A total of 576 bats were captured, representing 23 species. A total of 38 (6.6%) positive samples was detected in ten bat species. Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma noyesi were identified from Myotis siligorensis and Megaderma spasma, respectively. The remaining 18S rRNA sequences of trypanosomes were related to other trypanosomes previously reported elsewhere. The sequences in the current study showed nucleotide identity as low as 90.74% compared to those of trypanosomes in the GenBank database, indicating the possibility of new species. All bat trypanosomes identified in the current study fall within the T. cruzi clade. The current study adds to evidence linking T. noyesi to a bat trypanosome and further supports the bat host origin of the T. cruzi clade. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study on bat trypanosomes in Thailand and their phylogenetic relationships with global isolates.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Animal Science and Zoology, Infectious Diseases"

The effects of the SNR and FNR latex concentrations (1–5% dry rubber content, DRC) and immersion temperatures (50–60 °C) on the composite film characteristics were investigated. The resulting mechanical properties of the SNR-BC and FNR-BC films were significantly enhanced compared to the neat BC film. Smaller size particles in SNR latex could extensively diffuse into the BC network, resulting in a much higher loading of SNR into BC film, as compared to that of FNR. The composite BC film with the highest elongation at break at 28% was obtained by immersion in a 5% SNR latex suspension at 60 °C, whereas the film with the highest tensile strength at 177 MPa was obtained by immersion in a 5% FNR latex suspension at 50 °C. The reinforcement strongly improved the structural stability of the composite films in water, and the composite films showed good chemical resistance in toluene. The composite films were biodegradable and could be degraded by 50–100% within 4–6 weeks in soil. The dielectric properties, in terms of dielectric constant and dielectric loss, of the BC film modified by a 5% SNR latex loading at immersion temperature of 60 °C were considerably enhanced to 170 (at 102 Hz) and 76 (at 102 Hz), respectively. With the reinforced mechanical and dielectric properties, SNR-BC composites offer potential for further development in electronic applications. FNR-BC films might also be applied as low dielectric materials for microelectronics.

Several naturally occurring compounds exhibit attractive biological effects including anti-melanogenic activity. Chemically modified derivatives of those compounds are expected to be more efficient. However, efficacy and safety testing processes are of significant consideration to identify the most effective compound among them. Herein, we demonstrated a tiered approach to investigate the antipigmentation activity of 17 trans-N-coumaroyltyramine derivatives. First, we evaluated the in chemico antityrosinase activity, then the cytotoxicity of the most potent derivatives using a mitochondrial activity-based assay, followed with the in vitro anti-melanogenic activity in two dimensional (2D) monolayer human melanocytes. The selected derivatives were topically applied on a three dimensional (3D) pigmented-reconstructed human epidermis (pRhE) containing melanocytes and keratinocytes to evaluate their depigmenting activity. Two of the 17 derivatives displayed a significant reduction in pigmentation in the 3D pRhE, comparable to kojic acid, a known tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, a molecular docking experiment indicated an interaction of the three derivatives and tyrosinase, suggesting that these derivatives have potent anti-melanogenic activity through tyrosinase inhibition. Our findings provide an alternative approach for investigating skin-whitening agents, thereby facilitating the research and development of skin-whitening products that need not be tested on animals.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Dermatology"

The preparation of a polymer coating, from a simple and easy method of solution blending of hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane elastomer and hydrophilic polyurethane with SiO2, was carried out in this study, with the aim of improving characteristics, and the coating demonstrated economic feasibility for antifouling application. Incorporation of SiO2 particles into PDMS and PDMS/PU polymer film improved mechanical properties of the film and the support fabrication of micropatterns by means of a soft lithography process. Observations from field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) of the PDMS/SiO2 composite film revealed a homogeneous morphology and even dispersion of the SiO2 disperse phase between 1–5 wt.%. Moreover, the PDMS film with 3 wt.% loading of SiO2 considerably increased WCA to 115.7° ± 2.5° and improved mechanical properties by increasing Young’s modulus by 128%, compared with neat PDMS film. Additionally, bonding strength between barnacles and the PDMS film with 3 wt.% of SiO2 loading was 0.16 MPa, which was much lower than the bonding strength between barnacles and the reference carbon steel of 1.16 MPa. When compared to the previous study using PDMS/PU blend (95:5), the count of barnacles of PDMS with 3 wt.% SiO2 loading was lower by 77% in the two-week field tests and up to 97% in the eight-week field tests. Subsequently, when PDMS with 3 wt.% SiO2 was further blended with PU, and the surface modified by the soft lithography process, it was found that PDMS/PU (95:5) with 3 wt.% SiO2 composite film with micropatterns increased WCA to 122.1° ± 2.9° and OCA 90.8 ± 3.6°, suggesting that the PDMS/PU (95:5) with 3 wt.% SiO2 composite film with surface modified by the soft lithography process could be employed for antifouling application.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In addition, the degradation kinetics of bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity during storage were assessed using zero-order and first-order kinetic models. Results showed riceberry roasted at 120°C had the highest total anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity. In addition, riceberry obtained from roasting exhibited the highest bioactive compound and antioxidant activity. Besides, first-order kinetic was confirmed as the best-fitted model to describe degradation of bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity of processed riceberry during storage. This finding suggested that roasting at 120°C was chosen as an optimum condition to maximize the content of bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity and kinetic models provided a better understanding of antioxidant property reduction of processed riceberry during storage. Practical Application: Riceberry is an abundant source of bioactive constituents with beneficial health effects leading to a development of functional food product. However, processing may negatively affect biological properties of riceberry and bioactive constituent degradation of processed riceberry during storage has not been previously reported. Therefore, different processes were investigated to determine the effect on bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity of riceberry, and the degradation kinetic model of bioactive constituents during storage was also studied. Optimum processing is appropriate to design riceberry containing high concentration of bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity, which could be considered as a functional diet for health-conscious consumer.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Food Science

The formation of oxygen vacancies during epoxidation resulted in the loss of active species, leading to permanent catalyst deactivation. The WI-based catalysts exhibited superior stability to that of the IWI-based equivalents. Moreover, the use of SBA-15 as a support enabled higher stability than that of SiO2. The permanent deactivation rates for the 4Ti/SiO2-IWI, 4Ti/SBA-15-IWI, 4Ti/SiO2-WI, and 4Ti/SBA-15-WI catalysts were approximately 44.0%, 32.6%, 8.1%, and 0%, respectively. Various catalyst characterization data revealed that the configuration featuring stable surface Ti was present in the 4Ti/SBA-15-WI catalyst with strong metal–support interactions. This was attributed to the strong Ti4+ tetrahedral coordination achieved through Si–O–Ti bonds, the low degree of reducibility of the Ti catalyst, and the high dispersion and small particle size of Ti. Consequently, this modified surface can mitigate permanent catalyst deactivation caused by the surface oxygen vacancies.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

With the proposed pathophysiology of alcohol-induced liver injury to be related to deranged gut microbiota, we hypothesized that probiotics would have beneficial effects in attenuating alcohol-induced liver injury. Methods: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, alcohol group, Lactobacillus plantarum group, and mixed-strain probiotics group. After 4 weeks, all rats were sacrificed, and blood samples were analyzed for ALT, lipopolysaccharide level (LPS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Liver tissues were processed for histopathology, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and immunohistochemistry for toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4). Stool samples were collected, and 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the fecal microbiota. Results: Liver histopathology showed the presence of significant hepatocyte ballooning in the alcohol group as compared with the control group, and the treatment with L. plantarum or mixed-strain probiotics alleviated these changes. Significant elevation of serum ALT, LPS, IL-6, and TNF-α, hepatic MDA levels, and hepatic TLR-4 expression were observed in alcohol-fed rats as compared with control rats. The administration of L. plantarum or mixed-strain probiotics restored these changes to the levels of control rats. The relative abundance of fecal bacteria at genus level showed a significant reduction in Allobaculum, Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia in the alcohol group as compared with the control group. In probiotics-treated rats, significant increases in Allobaculum and Bifidobacterium were observed, while the relative abundance of Romboutsia and Akkermansia was unchanged compared to the alcohol group. A reduction in alpha diversity was observed in alcohol-treated rats, whereas the improvement was noted after probiotic treatment. Conclusions: The treatment with Lactobacillus, whether as single-, or mixed-strain probiotics, was beneficial in reducing the severity of alcohol-induced liver injury likely through the increase in beneficial bacteria, and the reduction of inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

This work aims to perform technical and economic analyses of the pyrolysis and gasification integrated process using EFB for multi-biofuels production. Firstly, the pyrolysis and gasification integrated process model is developed by using Aspen Plus simulator and employed to determine optimal conditions through a parametric analysis. Then, the design of a heat exchanger network is also incorporated to enhance the energy efficiency of the process using Aspen Energy Analyzer. Finally, the key economic performance indicators, i.e., payback period (PB), net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR), of the process are analyzed using Aspen Process Economic Analyzer.

There was no difference in the fungal microbiome (predominant Ascomycota in both sham and CLP mice) and the abundance of all organisms between sepsis and control groups. Interestingly, the transfers of feces from CLP mice worsened sepsis severity when compared with sham fecal transplantation, as evaluated by mortality, renal injury (serum creatinine and histology), liver damage (liver enzyme and histology), spleen apoptosis, serum cytokines, endotoxemia, and bacteremia. In contrast, the transfers of fecal viral particles from sepsis mice, but not from sham mice, attenuated inflammation in CLP sepsis possibly through the decrease in several fecal pathogenic bacteria (such as Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Prevotellaceae) as evaluated by fecal microbiome analysis.

This study investigates the performance of the bioengineering techniques employed at Ban Na Tum by means of 3D stability-seepage modelling. The analysis considers the influence of different land uses based on digital terrain model using unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry. A detailed site investigation was conducted which included soil boring, standard penetration tests, light-weight penetration tests, field density tests, resistivity surveying, and ground aeration sound tests to develop 3D soil stratigraphy and hydro-geological models. The height and perimeter of trees were selectively measured at the site to make corrections of the surface model. The analysis results revealed that the critical locations on slopes (i.e., the lowest factor of safety) were not necessarily stationary but could change with on-going water infiltration and seepage. In summary, the bioengineered slope covered with early-stage pioneer plants and rubber trees had a lower stability factor of safety than the natural forest, meaning that the surface slope covered with the early-stage pioneer plants is more likely to fail during heavy rainfall. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating land use in 3D stability modelling, as land coverage can have notable influences on slope stability.","water engineeringneering, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

Conclusion: AD is characterized by TRP depletion but not by an overactivity of the TRYCAT pathway. IDO-induced production of neurotoxic TRYCATs is not a key factor in the pathophysiology of AD.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience, psychology, medical","Neuroscience (all), Clinical Psychology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
"Electrically controlled transdermal delivery of naproxen and indomethacin from porous cis-1,4-polyisoprene matrix","Ruangmak K., Paradee N., Niamlang S., Sakunpongpitiporn P., Sirivat A.",2022-02-01,"Cis-1 ,4-polyisoprene, Concentration gradients, Controllable drug release, Deproteinized natural rubber latices, Drug release mechanism, Electrical potential, Permeation experiments, Transdermal delivery, Administration, Cutaneous, Animals, Drug Delivery Systems, Hemiterpenes, Indomethacin, Latex, Naproxen, Porosity, Skin, Swine, deproteinized natural rubber, natural rubber latex, porous structure, transdermal patch","This study is focused on the inquiry of using a porous polymeric structure to absorb and release transdermally two drugs through a skin from deproteinized natural rubber latex (DPNR). The porous DPNR films were fabricated from the internal formation of surfactant micelles and their subsequent leaching out to generate porous structures. The pore size of DPNR films increased with increasing surfactant amount. The model drugs were naproxen and indomethacin; their releases and release-permeations were investigated under the effects of surfactant amount, electrical potential, and drug size. Without electric field, the drug release mechanism was mainly driven by concentration gradient. The higher amount of drug released was obtained from the matrix with a larger pore size. Under electric field, the higher amounts of drug release were obtained in the shorter drug release durations, via the electrorepulsive force between the negatively charged drugs and the cathode electrode. The molecular drug size was a factor for the drug absorption, release rate and amount. For the drug release-permeation experiment through the pig skin, there were two release-permeation periods as governed by the combination of concentration gradient and swelling in the first period, and the matrix erosion in the second period. The fabricated porous DPNR films have been shown here to be potential to be used as a transdermal patch with electrically controllable drug release rate, amount and duration along with the facile drug-matrix loading and absorption.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"
Blood Bacteria-Free DNA in Septic Mice Enhances LPS-Induced Inflammation in Mice through Macrophage Response,"Kaewduangduen W., Visitchanakun P., Saisorn W., Phawadee A., Manonitnantawat C., Chutimaskul C., Susantitaphong P., Ritprajak P., Somboonna N., Cheibchalard T., Wannigama D.L., Kueanjinda P., Leelahavanichkul A.",2022-02-01,"Animals, Cytokines, Dextran Sulfate, Disease Models, Animal, DNA, Bacterial, Feces, Interleukin-10, Interleukin-6, Lipopolysaccharides, Macrophages, Mice, Mucositis, Sepsis, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Bacterial DNA, Blood microbiome analysis, Cecal ligation and puncture, LPS, Sepsis","Although bacteria-free DNA in blood during systemic infection is mainly derived from bacterial death, translocation of the DNA from the gut into the blood circulation (gut translocation) is also possible. Hence, several mouse models with experiments on macrophages were conducted to explore the sources, influences, and impacts of bacteria-free DNA in sepsis. First, bacteria-free DNA and bac-teriome in blood were demonstrated in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis mice. Second, administration of bacterial lysate (a source of bacterial DNA) in dextran sulfate solution (DSS)-induced mucositis mice elevated blood bacteria-free DNA without bacteremia supported gut translocation of free DNA. The absence of blood bacteria-free DNA in DSS mice without bacterial lysate implies an impact of the abundance of bacterial DNA in intestinal contents on the translocation of free DNA. Third, higher serum cytokines in mice after injection of combined bacterial DNA with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), when compared to LPS injection alone, supported an influence of blood bacteria-free DNA on systemic inflammation. The synergistic effects of free DNA and LPS on macrophage pro-inflammatory responses, as indicated by supernatant cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), pro-inflammatory genes (NFκB, iNOS, and IL-1β), and profound energy alteration (enhanced glycolysis with reduced mito-chondrial functions), which was neutralized by TLR-9 inhibition (chloroquine), were demonstrated. In conclusion, the presence of bacteria-free DNA in sepsis mice is partly due to gut translocation of bacteria-free DNA into the systemic circulation, which would enhance sepsis severity. Inhibition of the responses against bacterial DNA by TLR-9 inhibition could attenuate LPS-DNA synergy in macrophages and might help improve sepsis hyper-inflammation in some situations.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Methods: Two hundred postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years were recruited. Each participant was evaluated for FPHL according to Ludwig's classification using standardized global photography in all six views and trichoscopy for hair density and diameter. Three dermatologists re-evaluated all pictures for confirmation of FPHL. The time since menopause, levels of scalp sebum, serum testosterone, estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, and hemoglobin; family history of hair loss, as well as an evaluation of low self-esteem were evaluated. Women who underwent recent hair loss treatments were excluded. We used simple and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the factors affecting FPHL. Results: In total, 178 postmenopausal women were evaluated for hair-loss patterns. The average age and time since menopause were 58.8±4.1 and 9.2 ± 5.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of FPHL was 52.2% (95% CI, 44.6-59.8). Severity of FPHL by Ludwig grades I, II, and III was 73.2% (95% CI, 62.9-81.8), 22.6% (95% CI, 14.6-32.4), and 4.3% (95% CI, 1.2-10.7), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, time since menopause, and body mass index were all significantly associated with FPHL. After adjusting for age and family history of FPHL, only body mass index ≥25 kg/m2was significantly associated with FPHL (adjusted OR = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.23-5.70). Conclusion: The prevalence of FPHL was high in postmenopausal women, raising the need for hair loss awareness in menopause clinics. Early detection and proper treatment of FPHL may increase the quality of life in postmenopausal women.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology
Solution plasma synthesis of bacterial cellulose acetate derived from nata de coco waste incorporated with polyether block amide,"Ajkidkarn P., Manuspiya H.",2022-06-01,"Amides, Bacteria, Cellulose, Cocos, Ions, Lithium, Acetylation, Bacterial cellulose acetate, Cellulose derivative, LIB separator, Solution plasma process","Cellulose acetate (CA), one of the most important cellulose derivatives, is used in various applications especially in membranes, films, fibers, filters, and polymers. Because of the tough and flexible character and resistance to acids of CA, bacterial cellulose acetate (BCA) has been used as reinforcement for high performance separator purposes. In this study, BCA was synthesized through the heterogeneous acetylation in acetic solution with H2SO4 as catalyst by solution plasma process (SPP) of bacterial cellulose (BC) extracted form nata de coco waste. The SPP was considered as mild, simple, and fast method for many kinds of synthesis. The solution plasma time was studied to obtain considerably high DS values (in this work, DS = 1.95). The high DS values are an important feature when considering an environmental factor, good liquid transport and excellent absorption. Furthermore, the BCA incorporated with poly ether block amide by electrospinning method is successfully fabricated as nanofibrous membranes. The proposed PEBAX/BCA nanofibrous membranes display superior sufficient porosity (74.7%), exceptional liquid electrolyte uptake (364.6%), sufficient thermal dimensional stability at 150 °C, great electrochemical stability (discharge capacity at 0.2C = 102.14 mAh g−1), and high ionic conductivity (9.12 × 10−3 S/cm). Furthermore, the PEBAX/BCA nanofibrous membranes can be used as high-performance separators enhancing its safety for Li-ion battery applications.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Although the government has made efforts in curbing the use of conventional single-use plastic packaging, the problem is still looming up in the critical time of building ecological civilization. The key to resolve the overwhelming usage of disposable plastic packaging lies in reduction, along with using green alternatives: biodegradable packaging and returnable containers. The study investigated consumers’ willingness to adopt new alternatives by applying the extended classical behavioral theory: the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The measurement scale, developed upon previous literature, gains validated reliability and validity after running confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) in SmartPLS. The study distributed 536 questionnaires online, targeting consumers from Beijing and Shanghai. 430 valid samples were collected and analyzed, with results showing that consumers’ perceived behavior control has strong and positive effect on their willingness to pay more to using biodegradable packaging and willingness to participate in the returnable container programs. The environmental attitude, social norms and past green behavior show less direct relationships with people’s adopting intentions. Their effects on the intentions are mediated by perceived behavior control disproportionately.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"

Current regenerative approaches implement exogenous systems, including stem cells, scaffolds, growth factors, and plasmid DNA/viral vectors, that induce variable clinical outcomes. An innovative approach that is safe, effective, and inexpensive is needed. The lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) platform has proven to be a successful vaccine modality against coronavirus disease 2019, demonstrating safety and high efficacy in humans. The same fundamental technology platform could be applied to facilitate the development of mRNA-based regenerative therapy. While the platform has not yet been studied in the field of oral tissue regeneration, mRNA therapeutics encoding growth factors have been evaluated and demonstrated promising findings in various models of soft and hard tissue regeneration such as myocardial infarction, diabetic wound healing, and calvarial and femoral bone defects. Because restoration of both soft and hard tissues is crucial to oral tissue physiology, this new therapeutic modality may help to overcome challenges associated with the reconstruction of the unique and complex architecture of oral tissues. This review discusses mRNA therapeutics with an emphasis on findings and lessons in different regenerative animal models, and it speculates how we can apply mRNA-based platforms for oral tissue regeneration.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

A clogging or bacterial attachment onto product's surface can be avoided by creating the non-fouling surface for extending the NR utilization. Herein, a superhydrophobic NR film was prepared using two-step surface modification involving sulfuric acid (H2SO4)-catalyzed hydration to form hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups on the rubber surface followed by grafting with methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS). From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the immersion of a vulcanized NR film (VNR) in 75 wt% H2SO4 solution for 1 h showed the highest area portion of -OH groups on the VNR surface (50.9%), which were expected to act as the active sites for grafting with MTCS via hydrolysis and polycondenzation to obtain a VNR-OH-MTCS film. As a measure of the hydrophobicity, the water contact angle (WCA) of the VNR-OH-MTCS film prepared by using 2 wt% MTCS concentration was greatest at 155° with a high roughness of 1790 nm. The glass transition temperature and antimicrobial activity of the VNR film were not affected by these surface modifications. This indicated that the superhydrophobic VNR-OH-MTCS film maintained the flexibility with ability to inhibit the formation of a bacterial biofilm. Not only superhydrophobicity, the VNR-OH-MTCS film also had oleophilicity (oil absorption capacity [k] of 1.13) suggesting that it could be applied for oil/water separation with high separation efficiency of 98.6%. Moreover, the VNR-OH-MTCS film still had high hydrophobicity with WCA of 138°–142° after 20 abrasion cycles using a sandpaper under the weighting load not over than 50 g.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

The altered shapes led to the variation in catalyst properties, such as the exposed planes, ease of Ni reduction/oxidation, and carbon removal, which affected its catalytic performance. Additionally, it was found that the exposed planes present in cubic {100} and rod structures ({100} and {110}) enhanced the formation of Ni0 and subsequently promoted the reforming reaction. Moreover, oxygen vacancies and mobility properties of {100} and {110} exposed planes can promote the oxidation reaction of carbon, resulting in a stable catalyst for the reforming of acetic acid. The results also showed that the type of depositing carbons was influenced by the support morphology. All the catalysts showed a 100% acetic acid conversion with the 15Ni/NC-CeZr (cubic structure) catalyst exhibited the highest hydrogen yield.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

However, current strategies to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults are quite complicated and not well implemented among many AP areas, and vaccination coverage rates among adults are generally low or perceived as low in the region. Thus, this literature review’s purpose was to summarize the disease burden and vaccination against pneumococcal diseases among adults in select AP areas (Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam). Areas Covered: This systematic review included published articles from January 2010 to August 2020 using MEDLINE/Embase. Grey literature websites were searched for national immunization programs and medical society vaccination recommendations from areas of interest. A total of 69 publications were identified. Expert Opinion: In the AP region, pneumococcal disease burden and serotype prevalence are variable among adult populations, particularly among older adults. Data was provided primarily from countries with established national immunization programs (NIPs). Further research on the disease burden and emphasis on the benefits of vaccination in AP areas lacking pneumococcal vaccination programs is warranted.","Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Methods: We recruited 65 older adult patients with a low energy impact hip fracture who underwent hip fracture operation. The CAM-ICU and the Delirium Rating Scale, Revised-98-Thai version (DRS-R-98) were assessed pre-operatively and 1, 2 and 3 days after surgery. Blood samples (day 1 and 2) post-surgery were assayed for cytokines/chemokines using a MultiPlex assay and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Results: We found that delirium and/or the DRS-R-98 score were associated with IRS activation as indicated by activated M1, Th1, Th17 and T cell growth profiles and by attenuated CIRS functions. The most important IRS biomarkers were CXCL8, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and the most important CIRS biomarkers were IL-4 and soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist. We found that 42.5% of the variance in the actual changes in the DRS-R-98 score (averaged from day 1 to day 3) was explained by T cell growth factors, baseline DRS-R-98 scores and age. An increase in the NLR reflects overall IRS, M1, Th1, Th17, and Th2 activation. Conclusions: Post-hip surgery delirium is associated with activated IRS pathways and appears especially in patients with lowered CIRS functions.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

The adaptation and use of biobased materials for applications such as targeted therapeutic delivery is, therefore, in high demand. A crucial part of this relates to the development of porous and hollow structures that are biocompatible, pH-responsive, deliver active substances, and contribute to pain relief, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and so forth. In this study, we developed a facile single-step and water-based method for the fabrication of hollow spherical cellulose beads for targeted drug release in response to external pH stimuli. Through base-catalyzed deprotection, hydrophobic solid and spherical cellulose acetate beads are transformed into hydrophilic cellulose structures with a hollow interior (wall thickness: 150 μm and inner diameter: 650 μm) by a stepwise increment of temperature and treatment time. Besides the pH-responsive fluid uptake properties, the hollow cellulose structures exhibit a maximum encapsulation efficiency of 20–85% diclofenac (DCF), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, used commonly to treat pain and inflammatory diseases. The maximum amount of DCF released in vitro increased from 20 to 100% when the pH of the release medium increased from pH 1.2 to 7.4. As for the DCF release patterns and kinetic models at specific pH values, the release showed a diffusion- and swelling-controlled profile, effortlessly fine-tuned by external environmental pH stimuli. Overall, we show that the modified beads exhibit excellent characteristics for transport across the gastrointestinal tract and enhance the bioavailability of the drug. Their therapeutic efficacy and biocompatibility are also evident from the studies on human fibroblast cells. We anticipate that this platform could support and inspire the development of novel sustainable and effective polysaccharide-based delivery systems.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Objective: This study aims to investigate engagement in a theory-based (information-motivation-behavioral skills model) mobile phone app developed to support HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence among Thai young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among HIV-negative YMSM and YTGW aged 15-19 years initiating daily oral PrEP. Participants were randomized to receive either youth-friendly PrEP services (YFS) for 6 months, including monthly contact with site staff (clinic visits or telephone follow-up) and staff consultation access, or YFS plus use of a PrEP adherence support app (YFS+APP). The target population focus group discussion findings and the information-motivation-behavioral skills model informed app development. App features were based on the 3Rs-risk assessment of self-HIV acquisition risk, reminders to take PrEP, and rewards as redeemable points. Dried blood spots quantifying of tenofovir diphosphate were collected at months 3 and 6 to assess PrEP adherence. Tenofovir diphosphate ≥350-699 fmol/punch was classified as fair adherence and ≥700 fmol/punch as good adherence. Data analysis on app use paradata and exit interviews were conducted on the YFS+APP arm after 6 months of follow-up. Results: Between March 2018 and June 2019, 200 participants with a median age of 18 (IQR 17-19) years were enrolled. Overall, 74% (148/200) were YMSM; 87% (87/100) of participants who received YFS+APP logged in to the app and performed weekly HIV acquisition risk assessments (log-in and risk assessment [LRA]). The median duration between the first and last log-in was 3.5 (IQR 1.6-5.6) months, with a median frequency of 6 LRAs (IQR 2-10). Moreover, 22% (22/100) of the participants in the YFS+APP arm were frequent users (LRA≥10) during the 6-month follow-up period. YMSM were 9.3 (95% CI 1.2-74.3) times more likely to be frequent app users than YTGW (P = .04). Frequent app users had higher proportions (12%-16%) of PrEP adherence at both months 3 and 6 compared with infrequent users (LRA<10) and the YFS arm, although this did not reach statistical significance. Of the 100 participants in the YFS+APP arm, 23 (23%) were interviewed. The risk assessment function is perceived as the most useful app feature. Further aesthetic adaptations and a more comprehensive rewards system were suggested by the interviewees. Conclusions: Higher rates of PrEP adherence among frequent app users were observed; however, this was not statistically significant. A short app use duration of 3 months suggests that they may be useful in establishing habits in taking daily PrEP, but not long-term adherence. Further studies on the specific mechanisms of mobile phone apps that influence health behaviors are needed.",medical,Health Informatics

Acids treatment for improving catalytic properties and activity of the spent RFCC catalyst for cracking of palm oil to kerosene-diesel fraction fuels,"Istadi I., Amalia R., Riyanto T., Anggoro D.D., Jongsomjit B., Putranto A.B.",2022-07-01,"Acid solutions, Acid treated, Acid treatments, Catalyst properties, Catalytic properties, Fluid catalytic cracking catalyst, Kerosene-diesel, Solution concentration, Spend residue fluid catalytic cracking catalyst, ]+ catalyst, Acid treatment, Catalyst properties, Catalytic cracking, Kerosene-diesel, Spent RFCC catalyst","In this study, the reactivation and modification of the spent Residue Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) catalyst using sulfuric acid and citric acid as acids treatment was evaluated by varying the acid solution concentrations. The effect of acid types and acid-solution concentrations on structural, textural, and acidic properties of spent RFCC catalyst was observed using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, N2-sorption and pyridine-probed Fourier transform infrared measurements. Catalytic cracking of palm oil was used to evaluate the catalytic activity of the acid-treated catalysts. All the results showed the different beneficial effects of the sulfuric acid- and citric acid- treatments on the physicochemical properties of the modified catalyst with an improvement of surface area and pore volume of catalysts as well as the crystallinity due to the metal and matrix material removal. The sulfuric acid-treated catalysts have higher Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) ratio than the citric acid treatment, while the citric acid-treated catalysts have lower B/L ratio due to the enhancement of Lewis acid site. The acid-treated catalysts showed better performance than the non-treated catalyst. The selectivity of the kerosene-diesel range product fraction increased with the acid concentrations treatment.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Chitooligosaccharides (COS) have health benefits, but their effect on endothelial cells is unknown. We demonstrate for the first time a protective effect of COS against ER-induced endothelial cell damage. Objective: To evaluate the protective effect of COS on ER stress-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells. Material and methods: Endothelial (EA.hy926) cells were pre-treated with COS (250 or 500 μg/mL) for 24 h, and then treated with 0.16 μg/mL of Tg for 24 h and compared to the untreated control. Apoptosis and necrosis were detected by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide co-staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with the DCFH2-DA and DHE probes. The protective pathway and ER stress markers were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. Results: COS attenuated ER stress-induced cell death. The viability of EA.hy926 cells treated with Tg alone was 44.97 ± 1% but the COS pre-treatment increased cells viability to 74.74 ± 3.95% in the 250 μg/mL COS and 75.34 ± 2.4% in the 500 μg/mL COS treatments. Tg induced ER stress and ROS, which were associated with ER stress-mediated death. Interestingly, COS reduced ROS by upregulating nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and the oxidative enzymes, superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) and catalase. COS also suppressed up-regulation of the ER-related apoptosis protein, CHOP induced by Tg. Conclusions: COS protected against ER stress-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells by suppressing ROS and up-regulation Nrf2 and SOD1. These findings support the use of COS to protect endothelial cells.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

GaAs wafers were exposed to high-energy electron beams under different energies of 10, 15, and 20 MeV for absorbed doses ranging from 0–2.0 MGy. The study showed high-energy electron bombardments caused roughening on the surface of the irradiated GaAs samples. At the maximum delivered energy of 20 MeV electrons, the observed root mean square (RMS) roughness increased from 5.993 (0.0 MGy) to 14.944 nm (2.0 MGy). The increased RMS roughness with radiation doses was consistent with an increased hole size of incident electrons on the GaAs surface from 0.015 (0.5 MGy) to 0.066 nm (2.0 MGy) at 20 MeV electrons. Interestingly, roughness on the surface of irradiated GaAs samples affected an increase in material wettability. The study also observed the changes in bandgap energy of GaAs samples after irradiation with 10, 15, and 20 MeV electrons. The band gap energy was found in the 1.364 to 1.397 eV range, and the observed intense UV-VIS spectra were higher than in non-irradiated samples. The results revealed an increase of light absorption in irradiated GaAs samples to be higher than in original-based samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Exome sequencing (ES) was pursued in all cases, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) was performed for six cases. Our result is impressive; six cases (60%) received likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants. Four definitive diagnosis cases had known pathogenic variants in KCNJ2, TGFBR1, SCN1A, and FBN1, whereas another two cases revealed novel likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in GNB1 and DNAH9. Our study demonstrates the success in genetic diagnosis in adult patients: four cases with definitive, two cases with possible, and one case with partial diagnosis. The advantage of diagnosis is beyond obtaining the diagnosis itself, but also relieving any doubt for the patient regarding any previous questionable diagnosis, guide for management, and recurrence risk in their children or family members.

However, the diagnosis of sepsis remains challenging because of vague clinical presentations. Objectives: We aim to developed novel sepsis screening tools with machine learning models and compared their performance with traditional methods. Methods: We used machine learning algorithms to develop models for early risk prediction of sepsis based on retrospective single-center electronic health record data from adult patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) from June 2018 through May 2020. Available triage data including vital signs, baseline characteristics, and chief complaints served as predictors. In our study, 80% and 20% of the data were randomly split into training and testing sets, respectively. Derived from the training set, we built the models based on four machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and neural network. Our primary outcome was the model performance that predicted the final diagnosis of sepsis determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and predictive performance compared with those of the reference models (quick sequential organ failure assessment [qSOFA], modified early warning score [MEWS], and systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS]) using the testing dataset. Results: In total, 133,707 ED visits were analyzed. All machine learning models outperformed the reference models by achieving a higher AUROC (e.g., AUROC 0.931 [95% CI 0.921–0.944] in our best model (random forest algorithm) vs 0.635 [95% CI 0.613–0.660] in qSOFA, 0.688 [95% CI 0.662–0.715] in MEWS, and 0.814 [95% CI 0.794–0.833] in SIRS). Conclusion: The machine learning models demonstrated superior performance in prediction of sepsis diagnosis among emergency patients compared with that using the traditional screening tools.

The dynamic virtual environment could reduce effective neuromuscular regulation and instability. Nevertheless, virtual reality (VR) on the STS movement was not explored in any research. Objectives: This study's aim was to investigate the effect of the VR of an optokinetic drum on the STS movement by using optokinetic drum VR scenes. Methods: This study used a repeated measurement research design. Ninety healthy subjects aged 18–23 years with no experience in virtual reality were recruited. Each participant was asked to stand as quickly as possible from a height-adjustable chair three times under five conditions: with eyes-open (EO), eyes-closed (EC), and three VR scenes: a limited field view of an optokinetic scene, a black and white striped scene, moving in horizontal direction (VRhori), vertical direction (VRvert), and roll (VRroll). VR scenes were generated using a mobile phone in a head-mounted display. The rising index (the upward force produced by the legs as a proportion of body weight), sway velocity, and weight transfer time were measured using a NeuroCom Balance Master. Results: Only VRvert condition significantly reduced weight transfer time as compared to EO and the other two VR conditions. All three VR scenes significantly reduced the rising index as compared to EO. VRvert condition significantly increased sway velocity as compared to all conditions. Conclusion: These findings suggest that optokinetic environment scenes in virtual reality could be used as an alternative method to increase the challenge of maintaining the balance during STS.","biochemistryistry, medical, psychology","Biophysics, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology"
An Adaptive Perspective on Visual Working Memory Distortions,"Chunharas C., Rademaker R.L., Brady T.F., Serences J.T.",2022-01-01,"Bias, Humans, Memory, Short-Term, Mental Recall, Visual Perception, Attraction bias, Color memory, Memory biases, Repulsion bias, Visual working memory","When holding multiple items in visual working memory, representations of individual items are often attracted to, or repelled from, each other. While this is empirically well-established, existing frameworks do not account for both types of distortions, which appear to be in opposition. Here, we demonstrate that both types of memory distortion may confer functional benefits under different circumstances. When there are many items to remember and subjects are near their capacity to accurately remember each item individually, memories for each item become more similar (attraction). However, when remembering smaller sets of highly similar but discernible items, memory for each item becomes more distinct (repulsion), possibly to support better discrimination. Importantly, this repulsion grows stronger with longer delays, suggesting that it dynamically evolves in memory and is not just a differentiation process that occurs during encoding. Furthermore, both attraction and repulsion occur even in tasks designed to mitigate response bias concerns, suggesting they are genuine changes in memory representations. Together, these results are in line with the theory that attraction biases act to stabilize memory signals by capitalizing on information about an entire group of items, whereas repulsion biases reflect a tradeoff between maintaining accurate but distinct representations. Both biases suggest that human memory systems may sacrifice veridical representations in favor of representations that better support specific behavioral goals.","psychology, neuroscience","Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Psychology (all), Developmental Neuroscience"

Methods: Methylation patterns of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) and short interspersed element (Alu) sequences were assessed using the combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) method in cervical samples with cytology-diagnosed cervical lesions. Results: In cervical precancerous lesions with hrHPV positive, the percentage of overall (mC) and mCmC LINE-1 methylation levels showed a stepwise increase from hrHPV positive normal to HSIL with significant differences (p<0.001). However, both methylation levels were significantly higher in hrHPV negative normal than in hrHPV positive normal (p<0.001). The overall (mC) Alu methylation in hrHPV positive LSIL and HSIL was lower than in hrHPV positive normal, with a significant difference (p<0.05). Remarkably, the percentage of uCmC and mCuC of LINE-1 and Alu in three different hrHPV positive cervical lesions showed a stepwise decrease from hrHPV positive normal, LSIL and HSIL, respectively. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses revealed that the LINE-1 mC and mCmC patterns have high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing HSIL from normal/LSIL in hrHPV positive cases at the appropriate cutoff levels. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the LINE-1 and Alu methylation data in normal and premalignant cervical epithelia. LINE-1 hypomethylation was found in hrHPV positive normal cells, with lower methylation levels associated with cancer features.

In this work, we analyze the operating points with the thermal comfort requirement. Afterwards, we linearize the nonlinear dynamic model to a linear time-varying model. In particular, we specify that the operating point of the open-loop HVAC system satisfies the thermal comfort condition. This makes the predicted mean vote (PMV) equal to zero or nearly to zero. Subsequently, we calculate the zone temperature, the zone humidity ratio, and the volumetric flow rate. When considering the time-varying disturbance profiles, it appears that the operating points are time-varying. We observe that the coefficient of performance (COP) and the operating points are time-varying which lead to time-varying model. Moreover, we design supervisory control (SC) and model predictive control (MPC) for linear time-varying model. In the SC design, we aim to find the optimal reference zone temperature which is used as the reference signal for MPC. In the MPC design, the objectives are twofold. First, the zone temperature tracks the reference signal. Second, both electrical energy cost and deviation of desired thermal comfort are minimized. The computer simulation shows that MPC of time-varying HVAC system yields the best reference tracking. In addition, it reduces total electrical energy cost the most. We conclude that the optimal temperature reference can be effectively applied to the building HVAC systems while the occupants feel comfortable and the total electrical energy cost is the lowest.","heat exchange, computer science, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Control and Systems Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The critical parameters were optimized, and the process platform was scaled up from 2 ml to 1,000 ml for the efficient recovery of PHB. The physical parameters including continuous shaking, ultrasonication, extraction using the Soxhlet extractor, diluted 1,3-dioxolane, reused 1,3-dioxolane, and cell rupture by steam explosion prior to solvent extraction were carefully investigated. The results showed that continuous shaking played a major role in increasing the recovery efficiency during the scale-up process. The PHB extraction at 2 ml from dried cells at 80°C with 100 rpm of shaking speed for 5 h resulted in a recovery yield of 96.6 ± 0.1% with purity up to 99.1 ± 0.6% and that from wet cells under the same condition resulted in a recovery yield of 94.6 ± 4.8% and purity of 97.0 ± 0.1%. It should be noted that the PHB extracted from wet cells at room temperature with 150 rpm of shaking speed for 36 h resulted in a recovery yield of 93.5 ± 0.7% and purity of 97.7 ± 1.3% and had an MW of 3.1×105, MN of 2.7×105, and polydispersity index of 1.1. The direct scale-up process at 1,000 ml showed comparable results in purity, recovery yield, molecular weight distribution, thermal properties, and mechanical properties. The PHB extraction from dried cells gave the highest purity of 99.3 ± 0.5% and recovery of 94.0 ± 0.3%, whereas the PHB extraction from wet cells gave a purity of 90.3 ± 1.5% and recovery of 92.6 ± 1.0%. The novel recovery process showed its feasibility to be applied on an industrial scale.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

Approximately 20% of the crop (4,000 fish/crop) was affected. Bacterial isolation from the kidney and tissue surrounding the spinal lesion of the affected fish was negative. Histopathology revealed granulomatous inflammation and Gram-positive cocci in connective tissues around the bone and notochord. PCR assay confirmed the presence of S. agalactiae in the spinal tissue lesion. Spinal deformity in red tilapia observed in our study may be associated with the inflammatory process and granuloma that compress the skeleton structure.

Carbon deposition influenced by gas concentration in a Ni/YSZ anode of an internal-reforming solid oxide fuel cell using a detector layer inside the anode,"Sakama S., Chanthanumataporn M., Hanamura K.",2022-12-15,"Carbon deposition, Electrochemical reactions, Gas concentration, Internal methane reforming, Methane reforming, Ni/YSZ, Oxygen ions, Solid-oxide fuel cell, Three-layer, Two-layer, Anode, Carbon deposition, Internal methane reforming, Ni/YSZ, Solid oxide fuel cell","Carbon deposition on a nickel-based anode is a major concern when using methane as a fuel in SOFCs. In the current study, the influences of electrochemical reaction related to gas concentration distribution inside the fuel electrode on carbon deposition in the vicinities of an electrolyte and the electrode surface were experimentally investigated. A fabricated two- or three-layer structured anode with a detector layer consisting of 50% Ni and 50% Al2O3 for the two-layer anode or 10% Ni and 90% YSZ for the three-layer anode was used. FE-SEM images of the detector layer in the three-layer structured anode clearly suggest the important roles of electrochemical reactions in suppressing carbon deposition by providing oxygen ions and increasing water concentration inside the anode. In addition, the observed carbon deposition at the Ni/Al2O3 top detector layer of the two-layer structured electrode indicates that the surface of the electrode is more likely to be the location for carbon deposition than the vicinity of the electrolyte. From the results, carbon deposition and no deposition conditions could be disclosed as a function of the amount of H2O supplied in fuel and the amount of oxygen ion produced by electrochemical reaction.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Our aim was to characterise the ADHCAI phenotypes, tooth properties and genotypes. Methods: Three unrelated ADHCAI probands and seven additional affected members of the three families were recruited. Mutations were identified by exome and Sanger sequencing, and haplotypes by SNP array. Tooth colour, roughness, density, nanohardness, minerals and ultrastructure were investigated. Results: Ten participants were heterozygous for the FAM83H mutation c.1387C>T (p.Gln463*). All shared a 3.43 Mbp region on chromosome 8q24.3 encompassing the FAM83H variant, indicating a common ancestry. The c.1387C>T was estimated to be 23.8 generations or 600 years. The FAM83H enamel had higher roughness and lower lightness, density, nanohardness, and calcium and phosphorus levels than controls. Blunted enamel rods, wide interrod spaces and disorganised dentinoenamel junctions were observed. Evaluating the patients with the same mutation and reviewing others with different mutations in FAM83H revealed that the FAM83H heterogeneous phenotypes are age-influenced. Tooth colour and surface texture change with ageing. Conclusions: FAM83H enamel demonstrated decreased lightness, density, hardness, calcium, phosphorus and defective ultrastructure. We have identified that the phenotypic variation in FAM83H-associated ADHCAI is age-related. Awareness of the correlation between age and clinical features of FAM83H-ADHCAI can help dentists make an accurate diagnosis.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

We hypothesized that gene mutations are strong prognostic factors for these low-risk patients. Materials and methods: We enrolled patients from 4 medical centers with unexplained cytopenia of at least 1 lineage. Diagnosis of low-risk MDS was made according to WHO 2016 classification and a revised international prognostic scoring system (R-IPSS) score of ≤ 3.5. DNA was extracted from bone marrow or blood and sequenced by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Results: One hundred twenty-one patients were recruited: 25% with UC and 75% with low-risk MDS. Complete blood counts were similar, but low-risk MDS patients carried higher numbers of mutations (1 vs. 0; P =.04) than UC patients. Overall, the most frequent mutated genes were TET2 (14.6%), SF3B1 (12.2%), and ASXL1 (9.7%). Survival rates of low-risk MDS patients versus UC patients were not significantly different. UC patients and low-risk MDS patients without genetic abnormalities showed superior 5-year progression free survival compared to MDS patients with mutations (100% vs. 76.0%; P =.005). Overall, ASXL1 mutations were associated with decreased 4-year overall survival compared to wild-type (59% vs. 31%; P =.01). In a multivariate analysis, ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations in low-risk MDS patients were associated with a higher risk of disease progression with hazard ratios of 7.88 (95% CI 1.76-35.32, P =.01) and 7.45 (95% CI 1.61-34.46, P =.01), respectively.

According to statistics, there are three major model groups used to establish groundwater potential maps. The first model group is a statistic group, including multi-criteria decision making/analytic hierarchy process, frequency ratio, evidence belief function, and weights of evidence. The second model group includes machine learning models, such as random forest, logistic regression, boosted regression tree, and support vector machine. The final group is the hybrid/ensemble models. In groundwater potential mapping studies, 41 thematic layers affect the potential of groundwater. However, hydrological researchers have frequently used eight factors in groundwater potential studies: geology, slope, land use, soil type, drainage density, lineament density, altitude, rainfall. Most previous studies on groundwater potential have used a combination of geographic information system, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques to design the groundwater potential in regions of interest. Data sources are commonly applied to groundwater potential mapping, including satellite, borehole, and geophysical data. The accuracy of groundwater potential maps produced by common machine learning models ranges from 50.0% to 90.1%, while that produced by common statistical models ranges between 59.0% and 90.3%. Interestingly, hybrid/ensemble models’ accuracy interval ranges from 71.0% to 92.0%. Therefore, the review suggests that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined, and thematic layers should be increasingly used in mapping groundwater potential maps to achieve high efficiency.","water engineeringneering, applications; hydrosphere, environmental",Water Science and Technology

Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences, they were identified into five genera including Actinoplanes (1 strain), Actinomadura (1 strain), Pseudosporangium (1 strain), Wangella (1 strain) and Streptomyces (33 strains). Among these isolates, strain Ptm05T, Ptm01 and Ptm12 showed low 16S rRNA gene similarity and was selected for the further taxonomic study using the polyphasic approach. These strains showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Streptomyces sparsogenes ATCC 25498T (97.44–97.72%). Strain Ptm05T was selected for the type strain. The chemical cell composition of the strain was similar to the members of Streptomyces genus. LL-diaminopimelic acids were detected in the peptidoglycan. Menaquinones were MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H6). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified lipid were detected as the polar lipids. The predominant cellular fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, iso-C17:0 and C16:0. The dDNA-DNA hybridization values among strain Ptm05T and its closely related Streptomyces type strains were 17.2–18.0%. In addition, the ANIb and ANIm between strain Ptm05T and related Streptomyces type strains were ranged from 75.69 to 76.13% and 85.21 to 85.35%, respectively. Based on phenotypic and genomic evidence, strain Ptm05T (= TBRC 14546T = NBRC 115203T) represents the novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces parmotrematis sp. nov. is proposed.

In this paper, we introduce an adversarial training framework that enhances the robustness against typographical adversarial examples. We evaluate the robustness of sequence labeling models with an adversarial evaluation scheme that includes typographical adversarial examples. We generate two types of adversarial examples without access (black-box) or with full access (white-box) to the target model's parameters. We conducted a series of extensive experiments on three languages (English, Thai, and German) across three sequence labeling tasks. Experiments show that the proposed adversarial training framework provides better resistance against adversarial examples on all tasks. We found that we can further improve the model's robustness on the chunking task by including a triplet loss constraint.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, arts, sociology","Software, Language and Linguistics, Linguistics and Language, Artificial Intelligence"

Although BERT and its variance have led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, one of the problems of BERT is overfitting. When training data is limited, BERT model overemphasizes certain words and ignores the whole context of the sentence. This makes it difficult for the model to make accurate predictions on the test data. In this paper, we propose weighted token-level virtual adversarial training, which combines two-level perturbations: (1) the sentence-level perturbation and (2) the weighted token perturbation to create a more granular perturbation than traditional virtual adversarial training with only sentence-level perturbation. Our approach can help models learn more about the key and important tokens in sentences when trained with virtual adversarial examples. The experiments in the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark showed that our approach can achieve the average score of 79.5%, which outperforms BERTbase model. Our approach can also reduce the overfitting problem especially when datasets are small.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing"
Selective synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural over natural rubber–derived carbon/silica nanocomposites with acid–base bifunctionality,"Yousatit S., Osuga R., Kondo J.N., Yokoi T., Ngamcharussrivichai C.",2022-03-01,"5 hydroxymethyl furfurals, Acid base, Acid-base catalysts, Bi-functional, Carbon silicas, Carbon/silica composites, Mesoporous carbon, Mesoporous carbon/silicum composite, Silica catalyst, Silica nanocomposites, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, Acid–base catalyst, Dehydration, Hydrophobicity, Mesoporous carbon/silica composite","5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform molecule, derived from biomass-based carbohydrates, for the production of renewable fuel additives, liquid hydrocarbon fuels, biopolymers, and specialty chemicals. In this study, a mesoporous carbon/silica (MCS) nanocomposite, as catalyst support, was prepared using a nanocomposite of natural rubber (NR) and hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) as a precursor. To obtain a series of acidic, basic, and bifunctional acid-base catalysts, the MCS surface was modified using post-synthesis methods in which the carbon moieties were decorated with sulfonic acid groups, whereas the silica matrix surface was grafted with 3-aminopropyl groups. The resulting materials exhibited high surface area, large pore volume, and contain some oxygen-containing functional groups. Their acid-base properties were tunable by varying the content of sulfonic acid and aminopropyl groups. The HMF was synthesized by catalytic conversion of fructose and glucose in a biphasic medium. Fructose dehydration catalyzed by sulfonated MCS catalyst (MCS-SO3H) at 150 °C for 2 h yields 56% HMF at 81% conversion. For the glucose system, the Brønsted basic sites facilitated the glucose–fructose isomerization, however, it promoted the formation of undesired humins. The acid/base ratio of bifunctional MCS catalysts (MCS-SO3H-NH2) contributes to the HMF yield and selectivity. The HMF yield of 39.4% was obtained over the MCS-SO3H-NH2 catalyst with an acid/base ratio of 0.10 at 190 °C for 1 h. In both systems, the formation of levulinic acid, a byproduct of HMF hydrolysis, was suppressed due to the hydrophobicity of the MCS catalyst. These developed catalysts are promising for the synthesis of HMF from glucose, at high substrate concentration than those reported in the literature.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"
The autophagy-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strain upregulates KatG to evade starvation-induced autophagic restriction,"Siregar T.A.P., Prombutara P., Kanjanasirirat P., Kunkaew N., Tubsuwan A., Boonmee A., Palaga T., Khumpanied T., Borwornpinyo S., Chaiprasert A., Utaisincharoen P., Ponpuak M.",2022-01-01,"Autophagy, Beijing, Lysosomes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Phagosomes, CRISPR, KatG, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ROS, tuberculosis, tutophagy","Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes several mechanisms to block phagosome-lysosome fusion to evade host cell restriction. However, induction of host cell autophagy by starvation was shown to overcome this block, resulting in enhanced lysosomal delivery to mycobacterial phagosomes and the killing of the M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv. Nevertheless, our previous studies found that strains belonging to the M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype can resist starvation-induced autophagic elimination, though the mycobacterial factors involved remain unclear. In this study, we showed that KatG expression is upregulated in the autophagy-resistant M. tuberculosis Beijing strain (BJN) during autophagy induction by the starvation of host macrophages, while such increase was not observed in the H37Rv. KatG depletion using the CRISPR-dCas9 interference system in the BJN resulted in increased lysosomal delivery to its phagosome and decreased its survival upon autophagy induction by starvation. As KatG functions by catabolizing ROS, we determined the source of ROS contributing to the starvation-induced autophagic elimination of mycobacteria. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we found that Superoxide dismutase 2, which generates mitochondrial ROS but not NADPH oxidase 2, is important for the starvation-induced lysosomal delivery to mycobacterial phagosomes. Taken together, these findings showed that KatG is vital for the BJN to evade starvation-induced autophagic restriction.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Objective: To evaluate post-procedural outcomes and survival between patients undergoing DS and MBTS. Methods: All infants ≤ 60 days of age having CCHD with diminished pulmonary blood flow who underwent palliative procedure either with MBTS or DS at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during January 1st, 2013 and December 31th, 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: 98 patients were included; 34 patients underwent a transcatheter DS and 64 patients underwent MBTS. There was no significant difference in post-procedural outcomes and overall mortality rate between two groups (17.6% in MBTS group and 6.1% in DS group, p = 0.09). Single ventricle morphology was the major risk factor associated with increased mortality compared with biventricular morphology (aHR 3.9, 95% CI 1.49–10.2, p = 0.01). There was similar number of early and pre-repair additional interventions focusing on MBTS/DS patency between two groups. The MBTS group had a greater number of early interventions on PA branch stenosis related to baseline diagnosis. Risk factors associated with additional intervention were pre-existing pulmonary branch stenosis (aHR 2.54, 95% CI 1.3–4.97, p = 0.006) and body weight less than 2.5 kg (aHR 3.33, 95% CI 1.57–7.08, p = 0.003). Having pulmonic valve perforation or balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty to promote antegrade pulmonary blood flow could result in a lower number of additional interventions required before definitive repair.

H2 is mainly produced via the catabolism of stored glycogen under dark anaerobic condition. H2 evolution is catalyzed by O2-sensitive bidirectional hydrogenase. The aim of this study was to improve H2 production by A. halophytica using various kinds of inhibitors. Among all types of inhibitors, simazine efficiently promoted the highest H2 production under dark conditions. High simazine concentration and long-term incubation resulted in a decrease in cell and chlorophyll concentrations. The optimal simazine concentration for H2 production by A. halophytica was 25 µM. Simazine inhibited photosynthetic O2 evolution but promoted dark respiration, resulting in a decrease in O2 level. Hence, the bidirectional hydrogenase activity and H2 production was increased. A. halophytica showed the highest H2 production rate at 58.88 ± 0.22 µmol H2 g−1 dry weight h−1 and H2 accumulation at 356.21 ± 6.04 μmol H2 g−1 dry weight after treatment with 25 µM simazine under dark anaerobic condition for 2 and 24 h, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of simazine for the enhancement of dark fermentative H2 production by A. halophytica.","gas fuels, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

KRAS is a gene in the KIT/RAS signaling pathway, and KRAS mutations have been reported in patients diagnosed with IGCTs. Objectives: To describe the clinicopathologic and molecular features of KRAS mutation and the treatment outcome of children diagnosed with IGCTs. Methods: Patients diagnosed with IGCTs at the Department of Pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and used for molecular study. Mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the KRAS gene were detected using the cobas® KRAS mutation test and pyrosequencing. Results: Eighteen patients were diagnosed with IGCTs (11 males and 7 females): nine with germinomas and nine with non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs). The age range of the patients was 5–14 years (median 10.5 years). Elevated markers were revealed in approximately 25% of the patients. Four patients (two with germinomas and two with NGGCTs) had leptomeningeal involvement. All patients underwent tumor biopsy and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was administered in 16 patients, and craniospinal radiation was administered only in patients with leptomeningeal metastasis. With a median follow-up of 26 months, overall survival was 88.9% in the patients with germinomas and 37% in the patients with NGGCTs. Mutation of the KRAS gene was detected using pyrosequencing in one patient. The mutation located at codon 61, with frequency 38.3% units, nucleotide substitution CAA > CTA, and amino acid substitution, was Q61L. The patient carrying the mutant gene was diagnosed with germinoma with cerebrospinal fluid metastasis and eventually died from treatment-related toxicity. Conclusion: Our study revealed the treatment outcomes of IGCTs in Thai children. The metastatic germinoma patient with KRAS codon 61 mutation had a poor outcome, supporting that Q61L has a clinical correlation with IGCTs.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

However, community pharmacists cannot report ADRs if patients do not report them. Objective: To investigate factors that can influence patients’ intention to report ADRs to community pharmacists and to develop a structural model of influencing factors to report ADRs from patients. Method: Self-administered questionnaire via a Google form was used. The study samples were people living in all regions of Thailand. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the influencing factors to intention to report ADRs to community pharmacists. Results: A total of 2774 responses were collected. All Pearson correlations among variables were statistically significant. The correlation between intention to report ADR and instrumental attitude was highest. Perceived behavior control had the lowest correlation with intention to report ADRs. The structural equation model was an adequate fit for the data. Intention to report ADRs to community pharmacists was significantly influenced by instrumental attitude, injunctive norm, descriptive norm and self-efficacy. Conclusion: Positive attitude of ADR reporting, self-efficacy and their reference person such as physicians, community pharmacists, their families and friends could encourage and motivate their intention to report ADRs to community pharmacists.","Health Professions, pharmacology","Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Science"

This letter proposes the use of wave variables which facilitate the computation of suitable reference motion or force through the wave planner framework. The notion is to specify the supplied power, via input wave, instead of desired motion or force. Input wave will be resolved into motion and force according to the port impedance. The method ensures safe manipulation when applying to passive control systems. Experimental results show advantages of using this wave planner with the impedance and force controllers.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence"

We aimed to discover time trends for the epidemiology, economic burden, and mortality of ACLF in Thailand. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cohort study which involved all hospitalized patients with cirrhosis in Thailand during the period between 2009 and 2013, with data from the National Health Security Office. ACLF was defined by two or more extrahepatic organ failures in patients with cirrhosis. Primary outcomes were trends in hospitalizations, hospital costs, together with inpatient mortality. Results: The number of ACLF hospitalizations in Thailand doubled between 3185 in 2009 and 7666 in 2013. The average cost of each ACLF hospitalization was 3.5-fold higher than for cirrhosis ($ 1893 versus $ 519). The hospital is paid using a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system that is only 15% of the average treatment costs ($ 286 from $ 1893). The in-hospital fatality rate was 51% for ACLF while the additional fatality rate was 85% up to 1 year. The ACLF organ failure trends indicated sepsis with septic shock and renal failure as the majority proportion. Age, the number and types of organ failure and male sex were predictors of ACLF death. Conclusions and relevance: Cirrhosis and ACLF both represent substantial and increasing health and economic burdens for Thailand.

H. schistosus can be considered as the deadliest sea snake commonly found in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Their envenomation causes muscular paralysis and rhabdomyolysis. To develop effective treatment for this snakebite, it is necessary to understand the detailed venom composition. In this study, multiple mass spectrometry-based approaches were employed. Bottom-up proteomics revealed that tryptic digestion in-solution provided a higher number of toxin proteins identified and a larger sequence coverage, compared to in-gel digestion. In addition, a venom gland transcriptome-derived database was constructed and used as a reference, which 43 known and novel toxin proteins were identified using this database and the UniProtKB. Three-finger toxin and phospholipase A2 were shown to be top two most abundant protein families. Minor compositions included other toxin families and a number of non-toxin proteins. Moreover, a hybrid de novo sequencing was performed to enhance identification of the small proteins/peptides. Using non-digested samples, there were 46 predicted toxin peptides. The finding from this study could lead to a better understanding in pathological effects of the snakebite and the future development of effective antivenoms. Significance: This study provides a better understanding of the venom proteome composition of the beaked sea snake (H. schistosus) found in the Gulf of Thailand, using a combination of different sample preparation techniques, Serpentes protein database searching, transcriptome-derived protein database searching, and a hybrid de novo peptide sequencing strategy.

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 33 patients with newly diagnosed NPC who underwent magnetic resonance imaging with the propeller DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map before and at 5 weeks after chemoradiation. The following ADC values of the primary tumor were calculated: pre-treatment ADC (pre-ADC), pre-treatment ADC ratio (pre-ADC ratio), ADC change (▵ADC), ADC change ratio (▵ADC ratio), and percentage of ADC change (▵%ADC). The correlations between these parameters and treatment outcomes were explored, and the patients were classified as good responders (complete response) and poor responders (stable disease, partial response, or progressive disease) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Results: The ▵ADC, ▵ADC ratio, and ▵%ADC were significantly lower in the poor-responder group (n = 12) than in the good-responder group (n = 21; p = 0.001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.004, respectively).

For the first time, the effect of the presence of three types of complexing agents such as phenanthroline (Phen), crown ethers (12C4, 15C5, 18C6), and ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) on the extraction efficiency of zinc ions was studied. In addition, the electroendosmosis (EEO) flow as an unwanted actuator was monitored in the presence and absence of complexing agents. By applying 50 V electrical potential across the membrane, the positive charged Zn2+ ions were migrated from a donor phase (pH 5.0) through the agarose gel membrane (pH 5.0, containing a complexing agent) into the acceptor phase (pH 3.0). The obtained results showed that the highest extraction recoveries were obtained when crown ethers, especially 1% (w/v) 18C6 was added to the gel membrane. In addition, EEO flow was decreased in the presence of all complexing agents (except EDTA), probably due to the increase in electrical resistance.

Application of waste aluminum cans based nano alumina as reinforcing filler in natural rubber composites,"Roy K., Sikdar D., Pongwisuthiruchte A., Debnath S.C., Potiyaraj P.",2022-07-01,"Aluminum can, Material-based, Nano-alumina, Natural rubber composites, Production cost, Reinforcing fillers, Rubber composite, Simple++, Waste aluminum, Waste aluminum can, Filler, Mechanical properties, Recycling, Rubber, Waste aluminum cans","The application of waste materials based fillers is unique way to achieve rubber composites, which reduces the amount of waste in the environment and the final production cost of the rubber products. In the present work, a simple and facile strategy was proposed to use waste aluminum cans based nano alumina (WACNA) as reinforcing filler for the development of natural rubber (NR) composites with balanced compact performances. The synthesized WACNA was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) experiments. NR composite with 2 phr WACNA was able to achieve considerably higher torque difference, hardness and tensile strength than unfilled NR composite. Also, the addition of WACNA successfully enhances the thermal stability and thermal oxidative aging resistance of NR composites. It is expected that the findings will offer an effective way for manufacturing a new generation NR composites competent for different tyre and non-tyre applications in future.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"
Management of intravascular thrombus in cases of bilateral Wilms tumor or horseshoe kidney,"Sutthatarn P., Gomez Quevedo O., Gleason J., Davidoff A.M., Murphy A.J.",2022-09-01,"Child, Fused Kidney, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms, Nephrectomy, Retrospective Studies, Thrombosis, Treatment Outcome, Wilms Tumor, Bilateral Wilms tumor, Horseshoe kidney, Intracaval tumor thrombus, Nephron-sparing surgery, Venous thrombectomy","Purpose: To describe the oncologic and surgical management of bilateral Wilms tumor or Wilms tumor arising in a horseshoe kidney with intravenous tumor thrombus to help pediatric surgeons negotiate this rare and difficult anatomic circumstance. Methods: A single-institution, retrospective medical record review identified 4 cases of bilateral WT and one case of WT arising in a horseshoe kidney with intravenous tumor thrombus between 2009 and 2021. The presentation, imaging, chemotherapy regimen, intraoperative approach, and surgical and oncologic outcomes were reviewed for each of these patients. Results: All patients received a total of 12 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In two patients, a staged approach to the bilateral tumors was undertaken with the first side being operated on after six weeks of therapy and the other side undergoing surgery after an additional six weeks of therapy. Of five patients, four underwent nephron-sparing surgery of all tumors and one underwent unilateral radical nephroureterectomy with contralateral nephron-sparing surgery. Tumor thrombectomy was performed in four of five cases; one patient demonstrated a complete response of the intravenous tumor thrombus to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and did not require thrombectomy. Three patients received adjuvant flank radiotherapy. Three patients developed medically managed stage II or III chronic kidney disease and no patient required renal replacement therapy or kidney transplant to date. Conclusion: Nephron-sparing surgery is feasible and safe to perform in selected cases of bilateral Wilms tumor with intravascular thrombus by utilizing three-drug neoadjuvant chemotherapy, staged approaches to each kidney when appropriate, and detailed preoperative and/or intraoperative mapping of renal venous anatomy. Successful nephron-sparing surgery with tumor thrombectomy is dependent on a branched renal venous system or the presence of accessory renal veins.

This work presents the possibility of using commercial surfactants to reduce wall-growth biofilm in PBRs. Results confirm that sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 0.0082 mM can successfully control wall-growth biofilm in the cultivation of C. humicola more than CTAB and Triton X-100. The addition of SDS into 2-L PBRs, built from either acrylic or glass, results in 68–158 % and 28–43 % increases in algal biomass concentrations compared to those without SDS addition. PBRs applying with SDS at the start of the cultivation can be operated for 23 days without stopping aeration to remove biofilm. Both SDS and floating plastic media were effective in algal biofilm control when applying in 60-L PBRs. The addition of SDS is seen to offer a practical solution to reduce algal biofilm on both glass and acrylic surfaces and promote higher biomass concentration during the cultivation.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, environmental, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Biomedical Engineering"

However, due to its peppery taste, strong odor, and rapid oxidative deterioration, its application in food formulations has been limited. Encapsulation techniques with hydrocolloids combined with other nutritive wall materials may overcome these problems and provide more health benefits for consumers. For these reasons, cold-pressed black cumin seed oil was microencapsulated by spray drying in four different microcapsule models, including gum arabic alone (GA) and in combination at a 50:50 ratio with maltodextrin (GM), inulin (GI), or whey protein (GW). The microencapsulation efficiency of GA presented the highest yield of up to 88%. Replacing 50% of the gum arabic with whey protein (GW) reduced the microencapsulation efficiency from 88 to 75% while GI and GM were 86.12 and 83.51, respectively. The wettability and solubility of the microencapsulated powders prepared (GI, GM, and GW) were superior to those of the microcapsules prepared by gum arabic alone. Under SEM, the GA and GM powders collapsed at the surface, while the GI and GW powders were spherical and smooth. The highest thymoquinone content was found in the GI powder. There were no differences (P˃0.05) in the thymoquinone content observed among all powders.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Among natural CDs, γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) has the highest water solubility, largest cavity size, and most favorable toxicological profile. γCD can form inclusion complexes with a wide variety of drugs. In aqueous solution, γCD tends to self-assemble to form aggregates, leading to formation of both nano- and microparticles. The self-assembled γCD molecules can increase the solubility and enhance drug permeability through biological membranes, consequently improving drug bioavailability. This promising drug delivery platform is well tolerated, and it has low ocular toxicity. Clinical studies have shown that this nanocarrier can enhance topical drug delivery to both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye. The present article reviews the physicochemical properties of γCD and its derivatives, their toxicological profiles, the γCD solubilization of drugs, and methods for enhancing drug/γCD complexes and their aggregates.

Methods: Fourteen Rugby Sevens players were randomly allocated into hypoxic (RSH, FIO2 = 14.5%, n = 7) or normoxic (RSN, FIO2 = 20.9%, n = 7) groups. Both groups underwent RS training consisting of 3 sets of 6-s × 10 sprints at 140% of velocity at peak oxygen uptake (vVO 2peak ) on a motorized treadmill, 3 days/week for 6 weeks in addition to usual training. Hematological variables, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations were measured. Aerobic performance, RSA, and muscle oxygenation during the running-based anaerobic sprint (RAS) test were analyzed. Results: RSH caused no changes in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit but significant improvements in VO 2peak (7.5%, p = 0.03, ES = 1.07), time to exhaustion (17.6%, p = 0.05, ES = 0.92), and fatigue index (FI, − 12.3%, p = 0.01, ES = 1.39) during the RSA test compared to baseline but not RSN. While ∆deoxygenated hemoglobin was significantly increased both after RSH and RSN (p < 0.05), ∆tissue saturation index (− 56.1%, p = 0.01, ES = 1.35) and ∆oxygenated hemoglobin (− 54.7%, p = 0.04, ES = 0.97) were significantly decreased after RSH.

However, waning immunity and breakthrough infections have been observed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the heterologous booster might improve the protection against the delta and omicron variants. Methods: A total of 224 individuals who completed the 2-dose CoronaVac for 6 months were included. We studied reactogenicity and immunogenicity after a heterologous booster with the inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), the viral vector vaccine (AZD1222), and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine (both BNT162B2 and mRNA-1273). We also determined immunogenicity at 3- and 6-month boosting intervals. Results: The solicited adverse events were mild to moderate and well tolerated. Total receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig), anti-RBD IgG, focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) against delta and omicron variants, and T-cell response were highest in the mRNA-1273 group followed by the BNT162b2, AZD1222, and BBIBP groups, respectively. We also witnessed a higher total Ig anti-RBD in the long-interval than in the short-interval group. Conclusions: All 4 booster vaccines significantly increased binding and neutralizing antibodies in individuals immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac.

However, the accuracy of such models remains a challenge, especially in the orbital area. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of four different CBCT imaging positions on the accuracy of the resulting 3D models in the orbital area. Methods: An anthropomorphic head phantom was manufactured by submerging a dry human skull in silicon to mimic the soft tissue attenuation and scattering properties of the human head. The phantom was scanned on a ProMax 3D MAX CBCT scanner using 90 and 120 kV for four different field of view positions: standard; elevated; backwards tilted; and forward tilted. All CBCT images were subsequently converted into 3D models and geometrically compared with a “gold-standard” optical scan of the dry skull. Results: Mean absolute deviations of the 3D models ranged between 0.15 ± 0.11 mm and 0.56 ± 0.28 mm. The elevated imaging position in combination with 120 kV tube voltage resulted in an improved representation of the orbital walls in the resulting 3D model without compromising the accuracy. Conclusions: Head positioning during CBCT imaging can influence the accuracy of the resulting 3D model. The accuracy of such models may be improved by positioning the region of interest (e.g. the orbital area) in the focal plane (Figure 2a) of the CBCT X-ray beam.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Dentistry (all)"

Moreover, the cyanobacteria can be easily engineered to synthesis a plenty of fuel molecules from CO2. To obtain the fuel molecule from cyanobacteria, various techniques were invented in which the metabolic engineering is found to be a prerequisite to develop an economically feasible process. The expression of indigenous or heterologous pathways plays an important role in developing successful production process. In addition, the engineering of photosynthetic apparatus, destruction of competitive pathways and improvement of tolerance were also proven to improve the product specific synthesis. Although various metabolic engineering approaches have been developed, there are certain obstacles when it comes to implementation for the production.

While often considered to be more useful for shallow evolutionary scales, mt genomes have been increasingly shown also to contain valuable phylogenetic information about deep relationships. Further, mt genome organization provides another important source of phylogenetic information and gene reorganizations which are known to be relatively frequent within the insect order Hymenoptera. Here we used a dense taxon sampling comprising 148 mt genomes (132 newly generated) collectively representing members of most of the currently recognised subfamilies of the parasitoid wasp family Braconidae, which is one of the largest radiations of hymenopterans. We employed this data to investigate the evolutionary relationships within the family and to assess the phylogenetic informativeness of previously known and newly discovered mt gene rearrangements. Results: Most subfamilial relationships and their composition obtained were similar to those recovered in a previous phylogenomic study, such as the restoration of Trachypetinae and the recognition of Apozyginae and Proteropinae as valid braconid subfamilies. We confirmed and detected phylogenetic signal in previously known as well as novel mt gene rearrangements, including mt rearrangements within the cyclostome subfamilies Doryctinae and Rogadinae. Conclusions: Our results showed that both the mt genome DNA sequence data and gene organization contain valuable phylogenetic signal to elucidate the evolution within Braconidae at different taxonomic levels. This study serves as a basis for further investigation of mt gene rearrangements at different taxonomic scales within the family.","evolution and speciation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Environmental Science (all)"

We also expatiate on an alternative approach in describing the nature of Tc under pressures, i.e. the bandwidth function as an approximation of the spectral function (α2F) for Sc0.5Y0.5H6. Being a special case, the bandwidth function is derived from an analytic solution for the α2F function given constraints arising from the characteristics of the function itself.

These criteria appear to be met by hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). PEMFCs have attracted tremendous attention on account of their excellent performance with tunable operability and good portability. Nonetheless, their practical applications are hugely influenced by the scarcity and high cost of platinum (Pt) used as electrocatalysts at both cathode and anode. Pt is also susceptible to easy catalyst poisoning. Herein, this paper reviews the progress of the research regarding the development of electrocatalysts practically used in hydrogen PEMFCs, where the corner-stone reactions are cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). To reduce the costs of PEMFCs, lessening or eliminating the use of Pt is of prime importance. For current and forthcoming laboratory/large-scale PEMFCs, there is much interest in developing substitute catalysts based on cheaper materials. As such are non-platinum (non-Pt), non-platinum group metals (non-PGMs), metal oxides, and non-metal electrocatalysts. Hence, high-performance, state-of-the-art, and novel structured electrocatalysts as replacements for Pt are needed.","corrosion, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, the limited conversion and yield are obtained in the conventional methods due to low boiling point of ethanol that thus requires conducting the reaction at low temperature. This work demonstrates high yield of FAEEs from soybean, rice bran and palm oil with ethanol by performing the transesterification at high temperatures of 150-200°C by using CaO catalyst in a high pressure reactor. The results demonstrate the complete reaction for all vegetable oils with low ethanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1 and 1 wt.% CaO catalyst. Higher reaction temperature results in faster reaction while keeping high conversion of ≥ 99.0%. The unsaturated components in FAEE products are consistent with their original fatty acid chain. Moreover, the high conversion can be achieved even in the reaction conducted with low ethanol to oil molar ratio of 4.5:1 and 0.5 wt.% CaO catalyst at 180 °C in the palm oil transesterification. The catalyst can be reused for at least 3 times with the conversion higher than 94.0%.

Random-effect models and meta-regressions were used to generate pooled estimates and assess heterogeneity. Results: Four hundred and seven studies with 1,302,167 participants were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of HCV infection was 21%. The highest prevalence was observed in Africa (28%) and low-income countries (48.5%). A significant prevalence decline was observed following the publication year and was also inversely related to GDP and total population of each country. Factors associated with HCV positivity included younger age, longer dialysis duration, more blood transfusions, and dialyzer reuse. The pooled unadjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CI 1.03–1.22), and the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12–1.30) in HCV-infected compared to non-HCV infected patients.

The coated films were evaluated for viral Phi-X 174 inactivation and tested with fluorescence and UV-C light illumination, then log (N/N0) versus t plots (N = [virus] in plaque-forming units [PFUs]/mL) were obtained. The presence of nanosilica in PET showed a high adsorption ability in both MB and Phi-X 174, whereas the best performances with fluorescent light were obtained from PET-1.0Si-P25 and PET-P25-1.0Si-SiO2 equally. A 0.2-log virus reduction was obtained after 3 h at a rate of 4×106 PFU.mL-1.gcat-1.min-1. Additionally, the use of this film for preventing transmission by direct contact with surfaces and via indoor air was considered. Using UV light, the PET-1.0Si-P25 and PET-1.0Si-P25-SiO2 samples produced a 2.5-log inactivation after 6.5 min at a rate of 9.6×106 and 8.9×106 PFU.mL-1.gcat-1.min-1, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology"

By investigating their vibrational and electronic properties, the three carbides are dynamically stable and are metallic. We further demonstrate, by adopting phonon mediated superconductivity based on the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory, that cubic TaC, face-centered orthorhombic TaC0.833, and hexagonal Ta2C superconduct, whose transition temperatures are estimated by the Allen–Dynes equation to be 10.0 K, 6.8 K, and 1.4 K, respectively.

The circadian clock machinery is also critically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neurodevelopmental processes. Circadian disruption during embryonic development can impair crucial phases of neurodevelopment. This can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring. Increasing evidence from studies showing abnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and epigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian pathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in ASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through which the circadian pathways influence the risk and progression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Well-recognized mechanistic pathways in ASD include altered immune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways. Notably, all these pathways are under the control of the circadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian clock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein, we highlight the possible mechanisms through which aberrations in the circadian clock might affect immune-inflammatory, nitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and neurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiological sequelae leading to ASD.",neuroscience,Neuroscience (all)

A pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed using the aqueous titration method. The suitable ratio of surfactant mixture (Smix):oil mixture (Omix):water was chosen from the microemulsion region of the diagram. FA was loaded into the selected ratio to prepare FA microemulsion. Exvivo skin permeation study of the FA microemulsion with fractional laser assistance was performed to determine a proper ablative depth. A pilot clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of FA microemulsion and FA microemulsion combination with lasering at the optimum ablation depth. The selected microemulsion base contained (in wt%) 77% water, 20% Smix (Tween 80:ethanol, 2:1), 3% Omix (10% benzyl benzoate and 1% benzyl alcohol in bergamot oil), and 0.2% sodium carboxymethylcellulose. FA was loaded into this base at a concentration of 0.1%. The skin lasered at an ablation depth of 50 µm was conducted in the pilot clinical study. Scalp psoriasis responded well to the FA microemulsion. Psoriasis scalp severity index (PSSI) scores indicated that the FA microemulsion plus laser treatment provides higher efficacy than the FA microemulsion alone without any topical and systemic side effects. The efficacy of the treatments could be maintained for at least 1 week after treatment discontinuation. FA microemulsion was properly formulated and evaluated. The microemulsion demonstrating the greatest benefits was used in combination with ablative fractional lasering to treat scalp psoriasis.

It was performed in a fixedbed microreactor under continuous flow of vaporized ethanol mixed with N2. The MgAlO catalyst had high total basic sites and high total acid sites that were crucial for ethanol Guerbet reaction. The MgAlO catalyst showed the highest butanol selectivity at 300℃ under WHSV = 3.10 h–1 and nitrogen flow rate = 3,600 mL/h, and the highest butanol yield at 400℃ under WHSV = 3.10 h–1 and nitrogen flow rate = 900 mL/h. It can be summarized that in order to enhance the butanol yield, the low WHSV is preferred to increase the contact time of ethanol and catalyst under moderate temperature.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

While Kubernetes is gaining popularity in orchestrating containers, many organizations with Virtual Machine (VM) based legacy applications still struggle to containerize. Rehost strategy seems to be a faster method. On Kubernetes, KubeVirt can be used to manage rehosted VM. However, there is a huge difference between the long-term use of the VMs and containers. For example, container IP addresses change over time is problematic for VMs that need a static IP. In addition, some VM-based applications may require multiple network interfaces or a specific domain name for service discovery. These issues prevent some VMs from functioning properly after the migration to KubeVirt. We developed an operator framework to solve network problems that arise in the application layer such as DNS queries. In addition, we provide a guideline on how to use open-source projects like the Multus Container Network Interface, NMState to enable the migration of VMs with applications related to network function properly. Our operator and guideline allow most VMs to function properly with few modifications (to none) after migrating to KubeVirt. This facilitated the adoption of Kubernetes in more organizations.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems and Management, Control and Optimization"

A total of 408 Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred gilts were included in the experiment. Gilts at 8 months of age were randomly allocated into three groups: control AI (n = 192), treatment 1–TAI (n = 117) and treatment 2–FTAI (n = 99). Gilts in the control AI group were inseminated 2–3 times during standing oestrus at 0, 12 and 24 h after the onset of oestrus. Gilts in the treatment 1–TAI group were orally administered 20 mg per day of altrenogest for 18 days and then inseminated 2–3 times during standing oestrus by conventional AI. Gilts in the treatment 2–FTAI group were synchronized like gilts in treatment 1–TAI group but then GnRH (10 μg of buserelin) was administered 120 h after the end of altrenogest treatment and fixed time artificial inseminated twice at 24 and 32 h after GnRH irrespective of the presence of oestrus or not. Conception rate of gilts in treatment 2–FTAI (87.9%) was similar to the treatment 1–TAI (94.9%) and control AI (83.3%) (P > 0.05). Conception rate in treatment 1–TAI (94.9%) was higher compared to control AI group (83.3%, P = 0.040). Farrowing rate of gilts in treatment 2–FTAI (83.8%) was similar to treatment 1–TAI (89.7%) and control AI (76.0%) (P > 0.05). Farrowing rate of treatment 1–TAI (89.7%) was higher than control AI gilts (76.0%, P = 0.033). In treatment 2–FTAI, the conception and farrowing rate of the nine gilts that were inseminated even if they were not detected in oestrus (all during warm season) was 44.4% and 44.4%, respectively. Regular return to oestrus was similar between groups (9.4%, 0.9% and 4.1% for control AI, treatment 1–TAI and treatment 2–FTAI, respectively, P > 0.05). The total number of piglets born per litter in treatment 1–TAI group was higher than control AI (13.1 ± 0.2 versus 11.6 ± 0.2, respectively, P < 0.001) and treatment 2–FTAI groups (12.2 ± 0.3, P = 0.019). The number of piglets born alive was higher in treatment 1–TAI (12.1 ± 0.3) compared to treatment 2–FTAI (11.3 ± 0.2) and control AI group (11.2 ± 0.3). The percentage of stillbirth and mummified foetus were not different between groups (P > 0.05). The present study indicated that fixed-time AI in gilts can be successfully performed by administration of altrenogest for 18 days, GnRH at 120 h after altrenogest withdrawal and then double fixed-time AI at 24 and 32 h after the administration of GnRH. Fertility metrics such as conception rate, farrowing rate and litter performances using this method were similar to gilts inseminated at oestrus with conventional AI.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

To move toward more resilient system configurations requires understanding the processes that shape farmers' adaptation amidst complex institutional contexts. Social networks are an important part of collective action for supporting adaptive capacity and there are continuing calls to strengthen network connectivity for agricultural governance under the impacts of climate change. Through a survey of 176 farmers in northern Thailand, we explore the extent to which the characteristics of information shared in a catchment advice network are associated with adaptations. Statistical analyses reveal the perceived efficacy of communications as well as farmers' relative closeness in the advice network to be positively associated with adaptation to drought. We identify a capacity for local actors to bridge information bottlenecks in the network and opportunities for institutions to enhance their dissemination of information to reach less networked farmers. We find that not all adaptations are perceived as effective against future drought and infer opportunities to support engagement with extension services, encourage the sharing of local knowledge and experience and devise policy and interventions to strengthen advice networks for more resilient agricultural systems.

Therefore, this study focused on the tourism industry in Japan, used Google Earth Engine to calculate the changes in five atmospheric substances before and during the government’s Go To Travel Campaign, which was implemented to support domestic travel, and analyzed the correlations with statistical data such as the number of travelers, use of buses, and taxis. As a result, a series of connected behaviors clarified the fact that socioeconomic activities affected by the government’s Go To Travel Campaign surfaced with the changes in the atmospheric substances. To further understand the relationship between interventions to promote tourism and air qual-ity, additional datasets and approaches are needed, in-cluding data on the operation status of facilities and the behavioral characteristics of Japanese travelers.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

There are no data demonstrating the anatomic mechanism of SeTB. This cadaver study aimed to evaluate the spread of an injectate after a simulated ultrasound-guided (USG) SeTB. Methods USG SeTB (n=7) was performed on both sides of the neck in four adult human cadavers with 25 mL of 0.1% methylene blue dye. Anatomic dissection was performed to document staining (deep, faint, and no stain) of the various elements of the brachial plexus from the level of the roots to the cords, including the phrenic, dorsal scapular, and long thoracic nerves. Only structures that were deeply stained were defined as being affected by the SeTB. Results All the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus, as well as the ventral rami of C5-C7 and suprascapular nerve, were deeply stained in all (100%) the simulated injections. The ventral rami of C8 and T1 (86%), dorsal scapular and long thoracic nerve (71%), and the phrenic nerve (57%) were also deeply stained in a substantial number of the injections. Conclusion This cadaver study demonstrates that an USG SeTB consistently affects all the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus, as well as the suprascapular nerve. This study also establishes that SeTB may not be phrenic nerve sparing. Future research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SeTB as an all-purpose brachial plexus block technique for upper extremity surgery is warranted.

In order to enhance their electromechanical properties, the modified P(VDF-HFP) with various conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) and carbon black (CB) is considerably required. In this work, the P(VDF-HFP) as matrix was doped with different loading of PPy/CB (< 1 wt%) and the composites films were obtained by using solution casting method. The influence of filler content on the dielectric properties and the conductivity of these thin films was investigated by using LCR meter. The maximum dielectric constant of the P(VDF-HFP)/PPy-CB was 2 times larger than the pure P(VDF-HFP) without conductive fillers. At low frequency, the both dielectric loss and conductivity were found to be slightly increased as consequence of the conducting polymers, but the conductive phase has not been achieved yet. In addition, a complete set of electromechanical properties were systemically explored using the result of strain displacement under the low electric field (< 5 MV/m). During the applied electric field, the average voltage peak-to-peak was attributed to the strain yield of approximately 0.08% at 2 MV/m. These observations indicate that the synergistic effect of conductive fillers induce their electric polarization and it can be considered as one of the promising candidates for actuator applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Control and Systems Engineering, Ceramics and Composites, Condensed Matter Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The total Lagrangian description is considered in the derivation of finite element equations. Relationships between the cross-sectional rotation and displacements of the beam axis are derived, and consequently, the kinematics of the element are entirely described by the displacements of the beam axis. These relationships underlie the construction of field-consistent interpolations. Regarding geometric descriptions, the deformed configuration of an element is represented by a rational cubic Bézier curve. For better geometric representations of complex deformed configurations, some of the weights are treated as discrete unknowns. Several benchmark numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed beam element. The merits of considering weights as discrete unknowns are verified through comparisons between elements having varying weights and stationary weights. Furthermore, the proposed beam element is found to be naturally free from membrane locking, and thus, no additional efforts are required to handle the locking issues.","numerical methods, fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

To complement and enhance existing approaches to open-source quality assessment, this paper proposes a new open-source software quality model called OSS-AQM that aims at automating the measurement of open-source software quality. The OSS-AQM provides a set of quality metrics and an automation tool that can retrieve information about the open-source software from GitHub, source code, SonarQube, and Stack Exchange, and quantitatively determine the overall quality of the open-source software.

Materials and methods: A total of 36 human mandibular premolars were instrumented and obturated with gutta-percha and iRoot SP using the single-cone technique. Retreatment was performed with ProTaper Universal retreatment files. The samples were randomly divided into the following supplementary cleaning protocols: conventional syringe irrigation (CSI), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), and XP-endo Finisher R (XPR). The samples underwent micro-CT scanning to quantify the amount of residual filling materials after retreatment and after performing the cleaning protocols. The volume of filling material removal was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni and Games–Howell tests (P < 0.05). Results: There were significant differences in the amount of root canal filling material removal in every comparison group (P < 0.05). The XPR removed significantly more residual filling materials (P < 0.01) followed by PUI and CSI (P < 0.05). Similar efficacy was found in the total root canal and all root thirds. Conclusions: The additional use of XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation effectively removed the bioceramic-obturated root filling materials from the oval-shaped canals. However, none of the techniques completely removed the filling materials. Clinical relevance: The XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation exhibited greater efficacy compared with syringe irrigation in the reduction of residual filling materials after retreatment in root-filled teeth with a bioceramic sealer.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Accel-erated membrane ageing was induced by use of high concentrations of tannic acid and iron oxide (Fe2O3 ) particles in the feed water; these conditions were kept with different membrane soaking times to observe temporal effects. It was found that tannic acid molecules adsorb onto the membrane surface that results in changes in surface characteristics, particularly surface functional groups that are responsible for enhancing membrane’s hydrophilicity. Experimental results demonstrate that NaOH had a stronger effect on the tensile strength and surface chemistry of the fouled MF and UF membranes than citric acid. Prediction of lifetime by an exponential (decay) model confirmed that the UF membrane cleaned with NaOH would be aged within about 1.8 years and the MF membrane after about 5 years, at cleaning every 15 days, downtime 2 h per cleaning, when a 10% tensile strength decrease against the original membrane is allowed.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

Due to the high human-animal interface, the monitoring of canine influenza in dogs and the study of the transmission and pathogenicity of canine influenza in animals are important. Methods: Eight-week-old beagle dogs (Canis lupus familaris) (n = 13) were used for the intraspecies transmission model. The dogs were inoculated intranasally with 1 ml of 106 EID50 per ml of canine H3N2 influenza virus (A/canine/Thailand/CU-DC5299/2012) (CIV-H3N2). In addition, 4-week-old guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) (n = 20) were used for the interspecies transmission model. The guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with 300 µl of 106 EID50 per ml of CIV-H3N2. Results: For the Thai CIV-H3N2 challenged in the dog model, the incoculated and direct contact dogs developed respiratory signs at 2 dpi. The dogs shed the virus in the respiratory tract at 1 dpi and developed an H3-specific antibody against the virus at 10 dpi. Lung congestion and histopathological changes in the lung were observed. For the Thai CIV-H3N2 challenge in the guinea pig model, the incoculated, direct contact and aerosol-exposed guinea pigs developed fever at 1–2 dpi. The guinea pigs shed virus in the respiratory tract at 2 dpi and developed an H3-specific antibody against the virus at 7 dpi. Mild histopathological changes in the lung were observed. Conclusion: The result of this study demonstrated evidence of intraspecies and interspecies transmission of CIV-H3N2 in a mammalian model.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Methods: The present study focuses on evaluating the performance of the methylation status of two genes (CGB3 and NOP56) using a total of 200 PAP samples, which were divided into the “determined” group, with 78 samples based on cytology, and the “undetermined” group (ASC US), with 122 samples. The promoter methylation status of the CGB3 and NOP56 genes was detected for the 200 PAP samples using methylation specific PCR (MSP). The diagnostic abilities of the CGB3 and NOP56 genes in PAP samples were measured, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using Python programming language. Results: Based on the validation of CGB3 and NOP56 methylation in the 200 PAP samples, both genes exhibited higher methylation percentages in abnormal samples compared with normal samples. In addition, on the basis of diagnostic performance analysis, the CGB3 gene exhibited the highest sensitivity and specificity in both histology based ASC US and cytology based ‘determined’ PAP samples, with significant diagnostic abilities [area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.83 and 0.74, respectively, where AUC ≥0.5 was determined to be significant] to distinguish between the “normal” and “abnormal” samples. Conclusion: The findings of the present study will contribute toward identifying a DNA methylation marker for the early detection of abnormal samples before they reach the initial stages of cervical cancer, and should prove to be helpful for clinicians in terms of diagnosing patients whose cells are ASC US.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Plasmodium falciparum 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin-pyrophosphokinase (Pf HPPK) has been advanced as a promising target, as being part of the parasite essential folate biosynthesis pathway while having no orthologue in the human genome. However, no drug discovery efforts have been reported on this enzyme. In this study, we conducted a three-step screening of our in-house antifolate library against Pf HPPK using a newly designed Pf HPPK-GFP protein construct. Combining virtual screening, differential scanning fluorimetry and enzymatic assay, we identified 14 compounds active against Pf HPPK. Compounds’ binding modes were investigated by molecular docking, suggesting competitive binding with the HMDP substrate. Cytotoxicity and in vitro ADME properties of hit compounds were also assessed, showing good metabolic stability and low toxicity. The most active compounds displayed low micromolar IC50 against drug-resistant parasites. The reported hit compounds constitute a good starting point for inhibitor development against Pf HPPK, as an alternative approach to tackle the malaria parasite.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Fluoxetine is a thoroughly safety-tested drug that may target the sigma-1 receptor (σ1-R). Research design and methods: Using the human leukemic cell line, Jurkat, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine on cell survival using XTT and trypan blue staining. Apoptosis was measured using AnnexinV/PI staining and western blot analysis of caspase cleavage. IL-2 secretion of Jurkat cells in response to PHA/PMA was measured using ELISA, and the expression of AKT/pAKT and the σ1-R were measured using western blotting. Results: Fluoxetine-induced apoptosis and G-2 cell cycle arrest. Fluoxetine reduced IL-2 secretion dose-dependently and could be further potentiated by σ1-R antagonist BD1047 (P < 0.05). Fluoxetine inhibited pAKT six hours post-treatment (P < 0.05). The expression of the σ1-R showed a significant increase between 12 to 48 hours in Jurkat cells (P < 0.05). At the same time, there was a substantial increase in autophagy. Conclusions: Fluoxetine may have the potential for acute leukemia treatment. Co-treatment with a σ1-R antagonist increases fluoxetine-induced apoptosis, possibly targeting AKT phosphorylation and autophagy activation.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry"

Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) from these subjects potentially causes haemolysis in recipients. Methods: RBC units from the National Blood Centre were sampled to assess G-6-PD levels using spectrophotometry. Patients with pure underproduction anaemia requiring blood transfusion were randomised to receive G-6-PD-deficient versus normal ABO-matched RBCs. Pre- and 48-h post-transfusion indirect bilirubin, haemoglobin, haematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and haptoglobin were measured. Results: From April 2020 to March 2021, 374 RBC units were tested for G-6-PD, and that 25 were found to be G-6-PD deficient. Twelve units of G-6-PD-deficient RBCs and 14 units of normal RBCs were given to patients who met the inclusion criteria. The median (interquartile range) increases of indirect bilirubin in G-6-PD-deficient (N = 11) versus normal RBCs (N = 13) were + 0.12 (0.27) versus + 0.01 (1.3) mg/dl, p = 0.030), respectively.

They consisted of five strains (DMKU-MRY16T, DMKU-SK18, DMKU-SK25, DMKU-SK30 and DMKU-SK32) obtained from five different mushrooms, and two strains (ST-224 and 11-14.2) derived from insect frass and soil, respectively. The pairwise sequence analysis indicated that all seven strains had identical sequences in the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Metahyphopichia silvanorum was the most closely related species, but with 11.9–12.4% nucleotide substitutions in the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rRNA gene and 13.1–13.3% nucleotide substitutions in the ITS region. The phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenated sequences of the ITS region and the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rRNA gene showed that the seven strains form a well-separated subclade in a clade containing M. silvanorum and Metahyphopichia laotica with high bootstrap support. A phylogenetic analysis of a multilocus dataset including the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, the ITS region, the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rRNA gene, translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene, actin gene and the RNA polymerase II subunit 2 gene, confirmed the presence of the monophyletic clade that also includes M. silvanorum and M. laotica, and strongly supported the phylogenetic isolation of the seven strains from its neighbouring species. Therefore, the seven strains were assigned as a single novel species of the genus Metahyphopichia, according to their phylogenetic relationships. The name Metahyphopichia suwanaadthiae sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the seven strains. The holotype is DMKU-MRY16T (TBRC 11775T=NBRC 114386T=PYCC 8655T). The MycoBank number of the novel species is MB 841280. In addition, Candida silvanorum is reassigned to the genus Metahyphopichia.

Under experimental conditions, the heating temperatures of the substrate (Tsubstrate) were varied at 525 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C and 660 °C. The acquired XRD patterns indicated a strong β(202/220) peak of around 29.1° for the β-FeSi2 films prepared at a Tsubstrate of at least 600 °C. The β-FeSi2 film surface prepared at a Tsubstrate of 525 °C comprised several crystallites, which were arranged to form a grain format at a higher Tsubstrate. The root mean square roughness for the film surface prepared at a Tsubstrate of 525 °C was 0.49 nm, where it increased to 0.98 nm, 2.39 nm, and 4.23 nm at Tsubstrate of 550 °C, 600 °C, and 660 °C, respectively. The films prepared at a Tsubstrate of 525 °C exhibited an average contact angle (θCA) of 91.15°, and improved to 103.80° after employing a Tsubstrate of 660 °C. These results hinted at the possibility of employing the β-FeSi2 films prepared at all Tsubstrate in the hydrophobic surface application. The estimated hardness and elastic modulus of the β-FeSi2 films prepared at Tsubstrate of 525 °C were 12.78 GPa and 190.98 GPa, respectively, which increased to 21.27 GPa and 248.67 GPa, respectively, for the films prepared at 660 °C.

Herein, we developed a novel CdS decorated TiO2@BaTiO3 core–shell nanocomposite, where the optimal ratio of TiO2, BaTiO3 and CdS are 53.43, 37.37 and 9.20 wt%, respectively, for the best photocatalytic activity. The TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite reported in this work offers a persistent electric field in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 shell, due to the limited shielding effect in an asymmetrically polarized field. With the built-in electric field as the driving force, the photogenerated electrons and holes flowed into the CdS surface and the TiO2 core, respectively, with improved charge separation to participate in water-splitting reactions. The measured charge carrier lifetime of TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite via transient fluorescence spectrum is 0.42 ns, which is much longer than the TiO2 (0.25 ns) and TiO2@BaTiO3 (0.31 ns) samples. The TiO2@BaTiO3/CdS nanocomposite shows an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 13.22 mmol/g∙h under visible light illumination with an AQE of 52.50 % at 405 nm monochromatic light. This is much better than their components and binary composites, including TiO2/Pt (0.63 mmol/g∙h), CdS (1.23 mmol/g∙h), TiO2@BaTiO3 (0.03 mmol/g∙h), TiO2/CdS (0.53 mmol/g∙h), and BaTiO3/CdS (2.62 mmol/g∙h).

With a highly homologous pseudogene and various types of single nucleotide and complex structural variants, identification of PVs in CYP21A2 has been challenging. Objective: To leverage long-read next-generation sequencing combined with locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect PVs in CYP21A2 and to determine its diagnostic yield in patients with 21-OHD. Methods: Forty-eight Thai patients with 21-OHD comprising 38 sporadic cases and 5 pairs of siblings were enrolled. Two previously described locus-specific PCR methods were performed. Amplicons were subject to long-read sequencing. Results: Ninety-six PVs in CYP21A2 in the 48 patients were successfully identified. The combined techniques were able to detect 26 structural chimeric variants (27%; 26/96) in 22 patients with 18 having monoallelic and 4 having biallelic chimeras. The remaining PVs were pseudogene-derived mutations (63%; 60/96), entire gene deletions (2%; 2/96), missense variants (3%; 3/96), a splice-site variant (2%; 2/96), frameshift variants (2%; 2/96), and a nonsense variant (1%; 1/96). Notably, a splice-site variant, IVS7+1G>T, which was identified in a pair of siblings, has not previously been reported.

However, their effect on chest wall volumes and movements in older adults without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has never been investigated. This observational study aimed to identify the effect of combined PLB and FTLP on total and regional chest wall volumes, ventilatory pattern, and thoracoabdominal movement using in older adults. It was hypothesized that the combined PLB with FTLP would result in the highest chest wall volumes among the experimental tasks. Twenty older adults performed 2 breathing patterns of quiet breathing (QB) and PLB during a seated upright (UP) position and FTLP. An optoelectronic plethysmography system was used to capture the chest wall movements during the 4 experimental tasks. Tidal volume (VT) was separated into pulmonary ribcage, abdominal ribcage, and abdomen volume. The changes in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) chest wall diameters at 3 levels were measured and used to identify chest wall mechanics to improve chest wall volumes. The PLB significantly improved ventilation and chest wall volumes than the QB (P < .05). VTof pulmonary ribcage, VTof abdominal ribcage, and VTwere significantly higher during the PLB + UP (P < .05) and during the PLB + FTLP (P < .01) as compared to those of QB performed in similar body positions. However, there was no significant in total and regional lung volumes between the PLB + UP and the PLB + FTLP. The AP diameter changes at the angle of Louis and xiphoid levels were greater during the PLB + UP than the QB + UP and the QB + FTLP (P < .01). The AP diameter changes at the umbilical level and the ML diameter changes at the xiphoid level were significantly larger during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + FTLP and the QB + UP (P < .05). The ML diameter changes at the umbilical level were significantly greater during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + UP (P < .05). However, no significant difference in the relative regional chest wall volumes and phase angle among the experimental tasks (P > .05). In conclusion, a combined PLB performed in an FTLP or UP sitting could be used as a strategy to improve chest wall volumes and ventilation in older adults.","chest diseases, thoracic surgery and tuberculosis, medical",Medicine (all)

The performance at each cycle of spent catalyst correlated to the formation of soft and refractory coke on the catalyst was probed by the temperature-programmed oxidation analysis and FT-IR. As a result, soft coke contributed as the major coke species, including an ester functional group. Furthermore, the coke adsorption on the surface and the electron transfer was analyzed by density functional theory-based calculation. It was found that the strongly adsorbed refractory coke on the catalyst is prone to adsorb on the main Al active site blocking the formation of the Al–OOH site. This phenomenon is responsible for the main reaction in contrast to the soft coke that prefers the other Al sites. Thus, controlling the refractory coke formation is crucial to control the overall catalyst performance, although present in a small amount.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

The metal–organic framework filler (C3N2H5)(Mg(HCOO)3), HImMg is prepared and introduced into poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) matrix using two distinguished methods: melt-mixing and solution-casting methods. The processing conditions are important in determining the dominant phase in PVDF-HFP. As a result of solvent-induced crystallization, the β-phase content of solution-cast composites containing 10% HImMg is 22% higher than that of melt-mixed composites. In both methods, the nucleating effect of HImMg particles increases the overall crystallinity of the polymer matrix and enhances the dielectric constant in composite films by improving the interfacial and dipolar polarization. Furthermore, the melt-mixed composites with 7 wt% HImMg demonstrate the highest dielectric constant of 17.8 at 1 kHz, showing an enhancement of 59% compared with that of pristine PVDF-HFP. Meanwhile, the dielectric loss is suppressed at 0.083.

Respondents from low/middle income countries were more likely to report lack of surge preparedness (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.8) and struggling to return to prepandemic standards of care (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 4.4-34) compared with respondents from high-income countries. Respondents experiencing a surge were more likely to report conversion of NCCUs and general-mixed intensive care units (ICUs) to a COVID-ICU (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3), conversion of non-ICU beds to ICU beds (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5), and deviations in critical care and pharmaceutical practices (OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.2). Respondents from hospitals with a dedicated NCCU were less likely to report conversion to a COVID-ICU (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) or conversion of non-ICU to ICU beds (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9). Conclusion: This study reports the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global neurocritical care delivery, and highlights shortcomings of health care infrastructures and the importance of pandemic preparedness.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"
Theoretical screening of highly efficient single-atom catalysts for nitrogen reduction based on a defective C3N monolayer,"Chen Y., Zhang X., Qin J., Liu R.",2022-01-26,"Density-functional-theory, Electrochemical technology, High activity, High selectivity, Nitrogen reduction, Nitrogen reduction reaction, Reduction reaction, Single atom catalyst, Single-atoms, ]+ catalyst, Density functional theory, Nitrogen reduction reaction, Single atom catalysts, Transition metal","Conversion of N2 to NH3 through electrochemical technology is one of the most attractive and promising alternatives to the traditional Haber-Bosch method. However, exploring the promising electrocatalysts with high stability, activity and selectivity for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is still an important and long-standing challenge to accelerate the green production of NH3. Herein, through the first-principles high-throughput screening, we systematically investigated the potentiality of single transition metal (TM) anchored on defective C3N monolayer as TM-VCC candidates for N2 fixation. We carried out a comprehensive screening and systematical evaluation for stability, catalytic activity and selectivity toward NRR on TM-VCC candidates. Our results reveal that, among 26 candidates, Mn-VCC can significantly suppress HER and exhibit the outstanding NRR activity, with the most favorable limiting potential of −0.75 V through the distal pathway, which is better than the currently stepped catalyst Ru (0001). More impressively, such a satisfactory NH3 conversion is primarily ascribed to the strong back-donation interactions between d-electrons of Mn atom and the anti-orbitals of N2 molecule, as well as efficient charge transfer of electrochemical process. Our findings not only broaden the development prospect of SACs for N2 reduction but also pave a way for rational design and rapid screening of highly active C3N-based catalysts for NRR.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Proton donor/acceptor copolymer brushes on sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membrane: An approach to construct efficient proton transfer pathway in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell,"Pokprasert A., Theato P., Chirachanchai S.",2022-02-01,"Benzimidazoles, Donor and acceptor, Poly(acrylic acid), Polymer brushes, Polymer electrolyte membranes, Proton acceptors, Proton donors, Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells, Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membranes, Surface-modification, Polymer brushes, Polymer electrolyte membrane, Proton donor and acceptor, Proton exchange membrane fuel cell, Surface modification","Proton transfer in polymer electrolyte membrane is an essential mechanism in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The development of PEM mostly relies on polymer modification with proton conductive species followed by membrane casting. This brings in the random existence of conductive species in the membrane to result in a limit of conductivity. The present work proposes an alignment of conductive species, i.e., proton donor and acceptor polymer chains, on the membrane through the surface-initiated polymerization so that the proton transfer proceeds effectively and continuously. The grafting of poly(acrylic acid) (Poly(AA) and/or poly(benzimidazole acrylamide) (Poly(BImAm)) onto sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membrane (SPEEK) enables the polymer brush decoration on the SPEEK surface. Among various types of copolymer architecture, the statistical copolymer, i.e. SPEEK-Poly(AA63-stat-BImAm26), shows the most significant proton conductivity. The present work demonstrates a simple approach to modify the surface of PEMFC membrane with proton donor/acceptor for proton conductivity enhancement.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

First, the power plant modeling was accurately developed using NN simulation. Then, the model was applied to the optimization step, where the CPSO (the modified algorithm from the classical PSO) was introduced. The proposed method included real operation constraints to the algorithm, such as biomass feed availability and minimum steam production rate. In the optimization step, the COP has been defined as the cost function to check the present operation's economic viability. To obtain the minimum production cost (COP), the CPSO suggested feeding wood bark from sources C and D with the amount of 104.1 and 463.8 tons/day, respectively. The result has been extensively validated by the real operation. The calculation framework in this study then applies to various production systems. Besides, by integrating the cost function in the optimization model with other indicators such as environmental impact indices, the output would provide an additional holistic picture of economic and environmental aspects.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)
CAVVPM: Challenge-Based Authentication and Verification of Vehicle Platooning at Motorway,"Arslan M., Majeed M.F., Abu Bakar R., Khan J., Hussain S., Lee Y., Khan F.",2022-10-01,"Challenge response, Communications data, Constant speed, Prospectives, Safety and securities, Security, Sensors data, Vehicle platoons, Vehicle sensors, Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, Chloride Channels, Prospective Studies, access control, challenge–response, security, vehicle platoon","As a result of vehicle platooning, advantages including decreased traffic congestion and improved fuel economy are expected. Vehicles in a platoon move in a single line, closely spaced, and at a constant speed. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications and sensor data help keep the platoon formation in place, and the CACC system is responsible for maintaining it. In reality, V2V transmissions are essential for reducing platooning distances while still ensuring their safety and security. It is far more difficult to confirm the veracity of a V2V message’s content than it is to verify its integrity and source authentication. Only platoon members can send and receive V2V communications by implementing a practical access control mechanism. The goal is to link a prospective platoon member’s digital identification to their actual location inside the unit. A physical challenge–response interaction is used in the CAVVPM process to verify that a prospective platoon member respects the rules. The applicant is asked to perform a series of random longitudinal movements, thus, the protocol’s name. Remote attackers cannot join the platoon or send bogus CACC communications because CAVVPM blocks them. CAVVPM is more resistant to pre-recording assaults than previous work, and it can validate that the candidate is precisely behind the verifier in the same lane compared to previous studies.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

(Amaryllidaceae) has been used in Southeast Asian traditional medicine to alleviate the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The pathological mechanism of BPH is associated with the induction of prostate stromal cell proliferation through transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Standardization as well as investigation of the potential anti-BPH activity of C. latifolium extract could benefit the further development of BPH-related analyses and provide evidence to support the application of this extract for BPH treatment. This study aimed to standardize and investigate the antiproliferative activity of the ethanolic extract of C. latifolium leaves. The major alkaloids isolated from C. latifolium were also explored for their potential use as bioactive markers. Methods: Two major alkaloids were isolated from the ethanolic extract of C. latifolium leaves by chromatographic techniques, identified by NMR and MS, and quantified by a validated UHPLC method. Their antiproliferative activity was studied in human prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1) induced by TGF-β. The synergistic effect of combining the two major isolated alkaloids was analyzed by the zero interaction potency (ZIP) model. Results: Two alkaloids, lycorine (1) and 6α-hydroxybuphanidrine (2), were isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C. latifolium. A UHPLC method for the quantification of (1) and (2) was developed and validated in terms of linearity, precision, and accuracy. The C. latifolium leaf extract contained 0.279 ± 0.003% (1) and 0.232 ± 0.004% (2). The crude extract was more potent than either (1) and (2) alone against TGF-β-treated WPMY-1 cell proliferation. The drug combination study revealed that the greatest synergistic effect of (1) and (2) was achieved at a 1:1 ratio. Conclusions: The results of this study support the anti-BPH activity of C. latifolium in traditional medicine and suggest that these the two isolated alkaloids may promote the efficacy of the C. latifolium extract. Additionally, major alkaloids (1) and (2) can be used as bioactive markers for the standardization of C. latifolium extracts.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

In order to understand the morphological transformation of drug nanoparticles interaction on cancerous cells, we prepared curcumin nanorods (CNRs) and curcumin nanospheres (CNSs) by antisolvent precipitation process. The size, surface charge and morphology were analyzed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and High Resolution Transmission Microscope (HRTEM). The size of both the nanoparticles ranges below 50 nm and the zeta potential showed the negative surface charge. Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier Transformer Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR) studies revealed the crystal systems (monoclinic and orthorhombic forms) of curcumin nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity of these drugs was tested using MTT assay, where CNRs exhibited a little more anticancer activity and apoptosis than CNSs in HepG2 cells. Hence, we suggest that the morphological variation may act as another factor, which influences apoptotic cell death in spite of the surface charge.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

The Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 bulk metallic glass (BMG) rod has further formed into thin films through the filtered cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) deposition process. To assess the biocompatibility and the surface behaviour of the synthesised Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 BMG, the metallic glass (MG) thin films are fabricated on the glass substrate and cultured using murine osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and human osteoblast-like cells (SaOS-2). Various characterisation techniques has been utilised to evaluate the surface properties and the cultured cells behaviour of the deposited thin films. The synthesised Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 composition shows good biocompatibility similar to the routinely used Ti-6Al-4V. The osteoblast cells proliferate very well on the Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 MGs and exhibit similar levels of alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity to those of the controls and the Ti-6Al-4V material. The MC3T3-E1 cells adhered and spread faster on the alumina particle blasted Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 and Ti-6Al-4V surfaces with osteoblast-like shapes. These results suggest that Ti40Zr10Co36Pd14 BMG is biocompatible and could support osteoblast differentiation. Thus, the new alloy can be used as a candidate material for potential biomedical application.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The cleaning of Ni current collector is mandatory before it can be utilized in supercapacitor devices. The cleaning of the Ni foam substrate is essential for removing contaminations and modifying the surface morphology of the foam. In this study, Ni foam substrates were cleaned via sonication in different concentrations of HCl solution and the formation of the oxide layer on the surface of the Ni foam was investigated. The formation of oxide layer on the Ni foams was characterized of its morphology, elemental and structural analyses. The cleaning of the Ni foam with HCl solution leads to the formation of oxide layer on the Ni foam surface. The cleaning of Ni foam substrate with a 2.5 M of HCl solution gave an oxide layer with uniform thickness (0.034 μm) before the layer was detached. Cleaning with 5.0 M HCl concentration produced the thickest oxide layer formation (0.327 μm). However, a cracked line (black line) was also observed for 4.0 and 5.0 M HCl concentrations, indicating that the attachment of these oxide layers on the surface of the Ni foam was poor and susceptible to detachment. From the structural analyses, no impurity peaks were detected in the diffraction pattern and the intensity peaks of Ni were decreased and broaden with the increase in the HCl concentration. It is proven that the Ni foam have uniform surface roughness of the oxide layer when cleaned with HCl solution lower than 2.5 M but the thick oxide layer was detached at concentrations higher than 2.5 M which deteriorates the supercapacitor systems.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

Fabricated by using the solvent casting method, the composite films, with the HPMC–LCMRS ratios of 9:1, 7:1, 5:1 and 4:1, were then subjected to physicochemical and mechanical evaluations, including weight, thickness, moisture content and moisture absorption, swelling index, transparency, folding endurance, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young’s modulus, as well as the determination of disintegration time by using the Petri dish method (PDM) and slide frame and bead method (SFM). The results showed that HPMC-CLCMRS composite films exhibited good film integrity, uniformity, and transparency with up to 20% CLCMRS incorporation (4:1 ratio). Non-plasticized composite films showed no significant changes in the average weight, thickness, density, folding endurance (96–122), tensile strength (2.01–2.13 MPa) and Young’s modulus (10.28–11.59 MPa) compared to HPMC film (135, 2.24 MPa, 10.67 MPa, respectively). On the other hand, the moisture content and moisture absorption were slightly higher, whereas the elongation at break (EAB; 4.31–5.09%) and the transparency (4.73–6.18) were slightly lowered from that of the HPMC film (6.03% and 7.03%, respectively). With the addition of glycerol as a plasticizer, the average weight and film thickness increased, and the density decreased. The folding endurance was improved (to >300), while the transparency remained in the acceptable range. Although the tensile strength of most composite films decreased (0.66–1.75 MPa), they all exhibited improved flexibility (EAB 7.27–11.07%) while retaining structural integrity. The disintegration times of most composite films (PDM 109–331, SFM 70–214 s) were lower than those of HPMC film (PDM 345, SFM 229 s). In conclusion, the incorporation of CLCMRS significantly improved the disintegration time of the composite films whereas it did not affect or only slightly affected the physicochemical and mechanical characteristics of the films. The 5:1 and 4:1 HPMC:CLCMRS composite films, in particular, showed promising potential application as a film base for the manufacturing of orodispersible film dosage forms.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

Both the environmental attributes, i.e., Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, and soil attributes, i.e., Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorous, ph levels are used for the training of the model. The R-square prediction score shows that the decision tree regression is 95.5% accurate and random forest regression shows 98.5% accuracy. The results reveal the accuracy of random forest regression model is superior with respect to the other existing regression models.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Information Systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Hardware and Architecture"
Performances of Conventional SOAs Versus QD-SOA in 1530-nm Upstream Transmission of 40 Gb/s Access Network,"Boriboon B., Worasucheep D.-R., Shimizu S., Shinada S., Furukawa H., Matsumoto A., Akahane K., Yamamoto N., Wada N.",2022-02-01,"40 Gb/s, 40 gb/s access network, Access network, Cascaded SOA, Conventional SOA, Data pattern effect, Data patterns, Dynamic range, Gain, Input power, Input power dynamic range, NG-PON2, Optical noise, Optical saturation, Optical signal to noise ratio, Pattern effect, Power dynamics, QD-SOA, 40 Gb/s access network, Cascaded SOAs, Conventional SOA, Data pattern effect, Input power dynamic range, NG-PON2, Optical signal to noise ratio, QD-SOA","SOA is the key device for burst-mode upstream transmission of 40 Gb/s access network to extend distance and increase users. We evaluate two conventional SOAs and our QD-SOA in networks, consisting of 20-km Single Mode Fiber (SMF) and splitters (1:8, 1:16 & 1:32). First, their characteristics are reported: 3-dB bandwidth & peak wavelength of Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) spectra, gain, saturation output & input, and Noise Figure (NF). QD-SOA gives the lowest NF of 4.59 dB at -20-dBm input due to its highest Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR). It also has the fastest response time (70 ps) with less data pattern effect when operating in saturation region. Besides the measurement of Input Power Dynamic Range (IPDR) of 3 SOAs, their performances of single versus two-cascaded SOA transmissions are evaluated by Bit Error Rate (BER) in many combinations of SMF and splitters. In case of inserting 1:8 splitter between two-cascaded SOAs, the performance of 2nd-stage QD-SOA has lower BERs than 2nd-stage conventional SOA due to its higher saturation output and less pattern effect when operating at high input power. Finally, both experimental and computed BERs are plotted versus SOA's input to confirm the OSNR degradation and data pattern effect.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
The Impact of Variable Renewable Energy Integration on Total System Costs and Electricity Generation Revenue,"Imcharoenkul V., Chaitusaney S.",2022-01-01,"Electricity market price, Generator, Integration cost, Merit-order effect, Ordering effects, Renewable energy penetrations, Renewable energy source, System costs, Total system cost, Variable renewable energies, Electricity market prices, integration costs, Merit-order effect, total system costs, variable renewable energy","Variable renewable energy (VRE) integration creates additional costs, called 'integration costs.' These costs have grown with VRE penetration, potentially increasing the total system costs delivered to customers (direct integration costs) and decreasing electricity generation revenue, discouraging generators' investment (indirect integration costs). Thus, integration costs can be an economic barrier to integrate high shares of VRE. This paper proposes a method to determine the impact of VRE integration on total system costs and electricity generation revenue. The method is a combination of the unit-commitment model, the optimal generation mix and optimal generation schedule analysis, and merit-order simulations. The results show that the total system costs are minimal at 70% VRE penetration. In addition, after 20% VRE penetration, the combination of solar and wind generation provided minimal total system costs rather than relying on wind or solar individually. Moreover, the profitability of generators from supplying energy to the energy market is declined by VRE penetration. Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), hydro, and wind generators face higher impacts on their electricity generation revenue than coal and solar generators. Electricity system planners and policymakers need to consider and prioritize the severity of VRE impacts on each technology grown with VRE penetration to enact consistent plans and policies.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

"Mapping groundwater potential zones in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand by integrating of analytic hierarchy process, frequency ratio, and random forest","Thanh N.N., Chotpantarat S., Trung N.H., Ngu N.H., Muoi L.V.",2022-12-01,"Areas under the curves, Ensemble models, Frequency ratios, Groundwater potentials, Process-models, Random forests, Sustainable water resources, Thailand, Water resources management, Zone mapping, Analytic hierarchy process, Ensemble model, Frequency ratio, Groundwater potential, Random forest, Thailand","At the basic level, groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) mapping plays an important role in sustainable water resource management. There are different approaches to delineating GWPZ, and each has unique advantages and disadvantages. Incorporating these approaches into an ensemble could provide a more efficient tool for GWPZ evaluation and mapping. In this study, the frequency ratio (FR), random forest (RF), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) models, and their ensemble were compared in delineating GPWZs in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. These models predicted the potential of groundwater yield at > 10 m3/h and were trained based on the measured groundwater yield of 1,601 wells in the study region, coupled with the spatial data of eight influencing factors, including altitude, distance to faults, distance to waterbodies, geology, land use, rainfall, soil type, and slope. The Areas under the curve (AUC) metric was used to assess the model's performance. The results demonstrated that all models achieved similarly good performance with an AUC of 0.80, 0.76, 0.74, and 0.72 for the ensemble, RF, FR, and AHP models, respectively. Areas with high groundwater yield potential were primarily reported in the eastern part of Kanchanaburi, where the terrain is flat. The ensemble approach slightly improved the predictive power, but at the cost of model complexity.","water engineeringneering, decision sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Decision Sciences (all), Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Ecology"

However, the correlation between the presence of Q-waves and nonviable myocardium is still controversial. The aims of this study were to 1) test QWA, a novel ECG approach, to predict transmural extent and scar volume using a 3.0 Tesla scanner, and 2) assess the accuracy of QWA and transmural extent. Methods: Consecutive patients with a history of coronary artery disease who came for myocardial viability assessment by CMR were retrospectively enrolled. Q-wave measurements parameters including duration and maximal amplitude were performed from each surface lead. A 3.0 Tesla CMR was performed to assess LGE and viability. Results: Total of 248 patients were enrolled in the study (with presence (n = 76) and absence of pathologic Q-wave (n = 172)). Overall prevalence of pathologic Q-waves was 27.2% (for LAD infarction patients), 20.0 % (for LCX infarction patients), and 16.8% (for RCA infarction patients). Q-wave area demonstrated high performance for predicting the presence of a nonviable segment in LAD territory (AUC 0.85, 0.77–0.92) and a lower, but still significant performance in LCX (0.63, 0.51–0.74) and RCA territory (0.66, 0.55–0.77). Q-wave area greater than 6 ms mV demonstrated high performance in predicting the presence of myocardium scar larger than 10% (AUC 0.82, 0.76–0.89). Conclusion: Q-wave area, a novel Q-wave parameter, can predict non-viable myocardial territories and the presence of a significant myocardial scar extension.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

This pilot study conducted in Thailand determines the re-operation rate for SLNB without FS. Method: We retrospectively reviewed 239 SLNB cases without FS at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from April 2016 to April 2021. The patients were diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer with clinically negative nodes. The clinical nodal status was assessed from physical examination. The re-operation rate was determined by the number of positive SLNs; where 3 more nodal metastases were subjected to a second surgical procedure. Result: Between April 2016 and April 2021, 239 patients who had undergone SLNB in accordance with ACOSOG Z0011 criteria with PS alone was enrolled. A total of 975 SLNs were removed from these 239 patients, with an average of 4.15 nodes per patient. Out of 239 patients, 21 (8.8%) and 6 (2.5%) had metastatic disease in 1 and 2 nodes, respectively. The remaining 212 (88.7%) patients had no nodal metastasis. None of the patients were subjected to a second surgical procedure. Conclusion: We conclude that the implementation of SLNB with PS analysis alone in patients who satisfy the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria, with a re-operation rate of 0%, does not have outcomes that would be altered by the standard of care additional FS analysis. With ommision of FS analysis, operation cost, operative time and anesthetic side effects are projected to decrease.",medical,Surgery
"Frequent occurrence of respiratory symptoms in children is associated with exposure to air pollution, land use types, and parental mental health in the Greater Taipei area","Zou M.-L., Jiang C.-B., Chen Y.-H., Wu C.-D., Candice Lung S.-C., Chien L.-C., Kallawicha K., Lo Y.-C., Chao H.J.",2022-04-15,"Air Pollutants, Air Pollution, Child, Child, Preschool, Cohort Studies, Environmental Exposure, Humans, Mental Health, Risk Factors, Air pollution, Children respiratory symptoms, Land-use types, Parental mental health","Although studies have investigated the individual effects of air pollution, land use types, and parental mental health on children's respiratory health, few studies have examined the effects of these risk factors simultaneously in children aged <2 years. We investigated the effects of exposure to air pollution, land use types surrounding residences, and parental mental health on the frequent occurrence of respiratory symptoms in children aged <2 years in the Greater Taipei area. Participants were recruited from an ongoing Taiwanese birth cohort study. We analyzed the data of the participants who had been recruited from January 2011 to April 2014 and had responded to the follow-up questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect participants' sociodemographic background and health, such as respiratory symptoms, and parental mental health. Pre- and postnatal pollution levels were estimated using the spatial interpolation technique (ordinary kriging) at children's residential addresses. Land use types surrounding participants' homes were evaluated by performing buffer analysis. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of risk factors on the frequent occurrence of child respiratory symptoms in children aged 6, 12, and 24 months. We included 228, 360, and 441 children aged 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Our results indicated that postnatal exposure to PM2.5 and O3 was positively associated with children's respiratory symptoms. Traffic-related land-use types, sports facilities, and commercial land surrounding homes exerted adverse effects on children's respiratory symptoms, whereas the presence of schools in the neighborhood was beneficial. Parental mental health was also associated with children's respiratory symptoms. Postnatal exposure to air pollution and land use types surrounding residences were associated with respiratory health in children aged <2 years. The residential environment is a critical factor affecting children's respiratory health of children aged <2 years.","medicalcal geography, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"
Reverse bias dependent impedance and dielectric properties of Al/n-NC FeSi2/p-Si/Pd heterostructures formed by facing-targets sputtering,"Borwornpornmetee N., Chaleawpong R., Charoenyuenyao P., Nopparuchikun A., Paosawatyanyong B., Sittimart P., Yoshitake T., Promros N.",2022-08-01,"Al/n-NC fesi2/p-si/pd heterojunction, Bias-dependent impedance, Circuit parameter, Constant phase element, Dielectric characteristics, Dielectrics property, Electrical conductivity, Facing targets sputtering, Impedance characteristics, Reverse-bias, Al/n-NC FeSi2/p-Si/Pd heterojunctions, Circuit parameters, Dielectric characteristics, Electrical conductivities, Impedance characteristics","Al/n-NC FeSi2/p-Si/Pd heterostructures were formed by facing-targets sputtering. From the dark J-V results, the device showed rectifying action with leakage current. In this work, impedance spectroscopy was employed to study the electrochemical characteristics of the heterostructures, which were inspected within a frequency (f) range from 20 Hz to 2 MHz. The range of the biased voltage (V) was −1 V to 0 V. All plots of real and imaginary impedances possessed single semi-circular arcs for all bias V values. The relaxation time was 2.00 μs at −1 V, and it became faster at 0 V with 0.42 μs. The equivalent circuit for the heterostructures consisted of series resistance (Rs) combined with three sets of shunt circuits of resistance (Rp) and a constant phase element (CPE), representing grain, grain boundary, and junction, respectively. The simulated Rs and Rp values decreased, while all CPE values increased as the biased V increased. For the dielectric properties, the real permittivity (ε′) values of 86.70 at 0 V and 20.22 at −1 V were disclosed at 100 Hz; all ε′ values decreased as the f value was increased. The loss tangent revealed to be very high due to dielectric loss being much higher than ε′ values, indicating the device to be leaky. The alternating conductivities plotted against f started at a low level in low f zones and grew exponentially when f reached higher values for all V values. Direct current conductivity was observed at 1.66 × 10−4 S m−1 at 0 V, which reduced to 2.67 × 10−5 S m−1 at −1 V. The dimensionless exponent of the conductivity results was higher than 1, indicating the hopping movement within the local site.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The number of older patients is on the rise, and along with it comes the burden of noncommunicable diseases, both clinical and economic. Attempts with mobile health (mHealth) have been made to remedy the situation with promising outcomes. Researchers have adopted human-centered design (HCD) in mHealth creation to ensure those promises become a reality. Objective: This systematic review aims to explore existing literature on relevant primary research and case studies to (1) illustrate how HCD can be used to create mHealth solutions for older adults and (2) summarize the overall process with recommendations specific to the older population. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to address the study objectives. IEEE Xplore, Medline via Ovid, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for HCD research of mHealth solutions for older adults. Two independent reviewers then included the papers if they (1) were written in English, (2) included participants equal to or older than 60 years old, (3) were primary research, and (4) reported about mHealth apps and their HCD developments from start to finish. The 2 reviewers continued to assess the included studies qualities using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). A narrative synthesis was then carried out and completed. Results: Eight studies passed the eligibility criteria: 5 were mixed methods studies and 3 were case studies. Some studies were about the same mHealth projects with a total of 5 mHealth apps. The included studies differed in HCD goals, target groups, and details of their HCD methodologies. The HCD process was explored through narrative synthesis in 4 steps according to the International Standardization Organization (ISO) standard 9241-210: (1) understand and specify the context of use, (2) specify the user requirements, (3) produce design solutions to meet these requirements, and (4) evaluate the designs against requirements. The overall process and recommendations unique to older adults are summarized logically with structural order and time order based on the Minto pyramid principle and ISO 9241-210. Conclusions: Findings show that HCD can be used to create mHealth solutions for older adults with positive outcomes. This review has also summarized practical HCD steps and additional suggestions based on existing literature in the subfield. However, evidence-based results are still limited because most included studies lacked details about their sampling methods and did not set objective and quantifiable goals, leading to failure to draw significant conclusions. More studies of HCD application on mHealth for older adults with measurable design goals and rigorous research strategy are warranted.",medical,Health Informatics
Assessment of Riverbank Erosion Hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia Using Remote Sensing and Hazard Exposure Mapping,"Tha T., Piman T., Bhatpuria D., Ruangrassamee P.",2022-07-01,"Cambodia, Erosion rates, Google earth engine, Google earths, Hotspots, LANDSAT, Mekong River, Riverbank erosion, Root mean square errors, Sentinel-2, Google Earth Engine, Landsat, Mekong River, riverbank erosion, Sentinel-2","The large-scale monitoring of riverbank erosion is challenging because of human, equip-ment, and financial limitations, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to detect riverbank erosion and identify riverbank erosion hotspots along the Mekong River in Cambodia. A riverbank erosion rate map was developed using satellite images from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 (1990–2020) using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) at a resolution of 30 m and Sentinel-2 (2016–2021) using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) at a resolution of 10 m. Detecting riverbanks in satellite images using a water index depends greatly on image resolution and water threshold. The riverbank lines were validated using Google Earth images. In the data used in December 2017, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Sentinel-2 was 6.00 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 6.04 m. In the data used in January 2019, the RMSE of Sentinel-2 was 4.12 m, while the RMSE of Landsat was 5.90 m. The hotspots were identified by overlaying the riverbank erosion rate map and the exposure map of population density and land cover. Field surveys and interviews were conducted to verify riverbank erosion hotspots in the Ruessei Srok and Kaoh Soutin communes. The results showed that within the last 30 years (1990–2020), the riverbank eroded more than 1 km in a direction perpendicular to the river in some segments of the Mekong River in Cambodia. The highest average annual erosion rate was in the Ruessei Srok Commune in Kampong Cham Province, at approximately 43 m/yr. Most eroded areas were farmland and rural residential areas. The riverbank hotspots are situated mainly in the lower part of the Mekong River, where the population is dense, and the erosion rate is high. Riverbank erosion hotspots with a very high impact level and ongoing active erosion include the Peam Kaoh Sna, Kampong Reab, Kaoh Soutin, and Ruessei Srok communes in Kampong Cham Province. This study provides an efficient tool for using satellite images to identify riverbank erosion hotpots in a large river basin. The riverbank erosion hotspot map is essential for decision-makers to prioritize interventions to reduce the risk of riverbank erosion and to improve the livelihood of the people residing along the Mekong River.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

These major signs include Suicidal Ideation, Anhedonic, Sleep Problems, and Guilty Feelings. Different machine learning algorithms, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to build prediction models. A web application prototype is developed to predict signs of depression from a user's tweets during the past month to trace whether the user has shown any signs of depression as well as the degree or intensity of each sign in five scales. Such information can assist a mental health professional's client, who is experiencing depression, to realize one's own negative thoughts, and can be useful input to the treatment.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, sociology","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software, Information Systems and Management, Education"
