Reference Values for Chronotropic Index from 1280 Incremental Cycle Ergometry Tests,"Sirichana W., Neufeld E.V., Wang X., Hu S.B., Dolezal B.A., Cooper C.B.",2020-12-01,"Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Body Height, Body Weight, Databases, Factual, Exercise Test, Female, Heart Rate, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Non-Smokers, Oxygen Consumption, Reference Values, Retrospective Studies, Sex Factors, Smokers, Young Adult, CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TEST, CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY, HEART RATE, OXYGEN UPTAKE","Purpose Clinical cardiopulmonary exercise testing can determine causes of exercise limitation. The slope of heart rate (fC) versus oxygen uptake (V˙O2), which we call the chronotropic index (CI), can help identify cardiovascular impairment. We aimed to develop a reference equation for CI based on a large number of subjects considered to have normal exercise responses. Methods From a database of 13,728 incremental cycle ergometry exercise tests, we identified 1280 normal tests based on the absence of a clinical diagnosis, normal body mass index, and normal aerobic performance plus absence of cardiovascular disease, medications, or ventilatory limitation. A linear mixed-model approach was used to analyze the relationship between CI and other variables. Results Subjects were age 18-84 yr, and 693 (54.1%) were men. Mean ± SD CI in men was lower than in women, 41.2 ± 9.3 beats per liter versus 63.4 ± 15.7 L-1. Age (in years), sex (0, male; 1, female), height (in centimeters), and weight (in kilograms) were significant predictors for CI:CIi = 106.9 + 0.16 × agei + 14.3 × sexi - 0.31 × heighti - 0.24 × weighti. The SE of estimates ranged from 10.6 to 11.2 L-1 (median of 10.7 L-1). Conclusions We report a reference equation for CI derived from normal subjects. The CI can be used in conjunction with V˙O2max to interpret maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests. We consider a high CI to be cardiovascular impairment and a low CI plus low V˙O2max to be chronotropic insufficiency.","medical, Health Professions","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"

This simple and rapid approach allowed direct assembly of these two bulky motifs in good yields without the formation of byproducts. Upon evaluation of antidiabetic activity of the synthesized products, epicatechinosamin (β-2g) was the most active α-glucosidase inhibitor toward maltase and sucrase. The kinetic study indicated that β-2 g inhibited the enzymes in a mixed manner of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.","genergyal, chemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Plant Science, Organic Chemistry"
Missing factors that are overlooked in designing a photovoltaic system,"Narkwatchara P., Ratanatamskul C., Chandrachai A.",2020-01-31,"Ambient environment, Calculation results, Design development, In-depth interviews, Operation temperature, Particulate Matter, Photovoltaic systems, Qualitative research, Design factors, Design process, Photovoltaic system, Renewable energy","The purpose of this research is to study new factors for the design of the Photovoltaic system to generate electrical energy by reviewing factors affecting the efficiency of producing electrical energy, which has not been considered to be important parameters in the design stage and assessment for installation of Photovoltaic system. In addition to the study of secondary sources of the aforesaid information, qualitative research has been studied by an in-depth interview with sample group whose members are engineers and design specialists on the installation of Photovoltaic system to integrate both ideas and bring new important parameters into the design process of Photovoltaic system. From the results of the study, it was found that the important factors are air quality (Particulate matter) and ambient environment (Operation temperature & relative humidity) around the installation area. Both factors should be added into the design process of the Photovoltaic system to make calculation results more accurate when compared with the results from which electrical energy produced after installation completed. The results from this research are supposed to be an addition of new factors to the design process for the design development of the Photovoltaic system in the future.","air pollution control, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Positive mother-child interactions and parenting styles were associated with lower screen time in early childhood,"Detnakarintra K., Trairatvorakul P., Pruksananonda C., Chonchaiya W.",2020-04-01,"Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Mother-Child Relations, Parent-Child Relations, Parenting, Retrospective Studies, Screen Time, Thailand, digital, media, mother-child interaction, parenting, screen time","Aim: This study examined long-term associations between mother-child interactions and parenting styles and electronic screen time. Methods: We studied 280 healthy children (53.2% girls) enrolled at a mean age of 36 ± 0.4 months from February 2015 to September 2016. The study included retrospective data on 267 children who had been recruited from medical facilities in Thailand at 6 months of age. Mother-child interaction, parenting styles and screen time were assessed at various ages and path analyses were performed to elucidate the directionality and relationships between the variables. Results: Increased mother-child interaction at 18 months of age was positively associated with less screen time at 2 and 3 years of age. Likewise, nurturing authoritative parenting at 3 years of age was directly related to lower media exposure at 4 years. The total screen time at younger ages had positive direct relationships with relaxed permissive and strict authoritarian parenting styles, but negative direct relationships with nurturing authoritative parenting in subsequent years. Conclusion: Early mother-child interaction and nurturing authoritative parenting were associated with subsequent decreased screen time, while media exposure at the age of two was related to relaxed permissive and strict authoritarian parenting at 3 years of age.","genergyal, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

Our results demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the blending film were the best when the ratio of the CD and PVA was 4:1. Further, the barrier properties of the film were optimized by incorporating with thyme essential oil. It was proved that not only water vapor permeability was lower, but also the elongation at break was improved, when 2% (w/w) thyme essential oil used. The potential interactions of the film matrix were analyzed by FTIR, XRD and Cryo-scanning electron microscopy. Importantly, both the antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity were improved. Finally, the blending film was employed for the preservation of chilled meat, while the shelf life was extended up to 10 days.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Using this approach, novel toxin transcripts can be detected and abundancies of different isoforms of each toxin measured. The analytical pipeline can be briefly outlined as follows. Isolation of mRNA from tissue under RNase-free condition is essential to keep mRNA intact before sequencing. After mRNA fragmentation, the adapters are added to both ends of the fragments to synthesize complementary cDNAs. The obtained cDNA library is then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Quality of millions of reads produced from the NGS is checked and the sequences corresponding to the adapters and low-quality reads are removed. Subsequently, the NGS data are subjected to the workflow of de novo assembly, quantification of expression levels, annotation of transcripts, and identification of ORFs, signal peptides, structurally conserved domains, and functional motifs. In this report we describe the listed methodological steps and techniques in details and refer to the platforms and software that may be adopted for similar studies.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Biology, Genetics"
"Process and sustainability analyses of the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis process for methanol production","Im-orb K., Arpornwichanop A.",2020-02-15,"Analysis hierarchy process, Environmental assessment, Environmental factors, Methanol synthesis, Multi-criteria decision analysis, Process analysis, Product distributions, Sustainability analysis, Gasification, Methanol synthesis, Process analysis, Pyrolysis, Sustainability","Technical and sustainability analyses of the methanol production via the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis (IBPGM) process using rice straw as feedstock, are performed. The utilization of emitted CO2 by recycling to a gasifier as a gasifying agent is investigated for technical and environmental reasons. The effects of CO2 recirculation on the product distribution and energy consumption of the IBPGM process are examined. The production rate of methanol is improved with the increased CO2 recycle fraction, while that of bio-oil does not change. The IBPGM is a highly exothermic process, with the largest energy-releasing unit being the methanol reactor. The energy consumption at the gasifier exhibits the same trend and thermal self-sufficiency is consequently achieved when the recycle fraction is raised to 0.76. Environmental assessment using a life cycle analysis tool reveals that the energy management of methanol synthesis unit and syngas processor needs to be improved as they highly contribute toward the carbon footprint and potential environmental impact. The technical and environmental factors of the IBPGM process are evaluated by the analysis hierarchy process, calculated by a multi-criteria decision analysis method. The IBPGM process with the CO2 recycle fraction of 0.2 offers the best performance. Under this condition, the methanol and bio-oil production rates of 0.23 and 0.09 kmol h−1, respectively, and the energy efficiency of 60.7% can be achieved, based on the biomass feed rate of 1 kmol h−1.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Who worries about specific phobias? – A population-based study of risk factors,"Coelho C.M., Goncalves-Bradley D., Zsido A.N.",2020-07-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anxiety Disorders, Australia, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Phobic Disorders, Risk Factors, Substance-Related Disorders, Young Adult, Depression, Population based study, Representative, Risk factors, Specific phobia, Substance abuse","Although specific phobia is one of the most prevalent lifetime anxiety disorders, little is known about the particular risk factors related to its development. The underlying goal of this study was to analyse the risk factors associated with worrying about specific phobias (SP) in a representative sample of community dwelling adults. The sample was composed of 8461 participants (mean age 47.68 years, range 18–85, 54.60% female), from the Australian National Mental Health Survey. A total of 188 participants (2.22%) reported worrying about SPs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that female sex (odds ratio (OR) = 1.98, p < 0.0001) and a comorbid diagnosis of lifetime major depression disorder (OR = 2.80, p < 0.0001) were the factors most strongly associated with worrying about SPs. Having experienced traumatic experiences involving significant others (OR = 1.18, p = 0.02), the number of chronic diseases (OR = 1.21, p < 0.01), and a comorbid diagnosis of substance use (OR = 2.80, p = 0.02) were also associated. Our results are in line with previous studies focusing on other anxiety disorders. We provide further evidence that substance dependence appears to serve as a unique risk factor for the subsequent onset of SP. Further empirical and clinical implications are discussed.","genergyal, psychologyhiatry, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"
How to approach esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction?,"Patcharatrakul T., Alkaddour A., Pitisuttithum P., Jangsirikul S., Vega K.J., Clarke J.O., Gonlachanvit S.",2020-11-10,"Deglutition Disorders, Esophageal Achalasia, Esophagogastric Junction, Esophagoscopy, Humans, Manometry, dysphagia, esophageal outflow obstruction, esophagogastric junction, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction","The diagnosis of esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO) is currently based on high-resolution esophageal manometry and is characterized by impaired EGJ relaxation with preserved esophageal peristalsis. This condition has been defined by the Chicago Classification as a major esophageal motility disorder, although its clinical significance is controversial since heterogeneous and irrelevant presentations have been reported. EGJOO commonly has a benign clinical course, with spontaneous resolution, but it can also be associated with opioid usage, early achalasia, and mechanical obstruction. A careful medical, surgical, and medication history coupled with a careful manometry interpretation focused on the factors that might affect the integrated relaxation pressure are the keys for an accurate diagnosis. The advance of esophageal physiological tests can evaluate the clearance of the esophageal contents across the EGJ. The manometry technique, including testing in an upright position and provocative tests, can also complement those tests and demonstrate the evidence of EGJ obstruction. After making a diagnosis, endoscopy should be an initial step to exclude anatomical causes if it has not yet been done. Imaging studies can identify infiltrative lesions, but the reported diagnostic yield is relatively low. Management of EGJOO depends on the underlying etiology. Functional EGJOO patients with persistent dysphagia associated with the presence of outflow obstruction may require EGJ disruption therapy.","gastroenterology, neuroscience, biochemistryistry, arts","Neuroscience (all), Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), History and Philosophy of Science"

Interruption of this process could hamper subsequent asexual erythrocytic development of malaria parasites; therefore, these proteins are considered potential vaccine candidates. In Plasmodium vivax, MSP9 (PvMSP9) contains both conserved and polymorphic repetitive domains that were immunogenic upon natural malaria exposure and conferred protection in vaccination studies in animal models. To investigate the extent of sequence diversity at this locus, 104 P. vivax isolates from 4 major malaria endemic areas of Thailand were analyzed. Results revealed that pvmsp9 contained 3 repeat domains (R1–R3) flanked by conserved domains. Repeat domains exhibit extensive sequence and length variation, in which 14, 39 and 16 haplotypes for domains R1–R3, respectively, circulated in this country. Sequence diversity in pvmsp9 among P. vivax isolates from each endemic area displayed population structure. The extent of sequence diversity in pvmsp9 isolates from the provinces of Tak, Chanthaburi, Ubon Ratchathani and Prachuap Khiri Khan in northwestern, eastern, northeastern and southwestern areas, respectively, was almost comparable and was remarkably higher than that from Yala/Narathiwat population in southern Thailand. Evidence for intragenic recombination in this locus was observed within each P. vivax population except among isolates from Yala and Narathiwat. Synonymous nucleotide diversity significantly exceeded nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity in domains R2 and R3, indicating purifying selection. However, micro-scale signatures of positive and negative selections occurred in both conserved and repeat domains, implying two opposing forces, probably from functional or structural constraint and host immune pressure, could have influenced diversity at this locus. The immunodominant T and B cell epitopes so far identified were invariant or highly conserved across isolates. Further analysis of global isolates is warranted for vaccine design based on this protein.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Study Design: Multicenter, randomized, parallel intervention trial. Methods: One hundred two patients underwent microscopic endolaryngeal surgery at four university hospitals. The patients were randomized into moderate NMB (train-of-four 1-2) (M group) or deep NMB (post-tetanic count 1-2) (D group) with moderate or high doses of rocuronium, respectively. Surgical rating conditions (SRCs) were evaluated during the surgery. Sugammadex was given to the M group at 2 mg/kg and the D group at 4 mg/kg. Perioperative clinical signs and conditions were recorded until discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. Results: Clinically acceptable SRC was observed in 49 patients (100%) in the D group and 43 patients (89.6%) in the M group (P =.027). The frequency of notable vocal fold movement in the M group was significantly higher than the D group (70.8% vs. 32.7%). The patients in the M group required more additional doses of rocuronium (47.9%) than the D group (20.4%) to maintain full relaxation (P =.005). The median time (interquartile range) from administration of sugammadex to train-of-four ratio 0.9 in the D group was shorter than the M group (120 [109–180 minutes] vs. 180 minutes [120–240 minutes], P =.034). Conclusions: Deep NMB with high doses of rocuronium combined with 4 mg/kg of sugammadex for reversal during endolaryngeal surgery provided better SRC and anesthetic conditions than moderate NMB of rocuronium with 2 mg/kg of sugammadex.

This work focuses on a multipronged approach for efficient photoreduction of CO2 by designing a CdS/ZnO heterojunction photocatalyst. It is found that the combination of CdS and ZnO leads to about 11 times higher activity (383 K) for the reduction of CO2 to fuels than that over CdS under the irradiation of visible light. This is ascribed to the well-matched structural and intrinsic properties of the CdS/ZnO heterojunction, in which generation of electrons and holes by CdS-captured photons, separation and migration of electrons to ZnO by the heterojunction, and efficient adsorption/activation of CO2 on ZnO all work in a concert and harmonious way. This work highlights the potential of improving the performance of CO2 photocatalytic reduction based on a multipronged approach.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

This research aimed to identify and characterize the FeMV strains detected in a Thai cat population. Results: Two-hundred and ninety-two samples (131 urine and 161 blood) derived from 261 cats (61 sheltered and 200 household cats) were included for investigating the FeMV prevalence using real-time reverse transcription PCR. The overall prevalence of FeMV detection was 11.9% (31/261) among both samples, which accounted for 14.5% (19/131) and 7.5% (12/161) of the urine and blood samples, respectively. Among the FeMV-PCR positive cats, the FeMV-detected prevalence was insignificantly associated with healthy cats (58.1%; 18/31) or urologic cats (41.9%; 13/31). Full-length genome analysis of these FeMV-Thai strains revealed that their genomes clustered together in the FeMV-1A clade with up to 98.5% nucleotide identity. Selective pressure analysis showed that overall FeMV-1 has undergone negative selection, while positive selection sites were more frequently observed in the phosphoprotein gene. Conclusions: The detected FeMV infections in the Thai cat population were not correlated with urologic disorders, although the virus was more detectable in urine samples. The genetic patterns among the FeMV-1 Thai strains were more consistent. A large-scale study of FeMV in Thai cat samples is needed for further elucidation.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

This research aims to develop an active non-resorbable guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane from BCM by conjugating with plant-derived recombinant human osteopontin (p-rhOPN), an economically produced and RGD-containing biomolecule. The BCM was initially grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes to form poly(acrylic acid)-grafted BCM. Multiple carboxyl groups introduced to the BCM by PAA can serve as active anchoring points for p-rhOPN conjugation and yielded p-rhOPN-BCM. All chemically modified BCMs were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while their surface morphology was evaluated by field emission-scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses. The amount of p-rhOPN adhered on the membrane was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The immunocytochemistry, two-stage quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and in vitro mineralization analyses strongly suggested that p-rhOPN-BCM could elicit biological functions leading to the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells as effective as BCM conjugated with commercially available rhOPN from mammalian cells (rhOPN-BCM), suggesting its potential to be used as GTR membrane to promote bone tissue regeneration.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Its effect on a stability problem during undrained loading should be considered in order to get a more accurate and realistic safety assessment. In this paper, the undrained stability of unlined square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays is investigated by the lower bound finite element limit analysis using second-order cone programming. The anisotropic undrained strength of clays is modelled by using an elliptical strength envelope under plane strain conditions. The stability analyses of the problem are performed by the comprehensive investigations of the effects of the cover-depth ratio, the normalized overburden pressure, the normalized strength gradient, and the anisotropic strength ratio on the stability load factor and associated failure mechanisms. The computed lower bound solutions are validated with the existing results of square tunnels in isotropic clays. The new approximate equations of the stability load factor and factor of safety for square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays are first time presented by using a nonlinear regression, hence providing a reliable, accurate and convenient tool for stability analyses of the problem in practice. The numerical results reveal that the strength anisotropy has a significant impact on the stability load factor, especially when anisotropic clays have much difference in undrained strengths between compression and extension.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

There were many prior attempts, including the ones based on deep learning networks. These models were trained using traditional loss function that considers both positives and negatives differences equally. However, the loss of undersupply can cause a power outage, so it is more severe than that of oversupply. In this paper, we propose a new loss function tailor made for the power consumption forecasting task. It is asymmetric by giving more weight on the undersupplying loss in our deep learning networks, which is the dual-stage attentional LSTM models. Also, the model considers renewable energy factors including wind speed and rain data. The rain data infers to intensity of the sun. The renewable energy factors impact the demand of power consumption. The experiment was conducted on Thailand's power consumption data consisting of 5 control areas between 2010 to 2018. Since the power usages can be varied by regions, each area has its own model. The results show that our model outperforms the baseline in terms of mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE). Also, our model can decrease the number of power outages from 279 times to 32 times.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Bioaugmentation has been proposed for the biodegradation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners 4,4′-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) and carbanilide (NCC) in soil. The isolated TCC-degrading strain Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2 and chloroanilines-degrading strain Diaphorobacter sp. LD72 were used to study the removal efficiency of TCC, DCC and NCC mixture and their chloroanilines intermediates, respectively. The potential degradation competition between TCC and its dechlorinated congeners, and the response of bacterial community during the bioremediation were also investigated. The biodegradation of DCC and TCC was significantly enhanced for soil with inoculums compared with sterilized and natural soils. Chloroanilines products could also be effectively removed. For the degradation of combined substrates in the aqueous medium, NCC had negative effect on the degradation of TCC and DCC, while TCC and DCC negatively influenced each other. The bioaugmentation with two degraders obviously changed the phylogenetic composition and function of indigenous soil microbiome. Importantly, the inoculated degraders could be maintained, suggesting their adaptability and potential application in bioaugmentation for such recalcitrant contaminants. This study offers new insights into the enhanced bioremediation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners contaminated soils by the bioaugmentation of functional degraders and the structure and function response of the indigenous soil microbiome to the bioremediation process.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"
Comorbidities associated with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"McHugh T., Levin M., Snidvongs K., Banglawala S.M., Sommer D.D.",2020-07-01,"Aspirin, Asthma, Chronic Disease, Comorbidity, Eosinophilia, Humans, Nasal Polyps, Rhinitis, Severity of Illness Index, Sinusitis, ASA sensitivity, asthma, atopy, eosinophil, histology, immunoglobulin E, nasal polyps, recurrence, sinusitis","Objective: Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is a histological subtype of CRS that is generally recognised as being more difficult to manage. Patients with ECRS tend to have greater disease severity and poorer treatment outcomes after sinus surgery when compared with non-ECRS patients. The histopathology and biomarker assessments of ECRS are often unavailable prior to surgery and may be impractical and costly to analyse. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to understand clinical comorbidities associated with ECRS. Design/Setting: We searched three independent databases for articles that reported clinical CRS comorbidities associated with tissue eosinophilia. Data from studies with the same reported comorbidities were pooled, and a forest plot analysis was used to assess potential associations with four different conditions including allergic rhinitis, ASA sensitivity, asthma and atopy. The association between the phenotype of nasal polyps and ECRS was also quantified as a secondary objective. ECRS cut-off levels were as defined by papers included. Main outcome/Results: Eighteen articles were identified. The presence of nasal polyps (the first numbers in brackets represent odds ratios) (5.85, 95% CI [3.61, 9.49], P <.00001), ASA sensitivity (5.63, 95% CI [3.43, 9.23], P <.00001), allergic rhinitis (1.84, 95% CI [1.27, 2.67], P =.001) and asthma (3.15, 95% CI [2.61, 3.82], P <.00001) were found to be significantly associated with tissue eosinophilia. Atopy, however, was not significantly associated with tissue eosinophilia (1.71, 95% CI [0.59, 4.95], P =.32). Conclusion: Certain clinical disease characteristics such as ASA sensitivity, allergic rhinitis and asthma are more associated with CRS patients with eosinophilia when compared to those without eosinophilia. The phenotype of nasal polyps was also associated with ECRS. It is important for surgeons to recognise these comorbidities to ensure correct diagnoses, management and follow-up are implemented.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology
Effect of carbon number on the production of propylene and ethylene by catalytic cracking of straight-chain alkanes over phosphorus-modified ZSM-5,"Wattanapaphawong P., Reubroycharoen P., Mimura N., Sato O., Yamaguchi A.",2020-06-01,"Carbon number, Effect of carbons, Modified ZSM-5, N-octanes, Phosphorus modification, Straight chain alkanes, ZSM-5 catalysts, ZSM-5 zeolites, Catalytic cracking, Ethylene, n-Octane, Phosphorus modification, Propylene, ZSM-5 zeolite","Phosphorus-modified ZSM-5 (P-ZSM-5) shows catalytic activity for the cracking of alkanes to produce light olefins such as ethylene and propylene.

The percent of n-alkane converted and yields of light olefins increased with increasing carbon number of the reactant hydrocarbon. In the case of n-octane cracking at 923 K, 97.1% conversion of the alkane and 64.5% combined yield of ethylene and propylene were obtained. Up to a reaction time of 30 h, the P-ZSM-5 catalyst was stable and the n-octane conversion remained over 91.2%.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

This study investigated the effects of three polyphenolic antioxidants epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), phyllanthin and hypophyllathin in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced Caco-2 apoptosis. Methods: Cells were treated with ER stressors (indomethacin, diclofenac, tunicamycin or thapsigargin) and the polyphenols for up to 72 h. Cell viability, apoptosis and mitochondrial function were monitored by MTT, Hoechst 33342 and TMRE assays, respectively. Protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. Key findings: Epigallocatechin gallate suppressed increases in p-PERK/p-eIF-2α/ATF-4/CHOP and p-IRE-1α/p-JNK1/2 expression levels in the cells treated with any of the ER stressors, leading to inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, phyllanthin increased apoptosis in the cells subsequently exposed to either diclofenac, tunicamycin or thapsigargin, but not in the indomethacin-treated cells. The potentiation effect of phyllanthin seen with the three ER stressors was related to suppression of survival p-Nrf-2/HO-1 expression, resulting in increased activation of the eIF-2α/ATF-4/CHOP pathway. On the other hand, hypophyllanthin had no significant effect on the ER stressor-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: Epigallocatechin gallate, phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin displayed different effects in the ER stress-mediated apoptosis, depending upon their interaction with the specific unfolded protein response signalling.","genergyal, pharmacology","Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science"

Fifty-five captive small Indian civets (Viverricula indica), farmed for perfume production in Eastern Thailand, showed clinical signs of acute bloody diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, circling, and seizures. The disease spread within the farm and resulted in the death of 38 of the 55 civets (69% mortality) within a month. Fecal swabs were collected from the 17 surviving civets, and necropsy was performed on 7 of the dead civets. Pathologic findings were severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis with generalized lymphadenopathy. CPPV-1 was identified in both fecal swabs and postmortem samples by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Further whole-gene sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) as the causative agent. The viral tropism and tissue distribution were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with immunolabeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus of small intestinal crypt epithelial cells, villous enterocytes, histiocytes in lymphoid tissues, myenteric nerve plexuses, and cerebral and cerebellar neurons. Phylogenetic analysis of civet-derived CPPV-1 indicated a genetic similarity close to the FPV HH-1/86 strain detected in a jaguar (Panthera onca) in China. To our knowledge, this mass die-off of civets is the first evidence of disease associated with CPPV-1 infection in the subfamily Viverrinae. These findings support the multi-host range of parvovirus infection and raises awareness for CPPV-1 disease outbreaks in wildlife species.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Two linear boundaries were experimentally observed for the transitions between no condensation-induced water hammer and non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer. The analytical modeling based on the energy balance equation was conducted to derive the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer. The analytical model suggested that the map of the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer could be displayed by two essential non-dimensional parameters, such as modified Jakob number and Froude number. The model indicated that the slope of the boundary of the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer was the product of modified Stanton number, non-dimensional interfacial area concentration, and non-dimensional temperature difference. The model could predict the boundaries between no condensation-induced water hammer and non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer satisfactorily. The one-dimensional nuclear thermal-hydraulic system analysis code, RELAP5, was used for simulating the onset of the condensation-induced water hammer. The obtained boundary corresponded to the experimentally obtained boundary between non-periodic condensation-induced water hammer and periodic condensation-induced water hammer.","process equipment, energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

The depth of this field is from 300-1,200 meters and the sand thickness is varied from of 1 to 7 meters. For over 60 years of natural production, the field has low oil recovery. The difficulty has been attributed to the unfavorable production. Waterflooding, a secondary recovery, has been studied and the results show that the recovery can increase 4-6%. However, the production can be enhanced more with the tertiary recovery methods or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) which are recommended to increase oil production in this challenging field. However, the proper technologies have not been studied for commercial production yet. These technologies can be thermal recovery, gas injection, microbial enhanced oil recovery and chemical methods. Therefore, it will be the objective of this work to review and screen the EOR method to fit well with oil production in Fang oilfield in order to increase oil production. From this EOR screening, the main results from this study reveal that chemical injection is more appropriate for this field than other techniques because of reservoir characteristics and reservoir fluids. Based on the types of oil and composition in the oil, adding alkaline solution and surfactant can improve oil recovery because they can reduce interfacial tension of oil and to make the mobility higher. On the other hand, for other techniques, thermal recovery can increase mobility because of wax formation but it has higher cost. CO2 injection can increase more oil production. Nevertheless, the sources of CO2 has less supply and is expensive. Now, microbial enhanced oil recovery is on the beginning state and can provide the good potential. Consequently, based on the revision and screening method, the chemical method provide the higher commercial potential and feasibility to enhance oil production in Fang oilfield and the result of this study can be applied to design the plan of oil production operation in the oilfield in the future.","petroleum engineeringneering, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

In this paper, the rotor-position estimation of DFIM by the adaptive reduced-order observer is considered, and the sensitivity to inductance variation is examined. The sensitivity analysis on rotor-position estimation reveals that the effect of inductance variation is exactly the same for all operating rotor speeds, but it varies accordingly to the operating torques; with 15% of inductance variation, the error of rotor-position estimation can be up to 5°. In addition, this sensitivity analysis paves the way to the selection of regressor vector; the magnetizing current is chosen as the regressor of the adaptation scheme in order to strengthen the robust property.

However, the task of performing spelling correction and word normalization (text correction) for Thai social media text has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigated how current text correction systems perform on correcting errors and word variances in Thai social texts and propose a method designed for this task. We have found that currently available Thai text correction systems are insufficiently robust for correcting spelling errors and word variances, while the text correctors designed for English grammatical error correction suffer from overcorrections (text rewrites). Thus, we proposed a neural-based text corrector with a two-stage structure to alleviate issues of overcorrections while exploiting the benefits of a neural Seq2Seq corrector. Our method consists of a neural-based error detector and a Seq2Seq neural error corrector with contextual attention. This novel architecture allows the Seq2Seq network to produce corrections based on both the erroneous text and its context without the need for an end-to-end structure. Our method outperformed all the other evaluated text correction systems. When compared to the second-best result (copy-augmented transformer), our method further reduced the word error rate (WER) from 2.51% to 2.07%, improved the generalized language evaluation understanding (GLEU) score from 0.9409 to 0.9502 on the Thai text correction task, and improved the GLEU score from 0.7409 to 0.7539 on the English spelling correction task.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The conceptual framework was modified from the Nurse Work Environment, Nurse Staffing, and Outcome Model, and five questionnaires were used. The hypothesized model fitted the empirical data and explained 12% of the variance in nursing care quality. Structural equation modeling revealed that nurse work satisfaction negatively affected nursing care quality, while the nurse practice environment and burnout had no effect. Nurse staffing had a positive direct effect on nurse work satisfaction, while nurse work satisfaction did not directly affect burnout. The results indicate that the highest impacting factors influencing nursing care quality were nurse work satisfaction and the indirect effect of nurse staffing on nursing care quality. Therefore, leaders and policymakers in government, health systems, and nursing across the country need to consider these results to enhance nursing care quality.",Nursing,Nursing (all)

Understanding the characteristics and risk factors for peritonitis can guide regional development of prevention strategies. We describe peritonitis rates and the associations of selected facility practices with peritonitis risk among countries participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS). Study Design: Observational prospective cohort study. Setting & Participants: 7,051 adult PD patients in 209 facilities across 7 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States). Exposures: Facility characteristics (census count, facility age, nurse to patient ratio) and selected facility practices (use of automated PD, use of icodextrin or biocompatible PD solutions, antibiotic prophylaxis strategies, duration of PD training). Outcomes: Peritonitis rate (by country, overall and variation across facilities), microbiology patterns. Analytical Approach: Poisson rate estimation, proportional rate models adjusted for selected patient case-mix variables. Results: 2,272 peritonitis episodes were identified in 7,051 patients (crude rate, 0.28 episodes/patient-year). Facility peritonitis rates were variable within each country and exceeded 0.50/patient-year in 10% of facilities. Overall peritonitis rates, in episodes per patient-year, were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.46) in Thailand, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.32-0.46) in the United Kingdom, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.40) in Australia/New Zealand, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.26-0.32) in Canada, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.25-0.30) in Japan, and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.27) in the United States. The microbiology of peritonitis was similar across countries, except in Thailand, where Gram-negative infections and culture-negative peritonitis were more common. Facility size was positively associated with risk for peritonitis in Japan (rate ratio [RR] per 10 patients, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09). Lower peritonitis risk was observed in facilities that had higher automated PD use (RR per 10 percentage points greater, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00), facilities that used antibiotics at catheter insertion (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99), and facilities with PD training duration of 6 or more (vs <6) days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96). Lower peritonitis risk was seen in facilities that used topical exit-site mupirocin or aminoglycoside ointment, but this association did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.01). Limitations: Sampling variation, selection bias (rate estimates), and residual confounding (associations). Conclusions: Important international differences exist in the risk for peritonitis that may result from varied and potentially modifiable treatment practices. These findings may inform future guidelines in potentially setting lower maximally acceptable peritonitis rates.",medical,Nephrology

A prospective, open-label, PK study was conducted in paediatric patients (age 2–18 years) with normal renal function. Patients (n = 20) were randomly assigned to receive either a CMS loading dose (LD group) of 4 mg of colistin base activity (CBA)/kg/dose or a standard initial dose (NLD group) of 2.5 mg (12-h interval) or 1.7 mg (8-h interval) of CBA/kg/dose. Serial blood samples were collected. Plasma concentrations of formed colistin were measured by LC-MS/MS. PK parameters were reported. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was monitored by serum creatinine and urine NGAL. The median (interquartile range) age and body weight were 8.5 (3.5–11.3) years and 21.5 (13.5–20.0) kg.

The characterization of extracellular vesicles-derived microRNAs in Thai malaria patients,"Ketprasit N., Cheng I.S., Deutsch F., Tran N., Imwong M., Combes V., Palasuwan D.",2020-08-10,"Adult, Extracellular Vesicles, Female, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum, Malaria, Vivax, Male, MicroRNAs, Middle Aged, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Thailand, Young Adult, Extracellular vesicles, Malaria, microRNAs, Patients, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax","Background: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been broadly studied in malaria for nearly a decade. These vesicles carry various functional biomolecules including RNA families such as microRNAs (miRNA). These EVs-derived microRNAs have numerous roles in host-parasite interactions and are considered promising biomarkers for disease severity. However, this field lacks clinical studies of malaria-infected samples. In this study, EV specific miRNAs were isolated from the plasma of patients from Thailand infected with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. In addition, it is postulated that these miRNAs were differentially expressed in these groups of patients and had a role in disease onset through the regulation of specific target genes. Methods: EVs were purified from the plasma of Thai P. vivax-infected patients (n = 19), P. falciparum-infected patients (n = 18) and uninfected individuals (n = 20). EV-derived miRNAs were then prepared and abundance of hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p and hsa-miR-150-5p was assessed in these samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed, and relative expression of each miRNA was calculated using hsa-miR-451a as endogenous control. Then, the targets of up-regulated miRNAs and relevant pathways were predicted by using bioinformatics. Receiver Operating Characteristic with Area under the Curve (AUC) was then calculated to assess their diagnostic potential. Results: The relative expression of hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p was higher in P. vivax-infected patients compared to uninfected individuals, but hsa-let-7a-5p was up-regulated in both P. vivax-infected patients and P. falciparum-infected patients. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNAs might regulate genes involved in the malaria pathway including the adherens junction and the transforming growth factor-β pathways. All up-regulated miRNAs could potentially be used as disease biomarkers as determined by AUC; however, the sensitivity and specificity require further investigation. Conclusion: An upregulation of hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p was observed in P. vivax-infected patients while hsa-let-7a-5p was up-regulated in both P. vivax-infected and P. falciparum-infected patients. These findings will require further validation in larger cohort groups of malaria patients to fully understand the contribution of these EVs miRNAs to malaria detection and biology.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

To date, there are no precise injection points recommended that are based on an anatomical study. Objective: This study systematically investigated the vascular pattern and depth of forehead arteries at the periorbital area of upper eyelid. Methods: Twenty cadavers were dissected in this study. Additional data were obtained from 30 healthy volunteers using Doppler ultrasound imaging with high-frequency probe. Results: The ophthalmic artery divided into two opposite primary branches: the superior and inferior orbitoglabellar arteries running along the orbital rim. After the supratrochlear artery arose from the superior orbitoglabellar artery at the medial eyebrow, the supraorbital artery either divided from this artery near the supraorbital foramen or emerged as an individual artery from the supraorbital notch. The inferior orbitoglabellar artery gave off the radix artery superior to the medial canthal tendon. The radix artery divided into two opposite branches: the dorsal nasal artery going to the nose and the paracentral artery going to the glabella. Ultrasound imaging revealed a subcorrugator space that a cannula can safely pass through. At the supraorbital foramen/notch, the supraorbital artery traveled very close to the bone. Based on the anatomical data collected, the following injection points for a needle and a cannula technique are recommended. Conclusion: Correction of a sunken upper eyelid is a dangerous procedure which should be performed only by experienced physicians. However, with precise anatomical knowledge and correct techniques, optimal outcomes can be safely achieved.","ophthalmology, medical",Dermatology

Area covered: This article summarizes the pharmacokinetic characteristics of approved NRTIs that are currently in the international treatment and prevention guidelines. Expert opinion: Compared to other NRTIs, tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is more advantageous in terms of potency and safety. It is therefore a preferred choice in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) in most HIV treatment guidelines. The efficacy of the two-drug combination of NRTI/Integrase strand-transfer inhibitor, i.e. lamivudine/dolutegravir has been approved as an option for initial therapy. This regimen however has some limitations in patients with HBV coinfection. The two NRTI combinations tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC and TAF/FTC have also been approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Interestingly, a promising long-acting nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, formulated for implant was well tolerated and remained effective for up to a year, suggesting its potential as a single agent for PrEP. In the next decade, it remains to be seen whether NRTI-based regimens will remain the backbone of preferred ART regimens, or if the treatment will eventually move toward NRTI-sparing regimens to avoid long-term NRTI-toxicity.",pharmacology,"Toxicology, Pharmacology"
A novel model of injured liver ductal organoids to investigate cholangiocyte apoptosis with relevance to biliary atresia,"Chusilp S., Lee C., Li B., Lee D., Yamoto M., Ganji N., Vejchapipat P., Pierro A.",2020-12-01,"Animals, Animals, Newborn, Apoptosis, Bile Ducts, Biliary Atresia, Disease Models, Animal, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Organoids, Bile duct injury, Cell apoptosis, Fibrogenic cytokine, Organoid","Purpose: The fibrogenic process in cholangiopathic diseases such as biliary atresia (BA) involves bile duct injury and apoptosis of cholangiocytes, which leads to the progression of liver fibrosis into liver cirrhosis and can result in end-staged liver disease. Recent advances in the development of organoids or mini-organ structures have allowed us to create an ex vivo injury model of the bile duct that mimics bile duct injury in BA. The aim of this experimental study was to develop a novel model of injured intrahepatic cholangiocytes as this can be relevant to BA. Our new model is important for studying the pathophysiological response of bile ducts to injury and the role of cholangiocytes in initiating the fibrogenic cascade. In addition, it has the potential to be used as a tool for developing new treatment strategies for BA. Methods: Liver ductal organoids were generated from the liver of healthy neonatal mouse pups. Intrahepatic bile duct fragments were isolated and cultured in Matrigel dome. Injury was induced in the organoids by administration of acetaminophen in culture medium. The organoids were then evaluated for fibrogenic cytokines expression, cell apoptosis marker and cell proliferation marker. Results: Organoids generated from intrahepatic bile duct fragments organized themselves into single-layer epithelial spheroids with lumen on the inside mimicking in vivo bile ducts. After 24-h exposure to acetaminophen, cholangiocytes in the organoids responded to the injury by increasing expression of fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). This fibrogenic response of injured organoids was associated with increased cholangiocyte apoptosis and decreased cholangiocyte proliferation. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first description of cholangiocyte injury in the organoids derived from intrahepatic bile ducts. Our injury model demonstrated that cholangiocyte apoptosis and its fibrogenic response may play a role in initiation of the fibrogenic process in cholangiopathic diseases such as BA. These findings are important for the development of novel therapy to reduce cholangiocyte apoptosis and to halt the early fibrogenic cascade in liver fibrogenesis. This novel injury model can prove very valuable for future research in biliary atresia.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Surgery"

The clinical and biomarker diagnosis of this disorder is hampered by the lack of validated diagnostic criteria and laboratory tests with adequate figures of merit, although there are now many disease biomarkers indicating the pathophysiology of CFS. Here, we review multiple factors, such as immunological and environmental factors, which are associated with CFS and evaluate current concepts on the involvement of immune and environmental factors in the pathophysiology of CFS. The most frequently reported immune dysregulations in CFS are modifications in immunoglobulin contents, changes in B and T cell phenotypes and cytokine profiles, and decreased cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Some of these immune aberrations display a moderate diagnostic performance to externally validate the clinical diagnosis of CFS, including the expression of activation markers and protein kinase R (PKR) activity. Associated with the immune aberrations are activated nitro-oxidative pathways, which may explain the key symptoms of CFS. This review shows that viral and bacterial infections, as well as nutritional deficiencies, may further aggravate the immune-oxidative pathophysiology of CFS. Targeted treatments with antioxidants and lipid replacement treatments may have some clinical efficacy in CFS. We conclude that complex interactions between immune and nitro-oxidative pathways, infectious agents, environmental factors, and nutritional deficiencies play a role in the pathophysiology of CFS.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge gap that causes the irrational use of antibiotics among Thai dentists. Methods: Thai dentists were asked to complete an online questionnaire regarding their knowledge, perception, and attitude towards rationale antibiotic use. The survey was conducted during November to December 2018. Results: Online questionnaires were completed by 588 dentists. Most respondents had a positive perception and were aware of the rational use of antibiotics. However, the use of antibiotics without proper indication and the lack of pharmacological knowledge were found. A mobile application was considered the most preferable approach to manage knowledge for rational drug use. Conclusion: Irrational drug use among Thai dentists can be caused by lack of knowledge, attitude, and the perception of each dentist. Policy makers should promote self-learning through knowledge management strategies that can complement the pharmacology courses taught in dental school.",medical,Health Policy
Performance characteristics and optimal cut-off value of triple adenylate nucleotides test versus adenosine triphosphate test as point-of-care testing for predicting inadequacy of duodenoscope reprocessing,"Ridtitid W., Pakvisal P., Chatsuwan T., Kerr S.J., Piyachaturawat P., Luangsukrerk T., Kongkam P., Rerknimitr R.",2020-10-01,"Adenosine Triphosphate, Bacteria, Cross Infection, Disinfection, Duodenoscopes, Equipment Contamination, Equipment Reuse, Humans, Nucleotides, Point-of-Care Testing, Adenosine triphosphate, Bacterial contamination, Duodenoscopes, Reprocessing, Triple adenylate nucleotides","Background: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test based on one nucleotide has been applied as point-of-care testing (POCT) for bacterial contamination in the medical and food industries. Hypothetically, testing three adenylate nucleotides (A3) may provide better detection of duodenoscope bacterial contamination than ATP test. Aim: To evaluate performance characteristics and optimal cut-off value of A3 and ATP tests in predicting bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes. Methods: Four hundred duodenoscope samples obtained after 100 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures were randomized into group A (A3 test) or B (ATP test). Samples were collected from the elevator at the four-step cleaning process of duodenoscope. We defined the new cut-off value of the test for reaching 100% negative predictive value (NPV) from our receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Findings: Using the cultures from the four-step cleaning process as the reference, the areas under ROC (AUROC) were 0.83 and 0.84 for group A (N = 200) and group B (N = 200), respectively. Using the cultures from post-high-level disinfection (HLD) as the reference, the AUROC were 0.35 and 0.74 for group A (N = 50) and group B (N = 50), respectively. We investigated ATP as a POCT after HLD with a new cut-off value of 40 RLU. However, this threshold did not allow detection of low numbers of bacteria. Conclusion: A3 and ATP tests provide good performances in predicting bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes for the four-step cleaning process. The ATP <40 RLU is helpful as a POCT after HLD; however, the limitation of this cut-off value is its inability to detect low numbers of bacteria.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

A total of 44 gastropod species belonging to 30 genera are described herein, including thirteen new species and one new genus. The new genus is Altotomaria. The new species are Bellerophon erawanensis, Biarmeaspira mazaevi, Apachella thailandensis, Gosseletina microstriata, Worthenia humiligrada, Altotomaria reticulata, Yunnania inflata, Trachydomia suwanneeae, Trachyspira eleganta, Heterosubulites longusapertura, Platyzona gradata, Trypanocochlea lopburiensis and Streptacis? khaokhadensis. Most of the species in the studied assemblage represent vetigastropods (35.6%) and caenogastropods (26.7%) and most of the species belong to Late Palaeozoic cosmopolitan genera. The studied faunas come from shallow water carbonates that are rich in fusulinids, followed by gastropods, ostracods, bivalves and brachiopods. The gastropod assemblage from the Khao Khad Formation shares no species with the gastropod assemblages from other Permian formations in Thailand, the Tak Fa Limestone and the Ratburi Limestone. However, it is similar to the Late Permian gastropod faunas from South China of the Palaeo-Tethys, therefore it suggests that the Indochina Terrane was not located far from South China.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Animal Science and Zoology"
Hearing-impaired population performance and the effect of hearing interventions on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Utoomprurkporn N., Woodall K., Stott J., Costafreda S.G., Bamiou D.E.",2020-09-01,"Aged, Cochlear Implants, Cognitive Dysfunction, Hearing, Hearing Loss, Humans, Mental Status and Dementia Tests, Neuropsychological Tests, cochlear implant, hearing aid, hearing difficulty, hearing disorder, hearing impair*, hearing loss, MeSH subject headings, MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment","Background: Older adults are at high risk of developing age-related hearing loss (HL) and/or cognitive impairment. However, cognitive screening tools rely on oral administration of instructions and stimuli that may be impacted by HL. This systematic review aims to investigate (a) whether people with HL perform worse than those without HL on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a widely used screening tool for cognitive impairment, and what the effect size of that difference is (b) whether HL treatment mitigates the impact of HL. Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis including studies that reported mean MoCA scores and SDs for individuals with HL. Results: People with HL performed significantly worse on the MoCA (4 studies, N = 533) with a pooled mean difference of −1.66 points (95% confidence interval CI -2.74 to −0.58). There was no significant difference in MoCA score between the pre- vs post-hearing intervention (3 studies, N = 75). However, sensitivity analysis in the cochlear implant studies (2 studies, N = 33) showed improvement of the MoCA score by 1.73 (95% CI 0.18 to 3.28). Conclusion: People with HL score significantly lower than individuals with normal hearing on the standard orally administered MoCA. Clinicians should consider listening conditions when administering the MoCA and report the hearing status of the tested individuals, if known, taking this into account in interpretation or make note of any hearing difficulty during consultations which may warrant onward referral. Cochlear implants may improve the MoCA score of individuals with HL, and more evidence is required on other treatments.

These volcanic rocks are classified as rhyolite, dacite, and andesite whereas dikes are also characterized by andesitic composition. These dikes clearly cut into the volcanic rocks and Late Permian hornblende granite in the adjacent area. Rhyolite and dacite are composed of abundant plagioclase and quartz whereas andesite and andesitic dike contain mainly plagioclase and hornblende with minor quartz. The volcanic rocks typically show plagioclase and hornblende phenocrysts embedded in fine-grained quartz and glass groundmass whereas dike rocks contain less glass matrix with more albitic laths. P–T conditions of crystallization are estimated, on the basis of Al-in-hornblende geobarometry and hornblende geothermometry, at about 4.5–5.5 kbar, 861–927°C and 4.8–5.5 kbar, 873–890°C for the magma intrusions that fed volcanic rocks and andesitic dikes, respectively. Whole-rock geochemistry indicates that these rock suites are related to calc-alkaline hydrous magma. The enriched large-ion lithophile elements (LILE; e.g., Rb, Sr) and depleted high-field-strength elements (HFSE; e.g., Nb, Ce, Ti), with similar rare earth element (REE) patterns indicate arc magmatism. The results of this study are comparable with the continental arc magmatism along the Loei Fold Belt (LFB) as a consequence of the Late Permian Palaeo-Tethys subducted beneath Indochina Terrane.","water engineeringneering, igneous petrology and processes, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Unfortunately, large amounts of municipal-solid-waste-incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) is produced in the process, with their heavy metals content posing further problems to the environment. One fundamental treatment of MSWI FA heavy metals is called solidification-stabilization, where MSWI FA is solidified in cement-based materials to cap hazardous elements from being released into the environment. Mortar formed from this cement mixed with MSWI FA suffer from decreased compressive strength due to their chloride and sulfate contents. Thus, pre-treatment of MSWI FA to remove these salts before producing mortar is desirable. This study investigated treating MSWI FA with deionized water, 0.01 M and 0.1 M nitric acid, and 0.1 M and 0.25 M sodium carbonate to remove chloride and sulfate. Physical and chemical structures of treated and untreated MSWI FA was studied to understand the chloride and sulfate removal mechanisms. Treated MSWI FA was used as cement replacement in mortar, and the compressive strength was tested. Results suggest that all of the treatment solutions tested in this study can equally remove chloride (around 250,000 mg/kg), but sodium carbonate can remove sulfate at the highest extent (15,821 mg/kg). In addition, mortar with deionized-water-treated MSWI FA gave the highest compressive strength. Heavy metals leaching was tested by the Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure (TCLP) method, with results passing the standard.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, waste management and pollution policy, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

Its profile in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is largely unknown. We studied the liver injury patterns of SARS-Cov-2 in CLD patients, with or without cirrhosis. Methods: Data was collected from 13 Asian countries on patients with CLD, known or newly diagnosed, with confirmed COVID-19. Results: Altogether, 228 patients [185 CLD without cirrhosis and 43 with cirrhosis] were enrolled, with comorbidities in nearly 80%. Metabolism associated fatty liver disease (113, 61%) and viral etiology (26, 60%) were common. In CLD without cirrhosis, diabetes [57.7% vs 39.7%, OR = 2.1 (1.1–3.7), p = 0.01] and in cirrhotics, obesity, [64.3% vs. 17.2%, OR = 8.1 (1.9–38.8), p = 0.002] predisposed more to liver injury than those without these. Forty three percent of CLD without cirrhosis presented as acute liver injury and 20% cirrhotics presented with either acute-on-chronic liver failure [5 (11.6%)] or acute decompensation [4 (9%)]. Liver related complications increased (p < 0.05) with stage of liver disease; a Child-Turcotte Pugh score of 9 or more at presentation predicted high mortality [AUROC 0.94, HR = 19.2 (95 CI 2.3–163.3), p < 0.001, sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 94.4%). In decompensated cirrhotics, the liver injury was progressive in 57% patients, with 43% mortality. Rising bilirubin and AST/ALT ratio predicted mortality among cirrhosis patients. Conclusions: SARS-Cov-2 infection causes significant liver injury in CLD patients, decompensating one fifth of cirrhosis, and worsening the clinical status of the already decompensated. The CLD patients with diabetes and obesity are more vulnerable and should be closely monitored.",medical,Hepatology
Impact of sugar-sweetened beverage tax on dental caries: A simulation analysis,"Urwannachotima N., Hanvoravongchai P., Ansah J.P., Prasertsom P., Koh V.R.Y.",2020-03-18,"Adult, Dental Caries, Female, Humans, Male, Sugar-Sweetened Beverages, Taxes, Thailand, Computer simulation, Dental caries, Dental public health, Sugar consumption, Sugar-sweetened beverage tax, System dynamics model, System science","Background: The tiered sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax was implemented in Thailand to encourage industries to reduce sugar content in beverages, and consequently reduce sugar consumption in the population. The aim of the study is to explore the expected impact of the new SSB tax policy in Thailand, a middle-income country in Asia, and other alternative policies on oral health outcomes as measured by the prevalence and severity of dental caries among the Thai population. Methods: A qualitative system dynamics model that captures the complex interrelationships among SSB tax, sugar consumption and dental caries, was elicited through participatory stakeholder engagement. Based on the qualitative model, a quantitative system dynamics model was developed to simulate the SSB tax policy and other alternative scenarios in order to evaluate their impact on dental caries among Thai adults from 2010 to 2040. Results: Under the base-case scenario, the dental caries prevalence among the Thai population 15 years and older, is projected to increase from 61.3% in 2010 to 74.9% by 2040. Implementation of SSB tax policy is expected to decrease the prevalence of dental caries by only 1% by 2040, whereas the aggressive policy is projected to decrease prevalence of dental caries by 21% by 2040. Conclusions: In countries where a majority of the sugar consumed is from non-tax sugary food and beverages, especially Asian countries where street food culture is ubiquitous and contributes disproportionately to sugar intake, SSB tax alone is unlikely to have meaningful impact on oral health unless it is accompanied with a comprehensive public health policy that aims to reduce total sugar intake from non-SSB sources.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 433 students were examined in the 1st grade and followed up until the 6th grade. Each student was annually assessed for caries as per the World Health Organization index. Binary simple and multiple logistic regressions were performed to assess risk or protective factors with a P-value ≤0.05. Results: In 1st graders, the caries prevalence in deciduous teeth was 87.2%, and the mean decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) index was 6.44 (±4.4); in 6th graders, the caries prevalence in permanent teeth was 51.7%, and the mean DMFT was 1.37 (±1.84). Protective factors for caries in permanent teeth were complete participation in the program, receiving fluoride varnish >4 times, and sealant applications on all first molars. Risk factors were female sex and caries prevalence in deciduous teeth. After multiple logistic regression, sealant application only remained significant, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06–0.63, P = 0.007), and for risk factor, caries prevalence in deciduous teeth only remained significant, with an OR of 5.44 (95% CI = 2.23–13.27, P < 0.001). Conclusions: There is an association between deciduous dentition caries and permanent dentition caries. Early prevention in school settings by applying fluoride varnish and dental sealants onto molars is protective and feasible. The study suggests that regular fluoride varnish and sealant applications should be extended to similar low-income area schools.","genergyal, Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, medical","Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Instead of disposing the used cooking oil as waste, recent technological advance has enabled the use of WCO as a sustainable feedstock for biofuels production, thereby maximising the value of biowastes via energy recovery while concomitantly solving the disposal issue. The current regulatory frameworks for WCO collection and recycling practices imposed by major WCO producing countries are reviewed, followed by the overview of the progress in biodiesel conversion techniques, along with novel methods to improve the feasibility for upscaling. The factors which influence the efficiency of the reactions such as properties of feedstock, heterogenous catalytic processes, cost effectiveness and selectivity of reaction product are discussed. Ultrasonic-assisted transesterification is found to be the least energy intensive method for producing biodiesel. The production of bio-jet fuels from WCO, while scarce, provide diversity in waste utilisation if problems such as carbon chain length, requirements of bio-jet fuel properties, extreme reaction conditions and effectiveness of selected catalyst-support system can be solved. Technoeconomic studies revealed that WCO biofuels is financially viable with benefit of mitigating carbon emissions, provided that the price gap between the produced fuel and commercial fuels, sufficient supply of WCO and variation in the oil properties are addressed. This review shows that WCO is a biowaste with high potential for advanced transportation fuel production for ground and aviation industries. The advancement in fuel production technology and relevant policies would accelerate the application of sustainable WCO biofuels.","petroleum engineeringneering, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Methods: Nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires (Ormco, Glendora, CA), 0.016 × 0.022-inch, were bent by cold-hardening bending and DERHT methods into 1-mm, 2-mm, or 3-mm offset for a 3-point bending test, and at angles of 30°, 45°, or 60° to the horizontal plane for testing the change in transformation temperature (Af) measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The data were analysed using ANOVA followed by the Scheffe post-hoc test. Results: The 3-point bending test results of the cold-hardening bending and DERHT methods were not significantly different between the 1-mm, 2-mm and 3-mm offset groups (95% CI: −0.05 to 0.97; P = 0.082, 95% CI: −0.65 to 0.74; P = 0.983 and 95% CI: −0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.813, respectively). Increasing the offset resulted in a significantly decreased force in the 3-point bending test (P < 0.001). The Af temperatures of the cold-hardening bending and DERHT methods were not significantly different for the 30°, 45°, and 60° bending angulations (95% CI: −1.93 to 1.39; P = 0.876, 95% CI: −1.2 to 0.87; P = 0.878, 95% CI: −2.24 to 1.18; P = 0.636, respectively). Af temperatures were not influenced by different bending angulations. Conclusions: NiTi archwire shape can be modified by using both cold-hardening and DERHT bending methods, because the mechanical properties and Af temperature are not affected. However, the bending distance has an effect on the mechanical properties.",dentistry,Orthodontics

The alloy has so far been grown only by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy and this work represents the first epitaxial results of the alloy grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), an alternative technique and better suited for low-temperature processes involving Bismuth. Crystalline quality of the alloys is probed by high-resolution x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) which show that smooth and optically active films can be grown in limited parameter windows. Temperature-dependent PL shows that the 200 nm, MBE-grown GaAs0.38P0.44Bi0.18 film (the composition estimated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) has a band gap temperature stability close to that of GaAsBi, and superior to GaAs. The role of Bi in the quaternary alloy is complicated: Bi not only gets incorporated into the growing film but also enhances the P molar fraction. Based on this insight, strategies for growing GaAsPBi epilayers which are lattice-matched to GaAs are described, potentially affecting many important III-V based heterostructures such as lasers, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

In this study, a serological survey of AIV subtype H5 and H9 was conducted in a live bird market (LBM) in Yangon, Myanmar during February 2016 to September 2016. A total of 621 serum samples were collected from chickens (n = 489) and ducks (n = 132) from 48 vendors in the LBM. The samples were examined for antibodies against influenza viruses by using NP-ELISA and specific antibodies against AIV-H5N1 (Clade 2.3.4) and AIV-H9N2 (Clade 9.4.2) by using Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay. The result of NP-ELISA assay showed that 12.88 % (80/621) of poultry in LBM was positive for AIV antibodies. In detail, 38.06 % (51/134) of layers, 7.08 % (8/113) of backyard chicken, 2.07 % (5/242) of broilers and 12.12 % (16/132) of ducks were AIV positive. The HI test for specific antibodies against AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 were 1.77 % (11/621) and 4.51 % (28/621), respectively. Our findings revealed the evidence of AIV-H5N1 and AIV-H9N2 exposure in both chicken and ducks in the LBM in Yangon, Myanmar. Risks of influenza infections and transmission among poultry and humans in the LBMs could not be ignored.","medical, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Allergy, Microbiology, Immunology, Veterinary (all), Infectious Diseases"
Comparison between ferrihydrite adsorption and full-scale advanced drinking water treatment processes for controlling bacterial regrowth potential,"Yang Y., Lohwacharin J., Takizawa S., Hou L.-A.",2020-02-01,"Assimilable organic carbon, Bacteria regrowth, Bacterial regrowth potentials, Biological activated carbon, Dissolved organic matters, Drinking water treatment process, Excitation emission matrices, Ferrihydrites, Adsorption, Bacteria, Chromatography, Gel, Drinking Water, Ferric Compounds, Phosphates, Water Purification, Assimilable organic carbon (AOC), Bacteria regrowth potential (BRP), Bacterial stability, Ferrihydrite, Phosphate","Bacterial regrowth in drinking water systems is a threat to public health. In this study, ferrihydrite (Fh) adsorption was compared with advanced drinking water treatment processes (ADWTP) during one and a half years of sampling to test the reduction in assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and bacterial regrowth potential (BRP). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was removed by Fh through ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction. The DOM removal was higher below pH 6 due to protonation of Fh surfaces. The ADWTP exhibited higher removal rates of DOM than Fh and lower phosphate removal rates than Fh. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealed that Fh removed aromatic DOM larger than 1000 Da, while the biological activated carbon (BAC) of ADWTP could remove DOM smaller than 1000 Da. These differences of organic compositions resulted in the lowest AOC of BAC treated water, and the lowest BRP of Fh-treated water, indicating that it was the most biostable water. Phosphate addition experiments illustrated that phosphorus was the primary rate limiting nutrient, indicating that the higher phosphate removal of Fh made it possible to produce waters with lower BRP than ADWTP. Therefore, BRP is considered to be a better indicator of bacterial regrowth than AOC when phosphorus is a rate-limiting nutrient, as is the case with the Fh treatment.","geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Polar codes are used for the control channel in 5G wireless communication deployment. So, the channel decoding schemes used to decode the received codeword must be properly analyzed for efficient utilization of 5G. This paper performed a comparative analysis of the distinct channel state-based capabilities of decoding of the two different contenders of polar code decoders: 1) Successive Cancelation (SC) decoder and 2) Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoder. Here we have analyzed both the decoders in terms of the various combinations of high and low Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) of the received codewords from the channel. This investigation has revealed that even the SCL decoder always explores more decodable candidates than the SC counterpart, under some specific received codewords the SC may decode better.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics","Computer Networks and Communications, Signal Processing, Instrumentation, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"

Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were used to investigate the selective etching performances. The removal of β-Sn matrix was conducted at a fixed potential of-350 mV. Average performances of 2.19 and 2.30 mA were attained from the chronoamperometry. The efficiency of β-Sn removal was approved according to the reduction of the intensities on the phase analysis. Successful observation of the TiO2 near the Cu6Sn5 layer was attained for an optimum duration of 120 s. Clusters of TiO2 nanoparticles were entrapped by Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer network and at the solder/substrate interface. The presence of TiO2 nanoparticles at the solder interface suppresses the growth of the Cu6Sn5 IMC layer. The absence of a β-Sn matrix also allowed in-depth morphological observations to be made of the shape and size of the Cu6Sn5 and Ag3Sn. It was found that TiO2 content facilitates the β-Sn removal, which allows better observation of the IMC phases as well as the TiO2 reinforcement particles.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

At present, PV systems are equipped with a local control function (LCF). The conventional algorithm is then applied for power flow analysis with the LCF of each PV system, where the power output of LCF of each PV system is calculated and used in the power flow calculation. The conventional algorithm is terminated when the voltage at each iteration of the power flow algorithm is converged. However, the conventional algorithm inevitably requires a lengthy calculation. This paper proposes a power flow algorithm that applies the Newton–Raphson technique to handle multiple PV systems with an LCF for a faster calculation. The LCF is approximated to have a continuous characteristic. The developed power flow algorithm can be used for a three-phase unbalanced distribution system and its effectiveness was demonstrated in a modified 19-node distribution system. © 2020 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The CEO nanoemulsions were formed using an ultrasonic bath (43 kHz at power output of 210 W) and an ultrasonic probe (24 kHz at power of 400 W). Probe ultrasonication outperformed bath ultrasonication since it produced nanoemulsions with smaller droplet size, narrower size distribution as measured using polydispersity index (PDI), and higher viscosity. The influences of sonication time of 180.23–351.77 s, temperature of 4.82–45.18 °C, and Tween® 80 concentration of 1–3% w/w on the droplet size, PDI, and viscosity were investigated using RSM based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The RSM revealed that the sonication time of 266 s, temperature of 4.82 °C, and Tween® 80 of 3% w/w produced the optimum CEO nanoemulsion with droplet size of 65.98 nm, PDI of 0.15, and viscosity of 1.67 mPa.s. Moreover, the optimum nanoemulsion had good stability in terms of droplet size and PDI when storing at 4, 30, and 45 °C for 90 days. The antifungal activity of the optimum CEO nanoemulsion was then investigated against Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus arrhizus, Penicillium sp., and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in comparison to CEO coarse emulsion. The results showed that the CEO nanoemulsion had better antifungal activity than coarse emulsion of CEO.","environmental, coastal engineering, medical, physics, chemistry","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The detergency of oily soils with EACN ranging from 5.2 to 16.6 was evaluated using C10-4PO-SO4Na as a primary surfactant system and a 1:1 binary mixture of C10-4PO-SO4Na and AOT as a confirmatory surfactant system (with 65/35 polyester/cotton at 25°C). These surfactant systems were characterized using HLD concepts which showed that C10-4PO-SO4Na was more hydrophilic (had a higher negative Cc value) than that of the mixed surfactant system. Detergency of the selected soils was evaluated at different salinities corresponding to HLD ranging from negative to positive values. The results showed that detergency of all soils increased with increasing salinity (starting with an HLD = −3.0 (Winsor Type I microemulsion)), reached the maximum at widely different optimum salinity (S*) but at an identical HLD value of zero (optimum Type III), and then decreased with further increasing salt levels corresponding to positive HLD values (Type II). The preferred HLD range from −3.0 to 0.0 showed detergency levels exceeding 80% removal with interfacial tension values (IFT) below 1 mN m−1 for all oily soils studied. Detergency of octadecane (EACN = 18, solid at 25°C) was further conducted and demonstrated that performing detergency at HLD = −3.0 to 0.0 likewise revealed superior soil removal (over 80%) versus systems with HLD values outside this range. Thus, this work highlighted the utility of using the HLD approach in designing surfactant formulations for detergency of soils with widely varying EACN.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"
Enhancing thermal and chemical sensitivity of polydiacetylene colorimetric sensors: The opposite effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles,"Phonchai N., Khanantong C., Kielar F., Traiphol R., Traiphol N.",2020-02-20,"Chemical sensitivity, Colorimetric sensors, Concentration ranges, Enhanced sensitivity, Intercalation process, Packing structure, Polydiacetylenes, Thermochromism, Chemical sensor, Intercalation, Packing structure, Polydiacetylene, Reversible thermochromism","This contribution presents our continuing effort to develop polydiacetylene (PDA)/zinc(II) ion (Zn2+)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite for colorimetric sensing. In our previous studies, PDAs with monocarboxylic headgroup have been used to fabricate the nanocomposites. The incorporation of Zn2+/ZnO enhances overall interactions, resulting in reversible thermochromism with color-transition temperature (TCT) higher than that of the original PDA. Here, we extend this concept to the system of 3-(pentacosa-10,12-diynamido) benzoic acid (PCDA-mBzA) monomer constituting aromatic headgroup. Pure poly(PCDA-mBzA) assemblies exhibit reversible thermochromism with TCT ∼90 °C. Interestingly, the fabrication of poly(PCDA-mBzA)/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites using 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of ZnO nanoparticles results in a systematic decrease of TCT to about 80, 70 and 60 °C, respectively while the reversible thermochromism remains. The observed effect of ZnO nanoparticles is opposite to our previous studies. Structural analysis by utilizing infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction reveals that the Zn2+ ions intercalate the bilayer structure of poly(PCDA-mBzA). The intercalation process perturbs local organization of aromatic headgroups, reducing the strength of overall interactions. Colorimetric sensors in solution and thin film coated on nylon membrane with enhanced sensitivity are fabricated to detect cationic surfactant and organic solvent at various concentration ranges.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

In the Philippines, rice husks are usually burned in open air and either usually left in the field or rarely collected to be sold in the wet market as a cleanser. Hence in this study, an alternative use of this burning residue (rice husks ash, RHA) for removal of dyes from aqueous solutions was explored. Yet, its applications in real wastewater will be difficult in its pristine powdered form. Therefore, the RHA was functionalized with Fe3O4 to become inherently magnetic (MRHA), providing relative ease in handling. The RHA used was obtained from the local markets of Davao City, Philippines. Systematic adsorption studies on the effects of contact time, solution pH, solid/liquid ratio, and feed concentration were conducted. MB adsorption was Langmuir-type and followed a pseudo-second-order rate model. Its adsorption rate is significantly fast (t = 10 min, k2 = 0.015 g mg-1 min-1) with high qm (150.5 mg g−1).

Furthermore, the microscopic techniques (scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy) showed the characteristic of a long length channel and retained SBA-15 structure after incorporation of Cu, even at high copper loadings, and had a higher copper content loading with a longer length of Cu-SBA-15. In addition, the 9% Cu-SBA-15 was characterized by broad X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) which was used to inspect the aggregation and formation of CuO and no peak was observed. All evidence suggested that the Cu-SBA-15 successfully prepared and discovered the active copper species. In-situ XAS showed that to produce active copper species in Cu-SBA-15, heating under a helium atmosphere at 350 °C for 30 min was sufficient for the formation of bridge oxygen (Cu-Ox-Cu) with the characteristics of mono(u-oxo)dicopper and bis(u-oxo)dicopper.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

Capsaicin has important anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that allow to be applied as treatment for several diseases. However, its lack of water solubility, as well as its poor oral bioavailability in biological systems, show limiting factors for its successful application. Recently, the formulation of capsaicin for food and pharmaceutical use is limited. Therefore, the present study emphasized on preparation of capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CAP-CSNPs) and design and optimization of the formulation using Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). The capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification and ionotropic gelification. The optimized formulation of capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles had a chitosan concentration of 0.11 (%w/v), a Tween 80® concentration of 1.55 (%w/v) and a CAP concentration of 1 mg/mL and that it should be stored at 4℃. Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology was found to be a powerful technique for design and optimization of the preparation of capsaicin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles using limited number of experimental runs.

We aimed to describe determinants of empiric antibiotic use in PICUs in eight different countries. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: PICUs in Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Thailand, and Brazil. Subjects: Pediatric intensivists. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We used literature review and focus groups to develop the survey and its clinical scenarios (pneumonia, septic shock, meningitis, and intra-abdominal infections) in which cultures were unreliable due to antibiotic pretreatment. Data analyses included descriptive statistics and linear regression with bootstrapped ses. Overall response rate was 39% (482/1,251), with individual country response rates ranging from 25% to 76%. Respondents in all countries prolonged antibiotic duration based on patient characteristics, disease severity, pathogens, and radiologic findings (from a median increase of 1.8 d [95% CI, 0.5-4.0 d] to 9.5 d [95% CI, 8.5-10.5 d]). Younger age, severe disease, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prolonged antibiotic treatment duration despite a lack of evidence for such practices. No variables were reported to shorten treatment duration for all countries. Importantly, more than 39% of respondents would use greater than or equal to 7 days of antibiotics for patients with a positive viral polymerase chain reaction test in all scenarios, except in France for pneumonia (29%), septic shock (13%), and meningitis (6%). The use of elevated levels of inflammatory markers to prolong antibiotic treatment duration varied among different countries.

Mastering nocturnal jigsaws in Parkinson’s disease: a dusk-to-dawn review of night-time symptoms,"Bhidayasiri R., Sringean J., Trenkwalder C.",2020-05-01,"Humans, Parasomnias, Parkinson Disease, Excessive daytime somnolence, Insomnia, Nocturia, Nocturnal hypokinesia, Nocturnal manifestations, Parkinson’s disease, REM sleep behaviour disorder","Finding out about night-time symptoms from Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients can be a challenge as many patients and their carers cannot recall many symptoms that occur during the night, resulting in an under-recognition or a large variability of responses from clinical interviews and scales. Moreover, technology-based assessments for most night-time symptoms are still not universally available for use in a patient’s home environment. Therefore, most physicians rely on their clinical acumen to capture these night-time symptoms based on pieces of patients’ history, bedpartner’s reports, clinical features, associated symptoms or conditions. To capture more night-time symptoms, the authors identified common nocturnal symptoms based on how they manifest from dusk to dawn with selected features relevant to PD. While some symptoms occur in healthy individuals, in PD patients, they may impact differently. The authors intend this narrative review to provide a practical guide on how these common night-time symptoms manifest and highlight pertinent issues by focusing on prevalence, clinical symptomatology, and specific relationships to PD. It is also important to recognise that PD-specific sleep disturbances increase with advancing disease with additional contributions from ageing, comorbidities, and medication side effects. However, the relative contribution of each factor to individual symptom may be different in individual patient, necessitating clinical expertise for individual interpretation. While there are debatable issues in certain areas, they underlie the complexity of night-time symptoms. Understanding night-time symptoms in PD is like re-arranging jigsaw pieces of clinical information to create, but never complete, a picture for physicians to instigate appropriate management.","neuroscienceology and neuroscienceosurgery, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

The highest levels of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activities were presented by CFM hydrolysate derived using 5 wt% Neutrase and digested for 4 h. Fractionation of this particular hydrolysate was then performed by applying 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes. It was then determined that the molecular weight (MW) < 0.65 kDa fraction achieved the greatest level of free radical scavenging activity in the context of DPPH and ABTS. The MW < 0.65 kDa fraction then underwent additional fractionation using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to derive 3 main fractions designated as F1, F2, and F3. All of these fractions presented a high level of activity in DPPH radical scavenging, although no significant ABTS scavenging was observed. Quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry was used in determining the peptide contents of the fractions as Phe-Asp-Asp-Arg-Gly-Arg-X for F1 (FDDRGRX, 875 Da), Val-Thr-Leu-Ala-Val-Thr-Lys-His for F2 (VTLAVTKH, 868 Da), and Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-X-Ser-Ile-Pro-Ile-Ser for F3 (VSEIXSIPIS, 1,055 Da). Moreover, the F2 fraction was shown to be capable of preventing DNA damage induced by hydroxyl radicals, as indicated in tests using the plasmids pKS, pUC19, and pBR322 via the Fenton reaction. This outcome was demonstrated through in vitro antiproliferative activity in human cell lines based on SW620 colon cancer, using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay.

PEMFCs need low temperature for the operation along with high power density and easy implementation ability. These characteristics turned them into the most interesting type of fuel cells. However, PEMFCs need a technique for keeping them in a desired operating point. This is an essential item, especially during the current variation. In this study, a new configuration is proposed for designing an optimal PEMFC system. Two-phase interleaved boost DC/DC converter is also utilized for increasing the output voltage terminal. LQR optimal strategy is used for regulating the PEMFC. For improving the efficiency of the proposed LQR controller, a newly developed version of the whale optimization algorithm, called improved chaotic whale optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results of the proposed system are compared with different methods and the results showed that the proposed system has higher efficiency from the viewpoint of the current ripple and overshoot.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)
Risk-constrained stochastic power procurement of storage-based large electricity consumer,"Cao Y., Wang Q., Fan Q., Nojavan S., Jermsittiparsert K.",2020-04-01,"Downside risks, Electricity consumers, Energy trading, Industrial consumers, Optimization problems, Procurement process, Stochastic problems, Uncertain parameters, Downside risk constraints, Energy storage management, Energy trading and business, Large electricity consumer, Risk-measuring, Stochastic programming","Large electricity consumers can be either a large industrial consumer or a coalition of small electricity consumers. Large consumers (LCs) confront with various uncertainties due to the use of various power resources in the power procurement process, such as renewable resources, self-generation units, forward contracts, and pool market. These uncertainties can be lead to many financial risks for LCs. In this paper, the stochastic power procurement problem of large consumers is solved, and the new risk-measurement method is used to analyze the large consumer risks in power procurement process. The mentioned risk-measurement method is called downside risk constraints (DRC) method, which is used to model the financial risk imposed from uncertain parameters along with the stochastic problems. According to obtained results, it can be concluded that DRC method is a non-equilibrium method, which is applied clearly as a constraint to the optimization problem. In addition by using the DRC, LC can experience lower-risk strategy in the power procurement problem. Also, using DRC can make the total cost of large consumer independent of scenarios, which led to the lower-risk experiencing by the large consumer. Finally, results are expressed that lower-risk cost in DRC is less than the cost of the worst scenario in stochastic programming.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Plant hormone induced enrichment of Chlorella sp. omega-3 fatty acids,"Sivaramakrishnan R., Incharoensakdi A.",2020-01-17,"Antioxidant enzyme, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid, Micro-algae, Plant hormone, Antioxidant enzymes, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid, Microalgae, Plant hormone, ROS","Background: Omega-3 fatty acids have various health benefits in combating against neurological problems, cancers, cardiac problems and hypertriglyceridemia. The main dietary omega-3 fatty acids are obtained from marine fish. Due to the pollution of marine environment, recently microalgae are considered as the promising source for the omega-3 fatty acid production. However, the demand and high production cost associated with microalgal biomass make it necessary to implement novel strategies in improving the biomass and omega-3 fatty acids from microalgae. Results: Four plant hormones zeatin, indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GBA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were investigated for their effect on the production of biomass and lipid in isolated Chlorella sp. The cells showed an increase of the biomass and lipid content after treatments with the plant hormones where the highest stimulatory effect was observed in ABA-treated cells. On the other hand, IAA showed the highest stimulatory effect on the omega-3 fatty acids content, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (23.25%) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (26.06%). On the other hand, cells treated with ABA had highest lipid content suitable for the biodiesel applications. The determination of ROS markers, antioxidant enzymes, and fatty acid biosynthesis genes after plant hormones treatment helped elucidate the mechanism underlying the improvement in biomass, lipid content and omega-3 fatty acids. All four plant hormones upregulated the fatty acid biosynthesis genes, whereas IAA particularly increased omega-3-fatty acids as a result of the upregulation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. Conclusions: The contents of omega-3 fatty acids, the clinically important compounds, were considerably improved in IAA-treated cells. The highest lipid content obtained from ABA-treated biomass can be used for biodiesel application according to its biodiesel properties. The EPA and DHA enriched ethyl esters are an approved form of omega-3 fatty acids by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which can be utilized as the therapeutic treatment for the severe hypertriglyceridemia.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology, energy, environmental","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

This study aimed to determine the factors of newborn postnatal care utilization from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS) conducted from 2006-2018. Methods: We analyzed data from three rounds of cross-sectional, nationally representative PDHS 2006-07, 2012-13, and 2017-18. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore factors associated with utilization of newborn postnatal care within two months. Results: This study included 5724 women from the 2006-07 PDHS, 7461 from the 2012-13 survey, and 8287 from the 2017-18 survey. The proportion of women receiving newborn postnatal care within the first two months of delivery increased from 13% in 2006-07 to 43% in 2012-13 but dropped to 27% in 2017-18. Respondent's occupation and prenatal care utilization of maternal health services were common factors that significantly influenced newborn postnatal care utilization within two months. The utilization of postnatal care was greater among women having educated husbands and where the first child was a male in PDHS 2007 round. Higher wealth index and educated respondent had higher postnatal care utilization odds in DHS 2012 and DHS 2018. However, the odds of using postnatal care decreased with the number of household members and total number of children ever born in DHS 2012 and 2018 rounds. Conclusions: There was a general increase in the proportion of women who utilized postnatal care for their newborns during 2006-2013 but a decrease in 2018. The decreased utilization in 2018 warrants further investigation. Improving women's economic status, education, employment, and antenatal care attendance and reducing parity may increase newborn postnatal care utilization.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"
Dominance status and copulatory vocalizations among male stump-tailed macaques in Thailand,"Toyoda A., Maruhashi T., Malaivijitnond S., Koda H.",2020-09-01,"Animals, Copulation, Macaca arctoides, Male, Social Dominance, Thailand, Vocalization, Animal, Male copulation vocalizations, Male status, Multi-male multi-female society, Sexual strategy","Male copulation calls sometimes play important roles in sexual strategies, attracting conspecific females or advertising their social status to conspecific males. These calls generally occur in sexually competitive societies such as harem groups and multi-male and multi-female societies. However, the call functions remain unclear because of limited availability of data sets that include a large number of male and female animals in naturalistic environments, particularly in primates. Here, we examined the possible function of male-specific copulation calls in wild stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides) by analyzing the contexts and acoustic features of vocalizations. We observed 395 wild stump-tailed macaques inhabiting the Khao Krapuk Khao Taomor Non-Hunting Area in Thailand and recorded all occurrences of observed copulations. We counted 446 male-specific calls in 383 copulations recorded, and measured their acoustic characteristics. Data were categorized into three groups depending on their social status: dominant (alpha and coalition) males and non-dominant males. When comparing male status, alpha males most frequently produced copulation calls at ejaculation, coalition males produced less frequent calls than alpha males, and other non-dominant males rarely vocalized, maintaining silence even when mounting females. Acoustic analysis indicated no significant influence of status (alpha or coalition) on call number, bout duration, or further formant dispersion parameters. Our results suggest that male copulation calls of this species are social status-dependent signals. Furthermore, dominant males might actively transmit their social status and copulations to other male rivals to impede their challenging attacks, while other non-dominant males maintain silence to prevent the interference of dominants.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

Our aim was to identify clinicopathological characteristics (CPC) of squamous cell carcinomas of the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx (SCCPOCO) associated with HPV p16+. Methods: Using a retrospective cohort study design, we enrolled a sample of SCCPOCO patients treated in a Central German hospital over a 3-year period. The predictor variables: CPCs, were grouped into demographic, social, anatomic and prognostic. The main outcome variable was p16+. Appropriate statistics were computed, and P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 199 HNSCC patients, 23 had SCCPOCO and entered the analysis (mean age, 67 ± 12 years; 4 females; 16 in stage I; 4 p16+; 22 underwent primary surgery). We found 8 cervical lymph node metastases (34.8%), 3 distant metastases (13%), 9 recurrences (30.1%) and 3 overall deaths (13%). With the exception of recurrence (P = 0.006) and overall death (P = 0.02), p16+ was not associated with predictor variables: young age, male gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, tumor location, TNM stages, time to recurrence, metastases, death from disease and survival of smokers (P > 0.05). Primary brachytherapy failed to improve survival of p16+-SCCPOCO patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that p16+- and p16--SCCPOCOs in Central Germany share similar CPCs, except recurrence and overall death. Upfront surgery with/without radio(chemo)therapy is recommended for all operable SCCPOCOs, regardless of HPV-status. Patients with p16+-SCCPOCOs require close follow-up. Future research should investigate the cause of these distinctive CPCs.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

This article high-lights the interaction of the gut and mitochondria over the course of development, with an emphasis on the consequences for transdiagnostic processes across psychiatry, but with relevance to wider medical conditions. As well as raised levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) arising from increased gut permeability, the loss of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, is an important mediator of how gut dysbio-sis modulates mitochondrial function. Reactive cells, central glia and systemic immune cells are also modulated by the gut, in part via impacts on mitochondrial function in these cells. Gut-driven alterations in the activity of reactive cells over the course of development are proposed to be an important determi-nant of the transdiagnostic influence of glia and the immune system. Stress, including prenatal stress, also acts via the gut. The suppression of butyrate, coupled to raised LPS, drives oxidative and nitrosative stress signalling that culminates in the activation of acidic sphingomyelinase-induced ceramide. Raised ceramide levels negatively regulate mitochondrial function, both directly and via its negative impact on daytime, arousal-promoting orexin and night-time sleep-promoting pineal gland-derived melatonin. Both orexin and melatonin positively regulate mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, gut-mediated increases in ceramide have impacts on the circadian rhythm and the circadian regulation of mitochondrial function. Butyrate, orexin and melatonin can positively regulate mitochondria via the dis-inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leading to increased conversion of pyruvate to ace-tyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary co-substrate for the initiation of the melatonergic pathway in mito-chondria and therefore the beneficial effects of mitochondria melatonin synthesis on mitochondrial func-tion. This has a number of treatment implications across psychiatric and wider medical conditions, including the utilization of sodium butyrate and melatonin. Overall, gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability have significant impacts on central and systemic homeostasis via the regulation of mitochondrial function, especially in central glia and systemic immune cells.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

The obtained SO3H-carbocatalysts underwent catalytic testing for furfural oxidation with H2O2 to produce succinic acid. The effects of nitrogen functionalities were reported for the first time. The results showed that all carbon samples exhibited a microporous characteristic with comparable textural properties and contained various nitrogen functionalities (N-6, N-5, N-Q, and N-X). After sulfonation, the SO3H-carbocatalyst prepared from tetraethylenepentamine-based polybenzoxazine had the highest amount of sulfonic acid groups (1.45 mmol g−1) and a high nitrogen content (4.23%), providing a maximum succinic acid yield of 93.0% within a rapid reaction time of 60 min under the optimized conditions. This was higher than from Amberlyst-type catalysts and SO3H-carbocatalyst without nitrogen functionalities and was ascribed to the synergistic activity of the sulfonic acid groups and nitrogen functionalities. The XPS spectra and computational study confirmed that such nitrogen functionalities, especially N-5, are capable of forming hydrogen bonding with furfural, facilitating the formation of an intermediate compound and thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency. However, after four cycles, the succinic acid yield decreased to 40% due to leaching of the sulfonic acid groups.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Regional traffic congestion is modeled with a well-defined macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) mapping the trip completion rate to the vehicular accumulation. To overcome the limitation of inconsistent flow propagation between region boundaries and the corresponding travel time, the state-dependent regional travel time function is explicitly incorporated in the flow propagation of the conventional MFD dynamics. From a systems perspective, the traffic dynamics within a region can be regarded as a dynamic system with an endogenous time-varying delay depending on the system state. Equilibrium condition for the DSO problem is analytically derived through the lens of Pontryagin minimum principle and is compared against the static SO counterpart. The structure of path specific marginal cost is analyzed regarding the path travel cost and early-late penalty function. In contrast to existing analytical methods, the proposed method is applicable for general MFD systems without linearization of the MFD dynamics. Neither approximation of the equilibrium solution nor constant regional delay assumption is required. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the characteristics of DSO traffic equilibrium and the corresponding marginal cost together with other dynamic external costs.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Automotive Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications"

Because Candida albicans is prominent in human gut but not in mouse, C. albicans, a source of (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) in gut contents, was administered in high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obese mice at 1 week before sepsis induction by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). As such, sepsis in Candida-administered obese mice was more severe than obese mice without Candida as determined by mortality, organ injury (liver and kidney), serum cytokines, gut leakage, endotoxemia, serum BG, and fecal Gram-negative bacteria (microbiome analysis). Mice subjected to CLP and fed a HFD, but not treated with Candida demonstrated a similar mortality to non-obese mice with more severe gut leakage and higher serum cytokines. In vitro experiments demonstrated that LPS plus BG (LPS + BG) induced higher supernatant cytokines from hepatocytes (HepG2) and macrophages (RAW264.7), compared with the activation by each molecule alone, and were amplified by palmitic acid, a representative saturated fatty acid. The energy production capacity of HepG2 cells was also decreased by LPS + BG compared with LPS alone as evaluated by extracellular flux analysis. However, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) improved sepsis, regardless of Candida administration, through the attenuation of gut leakage and gut dysbiosis.

Methods: Data availability and goals from the health-care providers' perspective were explored using an online questionnaire survey for all PD centers registered with the Nephrology Society of Thailand from May to June 2016. The availability of essential data required for each KPI indicator to achieve the desired target was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Of the 197 centers, 119 responded to the survey (response rate of 60.41%).

Subsequently, the metabolic responses of this strain toward ethanol were investigated using untargeted metabolomics, which revealed the elevated levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the extracellular components, and of diacylglycerol, TAG, and hydroxy-TAG in the intracellular components. Lastly, stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry with ethanol-d6 showed altered isotopic patterns of molecular ions of lipids in the ethanol-d6 samples, compared with the nonlabeled ethanol controls, suggesting the ability of A. niger ES4 to utilize ethanol as a carbon source. Together, the studies revealed the upregulation of glycerolipid metabolism and ethanol utilization pathway as novel response mechanisms of A. niger ES4 toward ethanol stress, thereby underlining the utility of untargeted metabolomics and the overall approaches as tools for elucidating new biological insights.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology",Microbiology

Calculating life-cycle costs (LCCs) requires a variety of data that need to be gathered from diverse sources throughout the project life span. This information is usually stored in paper-based documents and are not well organized. These practices cause poor-quality data, which lead to incorrect results. Consequently, current LCCA in practice is extremely challenging. Data management is a major component for executing this sustainable development concept. This paper develops a relational database management system (RDBMS) that can support in calculating the LCCs of building projects. The system is structured to manage a large volume of design and construction data in a multi-parametric form. This allows users to integrate the proposed system with other modern construction platforms, especially building information modeling (BIM). In this paper, Autodesk Revit, a most widely-used BIM software, is adopted for authoring BIM models of a building and estimating relevant costs. Microsoft Access is used for developing a database management system (DBMS), which is designed to collaborate with the BIM models for LCCA. The system can significantly expedite the LCCA for a building with minimal errors and mistakes in data management and accurate LCCs.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Building and Construction, Civil and Structural Engineering"
Novel potential application of chitosan oligosaccharide for attenuation of renal cyst growth in the treatment of polycystic kidney disease,"Pathomthongtaweechai N., Soodvilai S., Pichyangkura R., Muanprasat C.",2020-12-01,"Animals, Benzimidazoles, Cell Proliferation, Chitosan, Dogs, Epithelial Cells, Kidney, Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells, Naphthalimides, Oligosaccharides, Phosphorylation, Polycystic Kidney Diseases, Signal Transduction, AMP-activated protein kinase, Chitosan oligosaccharide, Drug discovery, Polycystic kidney disease, Renal cyst","Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), a natural polymer derived from chitosan, exerts several biological activities including anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, anti-metabolic syndrome, and drug delivery enhancer. Since COS is vastly distributed to kidney and eliminated in urine, it may have a potential advantage as the therapeutics of kidney diseases. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder characterized by multiple fluid-filled cysts, replacing normal renal parenchyma and leading to impaired renal function and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The effective treatment for PKD still needs to be further elucidated. Interestingly, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed as a drug target for PKD. This study aimed to investigate the effect of COS on renal cyst enlargement and its underlying mechanisms. We found that COS at the concentrations of 50 and 100 µg/mL decreased renal cyst growth without cytotoxicity, as measured by MTT assay. Immunoblotting analysis showed that COS at 100 µg/mL activated AMPK, and this effect was abolished by STO-609, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ) inhibitor. Moreover, COS elevated the level of intracellular calcium. These results suggest that COS inhibits cyst progression by activation of AMPK via CaMKKβ. Therefore, COS may hold the potential for pharmaceutical application in PKD.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

It is believed that P. insidiosum’s zoospores, its infected form, play major role in pathogenesis. Vascular and ocular infections are the most common clinical manifestation in humans. It is difficult to establish the diagnosis given its relatively rarity and difficulty to distinguish P. insidiosum from other molds. Delay in diagnosis and treatment has been associated with poor outcomes. High index of suspicion is the key, particularly in thalassemia patients with arterial insufficiency and patients with fungal keratitis/endophthalmitis without improvement on antifungal therapy. Tissue culture and zoospore induction remain gold standard for diagnosis; however, DNA-based method should be performed simultaneously. The combination of radical surgery, antifungal agents, and immunotherapy has been recommended. It was previously believed that surgery with negative surgical margins was the essential to survive in vascular pythiosis; however, it was recently found that patients could have residual disease despite documented negative surgical margins as infected clot may be dislodged to proximal arterial sites prior to surgery. Serum β-d-glucan (BG) has been used to monitor disease response after treatment initiation in vascular pythiosis. A significant decrease in BG levels within 2 weeks after surgery is indicative of the absence of residual infection. Unfortunately, monitoring tools for ocular pythiosis are not yet available. Itraconazole plus terbinafine have generally been used in P. insidiosum-infected patients; however, antibacterial agents, including azithromycin and linezolid, have also been used with favorable outcomes in ocular disease. Recently, azithromycin or clarithromycin plus doxycyclin were used in two relapsed vascular pythiosis patients with good outcomes.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary mycology; diagnosis, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Agronomy and Crop Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

To control PED, apart from oral administration of minced intestinal materials, there are still no effective control methods. The ability of porcine epidemic diarrhea vaccine RNA particle platform (PED-RP) to induce antibody in colostrum and milk samples was investigated in two pig herds with a differing PED status in the Philippines. Herd-A was naïve but herd-B was endemically infected with PED. Sera, colostrum, and milk samples were collected prior to and following vaccination, and assayed for the presence of antibody by viral neutralization (VN) and IgG and IgA levels by ELISA spike protein. The results from both herds, compared to the non-vaccinated control group, demonstrated significantly increased VN titers and IgG and IgA levels in colostrum and milk samples of sows at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days post parturition. Additionally, piglets from vaccinated sows had VN titers, and IgG and IgA levels are significantly higher than those from non-vaccinated sows. In conclusion, the results of the study demonstrate that PED-RP can be used to induce a satisfactory antibody response in colostrum and milk, as measured by VN titers and IgG and IgA levels.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; animal vaccines, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

Despite having several studies on vitamin D supplement and fall and fracture reductions, the results are still inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of vitamin D supplement in different forms and patient settings on fall and fracture. Methods: A systematic literature research was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the effects of vitamin D supplements on fall and fracture outcomes. Random-effect models were used to compute the weighted mean difference for continuous variables and the risk ratio for binary variables. Results: Forty-seven RCTs with 58,424 participants were identified reporting on fall outcome. Twenty-four of 47 studies with 40,102 subjects also reported fracture outcome. Major populations were elderly women with age less than 80 years. Overall, vitamin D supplement demonstrated a significant effect on fall reduction, RR=0.948 (95% CI 0.914-0.984; P=.004, I2=41.52). By subgroup analyses, only vitamin D with calcium supplement significantly reduce fall incidence, RR=0.881 (95% CI 0.821-0.945; P<.001, I2=49.19). Vitamin D3 supplement decreased incidence of fall but this occurred only when vitamin D3 was supplemented with calcium. Regarding fracture outcome, vitamin D supplement failed to show fracture lowering benefit, RR=0.949 (95% CI 0.846-1.064; P=.37, I2=37.92). Vitamin D along with calcium supplement could significantly lower fracture rates, RR=0.859 (95% CI 0.741-0.996; P=.045, I2=25.48).

DON concentration was monitored with incubation time. Phenol suppressed the ammonification rate of DON up to 62.9%. No or minimal ammonification inhibition was observed at 100 mg/L of phenol while the inhibition increased with increasing phenol concentration from 250 to 1000 mg/L. The inhibition was curtailed by the presence of the phenol-degrading bacteria. DON was ammonified in the samples inoculated with only N. europaea and the ammonification was also inhibited by phenol. The findings suggest that high phenol in wastewater could result in low ammonification and high DON in the effluent.","genergyal, wastewater and other effluent/liquid waste engineeringn., geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

Relationship analysis began with the prioritization of the physicochemical properties of the anti-malarials to create a multivariate linear regression model that correlates the red blood cell penetration. Results: It was found that protein binding was significantly correlated with red blood cell penetration, with a negative coefficient. The next step was repeated analysis to find molecular descriptors that influence protein binding. The coefficients of the number of rotating bonds and the number of aliphatic hydrocarbons are negative, as opposed to the positive coefficients of the number of hydrogen bonds and the number of aromatic hydrocarbons. The p-value was less than 0.05. Conclusions: Anti-malarials with a small number of hydrogen bonds and aromatic hydrocarbons, together with a high number of rotatable bonds and aliphatic hydrocarbons, may have a higher tendency to penetrate the red blood cells.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

The use of specific solvent as a medium can promote molecular organization and crystal growth of bis-PDA assemblies, which in turn results in reversible thermochromism. In this study, bis-PDAs constituting symmetric alkyl tails were prepared by self-assembling in water or alkanes. The preparation by using water as a medium produces bis-PDA assemblies with relatively small particle size and irregular shape. In this system, the bis-PDA exhibits irreversible thermochromism. Interestingly, the use of nonpolar alkanes promotes crystal growth of the bis-PDA assemblies into micron-size sheet-like structure. We have found that the increase of particle size and molecular ordering results in reversible thermochromism. X-ray diffraction reveals lamellar structure with uncharacteristically high tilting angle of the alkyl side chain with respect to the lamellar plane. Infrared spectroscopy also detects the variation of segmental arrangement within the bis-PDA assemblies. Our study points to new and rather simple approach for achieving reversible thermochromism of bis-PDA-based materials that can extend their applications as colorimetric sensors, smart ink or responsive paint/pigment.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The glucan conversion was enhanced to 93.8% with temperature (210 °C) and delignification by organosolv pretreatment (OS). Thereafter, anaerobic digestion of the residue left after enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted which further improved the methane yield (205.5 LCH4/kg VS) by 33% over hydrothermal pretreatment (154.3 LCH4/kg VS). Delignification during OS plays a key role in improving the degradability of RW resulting in efficient energy recovery (11.23 MJ/kg pretreated RW) which was clearly higher than an integrated process based on hydrothermal (HT) or HT plus process water. Scaled up to a biorefinery, the integrated process based on OS would economically produce fermentable sugar while other value-added chemicals might be produced from the process water.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology; energygy, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

This study was conducted to describe characteristics of infections occurring before the initiation of immunosuppressants in hospitalized children with newly diagnosed SLE in underresourced areas. Methods: Medical records of paediatric patients with the diagnosis of SLE, who were admitted to a university-based hospital from 2002 to 2018, were reviewed. Only patients younger than 18 years of age with newly diagnosed SLE were included in the study. The primary outcome was infection before the administration of immunosuppressants.

Purpose: To utilize a networked system, optimized with statistical process control (SPC), for remote patient monitoring (RPM) and to identify potential predictors of COPD exacerbations. Methods: Seventeen subjects, mean (SD) age of 69.7 (7.2) years, with moderate to severe COPD received RPM. Over 2618 patient-days (7.17 patient-years) of monitoring, we obtained daily symptom scores, treatment adherence, self-reported activity levels, daily spirometry (SVC, FEV1, FVC, PEF), inspiratory capacity (IC), and oxygenation (SpO2). These data were used to identify predictors of exacerbations defined using Anthonisen and other criteria. Results: After implementation of SPC, concordance analysis showed substantial agreement between FVC (decrease below the 7-day rolling average minus 1.645 SD) and self-reported healthcare utilization events (κ=0.747, P<0.001) as well as between increased use of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators and exacerbations defined by two Anthonisen criteria (κ=0.611, P<0.001) or modified Anthonisen criteria (κ=0.622, P<0.001). There was a moderate agreement between FEV1 (decrease >1.645 SD below the 7-day rolling average) and self-reported healthcare utilization events (κ=0.475, P<0.001) and between SpO2 less than 90% and exacerbations defined by two Anthonisen criteria (κ=0.474, P<0.001) or modified Anthonisen criteria (κ=0.564, P<0.001). Conclusion: Exacerbations were best predicted by FVC and FEV1 below the one-sided 95% confidence interval derived from SPC but also by increased use of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators and fall in oxygen saturation. An RPM program that captures these parameters may be used to guide appropriate interventions aimed at reducing healthcare utilization in COPD patients.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

This study produces evidence that monetary policy transparency and communication policy of the Bank of England have information content in reduc-ing disagreement about interest rate forecasts. Different from most extant studies employing the transparency index derived from official documents of the central banks, this study extends the literature by using a recently devel-oped market‐based monetary transparency index. Moreover, this study ana-lyzes forecast disagreement in a multivariate perspective based on survey data of short‐ and long‐term rates over short and long horizons. This study characterizes several patterns on forecast disagreement related to maturities of interest rates, forecast horizons, recessions, forward guidance, credibility, transparency, and communication policy. Interestingly, disagreement among the Monetary Policy Committee in policy rate decisions is associated with lower disagreement among professional forecasters on interest rate outlook, whereas neither announcement of changes in policy rates nor publication of inflation reports affects forecast disagreement. These results have important implications for monetary policymakers in managing market expectations of interest rates.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science, Business, decision sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Computer Science Applications, Strategy and Management, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Management Science and Operations Research"
Development of lightweight and high-performance ballistic helmet based on poly(Benzoxazine-co-urethane) matrix reinforced with aramid fabric and multi-walled carbon nanotubes,"Daungkumsawat J., Okhawilai M., Charoensuk K., Prastowo R.B., Jubsilp C., Karagiannidis P., Rimdusit S.",2020-12-01,"Aramid fabrics, Ballistic impact, Ballistic Limit, Face deformations, Mass content, National Institute of Justice, Protection level, Simulation prediction, Ballistic helmet, MWCNTs, Poly(benzoxazine-co-urethane), Simulation","This study aims to develop a lightweight ballistic helmet based on nanocomposite with matrix of the copolymer of benzoxazine with an urethane prepolymer [poly(BA-a-co-PU)], at mass ratio 80/20, reinforced with aramid fabric and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). This has a protection level II according to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 0106.01 standard. The effects of MWCNTs mass content in a range of 0 to 2 wt% on tensile, physical and ballistic impact properties of the nanocomposite were investigated. The results revealed that the introduction of MWCNTs enhanced the tensile strength and energy at break of the nanocomposite; the highest values were obtained at 0.25 wt%. In addition, the nanocomposite laminate with 20 plies of aramid fabric showed the lowest back face deformation of 8 mm which was much lower than that specified by the NIJ standard. According to Military Standard (MIL-STD) 662F, the simulation prediction revealed that the ballistic limit of the ballistic helmet nanocomposite was as high as 632 m s−1. The developed laminates made of aramid fabric impregnated with poly(BA-a-co-PU) 80/20 containing 0.25 wt% MWCNTs showed great promise for use as a light weight and high-performance ballistic helmet.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
"Organic geochemistry of the Lower Permian Tak Fa Formation in Phetchabun Province, Thailand: implications for its paleoenvironment and hydrocarbon generation potential","Chenrai P., Fuengfu S.",2020-06-01,"Depositional environment, Extractable organic matter, Geochemical characteristic, Hydrocarbon generation potential, Hydrocarbon source rocks, Khao Khwang Platform, Source inputs, Tak Fa Formation, Biomarker, Depositional environment, Khao Khwang Platform, Source inputs, Tak Fa Formation","The outcrop samples of the Tak Fa Formation (Lower Permian) in Phetchabun Province have been studied to determine their organic geochemical characteristic, depositional paleoenvironment, and hydrocarbon generation potential. The total organic carbon (TOC) values ranging from 1.42 to 4.58 wt% and extractable organic matter values ranging from 76.84 to 197.65 ppm of the Tak Fa Formation were generally low and associated with low S2 values (0.00–0.50 mg HC/g rock) and hydrogen index values in range of 0–32 mg/g TOC, although this could reflect highly thermal maturity and complex tectonic history. Thus, kerogen classification can be based on a non-biomarker study for these outcrop samples instead. The non-biomarker plot, Pr/n-C17 and Ph/n-C18 from this study indicates that organic matter originally comes from type II/III kerogen. The samples were also investigated and indicated that the organic matter inputs were derived from mixed marine and terrigenous sources and deposited under suboxic to oxic conditions. The depositional environment of the Tak Fa Formation in this study is interpreted to be an estuarine environment or restricted lagoonal carbonate platforms. This has been achieved from normal alkane and isoprenoids distributions, terpane, and sterane biomarkers. Thus, the Tak Fa Formation is considered to be a hydrocarbon source rock during the time of the deposition. Although the geochemical data in this study indicate that the Tak Fa Formation has experienced high maturation, one or more locations could meet a condition that places this formation to be an active source rock. The approach and concepts presented in this study can be applied to similar evaporite-carbonate deposits in Thailand to find more petroleum plays.","petroleum engineeringneering, hydrocarbons, earth sciences",Geochemistry and Petrology

Different in patient ethnicity and pattern of practice may impact the clinical outcome. We aim to determine 1-year mortality and to identify factors that significantly predicts 1-year mortality of Thai patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Methods: This prospective multicenter registry enrolled consecutive Thai patients that were diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy at 9 institutions located across Thailand. Patients with left ventricular function < 40% and one of the following criteria were included: 1) presence of epicardial coronary stenoses > 75% in the left main or proximal left anterior descending artery or coronary angiography, and/or two major epicardial coronary stenoses; 2) prior myocardial infarction; 3) prior revascularization by coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention; or, 4) magnetic resonance imaging pattern compatible with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Baseline clinical characteristics, coronary and echocardiographic data were recorded. The 1-year clinical outcome was pre-specified. Results: Four hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled. Thirty-nine patients (9.9%) had died at 1 year, with 27 experiencing cardiovascular death, and 12 experiencing non-cardiovascular death. A comparison between patients who were alive and patients who were dead at 1 year revealed lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (26.7 ± 7.6% vs 30.2 ± 7.8%; p = 0.021), higher left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (185.8 ± 73.2 ml vs 155.6 ± 64.2 ml; p = 0.014), shorter mitral valve deceleration time (142.9 ± 57.5 ml vs 182.4 ± 85.7 ml; p = 0.041), and lower use of statins (94.7% vs 99.7%; p = 0.029) among deceased patients. Patients receiving guideline-recommended β-blockers had lower mortality than patients receiving non-guideline-recommended β-blockers (8.1% vs 18.2%; p = 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study revealed a 9.9% 1-year mortality rate among Thai ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. Doppler echocardiographic parameters significantly associated with 1-year mortality were LVEF, LVEDV, mitral E velocity, and mitral valve deceleration time. The use of non-guideline-recommended β-blockers rather than guideline recommended β-blockers were associated with increased with 1-year mortality.

In the classification process, two classifiers: Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest are combined and run on two selected features: Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and color layout descriptor (CLD) to categorize an incoming sign into one of four classes. In this process, the proposed technique provides the accuracy score up to 93.98%. Subsequently, the recognition process is used to identify each traffic sign. This process is based on the OCR and correlation coefficient-based template matching.

Optimal concentration of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor improved sperm membrane functionality and fertilizing ability of cryopreserved-thawed feline sperm,"Tharasanit T., Tiptanavattana N., Oravetdilok K., Tuangsintanakul T., Sirithanyakul P., Tanvetthayanont P.",2020-03-01,"Animals, Cats, Cell Membrane, Cryopreservation, Fertilization in Vitro, Male, rho-Associated Kinases, Semen Preservation, Spermatozoa, Cat, Cryopreservation, ROCK inhibitor, Sperm","Sperm cryopreservation induces irreversible loss of viability and fertilizing ability. This study aimed at examining the effects of Rho-associated, coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor on quality of frozen-thawed feline sperm. Ejaculated semen from individual cats (n = 6) was examined for the expression of LIMK1 and LIMK2 mediated ROCK cascade. The effects of ROCK inhibitor during cooling and cryopreservation on sperm quality and fertilizing ability were also examined. Feline sperm were treated with different concentrations of ROCK inhibitor (10, 20 and 40 μM) during cooling at 4 °C and cryopreservation. Sperm cooled and conventionally cryopreserved without ROCK inhibitor (0 μM) served as a control group. The ROCK cascade was confirmed in feline sperm as they expressed mRNA of LIMK1 and LIMK2 genes. Cryopreservation significantly reduced sperm quality in terms of viability (91.63 ± 3.96 vs. 60.11 ± 8.93), progressive motility (91.67 ± 3.54 vs. 46.67 ± 8.66) and acrosome integrity (93.49 ± 3.64 vs. 63.81 ± 5.31) for fresh and frozen-thawed sperm, respectively (p < 0.05). The positive effects of ROCK inhibitor on sperm quality were pronounced at 1 and 3 h post-thaw. ROCK inhibitor at 10 μM significantly improved sperm motility and membrane functionality compared to those observed in a control group (0 μM) (p < 0.05). In vitro fertilization revealed that supplement ROCK inhibitor at 10 μM during cryopreservation significantly improved in vitro fertilizing ability of the frozen-thawed sperm (p < 0.05). However, it did not subsequently increase morula and blastocyst rates (p > 0.05). Increased concentrations of ROCK inhibitor to 20 and 40 μM did not further improve the quality of frozen-thawed sperm. In conclusion, an optimal concentration (10 μM) of the ROCK inhibitor added into cooling medium could improve post-thaw sperm quality.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

A facial cleanser formulated with alkyl ether carboxylate (AEC) and alkyl carboxylate (AC) can improve acne by cleansing sebum on facial skin but cannot effectively remove keratotic plugs in the skin pores. Recently, we confirmed that Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane and L-arginine (Tris/Arg) is able to reduce sebum levels, disrupt keratotic plugs in vitro and decrease pore size on facial skin. Objective: To compare the efficacy of the Tris/Arg-formulated cleanser with the AEC/AC cleanser in Thai subjects with acne. Methods: We designed a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel trial. Thirty-four male Thai subjects with mild to moderate acne were assigned to one of two groups: one group used the Tris/Arg cleanser while the other used the AEC/AC-based cleanser twice a day for 4 weeks. Results: After 4 weeks, significant decreases in noninflammatory acne were observed in both groups, yet significant decreases in inflammatory acne were only observed in the Tris/Arg cleanser group. The sebum level prior to and 30 minutes after facial washing showed no change in either group. The average pore size with keratotic plugs on the cheeks was significantly decreased in the Tris/Arg group. More than half of subjects in both groups observed acne improvement but more subjects in the Tris/Arg group noted pore size improvement. Conclusion: The Tris/Arg formulated cleanser has a high efficacy for significantly reducing both noninflammatory and inflammatory acne accompanied by decreases in pore size with keratotic plugs in male Thai subjects.","dermatology and venergyeology, medical",Dermatology

However, the role of cystatin C for estimation of the renal function in survivors of critical illness is unknown. We aimed to compare the performance of serum cystatin C- and serum creatinine-based eGFR against a reference GFR using 99mTc–diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) in survivors of critical illness. Material and methods: Survivors of critical illness with stable hemodynamics and renal functions were recruited. Their serum creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured. eGFR were calculated by using various equations: 1)CKD-EPI SCysC; 2) Thai eGFR SCysC; 3)CKD-EPI SCr; 4)Thai eGFR SCr; 5)MDRD Caucasian SCr; 6)CKD-EPI SCr-SCysC. The 99mTc-DTPA plasma clearance was used as a standard eGFR. Results: Forty-two patients were included. The bias (median percentage difference) between standard GFR and SCysC-based eGFR were 41.97% (95%CI 33.1% to 48.5%) for CKD-EPI SCysC and 31.72% (95%CI 21.1% to 34.9%) for Thai eGFR SCysC. While, the bias between standard GFR and SCr-based eGFR were −11.37 (95%CI -20.9 to 1.6) for CKD-EPI SCr, −18.30 (95%CI -26.3 to −10.6) for Thai eGFR SCr, and −27.17 (−43.7 to −19.1) for MDRD Caucasian SCr. Conclusion: In survivors of critical illness, we demonstrated limitations of estimating GFR by both currently available SCysC and SCr-based equations.

Among various substances from agricultural factory waste, molasses and wastewater from ethanol distillation plants are the main focus of this study. To overcome the limitation of bio-H2 production, the direct screening of waste substrates for an efficient producer using co-culture free technique is an interesting choice. Competent species with H2-producing ability and valuable volatile acid such as acetic acid were selected. Several bacteria were isolated and had their species identified by microbial 16SrDNA sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method. Bacillus coaglulans, B. circulans, Sporolactobacillus inulinus, Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus acidilactici, Paenibacillus thermophilus, Chronobacter sakazaki and Clostridium beijerinckii were found in both reducing-sugar rich waste and wastewater. For bio-H2 application in this criteria, potent natural hydrogen producer B. coagulans MO11 and C. beijerinckii CN were picked to test the growth ability on different substrates (carbon-dioxide, L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-glucose, D-fructose, sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, starch and others). Wastewater from sugarcane factories and other agricultural factories in Thailand were tested for physical and biochemical characteristics which would make them suitable renewable substrates. Among all, Bacillus coagulans MO11 could produce hydrogen gas using molasses and ethanol refinery wastewater effectively (1.634 molH2/mol hexose) as detected by Drager tube, which was the maximum yield in this study. In comparison, the experiment performed by using B. coagulans MO11 and C. beijerinckii CN fed with 40X diluted molasses wastewater showed better production of H2 gas in Clostridium beijerinckii CN during the final 72-hr gas collection (79 mL/L and 125 mL/L respectively). The results pointed in the same direction when replacing 40X diluted molasses with 5X diluted refinery wastewater supplemented with trace elements.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Methods: The aim of this analysis was to estimate vaccine efficacy (VE) in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in each of 5 independent seasonal cohorts (2011-2014), as well as vaccine impact on healthcare utilization in 3 study regions (Europe/Mediterranean, Asia-Pacific and Central America). Healthy children were randomized 1:1 to IIV4 or control vaccines. VE was estimated against influenza confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on nasal swabs. Cultured isolates were characterized as antigenically matched/mismatched to vaccine strains. Results: The total vaccinated cohort included 12,018 children (N = 1777, 2526, 1564, 1501 and 4650 in cohorts 1-5, respectively). For reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed influenza of any severity (all strains combined), VE in cohorts 1-5 was 57.8%, 52.9%, 73.4%, 30.3% and 41.4%, respectively, with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval >0 for all estimates. The proportion of vaccine match for all strains combined in each cohort was 0.9%, 79.3%, 72.5%, 24.1% and 28.6%, respectively.

Here, single mouse iPSCs were first seeded in micro-space culture plates to form 3-dimensional spheres. At day 12, iPSC spheres were subjected to shaking culture and maintained in osteogenic induction medium for 31 days (Os induction). In another condition, the osteogenic induction medium was replaced by chondrogenic induction medium at day 22 and maintained for a further 21 days (Os-Chon induction). Os induction produced robust mineralization and some cartilage-like tissue, which promoted expression of osteogenic and chondrogenic marker genes. In contrast, Os-Chon induction resulted in partial mineralization and a large area of cartilage tissue, with greatly increased expression of chondrogenic marker genes along with osterix and collagen 1a1. Os-Chon induction enhanced mesodermal lineage commitment with brachyury expression followed by high expression of lateral plate and paraxial mesoderm marker genes. These results suggest that combined use of micro-space culture and mechanical stimuli facilitates hybrid bone/cartilage tissue formation from iPSCs, and that the bone/cartilage tissue ratio in iPSC constructs could be manipulated through the induction protocol.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Several previous studies in Thailand have mainly been focused on the health of dairy and beef cattle. Water buffaloes are one of the important ruminants in the country, but studies on their infection with VBPs remains limited. We conducted a molecular survey on blood samples from 456 buffaloes obtained from eight provinces across different geographical locations of Thailand. The PCR diagnostics indicated that 116 (25.4%) and 59 (12.9%) of these 456 samples were positive for piroplasm and Plasmodium spp., respectively, and were found in six and all eight regions, respectively, across Thailand. Co-infections of piroplasm and Plasmodium spp. were observed in 24 cases (5.26%). Babesia spp. was not detected in any of the 12 sequenced piroplasm-positive samples in the present study. Genetic comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of within and between parasite populations, based on the 18S ribosomal (r)RNA and cytochrome b (cytb) genes for T. orientalis and P. bubalis, respectively, revealed that T. orientalis shared a high similarity within its population and could be divided into four distinct haplotypes. Haplotypes 1 and 4 were placed in the same clade with the samples previously isolated from cattle in Korea, Japan, Australia, and the USA. Haplotypes 2, and 3 were novel and were placed in a separate clade not shared with the other isolates. We also confirmed our previous investigation that at least three cytb haplotypes of P. bubalis were distributed in the country with a relatively high degree of genetic polymorphisms within its population (based on cytb sequences). Type II P. bubalis was phylogenetically closely related to P. caprae in goats in Zambia and Thailand. This study improves our current understanding on the distribution, intra- and inter-population genetic diversity, and genetic relationship of piroplasms and Plasmodium spp. in water buffaloes.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Formulation of Bio-Based Washing Agent and Its Application for Removal of Petroleum Hydrocarbons From Drill Cuttings Before Bioremediation,"Arpornpong N., Padungpol R., Khondee N., Tongcumpou C., Soonglerdsongpha S., Suttiponparnit K., Luepromchai E.",2020-08-11,"Application of surfactants, Biological mechanisms, Environmental problems, Fatty alcohol ethoxylates, Microcosm experiments, Oil-in-water microemulsions, Petroleum hydrocarbons, Total petroleum hydrocarbons, biosurfactants, drilling waste, polyolefin biodegradation, sequential treatment, soil washing","Drill cuttings from petroleum exploration and production sites can cause diverse environmental problems. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) are a major pollutant from the use of polyolefin-based mud. As an alternative to incineration, this study investigated the application of surfactant-enhanced washing technology prior to bioremediation. The washing step was necessary because the initial TPH concentrations were quite high at approximately 15% (w/w). Washing agents were formulated by varying the concentration of lipopeptide biosurfactant (in foamate or cell-free broth), Dehydol LS7TH (fatty alcohol ethoxylate 7EO, oleochemical surfactant) and butanol (as a lipophilic linker) at different salinities. The most efficient formula produced a Winsor Type I microemulsion (oil-in-water microemulsion) with polyolefin and contained only 20% (v/v) foamate and 2% (v/v) Dehydol LS7TH in water. Due to the synergistic behavior between the anionic lipopeptides and non-ionic Dehydol LS7TH, the formula efficiently removed 92% of the TPHs from the drill cuttings when applied in a jar test. To reduce the cost, the concentrations of each surfactant should be reduced; thus, the formula was optimized by the simplex lattice mixture design. In addition, cell-free broth, at a pH of 10, containing 3.0 g/L lipopeptides was applied instead of foamate because it was easy to prepare. The optimized formula removed 81.2% of the TPHs and contained 72.0% cell-free broth and 1.4% Dehydol LS7TH in water. A 20-kg soil washing system was later tested where the petroleum removal efficiency decreased to 70.7% due to polyolefin redeposition during separation of the washing solution. The remaining TPHs (4.5%) in the washed drilled cuttings were further degraded by a mixture of Marinobacter salsuginis RK5, Microbacterium saccharophilum RK15 and Gordonia amicalis JC11. To promote TPH biodegradation, biochar and fertilizer were applied along with bacterial consortia in a microcosm experiment. After 49-day incubation, the TPHs were reduced to 0.9% by both physical and biological mechanisms, while the TPHs in the unamended samples remained unaffected. With the use of the formulated bio-based washing agent and bioremediation approach, the on-site treatment of drill cuttings could be conducted with an acceptable cost and low environmental impacts.","petroleum engineeringneering, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

Methods: The authors searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Outcomes of interest were performance (including cecal intubation time, adenoma detection rate, and polyp detection rate), discomfort score (patients and endoscopists; Likert scale), and sedation uses. Pooled mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Six randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The authors found that there was significantly lower sedative use including fentanyl (14.70; 95% Cl: 8.20–21.20) and propofol (15.58; 95% Cl: 3.27–27.89) in the E-C group compared with the C-E group.

Corrosion of amorphous alumina in deionized water under mild condition,"Dokmai V., Methaapanon R., Pavarajarn V.",2020-01-01,"Amorphous alumina, Defect formation, Dense films, Microelectronic components, Short periods, Alumina, Amorphous, Corrosion, Defects, Hydrolysis","Alumina is known for its inertness and chemical resistance. Unless the condition is near the critical point, it is conventional to assume that the reaction between alumina and water does not take place within short period of time. This assumption also includes amorphous alumina, which is formed via sputtering to protect microelectronic components. This work shows that amorphous alumina film indeed reacts with deionized (DI) water within minutes even in mild conditions. The reaction results in defects on the surface of the alumina, which ultimately progresses into the film, causing a dense film to become porous, as though it had become corroded. Severe surface defects are formed within 60 min of immersion in deionized water at 50 °C. Characterizations of the corroded film and the study of the effects of various parameters on defect formation indicate that the defects are associated with the hydrolysis of the amorphous alumina.","chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"
Waste biomass valorization through production of xylose-based porous carbon microspheres for supercapacitor applications,"Waribam P., Ngo S.D., Tran T.T.V., Kongparakul S., Reubroycharoen P., Chanlek N., Wei L., Zhang H., Guan G., Samart C.",2020-03-15,"Carbon microspheres, Hydrothermal, Hydrothermal carbonization, Maximum power density, Porous carbon microspheres, Specific capacitance, Supercapacitor application, Supercapacitor electrodes, Biomass, Electric Capacitance, Microspheres, Porosity, Xylose, Carbon microsphere, Chemical activation, Hydrothermal, Porous carbon, Supercapacitor","Sequential potassium hydroxide (KOH)-phosphoric acid (H3PO4) activation was applied to biomass waste to fabricate activated carbon microspheres (mCMs) with a controllable porous structure. Carbon microspheres (CMs) were first synthesized from xylose using a bottom-up approach of hydrothermal carbonization. Sequential KOH and H3PO4 activation was applied to the CMs in a KOH-carbon solid reaction. This created pores, which were further enlarged by adsorption of H3PO4. The KOH:carbon (C) and H3PO4:C molar ratios, and the H3PO4 heating rate and activation time, were varied to investigate the effect on average pore size and pore distribution. A uniform porous structure was formed without destruction of the spherical shape, and an almost 700-fold increase in surface area was obtained over the non-activated CMs. Following activation with H3PO4, phosphorous groups were found to be present at the surface of the carbon microspheres. The mCM was tested as a supercapacitor electrode and was shown to have a maximum specific capacitance of up to 277F g−1. A Ragone plot showed the maximum power density to be 173.88 W Kg−1. This increased specific capacitance was attributed to the increase in surface area and the presence of phosphorous-containing acid sites on the material surface.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental",Waste Management and Disposal

A calf stretching (CS) and a plantar fascia-specific stretching (PFSS) are two stretching techniques commonly administered by health care providers. Objective: To evaluate the literature on the application of these two stretching techniques in the treatment of PF and investigate their effectiveness and efficacy. Method: A search of PubMed, Web of Sciences, PEDro, CINHAL and Scopus was conducted. Studies that applied stretching as a co-intervention were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed to determine the internal validity of the included trials. The GRADE approach was adopted to determine the overall quality. Pooled analysis was performed to determine the treatment effects of CS and PFSS in terms of the mean difference in the visual analog scale pain score. Results: Eight articles were found that represented randomized controlled trial and met the inclusion criteria. There was very low-quality evidence that the combined CS and PFSS was less effective in the short term than the other therapies. Comparison between CS and PFSS revealed moderate quality evidence for a larger effect of pain score reduction for PFSS treatment over CS, while very low-quality evidence supported that combined CS and PFSS or CS alone was superior to sham stretching. Conclusion: There was moderate to very low-quality evidence of the effectiveness of stretching for PF. The treatment effect of stretching was large and comparable to other therapies. Future trials of higher quality are needed to clarify findings or to confirm findings.","Health Professions, medical","Complementary and Manual Therapy, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

It was cultured in 4% (w/v) NaCl at a pH range of 5.0–8.0 (optimally at pH 7) and at 30°C–40 °C (optimally at 37 °C). Its major cellular fatty acids are C16:0 (36.3%), C17:0 cyclo (9.7%), C16:1 ω9c (13.9%), and C18:1 ω9c (10.7%), and its DNA guanine–cytosine content is 40.8 mol%. On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, it was determined that the strain belonged to the genus Clostridium and was closely related to C. amygdalinum BR-10T (97.8%), C. saccharolyticum WM1T (97.8%), and C. celleracrescens DSM 5628T (97.7%). This strain showed a low level of DNA–DNA relatedness with the closely related strains, suggesting that it is a novel species in the genus Clostridium. Recent studies have demonstrated the production of succinic acid using Clostridium strains. Strain SP17–B1 produced 25.1 ± 1.3 and 15.3 ± 1.5 g/L of succinic acid from 40 g/L of glucose and 30 g/L of hevea wood waste hydrolysate (HH), respectively, after 24 h. When detoxified HH was used as a substrate, the lag phase was reduced and cell growth was enhanced by 7 fold (OD660 0.4–3.0) within 12 h.

Due to synergetic effects, the obtained Ni(OH)2/d-Ti3C2 displayed a capacity of 732.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, ∼6.0 times higher than that of d-Ti3C2 (∼121.3 mA h g−1), and ∼6.2 times higher than that of Ni(OH)2 (∼117.6 mA h g−1). Moreover, a higher reversible capacity of 372.0 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles without apparent capacity decay at 1 A g−1 was obtained. This enhanced performance can be caused by the higher lithium ion diffusion coefficient in Ni(OH)2/d-Ti3C2 (2.5 × 10−14 cm2 s−1), ∼284.1 times higher than that of Ni(OH)2 (8.8 × 10−17 cm2 s−1) and ∼7.1 times higher than that of d-Ti3C2 (3.5 × 10−15 cm2 s−1).

Infections were monitored for 16 weeks. Infected BALB/c mice were asymptomatic during the infection course. Parasite DNAs were detected in the liver at week 8 of infection, followed by clearance in most animals at week 16; whereas in the spleen, parasite DNAs were detected until week 16. These results are correlated to those obtained measuring parasite loads in both organs. No parasite DNA and no alteration in the bone marrow were observed indicating that no dissemination occurred. These results suggest the control of visceralization of L. martiniquensis by BALB/c mice. In hamsters, weight loss, cachexia, and fatigue were observed after week 11. Leishmania martiniquensis parasites were observed in tissue smears of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow by week 16. Parasite loads correlated with those from the presence of parasites and DNAs in the examined tissues. Alterations in the liver with nuclear destruction and cytoplasmic degeneration of infected hepatocytes, presence of inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis of hepatocytes, and changes in splenic architecture and reduction and deformation of white pulp in the spleen were noted. These results indicate a chronic form of visceral leishmaniasis indicating that the hamster is a suitable animal model for the study of pathological features of chronic visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. martiniquensis.","Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (all), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

Helicobacter pylori is an initiating factor in gastric pathogenesis via activation of massive inflammation, the cumulative effect of which leads to gastric disease progression, including gastric carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the effect of a crude ethyl acetate extract of KP (CEAE-KP) on proinflammatory cytokine production and cell chemotaxis was the focus of this study. Methods: The cytotoxicity of CEAE-KP (8–128 μg/ml) on AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma) cells was determined at 6, 12 and 24 h using an MTT assay. The effect of CEAE-KP on H. pylori-induced interleukin (IL)-8 production by AGS cells was evaluated by ELISA and RT-PCR. The effect of CEAE-KP on monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis to H. pylori soluble protein (sHP) and IL-8, respectively, was determined using a Boyden chamber assay with THP-1 or HL- 60 cells. Results: CEAE-KP reduced AGS cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, but at 8–16 μg/ml, it was not cytotoxic after 6–24 h of exposure. Coculture of AGS cells with CEAE-KP at a noncytotoxic concentration of 16 μg/ml and H. pylori reduced IL-8 secretion by ~ 60% at 12 h, which was consistent with the decreased level of mRNA expression, and inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis to IL-8. sHP (100 ng/ml) induced marked monocyte chemoattraction, and this was decreased by ~ 60% by CEAE-KP. Conclusion: CEAE-KP might serve as a potent alternative medicine to ameliorate the inflammation mediated by H. pylori infection.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

The present work proposes a simple way to prepare APNGs by applying the co-networks of biodegradable hydrophilic and hydrophobic chains. The co-networks between alkyno-poly(acrylic acid) (alkyno-PAA) and diazido-poly(ethylene glycol) (N3-PEG-N3) as well as diazido-poly(butylene succinate) (N3-PBS-N3) via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) Click lead to APNG. The variation of hydrophilic N3-PEG-N3 and hydrophobic N3-PBS-N3 controls the amphiphilicity as evidenced from the swelling performances in various solvents with different polarity. The APNG obtained favors multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to be dispersed in water for weeks without precipitation suggesting a potential dispersant of MWCNTs in hydrophilic media, especially aqueous solution.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Allocation of species to Feihyla remains confusing, particularly with respect to the closely related genus Chirixalus (formerly Chiromantis sensu lato). At the same time, several Chirixalus species are known only from cursory descriptions and remain poorly studied. In this study, we review the systematics of the genus Feihyla and clarify the generic placement of its members along with all other species currently assigned to Chirixalus. Based on integrative evidence gathered from new collections, examination of types and original descriptions, morphological comparisons, phylogenetic relationships inferred from a multi-gene (three mitochondrial + two nuclear) 1,937 bp dataset, as well as reproductive modes including egg-laying, nesting behaviour, and clutch morphology, our results show that the six species formerly attributed to Feihyla represent three morphologically and phylogenetically distinct groups: (1) the type species of the genus, F. palpebralis, along with F. fuhua constitute the Feihyla palpebralis group or Feihyla sensu stricto; (2) F. inexpectata and F. kajau represent the Feihyla vittiger group and are closely related to the Feihyla palpebralis group; (3) ‘F. hansenae’ and ‘F. vittata’ constitute another distinct and reciprocally monophyletic lineage, more closely related to Chirixalus + Chiromantis. In light of long-standing taxonomic confusions and unresolved phylogenetic relationships, we propose recognition of a new genus to accommodate ‘F. hansenae’ and ‘F. vittata’ in order to stabilise the classification of several Asian rhacophorid species that have been frequently confused and transferred within the Chirixalus–Chiromantis–Feihyla complex. Based on integrative evidence, eight species previously attributed to the genus Chirixalus or Feihyla are formally transferred to Rohanixalus gen. nov., two Chirixalus members are allocated to Feihyla, and one synonymised with Rhacophorus bipunctatus. In addition, we report the first member of the tree frog family Rhacophoridae from the Andaman Islands of India—Rohanixalus vittatus, along with description of its male advertisement call, reproductive behaviour including parental care by the female, and larval morphology. Extended distributions are also provided for Rohanixalus species across Northeast India. The study further reveals the presence of potentially undescribed diversity in the new genus. Altogether, the revised classification and novel insights presented herein will facilitate a better working taxonomy for four phylogenetically distinct but morphologically related groups of Old World tree frogs.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Animal Science and Zoology"

However, studies which reported the effects of tapioca RMD (TRM) on glucose and insulin response are lacking. This study investigated the effect of TRM on postprandial plasma glucose and serum insulin in healthy subjects. Additionally, satiety and gastrointestinal tolerability were also evaluated. Sixteen healthy participants received five different treatments on five separate days. Participants received 50 g of either: glucose (GL), tapioca maltodextrin (TM), TRM, MIX15% (7 5 g TRM + 42 5 g TM) or MIX50% (25 g TRM + 25 g TM). Plasma glucose, serum insulin and subjective appetite responses were measured postprandially over 180 min. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated by questionnaire before and after each test day. Results showed that at 30 min after treatment drinks, plasma glucose after TRM was significantly lowest (104 60 (SEM 2 63 mg/dl) than after GL (135 87 (SEM 4 88) mg/dl; P<0 001), TM (127 93 (SEM 4 05) mg/dl; P= 0 001), MIX15% (124 67 (SEM 5 73) mg/dl; P =0 039) and MIX50% (129 33 (SEM 5 23) mg/dl; P =0 003) (1 mg/dl = 0 0555 mmol/l). In addition, TRM also significantly reduced serum insulin (13 01 (SEM 2 12) μIU/ml) compared with GL (47 90 (SEM 11 93) μIU/ml; P= 0 013), TM (52 96 (SEM 17 68) μIU/ml; P= 0 002) and MIX50% (33 16 (SEM 4 99) μIU/ml; P= 0 008). However, there were no significant differences in subjective appetite between treatments (P > 0 05). A single high dose of TRM (50 g) caused flatulence (P < 0 05). Tapioca resistant maltodextrin has low digestibility in the small intestine and, therefore, reduced incremental plasma glucose and serum insulin, without affecting satiety in healthy subjects over 180 min. Gastrointestinal tolerability of TRM should be considered when consumed in high doses.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical, Nursing","Food Science, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The numbers of PS-exposing platelets in the PCs and in unprocessed whole blood were determined using flow cytometry. Results: A cross-sectional study of 253 PCs found that they had significantly increased numbers of PS-exposing platelets compared to unprocessed whole blood (47,439 ± 26,500 cells/μL; 5903‒166,156 cells/μL) vs. 30,058 ± 12,958 cells/μL; 8,154-86,606 cells/μL). A heterogeneity study demonstrated that 6% and 2% of the measured PCs and of unprocessed donor whole blood, respectively, showed an increase in the number of PS-exposing platelets that was greater than 2 fold. Conclusions: The study suggested that the number PS-exposing platelets in PC prepared in a routine transfusion laboratory differs.

Materials and methods: A total of 31 patients with LSCC with immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for EGFR were examined. Digital image processing was applied to analyze EGFR staining intensity and percent distribution, which were calculated as the H-score. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the best cut-off point of EGFR expression, with H-score separated into high- and low-grade for cancer recurrence prediction. Results: The cut-off point of EGFR expression for high- and low-grades was an H-score of 170 with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 66.7%. Using this cut-off, 14 (45.16%) and 17 (54.84%) patients were categorized as having high- and low-grades EGFR, respectively. The analysis showed a significant reverse correlation between the EGFR grade and LSCC recurrence (RR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.17–0.98; p =.02).

Forty healthy participants continuously typed a standardized text passage at a computer work station for 4 h. Subjects rated perceived body discomfort using Borg's CR-10 scale in 10 body regions (i.e. neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, upper back, lower back, buttock, thigh, knee, and ankle/foot). A seat pressure mat device was used to gather seat pressure data during sitting. Postural shifts were determined by analysis of the dispersion index of both ischial tuberosities from seat pressure data. The threshold for a postural shift was set at ±10% and ±20%. Perceived discomfort in all body regions increased continuously during a 4-h sitting period. The body regions with the highest perceived discomfort were the low back, buttocks, upper back, thigh, and neck. The average (±SD) numbers of postural shifts during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour of sitting were 14.8 ± 9.5, 17.8 ± 9.4, 18.2 ± 11.1, and 18.1 ± 9.8 shifts per hour for the 10% threshold, and were 4.8 ± 4.4, 6.0 ± 5.6, 7.4 ± 6.7, and 7.7 ± 6.6 shifts per hour for the 20% threshold, respectively. Prolonged sitting led to an increase in perceived musculoskeletal discomfort over time. The number of postural shifts at both magnitudes increased in the first 2 h of sitting and, in the second 2-h period of sitting, only the number of larger postural shifts (with 20% threshold) increased. The findings extend our understanding of sitting behaviors.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, Health Professions, engineering","Human Factors and Ergonomics, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

This work aimed to clarify the individual and simultaneous effect of these compounds on ADS of the most refractory sulfur-containing polyaromatic compounds (dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene) over Na–Y, Ni–Y, La–Y, Ce–Y and Ni–Ce–Y zeolites in a fixed bed system at ambient conditions. Polyaromatics (naphthalene) and nitrogen (quinoline and indole) compounds caused a marked decrease in the sulfur adsorption capacity, while the nitrogen compounds decreased the sulfur adsorption capacity more than naphthalene. The negative electrostatic potential of compounds might play an important role in the adsorptive selectivity on the pre-reduced Ni–Y zeolite. The results show that the adsorption sites of aromatics and nitrogen compounds on the adsorbents are the same as for the sulfur compounds. This competitive adsorption was very strong especially for the metal that enhanced π-complexation interaction. The reduced Ni2+ introduced into Na–Y zeolite increased resistance to aromatics and nitrogen compounds on ADS. For the spent adsorbent, the regeneration efficiency, in terms of the desorption amount, depended on the similarity of the polarity of the solvent (hexane and toluene) and adsorbate, where a high temperature and low flow rate of solvent favored the extraction of adsorbates leading to an increased regeneration efficiency. This study provides an insight into the interactions among these three kinds of components and adsorbents, which is useful for further development of the ADS process.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Selective cyclodimerization of epichlorohydrin to dioxane derivatives over MOFs,"Mousavi B., Chaemchuen S., Phatanasri S., Chen C., Zeng C., Ganguly R., Zhuiykov S., Verpoort F.",2020-01-01,"Basic characteristics, Cyclodimerization, Epichlorohydrin, Heterogeneous catalyst, MOFs, Reaction catalyzed, Reaction mechanism, Ring opening of epoxide, Cyclodimerization, Epichlorohydrin, MOFs, Oligomerization, Temperature program desorption (TPD), ZIF","Glycerol can be converted to valuable products such as epichlorohydrin which is an important intermediate applied in various industries. For example, dioxane derivatives, which are important pharmaceuticals, can be obtained from epichlorohydrin. In the present study, ZIF-8, ZIF-67, MIL-100, and UiO-66 were applied for the direct cyclodimerization of epichlorohydrin. These MOFs were selected because they were already applied as active catalysts in ring opening of epoxides. Among them, ZIF-8 showed the highest activity and selectivity in the absence of any solvent or co-catalyst. Using ZIF-8 as a catalyst, the cyclodimer product (1,4-dioxane 2,5-bis-chloromethyl) was obtained in a yield of about 70% which was significantly superior to previous homo or heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction. Due to ZIF-8 structure and the proposed mechanism, the cyclodimerization reaction catalyzed either by the defects in the structure and/or on the surface. Furthermore, acidic-basic characteristics were also in play. The NH3 and CO2 temperature-programed desorption technique were utilized to identify the active sites and thereby reaction mechanism. Moreover, because of similar properties of ZIF-8 to zeolites, the activity of commercial ZSM-5 for the same reaction was also investigated in this work.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Evaluation of NID2 promoter methylation for screening of Oral squamous cell carcinoma,"Srisuttee R., Arayataweegool A., Mahattanasakul P., Tangjaturonrasme N., Kerekhanjanarong V., Keelawat S., Mutirangura A., Kitkumthorn N.",2020-03-14,"Adult, Aged, Biomarkers, Tumor, Calcium-Binding Proteins, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Cross-Sectional Studies, DNA Methylation, Early Detection of Cancer, Female, Humans, Male, Mass Screening, Middle Aged, Mouth Neoplasms, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Detection, Methylation, Nidogen 2, Oral squamous cell carcinoma","Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive human malignancy. Because of late diagnosis and recurrence of OSCC, the treatment of patients with OSCC is often ineffective. Thus, finding novel biomarkers of OSCC are essential. Here we derived a methylation marker by utilizing methylation microarray data and testing its capacity in cross-sectional study designed for OSCC detection and screening. Methods: According to bioinformatics analysis of total of 27,578 cg sites, cg22881914 of Nidogen 2 (NID2) methylation was selected for evaluation. Next, we confirmed the methylation status by bisulfite sequencing from the microdissected OSCC cells in comparison with the microdissected oral epithelia. Subsequently, we developed a simple technique using real-time PCR with the specific probe to examine the ability for the detection of OSCC in the oral epithelial samples, which included 103 oral rinse and 82 oral swab samples. Results: Based on the comparison of microdissected tissue, cg22881914 of NID2 was proved to be methylated in most OSCC cells but unmethylated in the normal oral epithelia. Furthermore, the methylated NID2-relied quantitative PCR approach has demonstrated that this marker assists in distinguishing among patients with OSCC from normal oral epithelia, smokers, and patients with oral lichen planus using the non-invasive oral rinse and swab samples. Conclusions: Specific methylation at cg22881914 of NID2 of OSCC could be used as an important potential marker for detecting OSCC. Thus, to certify the utility of this marker, further studies with a larger sample size are needed.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Oncology, Cancer Research"

In this article the evapotranspiration was determined with the simplified equation of Makkink. There is need for precise approximation of the reference crop evapotranspiration in order to determine the water requirement in irrigated agriculture. However ET0 estimation is very difficult to achieve due to too many input parameters. Therefore the primary objective of the research was to establish regression models of the ET0 in regard to several input weather parameters. The regression models will be created by input/output data pairs. The main aim is to achieve predictive capable models for the ET0. Also according to the regression models precision one can determine the input parameters influence on the ET0. Hence one king of ranking process will be performed in order to select which factors have the most influence on the ET0. The repression models will be created by neuro fuzzy logic procedure since the procedure could handle high nonlinearity between input and output data pairs. According to the results Global radiation has the strongest influence on the ET0. Combination of Daily average temperature and Global radiation is the optimal combination for the ET0 estimation.","plant science; crop science; crop physicsiology; Agricultural and Biological Sciencescultural meteorology, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, computer science","Forestry, Agronomy and Crop Science, Computer Science Applications, Horticulture"

The chemical structure of targeted pullulan derivative, folic acid-decorated para-aminobenzoic acid-quat188-pullulan (FA-PABA-Q188-PUL), was designed for reducing, stabilizing, capping, and functionalizing AuNPs. Here, the key factors, including pH, temperature, and FA-PABA-Q188-PUL concentrations, were systematically optimized to control the morphology, size, and functionalization of multifunctional FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs. Spherical FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs obtained by a green, simple, and bio-inspired strategy under the optimum conditions were thoroughly characterized and had an average size of 12.6 ± 1.5 nm. The anticancer drug DOX was successfully loaded on monodispersed FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs and the system exhibited excellent intracellular uptake, specificity, and physicochemical properties. The pH-responsive DOX release from FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs-DOX showed fast release (85% after 72 h) under acidic conditions. Furthermore, FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs-DOX enhanced the anticancer activity of DOX toward Chago-k1 cancer cells up to 4.8-fold and showed less cytotoxicity toward normal cells than free DOX. The FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs-DOX induced the death of cells by increasing late apoptotic cells (26.4%) and arresting the cell cycle at S-G2/M phases. These results showed that innovative FA-PABA-Q188-PUL@AuNPs should be considered as new candidate platforms for anticancer drug delivery systems.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

The JFRP strengthening ratio and the pre-damaged level of RC beam are considered in this study. The test results revealed that JFRP can significantly improve the shear strength capacity of beams. All strengthened beams show a similar failure mode which is a rupture on JFRP sheets. The shear enhancement of JFRP strengthened pre-damaged beams are comparable to that of non-damaged beams strengthened with conventional FRPs, proving the applicability of JFRP strengthening in pre-damaged shear-deficient beams. In addition, the experimental results are compared with the predicted values by the Japanese design codes.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Civil and Structural Engineering"

Dengue outbreaks have occurred in many parts of the world, including Southeast Asia. The outbreak and the severity of the diseases depend on many factors including dengue genotype. Data on the genetic variation of dengue virus is highly informative for dengue protection plans and vaccine development. In this study, we focused on the analyses of genetic variation and amino acid changes of the whole coding sequences in two dengue strains isolated from Aedes mosquitoes in Bangkok, Thailand, an endemic area. The strains were identified as belonging to dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) genotype I, and have unique nucleotide sequences. In the recombinant analysis, these strains were identified as recombinants derived from Chinese counterparts for both the major (DENV-1 genotype I) and the minor (DENV-1 genotype IV) parental strains. The recombination event occurred within the prM and E genes. This corresponded with the result of multiple alignments where several amino acid residues between the recombination breakpoints in the strains were identical to those in DENV-1 genotype IV. Several of the amino acid substitutions also have changed the amino acid properties, which might affect viral infection and antigenicity. These results provide insight into the genetic variation of DENV in this endemic area, which might have been involved in the dengue outbreak and high numbers of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome cases in Thailand in 2015.","Immunology, medical, biochemistryistry","Virology, Infectious Diseases, Cancer Research"

Temperature dependence of ultrasonic wave velocities was carried out at 4 MHz frequency using pressure-controlled ultrasonic technique. It was found that the velocities decreased gradually as BaO content increased. However, sound velocities increased with increasing temperature. Then, both velocities were applied to estimate their elastic properties. Based on the obtained results, the elastic moduli and micro hardness of studied glasses increased with the amount of BaO and temperature, while their Poisson's ratio remained almost constant. Radiation shielding properties were investigated in terms of μm and HVL at photon energies of 74.23, 97.14, 122, 662, 1173, and 1332 keV by using narrow beam x-ray attenuation and transmission methods.

In addition, the use of oral ketogenic compounds, fractionated coconut oil, very low carbohydrate intake, or ketone monoester supplementation has been reported to be potentially helpful in mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autistic spectrum disorder. In these and other neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders, there are detrimental effects of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation on neuronal function. However, they also adversely impact on neurone-glia interactions, disrupting the role of microglia and astrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Astrocytes are the main site of CNS fatty acid oxidation; the resulting ketone bodies constitute an important source of oxidative fuel for neurones in an environment of glucose restriction. Importantly, the lactate shuttle between astrocytes and neurones is dependent on glycogenolysis and glycolysis, resulting from the fact that the astrocytic filopodia responsible for lactate release are too narrow to accommodate mitochondria. The entry into the CNS of ketone bodies and fatty acids, as a result of nutritional ketosis, has effects on the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle, glutamate synthase activity, and on the function of vesicular glutamate transporters, EAAT, Na+, K+-ATPase, Kir4.1, aquaporin-4, Cx34 and KATP channels, as well as on astrogliosis. These mechanisms are detailed and it is suggested that they would tend to mitigate the changes seen in many neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive disorders. Hence, it is hypothesized that nutritional ketosis may have therapeutic applications in such disorders.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

This was a retro-prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with FFA from 1 January 2010 to 1 November 2019. All patients were asked to present for re-examination. Clinical, trichoscopic, histopathological and laboratory data were recorded. A questionnaire was used to investigate hair care, hairstyle and facial skin care compared with age-matched normal controls. Multivariate analysis was performed in order to clarify factors associated with severity. All 58 FFA patients were female, of whom 27.6% were premenopausal, 37.7% had a history of surgical menopause, 13.8% had thyroid diseases, 69% had eyebrow loss and 32.8% facial papules. On physical examination, 10.3% showed linear pattern, 46.6% diffuse pattern and 43.1% pseudo-fringe sign.

The continuum-based approach corresponding to the complete version of Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity model is adopted to demonstrate the influence from surface energy. Normal and radial displacement boundary conditions in the contact region corresponding to the frictional indentation problem is formulated in the term of integral equations by employing the relevant displacement Green's function obtained by the use of Hankel integral transform. The contact tractions are solved by applying a collocation technique together with the assumption of a piecewise distribution for the tractions within each discretized annular ring element. The accuracy of proposed solution scheme is validated with existing solutions from classical continuum mechanics for frictional indentation problem of an elastic half-space. Selected numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influence of friction effects on the elastic fields of the layer under the influence of surface energy. It is found that the consideration of frictional contact makes the layer stiffer when compared to the frictionless indentation, and the influence of friction effect is smaller when the surface energy effects are accounted for. In addition, the elastic fields of the layer are clearly size-dependent and the elastic layer becomes stiffer with the presence of surface stresses.","engineering, Materials Science, physics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) promotes tight junction assembly in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), well-known prebiotics, have previously been shown to alleviate inflammation-associated intestinal epithelial disruption although the mechanisms were unclear. This study aimed to investigate any effect of FOS on AMPK activity and tight junction assembly under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions using T84 cells as an IEC model. As analyzed by western blot, FOS induced AMPK activation through a calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)-phospholipase C (PLC)- Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (CaMKKβ) pathway. Calcium switch assays and immunofluorescence staining of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) revealed that FOS induced tight junction assembly via an CaMKKβ-AMPK-dependent mechanism in IEC. Interestingly, FOS reversed the suppressive effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on AMPK activity and tight junction assembly via a CaMKKβ pathway. Taken together, these findings uncover a prebiotic-independent effect of FOS in promoting intestinal epithelial tight junction assembly through AMPK activation, which may have implications for the treatment of diseases whose pathogenesis involves impaired intestinal barrier function.","cell and developmental biology; membranes and cell transport; cell junctions and cell adhesion; tight junctions, pharmacology",Pharmacology

The process performances in terms of hydrogen productivity, hydrogen purity, ethanol conversion, CO2 capture ability and thermal efficiency were compared at their maximized net hydrogen. The simulation results showed that the sorption enhanced processes yield better performances than the conventional ESR and CLR because their in situ CO2 sorption increases hydrogen production and provides heat from the sorption reaction. SECLR is the most promising process as it offers the highest net hydrogen with high-purity hydrogen at low energy requirement. Only 12.5% of the produced hydrogen was diverted into combustion to fulfill the process's energy requirement. The thermal efficiency of SECLR was evaluated at 86% at its optimal condition.","mixing and separation, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Methods: AYHIV who transferred from a pediatric to an adult clinic within the past year across five sites in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam had clinical and laboratory evaluations and completed questionnaires about their health, socioeconomic factors, and transition experiences. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess associations with HIV viremia. Results: Of 93 AYHIV enrolled between June 2016 and April 2017, 56% were female, 87% acquired HIV through perinatal exposure, median age was 20 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18.5–21). Two-thirds were in a formal education program, 43% were employed, 43% of females and 35% of males were sexually active. Median lifetime antiretroviral therapy duration was 6.2 years (IQR 3.3–10.7); 45% had received second-line therapy. Median CD4 was 601 cells/mm3 (IQR 477–800); 82% had HIV-RNA <40 copies/mL. Being in a relationship, a shorter posttransition duration, self-reported adherence of ≥95%, and higher CD4 were inversely associated with HIV viremia. Half felt very prepared for the transfer to adult care, and 20% frequently and 43% sometimes still met with pediatric providers. Two-thirds reported needing to keep their HIV a secret, and 23%–38% reported never or rarely having someone to discuss problems with. Conclusions: Asian AYHIV in our cohort were concerned about the negative social impact of having and disclosing HIV, and one-third lacked people they could trust with their personal problems, which could have negative implications for their ability to navigate adult life.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

GQDs were synthesized by directly pyrolyzing citric acid and then dropped onto the surface of IL-SPCE, which was prepared by screen-printing the mixture of IL and carbon ink on a portable substrate. UV–vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the synthesized GQDs and the modified electrodes. The GQDs/IL-SPCE exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of AA, DA, and UA in the mixture solution. Moreover, the anodic peak responses of these three analytes were also resolved into three well-defined peaks. Under the optimized conditions, the linear response ranges for AA, DA, and UA were 25–400 μM, 0.2–10 μM, and 0.5–20 μM, respectively, with low detection limits (σ/N = 3) of 6.64 μM, 0.06 μM, and 0.03 μM, respectively. The proposed sensor exhibited high sensitivity, low cost and successfully applied for the simultaneous detection of AA, DA, and UA in pharmaceutical products and biological samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Fuel replacement: A possible option for Thailand energy security?,"Nakapreecha N., Vivanpatarakij S., Audomvongseree K.",2020-04-06,"Average growth, Carbon emissions, Foreign countries, Fossil-based fuels, Gulf of Thailand, Industrial sector, Intensive fuels, Natural gas demand, Carbon emissions mitigation, Coal replacement, Energy security, Fuel oil replacement, Natural gas","Natural gas has been playing an important role in strengthening energy security of Thailand as over 60 percent of total natural gas consumed in the country is from the Gulf of Thailand. In the past 20 years, the average growth of natural gas demand is 5.5 percent per year. Thanks to its low carbon content, natural gas is considered as cleaner fuel comparing to other fossil-based fuels. Still, there are usages of carbon-intensive fuels such as fuel oil and coal in Thailand e.g. in the industrial sector. Most of fuel oil and coal consumed are imported from foreign countries. Replacing these fuels with natural gas may be an option for the country to promote domestic clean energy and reduce overall carbon emissions. This paper forecasts the possibility of replacing fuel oil and coal in the industrial sector with natural gas. The research starts with examining the limitations of Thai regulations, estimating the amount of natural gas required for the replacement, and forecasting future prices of all three fuels. The price projection shows an attractive option for fuel oil users as the long term price of natural gas is projected to be lower than that of fuel oil. On the contrary, the projected coal price alone will not encourage coal users to switch their fuels. Thus, strong government measures will be required to stimulate coal replacement. The result of the study will be useful for determining appropriate policies to support long-term demand for natural gas of the country.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

The purpose of this study was to clarify the three-dimensional (3D) topography of the exposed segment (ES) of the FA and to provide information to help minimize complications during clinical procedures. From 50 embalmed adult cadavers, the undissected and dissected hemifaces were scanned and reconstructed using the 3D scanner. Then the topographic location of the ES was identified and measured from the superimposed the 3D images. The ES was observed in 82% of the whole specimens. The exposure patterns of the ES were examined, and classified into three types: Type I, one site exposed pattern (74%); Type II, two sites exposed pattern (8%); and Type III, nonexposed pattern (18%). The extent of the ES was located at 2.2 mm above and 4.2 mm below the cheilion (Ch)—otobasion inferius line, and 20.0 to 25.2 mm from the Ch on the lateral aspect. In the frontal view, the average distance from the mid-pupillary line to the ES was 7.1 mm, and from the lateral canthal line to the ES was 6.1 mm. The ES was 7.6 mm below the skin surface.

Even though the previous stability solutions of unsupported excavations namely infinitely long trenches and circular excavations are available in the literature, there is a lack of the stability solution of unsupported rectangular ones. In this paper, the lower bound solutions for the undrained stability of unsupported rectangular excavations in non-homogeneous clays are presented for the first time. A three-dimensional lower bound finite element limit analysis is developed in order to investigate the stability of this problem. The undrained shear strength of non-homogeneous clays are considered as a linearly increasing one with depth. The effects of aspect ratios of rectangular excavations, excavated depth ratios, and normalized strength gradients on the stability number of the problem and its associated failure mechanisms are examined parametrically. A new design equation of the problem is also firstly presented for practical use by practising engineers.","numerical methods, fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, computer science","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Computer Science Applications"

X-ray analysis reveals that both drugs insert the A-ring moiety vertically from the β-CD O2[sbnd]H/O3[sbnd]H-side and are kept in position by C5[sbnd]H⋯π interactions, yielding thermodynamically favorable complexes. In the β-CD cavity, NRT and AMT are less open as their butterfly angles are ~10° smaller than those in free HCl salt forms and in complex with proteins. The effect of HCl salt on both complexes is evaluated by DFT full-geometry optimization. When Cl− is directly linked with the NRT NH2Me+ group, the inclusion complex formed gains stability by 3.65 kcal mol−1 through N5′[sbnd]H⋯Cl⋯H[sbnd]O26 H-bond chain, compared to the complex of NRT base. The addition of HCl to N5′ of the side chain marginally affects the structures of β-CD–TCA complexes. This study provides a rigorous crystallographic evidence for the β-CD–TCA complexation and a theoretical view on the improved stability of TCA in the CD cavity, supporting the pharmacological benefit of CD encapsulation in reducing the TCA side effects.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

A molecular dynamics study presented here unveiled conformational variability in association with the flexibility of the glycosidic linkers, which depends on the number of disaccharide units. HA chain maintains a rigid rod-like conformation with short chain lengths. Crossover from a rod-like to a random−coil conformation is observed with increasing the chain length. The conformation with the β(1,4) linkage is more flexible than that with the β(1,3) linkage. Variation of the radius of gyration and conformational fluctuation showed that the β(1,4) linkers along with the HA chain length enhance the overall conformational flexibility and therefore elastic response of the polymer chain. Besides the inter-saccharide hydrogen bonding, Na+ binds preferably at the β(1,4) site. The hydration number of HA increases as an increase in the chain length. The hydration per disaccharide unit remains constant with the chain length.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

This study aimed to use electronic nose coupled with chemometrics as a rapid and nondestructive method for detection of fungal contamination on brown rice grain. Jasmine brown rice was artificially infected with Aspergillus and stored at 30 °C and 85% RH. Volatile markers of fungal infected brown rice were identified using solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME/GC–MS). The volatomic profiles of fungal infected rice were analyzed using electronic nose and explored using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) were then employed to classify samples with different levels of fungal contamination as a factor of storage time. Partial least squares (PLS) regression model was developed for prediction of the fungal growth on brown rice. The electronic nose coupled with PLS regression could accurately predict the fungal growth and gave coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.969, and root mean square error, RMSE = 0.31 Log CFU/g. The results suggested that the electronic nose can be used as a rapid and nondestructive tool for early detection of fungal infection on rice grain prior to visible growth.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Herein, we first demonstrated a new ready-to-use electrochemical sensor for on-site analysis of paraquat (PQ) using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel-electrolyte. For the preparation of gel-electrolyte, hydrolyzed PVA was dissolved in DMSO: water media, allowed to cool down to room temperature before adding LiClO4, and casted onto an electrode surface. To perform the experiment, nafion-modified screen-printed graphene electrode (Nf/SPGE) was used to enhance the electrochemical signal of PQ detection using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit of 0.31 μmol L−1 was obtained. Moreover, this article reported on the comparison of PQ detection obtained from ready-to-use gel-electrolyte and liquid-electrolyte. Finally, the proposed sensor was applied for the quantitative analysis of PQ in real samples. The operation can be easily performed by directly introducing sample solution onto the sensor without any additional sample preparation. This makes a device easy to carry out for field analysis. Additionally, this newly ready-to-use electrochemical platform displays good reproducibility, high stability, simple preparation, low-cost, disposability, and portability, which makes it suitable for various applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Performance analysis and temperature gradient of solid oxide fuel cell stacks operated with bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming,"Wiranarongkorn K., Banerjee A., Deutschmann O., Arpornwichanop A.",2020-04-17,"Air to fuel ratios, Electrochemical reactions, Enhanced steam reforming, High temperature gradient, Maximum temperature gradient, Performance analysis, Solid oxide fuel cell stack, System efficiency, Solid oxide fuel cell system, Sorption-enhanced steam reforming, System efficiency, Temperature gradient","A high temperature gradient within a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack is considered a major challenge in SOFC operations. This study investigates the effects of the key parameters on SOFC system efficiency and temperature gradient within a SOFC stack. A 40-cell SOFC stack integrated with a bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reformer is simulated using MATLAB and DETCHEM. When the air-to-fuel ratio and steam-to-fuel ratio increase, the stack average temperature and temperature gradient decrease. However, a decrease in the stack temperature steadily reduces the system efficiency owing to the tradeoff between the stack performance and thermal balance between heat recovered and consumed by the system. With an increase in the bio-oil flow rate, the system efficiency decreases because of the lower resident time for the electrochemical reaction. This is not, however, beneficial to the maximum temperature gradient. To minimize the temperature gradient of the SOFC stack, a decrease in the bio-oil flow rate is the most effective way. The maximum temperature gradient can be reduced to 14.6 K cm−1 with the stack and system efficiency of 76.58 and 65.18%, respectively, when the SOFC system is operated at an air-to-fuel ratio of 8, steam-to-fuel ratio of 6, and bio-oil flow rate of 0.0041 mol s−1.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS. Methods: Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified. Data on epidemiology and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients on HFOV were compared to patients on other modes of ventilation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect. Results: A total of 328 patients were included. In the first 7 days of PARDS, 122/328 (37.2%) patients were supported with HFOV. There were significant differences in baseline oxygenation index (OI) between the HFOV and non-HFOV groups (18.8 [12.0, 30.2] vs. 7.7 [5.1, 13.1] respectively; p < 0.001). A total of 118 pairs were matched in the GM method which found a significant association between HFOV with 28-day mortality in PARDS [odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 4.4, p value 0.01]. VFD was indifferent between the HFOV and non-HFOV group [mean difference - 1.3 (95%CI - 3.4, 0.9); p = 0.29] but IFD was significantly lower in the HFOV group [- 2.5 (95%CI - 4.9, - 0.5); p = 0.03]. From the sensitivity analysis, PS matching, IPTW and MSM all showed consistent direction of HFOV treatment effect in PARDS. Conclusion: The use of HFOV was associated with increased 28-day mortality in PARDS. This study suggests caution but does not eliminate equivocality and a randomized controlled trial is justified to examine the true association.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

In this work, we focused on cerium decahydride, CeH10. Ce is a member of the so-called lability belt in the periodic table, where the physical properties can be largely affected by pressure. It was reported and we confirmed that CeH10 can be formed with the Fm-3m structure, where a cerium atom is embedded in a H32 clathrate cage. Our phonon calculations show that it is dynamically stable at around 300 GPa onwards. We examined the evolution under pressures of the phonons, the electronic states, the Fermi surface, and the electron localization function (ELF). There exists a small van Hove singularity (vHs), and it gradually moves to below the Fermi surface as pressure increases. This behaviour associating with the reducing value of the electron-phonon coupling strength (λ), causes the superconductivity transition temperature (Tc) to gradually reduce under pressures. The maximum T c is 45 K at 300 GPa.","atomic and molecular physicsics, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

Heart rate variability (standard deviation of N-N intervals) increased by 14.94 (95% CI, 0.31-33.56) milliseconds in the intervention group as compared with controls (P = 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences across intervention groups in symptoms, physical performance, or endothelial function. Participants in the intervention group reverted to baseline steps during the postintervention follow-up. Limitations: The Northern California study setting may limit generalizability. Walking does not capture the full spectrum of physical activity. Conclusions: A short-term pedometer-based intervention led to increased step counts in dialysis patients, but the increase was not sustained. Pedometer-based interventions are feasible for dialysis patients, but future studies are needed to address whether more prolonged interventions can improve physical function or symptoms.

"Potential influence of jaggery-based biofloc technology at different C:N ratios on water quality, growth performance, innate immunity, immune-related genes expression profiles, and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)","Elayaraja S., Mabrok M., Algammal A., Sabitha E., Rajeswari M.V., Zagorsek K., Ye Z., Zhu S., Rodkhum C.",2020-12-01,"Aeromonas hydrophila, Animals, Aquaculture, Carbon, Cichlids, Disease Resistance, Fish Diseases, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Nitrogen, Plant Extracts, Technology, Water Quality, Biofloc, Experimental challenge, Innate immunity, Jaggery powder, Nile tilapia","Biofloc technology is increasingly becoming the most promising aquaculture tool especially in places where water is scarce and the land is very expensive. The dynamics of water quality, as well as plankton and microbial abundance, are collectively necessary for successful fish farming. The prospective use of jaggery as a potential carbon source and its influence on water quality, growth performance, innate immunity, serum bactericidal capacity, and disease resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila was investigated in Oreochromis niloticus. A completely randomized design was used in triplicates, where the control group was reared in a water system with no carbon source, while T1, T2, and T3 groups were raised in biofloc systems at C:N ratios of C:N12, C:N15, and C:N20, respectively. Water specimens were collected daily and fortnightly, while blood, serum, and head kidneys were collected at 75 days of experimental period for further analysis. TAN, nitrite, and ammonia values were considerably reduced, while the TSS values elevated significantly in all treated groups compared to the control. Jaggery-based biofloc system (JB-BFT) has a pronounced effect on hematological and growth performance parameters rather than control. Similarly, serum antioxidants, lysozyme, protease, antiprotease and bactericidal capacity were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. LYZ, TNF-α, and IL-1β genes were upregulated in proportion to C:N ratios with the highest fold in C:N20. Furthermore, fish treated with JB-BFT presented lower cumulative mortalities and better relative levels of production (RLP) after experimental challenge with A. hydrophila compared to control. In conclusion, JB-BFT has a robust influence on Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) innate immunity through favorable innovation of various immune-cells and enzymes as well as upregulating the expression levels of immune-related genes. This study offers jaggery as a new carbon source with unique properties that satisfy all considerations of biofloc technology in an eco-friendly manner.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Cross-Linking Silsesquioxane Cages with Polyaromatics as Fluorescent Porous Polymers for Fluoride Sensing and Removal,"Wannasiri C., Chanmungkalakul S., Bunchuay T., Chuenchom L., Uraisin K., Ervithayasuporn V., Kiatkamjornwong S.",2020-03-13,"Absorption and emissions, Fluorescent polymers, High surface area, Mesoporous structures, Photophysical properties, Silica based materials, Solvent polarity, Spectral change, adsorbent, fluoride, sensor, silica, silisesquioxane","Fluorescent polymer nanocomposites of silsesquioxane cage-based anthracene (An-PSQ) and pyrene (Py-PSQ) were obtained by cross-linked polymerization of octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS) with 9,10-dibromoanthracene or 1,6-dibromopyrene, respectively. The fluorescent polymers are insoluble and were structurally characterized by FT-IR and NMR. Polyaromatic spacer groups incorporated into materials could tune and rigidify in both micro- and mesoporous structures with high surface area in comparison to silica-based materials in the range of 246-342 m2/g, and their XRD analyses also show the amorphous nature. Both An-PSQ and Py-PSQ exhibit solvent-polarity-dependent photophysical properties in both light absorption and emission, which were employed in the anion sensing (i.e., F-, CN-) in high polarity organic media. Importantly, excimer natures of polyaromatic spacer groups among silsesquioxane cages play an important role in the selectivity of anions in recognition. An-PSQ gives spectral changes in the presence of both F- and CN-, whereas replacing anthracenyl to pyrenyl group in Py-PSQ could selectively detect only F- because of a stronger excimer feature. Moreover, strong fluoride-silsesquioxane interaction has provided another function to these materials as adsorbent for highly hydrophilic F- anion from organic media containing water up to 77%.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Process Chemistry and Technology, Organic Chemistry"
Heat shock protein 70 from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvHSP70) is involved in the innate immune response against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection,"Janewanthanakul S., Supungul P., Tang S., Tassanakajon A.",2020-01-01,"Animals, Apoptosis, Arthropod Proteins, Catechol Oxidase, Disease Resistance, Enzyme Precursors, Gene Expression Regulation, Hemocytes, HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins, Immunity, Innate, Penaeidae, Recombinant Proteins, Signal Transduction, Survival Rate, Up-Regulation, White spot syndrome virus 1, Apoptosis, Heat shock protein 70, ProPO activating system, Shrimp immunity, White spot syndrome virus","White spot syndrome (WSS) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a severe infectious disease in shrimp aquaculture. To find effective therapeutics to control WSSV, it is indispensable to understand the innate immune responses of shrimp to WSSV infection. Previous report demonstrated that the Litopenaeus vannamei heat shock protein 70 (LvHSP70) could induce shrimp innate immunity against bacterial infection. Herein, we further investigate the role of LvHSP70 in anti-WSSV infection. The temporal expression of LvHSP70 was significantly upregulated 2.5- and 1.5-fold at 6 and 24 h post systemic WSSV infection suggesting that the LvHSP70 was a WSSV responsive gene. The recombinant protein of LvHSP70 (rLvHSP70) was produced in an Escherichia coli system and its effect in protection against WSSV infection was investigated. Intramuscularly injection of juvenile shrimp with 1 nmol of rLvHSP70 could significantly prolong 50% mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp from 3 days to 5 days as compared to the control group injected with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Consistently, the injection of rLvHSP70 resulted in 24-fold, 20-fold and 100-fold decrease in the viral copy number after 6, 12 and 24 h post injection, respectively, compared to the control shrimp injected with BSA. Interestingly, it was found that the rLvHSP70 enhanced the expression of the key gene in the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system, LvproPO, but reduced the expression of Lvcaspase2 and LvIAP in WSSV-infected shrimp. These results suggested that the LvHSP70 is an important molecule involved in antiviral defense in shrimp presumably via modulating the proPO system and apoptosis.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Developmental Biology"

We sought to determine the efficacy of low-dose bupivacaine infusion via surgeon-inserted modified continuous transversus abdominis plane (mcTAP) catheters after LCS. Methods: A parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized single-centre trial was conducted between April 2017 and February 2018. Block-of-four randomization and allocation concealment by sequentially-numbered, opaque sealed envelopes were used. Patients, surgeons and assessors were blinded. Fifty-two patients were randomized to receive either 0.2% bupivacaine or saline through mcTAP catheters. A 5 ml bolus followed by a 72 h infusion at 2 ml/h was started, with patient-controlled fentanyl analgesia and oral paracetamol given on demand. Primary outcomes were fentanyl consumptions in the first 24 h, second 24 h, and third 24 h following surgery. Secondary outcomes were pain numeric rating scores, recovery outcomes and complications. Results: Twenty-five patients in the bupivacaine group and 26 in the control group were analysed. Patients in the bupivacaine group required significantly less fentanyl overall (106.1 vs 484.5 mcg, p < 0.001) and at all time points (first 24 h: 61.0 vs 324.3 mcg, p < 0.001; second 24 h: 36.3 vs 119.0 mcg, p = 0.033; third 24 h: 8.8 vs 41.2, p = 0.030) when compared to placebo. Significantly lower pain scores at rest at 6 h (2.32 vs 4.0, p = 0.002), and 12 h (1.80 vs 3.08, p = 0.011) and on coughing at 6 h (4.56 vs 5.84, p = 0.019), 12 h (3.76 vs 4.96, p = 0.009), and 24 h (3.44 vs 4.24, p = 0.049) as well as significantly lower opioid-related complications such as nausea or vomiting (9 (36%) vs 1 (4%), p = 0.005) were observed in the bupivacaine group.

SEM images indicate a well-distributed structure of the composites. The water contact angles existed in the range of 50–70◦. Measured water vapor permeability values were 300–800 g/m2/24 h, which were comparable with those of commercial dressing products. No release of curcumin from the films was observed during the immersion in PBS and artificial saliva, and the fluid uptakes were in the range of 100–700%. Films were stretchable and provided appropriate stiffness and enduring deformation. Hydrated films adhered firmly onto the skin. In vitro mucoadhesion time was found in the range of 0.5–6 h with porcine mucosa as model membrane under artificial saliva medium. The curcumin-loaded films had substantial antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. The films showed non-cytotoxicity to human keratinocytes and human gingival fibroblasts but exhibited potent anticancer activity in oral cancer cells. Therefore, these curcumin-loaded films showed their potential for use as leave-on skin applications. These versatile films can be further developed to achieve desirable characteristics for local topical patches for wound care, periodontitis and oral cancer treatment.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

It has strong and consistent wind speed when compared to the natural wind, with velocity about 5 to 10 m/s at a distance of 5 cm from the exhaust air outlet. However, some negative impacts to the exhaust air system performance was observed when a conventional wind turbine was employed. The objective of this research is to feasibility study the practicality of a prototype shaftless small scale horizontal axis wind turbine (SSHWT) to generate electricity from the exhaust air of the industrial exhaust air system. Aerodynamic, blade and generator designs were addressed in this study to maximize energy output and minimize negative impacts to the performance of the original exhaust air system. The performance of SSHWT was tested with a selected industrial fan that is widely used in industrial sections. The results showed that the SSHWT could generate electricity with less negative effect to exhaust air system performance. However, it still needs further improvements caused by the voltage output is too low. By the concept design, this innovative wind turbine is compact, thus needs only small space for installation. This SSHWT has high market potential for low wind speed countries to take advantage of unnatural wind resources which are better in terms of efficiency and economy for sustainable energy development.","power genergyation and power plants, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone histomorphometry in HD patients. Methods: Twenty-two chronic HD patients were enrolled. Serum levels of bone turnover markers were measured. Double tetracycline-labelled iliac crest bone specimens were evaluated using specialized a computer program (Osteomeasure). The types of bone histomorphometry were classified based on turnover, mineralization and volume. BMD and coronary artery calcification were also determined. Results: Bone histomorphometry revealed osteitis fibrosa (50%), adynamic bone disease (45%) and mixed uremic osteodystrophy (5%). Serum iPTH level predicted high bone turnover with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.833 (95% CI = 0.665–1.000, P = 0.008). Serum TRAP-5b also had ROC of 0.733 (95% CI = 0.517–0.950, P = 0.065). In addition, when using serum iPTH (cut-off 484.50 ng/mL) or serum TRAP-5b (cut-off 1.91 pg./mL) to predict high turnover, the sensitivity was 0.917. On the other hand, when both iPTH and TRAP-5B were above these cut-off, the specificity was 1.000. Low BMD and severe vascular calcification were commonly identified. However, there were no significant correlations between bone biomarkers and BMD or severe vascular calcification. Conclusion: Although iPTH levels were close to the target of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, abnormal bone histomorphometry, BMD, and severe vascular calcification are still common.

So, a robust optimization technique is applied in this work to investigate robust scheduling of EV aggregators considering price uncertainty. The proposed EV aggregator participates in market price with the aim of maximizing the profit. In order to model the market price uncertainty with the mentioned technique, the upper and lower amounts of upstream grid prices are used instead of the estimated prices. The output of the proposed algorithm is used to build the various charging and discharging strategies which can be used by the operator to robust scheduling of EV aggregator under upstream grid price uncertainty. With considering the obtained results, it can be shown that the total profit of EV aggregator in optimistic strategy is raised 69.78% in comparison with the deterministic strategy while it is decreased 54.94% in pessimistic cases. It should be noted that the applied technique is formulated as a MIP model which is implemented in GAMS and global optimal result is guaranteed.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The powdery and compacted formulation of the raw materials was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), particle size distribution (PSD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and acoustic emission technique (AE). The milling mechanism comprised of essentially three stages of milling time viz.; 120, 240, and 360 min respectively, with no milling (0 min) serving as the control batch. During the first stage of milling (120 min), it was observed that the greatest deformation occurred for the powdery formulation with increasing surface area, control batch inclusive, from 26.4 to 41.1 m2 g−1. It was also noticed that the density of the samples increased with progressive ball milling time. The mean crystallite sizes of un-milled and milled powders were calculated as 36.61, 48.82, 34.27 and 52.13 μm for control batch and powders milled at 120, 240, and 360 min, and denoted as MT0, MT120, MT240, and MT360, respectively. The mean crystallite sizes further reduced with increasing milling time up to 240 min and increased with milling time up to 360 min. These results were in line with the SEM findings. The acoustic emission (AE) intensity increased reaching a maximum at MT240, and a noticeable decline in the case of MT360 was observed. This indicated a gradual crack growth behavior because of the highly stressed powders used for the compacts.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials"

However, the quality of delivery of CPR varies widely in different settings, possibly affecting patient outcomes. This study is aimed to determine the efficacy of an audio-visual (AV) CPR feedback device in improving the quality of CPR delivered by healthcare providers. Methods: This pre-post, single-arm, quasi-experimental study randomly sampled 140 healthcare providers working in the Emergency Department of Hospital Ampang, Malaysia. Parameters of CPR quality, namely chest compression rate and depth were compared among participants when they performed CPR with and without an AV CPR feedback device. The efficacy of the AV CPR feedback device was assessed using the Chi-square test and Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) models. Results: The use of an AV CPR feedback device increased the proportion of healthcare providers achieving recommended depth of chest compressions from 38.6% (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI: 30.5, 47.2) to 85.0% (95%CI: 78.0, 90.5).

We aimed to explore patterns of UF practice, barriers to achieving UF targets, and concerns related to UF practice among practitioners working in Europe. Methods: This was a sub-study of an international open survey with focus on adult intensivists and nephrologists, advanced practice providers, and ICU and dialysis nurses working in Europe. Results: Four hundred eighty-five practitioners (75% intensivists) from 31 countries completed the survey. The most common criteria for UF initiation was persistent oliguria/anuria (45.6%), followed by pulmonary edema (16.7%). Continuous renal replacement therapy was the preferred initial modality (90.0%). The median initial and maximal rate of net ultrafiltration (UFNET) prescription in hemodynamically stable patients were 149 mL/hr. (IQR 100–200) and 300 mL/hr.

When hemodynamic instability occurred, 70.1% of practitioners reported decreasing the rate of fluid removal, followed by starting or increasing the dose of a vasopressor (51.3%). Most respondents (90.7%) believed in early fluid removal and expressed willingness to participate in a study comparing protocol-based fluid removal versus usual care. Conclusions: There was a significant variation in UF practice and perception among practitioners in Europe.

The target DNA induces a strand displacement reaction by replacing the pre-hybridized strand that is labeled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Thus, the amount of displaced-AuNP-labeled strand is proportional to the amount of target DNA in the sample. The use of a magnetogenosensing technique to isolate the target DNA allows for a simple, one-pot detection approach, which minimizes possible carry-over contamination and pipetting errors. We sought a proof-of-concept for this technology in its ability to detect DNA-equivalent of hepatitis E virus (HEV), which causes acute viral hepatitis for which rapid and simple diagnostic methods remain limited. Signal detection was done via visual observation, spectrophotometry, and electrochemistry. The sensor demonstrated good sensitivity with detection limits of 10 pM (visual), 10 pM (spectrophotometry) and 1 fM (electrochemical). This sensor also exhibited high specificity for real target amplicons and could discriminate between perfect and mismatched sequences. Lyophilized biosensor reagents stored at 4 °C, 25 °C, and outdoor ambient temperature, were stable for up to 90, 50, and 40 days, respectively.

In this paper, the effects of the overburden stress factors on the undrained capacity of laterally loaded piles under combined horizontal load and moment are comprehensively investigated by employing the three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis. In the present study, soil–pile interfaces are modelled as the no-tension condition while the influences of the pile length ratios are also examined in the numerical analyses. The failure envelopes of laterally loaded piles under combined horizontal load and moment incorporating overburden stress factors, pile length ratios are presented. Employing the normality rule to the derived failure envelopes, the failure mechanisms corresponding to the ratio between applied moment and horizontal load are postulated in this paper. An approximate solution of the failure envelope of laterally loaded piles is also proposed by using a nonlinear regression analysis, and provides a convenient tool for predicting the undrained lateral capacity of piles considering overburden stress factors in practice.","fluidex; related topics, foundations and piles, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

Two source waters of different nature — a surface water and a secondary treated wastewater effluent — were studied. The samples were analyzed for formation potentials of trihalomethanes (THM4), haloacetonitriles (HAN4), haloketones (HK2), and chloropicrin (CPN). A 4-component PARAFAC model was developed from 150 EEM samples generated from the raw source waters and their treatment with MIEX® resins. Components C1, C2, and C3 corresponded to humic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM) while C4 corresponded to protein-like DOM. Both MIEX® resins preferentially removed components C1, C2, and C3 over C4, indicating affinity with humic materials. MIEX® resins were shown to be more effective to treat surface water than secondary effluent, including effective removal of DBP precursors with extended bed volume treatment. Among all parameters investigated, THM4-FP strongly correlated with humic-like component C3, while HAN4-FP strongly correlated with protein-like component C4 (ρ > 0.89 and p < 0.01); CPN-FP and HK2-FP both correlated with anthropogenic DOM C2 (ρ > 0.89 and p < 0.01). Our results indicate that EEM–PARAFAC was valuable for assessing DBP formation potentials and removal of their precursors by MIEX® resins in different water sources.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The dipole moment depends on cell geometries as well as electrical parameters of media involved. Unfortunately, the analytical expression of equivalent dipole is available only for simple geometries. This work numerically studies the variation of the dipole moment of a red blood cell with cell geometries and electrical parameters. The cell is modelled as a sphere, an oblate spheroid or a biconcave disc. The authors apply the boundary element method to electric field calculation and use re-expansion formulae to compute the equivalent dipole moment of the cell. The numerical results agree well with the analytical one for the spherical model. The effects of cell geometries are clarified for two directions of the electric field, which are parallel or normal to the axis of symmetry of the cell. Using the biconcave disc model, we perform iterative calculation to estimate the intracellular conductivity and specific membrane capacitance of red blood cells from experimental results.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, engineering","Analysis, Engineering (all), Computational Mathematics, Applied Mathematics"

However, there remains difficulties in the implementation of mulberry leaves in evidence-based practice. The aims of this study were to examine the optimal dose of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) in mulberry leaves and to determine the efficacy and safety of mulberry leaves in glycemic control in obese persons with borderline diabetes. Design: First, healthy adults were recruited into the dose-finding study and randomly allocated to ingest sucrose solution concurrently with mulberry leaf powder at weights equivalent to 0 (control), 6, 12, and 18 mg of DNJ. Postprandial glucose and undesirable effects were evaluated. Second, obese persons with borderline diabetes were randomly assigned into the mulberry-leaves treatment group (12 mg of mulberry DNJ three times daily) and the control group in the 12-week prospective study. Blood glucose and insulin as well as adverse effects were determined. Results: Twelve mg of mulberry DNJ was the minimum effective dose attenuating postprandial hyperglycemia. Mulberry leaves decreased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 3.86 ± 5.99 mg/dL (p = 0.002) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.11 ± 0.22 % (p = 0.011) when compared with the baseline levels. Improvement in glucose tolerance was not observed. Furthermore, mulberry leaves tended to ameliorate insulin resistance (p = 0.057). Adverse events of mulberry leaves commonly found in this study were gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating, flatulence, and loose stools. Conclusion: Mulberry leaves possessed favorable effects on glycemic profiles without serious side effects.","Health Professions, medical, Nursing","Complementary and Manual Therapy, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Advanced and Specialized Nursing"

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates among Thai patients with S. aureus infection and to identify risk factors and appropriate antibiotics for these resistant strains. Methods: Data of culture-proven S. aureus isolates from clinical specimens during 2017 in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, were retrospectively collected and classified as methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or MRSA by cefoxitin screening and oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration by the Vitek 2 system. Each isolate was also tested for susceptibility to teicoplanin, erythromycin, clindamycin, linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and vancomycin by Vitek 2. Demographic information and comorbidities from medical records were reviewed to identify risk factors for S. aureus infection. Results: MRSA isolates were identified in 147 (17%) of 890 patients with no different ratio in adults or children. A higher proportion of MRSA in hospital-acquired settings was observed (27% vs. 12%; p < 0.001). Comorbidities significantly associated with MRSA were chronic lung, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. Atrial fibrillation, dementia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia were independently associated with MRSA isolation. Vancomycin was still susceptible to all kinds of infection. One VRSA isolate was from colonization. Conclusion: The prevalence of MRSA in our facility seemed to be comparatively low. Vancomycin is still an appropriate option for MRSA coverage since all S. aureus isolates in our center were sensitive to vancomycin. However, careful attention is warranted since one colonization isolate was VRSA.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Significant impact of casein hydrolysate to overcome the low consumption of glycerol by Klebsiella aerogenes ATCC 29007 and its application to bioethanol production,"Lee J.H., Yoo H.Y., Lee S.K., Chun Y., Kim H.R., Bankeeree W., Lotrakul P., Punnapayak H., Prasongsuk S., Kim S.W.",2020-10-01,"Bio-ethanol production, Biodiesel-derived glycerols, Casein hydrolysate, Essential amino acids, Ethanol concentrations, Industrial fermentation, ITS applications, Substrate consumption rate, Bioethanol, Biorefinery, Casein hydrolysate, Glycerol, Klebsiella aerogenes","As the demand for biodiesel increases, the by-product glycerol is increasing. Biodiesel-derived glycerol is expected to be applied in bioindustries. However, major limitation of industrial fermentation is that the rate of substrate consumption is significantly slower than conventional process. In this study, in order to improve the consumption of refined crude glycerol in Klebsiella aerogenes, casein hydrolysate was supplemented in main medium. As a result, the substrate consumption rate, cell and ethanol concentration were improved about 2.6-fold, 2.5-fold and 3.0-fold, respectively, compared with the control group. In addition, four components of the main medium (peptone, ammonium sulfate, casein hydrolysate, refined crude glycerol) were statistically optimized. The consumption of glycerol was achieved about 89%, and the productivity of bioethanol was found to be 0.83 g/(L h) under the optimized medium. Also, the bioethanol concentration and yield were 15.89 g/L and 0.487 (g/g), respectively. The supplementation of casein hydrolysate had a significant effect on fermentation. It was proved by analyzing the concentration of free amino acids contained in casein hydrolysate. As a result, it was found that glycerol consumption and bioethanol production were promoted by the abundant supply of essential amino acids contained in casein hydrolysate for cell growth. Therefore, these results will be the basis for sustainable development by providing the opportunity to reuse crude glycerol for industrial applications.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Studies have shown that for several vaccines, such as live attenuated, toxoid and conjugated vaccines, high maternal antibody titers inhibit the infant's humoral immune response after infant vaccination. However, it is not clear whether this decreased antibody titer has any clinical impact on the infant's protection, as the cellular immune responses are often equally important in providing disease protection and may therefore compensate for diminished antibody levels. Reports describing the effect of maternal antibodies on the cellular immune response after infant vaccination are scarce, probably because such studies are expensive, labor intensive and utilize poorly standardized laboratory techniques. Therefore, this review aims to shed light on what is currently known about the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination in the presence of high (maternal) antibody titers both in animal and human studies. Overall, the findings suggest that maternally derived antibodies do not interfere with the cellular immune responses after infant vaccination. However, more research in humans is clearly needed, as most data originate from animal studies.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The present work proposes a chemical structure that consists of in situ anchoring highly dispersed NiMn-LDH nanosheets on Ti3C2 MXene sheets via chemical bonds. Negatively charged MXene sheets will provide abundant heterogeneous nucleation sites for NiMn-LDH during the in situ crystallization process, and the surface functional groups can strengthen the chemical connection between the two materials, achieving higher charge transfer and ion diffusion rates between MXene and NiMn-LDH compared with mechanical mixtures of MXene and NiMn-LDH (MM NiMn-LDH/MXene). The size of the NiMn-LDH in the NiMn-LDH/MXene hybrid composite can be ∼10 nm smaller than that of pure NiMn-LDH nanosheets (∼50 nm), which is beneficial for active site exposure and ion conduction. The optimized hybrid nanocomposite NiMn-LDH/MXene 2:1 delivers a high specific capacitance of 1575 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 (689 F g-1 for pristine NiMn LDH, 192 F g-1 for pristine MXene, and 731 F g-1 for MM NiMn-LDH/MXene), a superior cycling stability of 90.3% after 10000 cycles at 5.0 A g-1, and good rate capability of 80% capacitance retention at 20 A g-1. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with activated carbon (AC) and NiMn-LDH/MXene 2:1 exhibits excellent specific capacitance (169.8 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and outstanding cycling stability (91.8% after 10000 cycles at 2 A g-1). A higher energy density of 126Wh kg-1 at 0.74kWkg-1 and higher power density of 3.3 kWkg-1 at 97Wh kg-1 can be achieved with NiMn-LDH/MXene 2:1, which provides an effective approach to design next-generation SC electrode materials exhibiting excellent rate performance and cycling stability.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The catalytic pyrolysis was carried out inside a custom-built one-shot two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst structure was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Remarkably, the Ni-Cu/mCM catalysts increased the produced alkyl-phenols by up to fourfold, and these products are an excellent gasoline blend stock due to their high blending octane number. At the same time, the mass of undesired compounds in the bio-oil including alcohols, ketones, and furan were markedly decreased compared to the case without a catalyst. The oxygen content of the bio-oil was reduced by up to 24 % compared to the non-catalytic case. The hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon molar ratios were also improved after all catalytic treatments. Finally, a reaction mechanism was proposed, including the pathways of oxygen removal through dehydration, decarbonylation, and dealkoxylation. The presence of NiO in the Ni-Cu/mCM catalyst promoted the alkylation reaction to yield more alkyl-phenols.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

However, aromatic hydrocarbons have mostly been obtained by catalytic pyrolysis under high-pressure conditions. In this study, a composite catalyst comprising Ca and Ni, supported on boronic-acid-functionalized KIT-6 mesoporous silica (Ca/Ni/BOH-NH-KIT-6), was developed. This catalyst exhibited high selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons (up to 50%) during integrated catalytic upgrading and pyrolysis of Napier grass under atmospheric pressure. The aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity depended on the dispersion of Ni on the KIT-6 support. The stability of Ni on the catalyst was improved by adding Ca, and the good dispersion of Ni promoted the deoxygenation of phenolic compounds to aromatic hydrocarbons. Further, the addition of Ca increased the selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Thus, the high selectivity of the Ca/Ni/BOH-KIT-6 catalyst for aromatic hydrocarbons can be attributed to the enhanced production of aromatics during catalytic pyrolysis of the biomass.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

This study evaluated the roles of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (C-met) towards clinical outcome and native liver survival. Methods: Hepatic HGF and C-met expression were determined using immunohistochemistry from liver biopsies of 41 BA patients during Kasai operation, and 17 non-cholestatic patients. The HGF and C-met expression was visually scored as per its intensity and percentage of stained area. BA patients were classified as high- and low-HGF and C-met receptor status. Native liver survival was compared between the two groups at 3-year follow-up. Data are shown as median and range. Main results: Median age of BA patients was 2 (1–6) months. Hepatic HGF and C-met staining scores of BA patients were higher than those of non-cholestatic patients (P < 0.0001). There was a correlation between HGF and C-met staining scores (spearman r = 0.77, P < 0.0001). However, there was no association between their expression and early outcome at 6 months post-op. Mean follow-up time was 68.6 months. Survival analysis revealed that native liver survival at 1 year and 3 years were 88% and 77%, respectively. Additionally, 82.6% (19/23) of patients in the low-HGF group survived with native liver, compared with 66.7% (10/15) of those in high-HGF group (P = 0.436). For C-met expression, 78.6% (22/28) of low-score and 70% (7/10) of high score groups survived with native liver (P = 0.673). Conclusions: Strong expression of hepatic HGF and its receptor in BA patients was demonstrated. However, the expression was not associated with the early outcome and native liver survival. These results suggest that HGF involved in the liver pathology of BA but its expression cannot be used as a prognostic indicator. Small sample size of patients was a main limitation.

The PBZ microspheres were successfully obtained at the F/DMF weight ratios of 0.4 and 0.6. These microspheres exhibited high nitrogen contents after carbonization. The microstructures of all the samples showed an amorphous phase and a partial graphitic phase. The porous carbon with the F/DMF ratio of 0.4 showed significantly higher specific capacitance (275.1 F·g−1) than the reference carbon (198.9 F·g−1) at 0.05 A·g−1. This can be attributed to the synergistic electrical double-layer capacitor and pseudo-capacitor behaviors of the porous carbon with the F/DMF ratio of 0.4. The presence of nitrogen/oxygen functionalities induced pseudo-capacitance in the microspheres, and hence increased their total specific capacitance. After activation with CO2, the specific surface area of the carbon microspheres with the F/DMF ratio of 0.4 increased from 349 to 859 m2·g−1 and the specific capacitance increased to 424.7 F·g−1. This value is approximately two times higher than that of the reference carbon. The results indicated that the F/DMF ratio of 0.4 was suitable for preparing carbon microspheres with good supercapacitive performance. The nitrogen/oxygen functionalities and high specific surface area of the microspheres were responsible for their high capacitance.

It is the only bridge of its kind in the world whose pylon is not back-Anchored, and its deck and pylon balance at a single massive footing below the pylon. This design made construction of the bridge very risky because the unfinished bridge had to be kept in balance like a giant teeter-Totter until it could rest at the secondary support away from the pylon. A total of three construction plans were investigated by the contractor with the first two rejected and the third used for construction. Previous research presented simulation models for these three plans in CYCLONE along with construction time estimates for the bridge deck and pylon. Unfortunately, the published simulation models had mistakes that led to incorrect statistical results and conclusions. This paper describes these mistakes and presents three simulation models in EZStrobe that produce appropriate statistics and conclusions. These models can be used as practical examples for the application of discrete-event simulation to construction.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Building and Construction, Civil and Structural Engineering"

This paper presents a new version of the improved fluid search optimization algorithm for optimal parameter identification of the undetermined parameters of the PEMFCs. The total of square deviations between the experimentally measured values and the optimal achieved values from the algorithm is considered the cost function. Two empirical PEMFC models including BCS 500-W and NedStack PS6 are employed and analyzed to present the capability of the proposed procedure under different conditions. Simulation results are compared with different optimizers under the same conditions to demonstrate the system efficiency. The final results showed that the proposed chaos-based fluid search optimization algorithm is successfully used to extract the parameters of a PEMFC model precisely.,"fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

STING plays a significant role in autoimmune lupus mice. However, the function of STING in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model has never been described. This study aimed to test the function of STING in CIA. The Sting-deficient mice developed arthritis comparable to WT mice. The levels of anti-collagen antibody from Sting-deficient mice were significantly higher than the WT mice. The B cells derived from Sting-deficient mice showed better survival than WT mice in response to the B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. Activation of STING also induced B cell death, especially in activated B cells. This study demonstrated that the inhibition of STING promotes anti-collagen antibodies and B cell survival, which suggested that STING acts as a negative regulator of B cell function in the CIA model.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Many surgical procedures have been proposed and claim to have good post-operative clinical outcomes. These techniques include direct repair, V–Y flap, turndown flap, peroneus brevis tendon graft, flexor digitorum longus graft, FHL graft, semitendinosus graft, gracilis tendon graft or synthetic material. The two surgical techniques that are widely used include FHL grafting and the combination of FHL grafting plus additional augmentation. This meta-analysis was conducted with the purpose of comparing clinical outcomes of flexor hallucis longus (FHL) grafting and the combination of FHL grafting with additional augmentation techniques in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendon rupture. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline, Embase and Scopus from their inception to April 4, 2019, and proceedings of reference list and scientific meetings were also searched. Relevant clinical studies (e.g., observational, cross-sectional, cohort or randomized controlled trial (RCT)) that reported AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score) and postoperative complications of either technique were identified. Results: Six studies (N = 68) were included for the analysis of FHL, and six studies (N = 124) were included for analysis of FHL with augmentation. A pooling of mean and standard deviation of preoperative and postoperative AOFAS were 57.09 (3.63), 92.97 (22.67) in FHL group and 66.92 (3.16), 95.25 (4.71) in FHL with additional augmentation group respectively. The pooled UMD of AOFAS in FHL with additional augmentation were 2.28 (−1.86, 6.42) scores higher when compared to the FHL group. The prevalence of complications in FHL and FHL with additional augmentation were 14 (N = 120) and 10 (N = 63) patients. The chance of having complications of FHL with additional augmentation group was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.56) lower than FHL group. However, there is no statistically significant difference. Conclusions: FHL with additional augmentation group has higher foot function scores (AOFAS) and lower complications when compared to the FHL group. However this did not reach to statistically significant. Further research that assesses a larger sample size of RCTs is necessary to further evaluate FHL with additional augmentation and FHL in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendon rupture.","orthopedic surgery, medical",Orthopedics and Sports Medicine
Differential quantitative proteomics reveals key proteins related to phenotypic changes of breast cancer cells expressing progesterone receptor A,"Pateetin P., Pisitkun T., McGowan E., Boonyaratanakornkit V.",2020-04-01,"Breast Neoplasms, Cathepsin D, Cell Cycle, Cell Line, Tumor, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Female, HEK293 Cells, Histones, Humans, Ligands, Phenotype, Prognosis, Protein Isoforms, Proteomics, Receptors, Progesterone, Signal Transduction, Cell cycle, Histone linker protein, Progesterone receptor isoforms A and B, Proteomics, Stable isotope dimethyl labeling","Progesterone receptor isoforms A and B exert different biological effects in breast cancer cells. Alteration of PRA/PRB ratio is often observed during breast cancer progression. High PRA/PRB ratios in breast cancer patients are associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. While it is well accepted that PRA and PRB regulate different sets of genes, how the expression of PRA and PRB alters breast cancer proteomes has not been fully investigated. To directly investigate the effects of PR isoform expression on the breast cancer proteome, both in the presence and absence of progestin, PRA and PRB were independently stably expressed in T47DC42 PR-null breast cancer cells using a doxycycline (Dox)-regulated promoter. Dox induction dose-dependently increased PRA and PRB expression. Dox-induced PRA and PRB showed normal receptor localization and were transcriptionally active. Differential quantitative proteomic analysis by stable isotope dimethyl labeling was performed to quantitatively examine how PR isoforms altered global breast cancer proteomes. Cells expressing PRA in the absence of progestin were enriched in proteins involved in the TCA cycle and enriched in proteins involved in glycolysis in the presence of progestin, whilst cells expressing PRB in the absence and presence progestin were significantly enriched in proteins involved in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis pathways. This proteomic data revealed a link between PR isoform expression and alteration in cell metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The enrichment of proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway in breast cancer cells expressing PRA is consistent with stem cell-like properties, previously reported in PRA-rich breast cancer cells. Moreover, compared to liganded PRB, liganded PRA differentially upregulated proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as linker histone H1.2. Silencing H1.2 gene expression suppressed PRA-mediated cell proliferation and promoted G2/M and S phase entry of the cell cycle. Additionally, liganded PRA upregulated the expression of cathepsin D (CTSD) protease, whose expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Together, our data demonstrated that the expression of PRA or PRB dramatically and differentially altered breast cancer cell proteomes. These isoform-specific changes in the breast cancer proteome will help to explain the distinct phenotypic properties of breast cancer cells expressing different levels of PRA and PRB.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"

Whether this loss continues with longer therapy is unclear. We determined changes in bone and spine BMD over 5 years in adults receiving immediate or deferred initial ART. Methods: In the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) BMD substudy, ART-naïve adults with CD4 counts > 500 cells/μL were randomized to immediate or deferred ART. Deferred group participants not yet on ART were offered ART after May 2015. Mean per cent changes in total hip and lumbar spine BMD (measured annually by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were compared between groups using longitudinal mixed models. Fracture rates were also compared between groups for all START participants. Results: Substudy participants (immediate group, n = 201; deferred group, n = 210; median age 32 years; 80% non-white; 24% female) were followed for a mean 4.5 years until December 2016.

Global warming potential (GWP) of four scenarios for handling solid waste generated in Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park, 2018 was assessed concerning the different ratios of waste recycling, composting, incineration, and landfilling. The results show that alternative systems proposed will result in lower GWP than the existing waste management strategy. The MFA results reveal that the final weights of solid waste ending up in a landfill are 98.8, 101.9, 68.2, and 44.8 t yr- 1 for scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Increased rates of landfill diversion by increased recycling, composting, and incineration decreased the quantity of solid waste disposed to the landfill and improved the environmental profile of the park waste management system. The LCA results found landfilling to be the dominant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) burdens, while waste recycling was found to result in the reduction of GHG. The results highlight that the use of MFA and LCA as a combined tool to evaluate the environmental performance of solid waste management systems provides valuable information for policy and decision-makers.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Altered claudin expression has been shown to affect disease behavior and patient prognosis in various neoplasms. The objectives of this study were to analyze the claudin-1, -4 and -7 expression in odontogenic tumors and characterize their expression pattern in distinct tumor cell types in relation to the recurrence potential. Sixty-nine cases of odontogenic tumors, including 43 ameloblastomas (AM), 17 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 6 ameloblastic fibromas (AF) and 3 ameloblastic carcinomas (AC) were investigated for claudin-1, -4 and -7 expression immunohistochemically. The staining was analyzed semi-quantitatively and categorized into 4 levels, based on the percentage of positively stained neoplastic epithelial cells. Claudin-1 was expressed in all AOT and AF cases, whereas most AC (66.7%) showed no expression. The claudin-1 staining was moderate-to-intense in the odontogenic epithelium of AF. In contrast, its staining of ameloblast-like cells and stellate reticulum-like cells in AM was weak. Claudin-7 expression was noted in all tumor types studied, while the expression of claudin-4 was limited and mainly localized in the squamous differentiated cells of AM and AC. AM showed significantly higher claudin-4, but lower claudin-7 expression than AOT. In addition, AC showed diminished claudin-1 immunoreactivity, compared to AOT. Low claudin-1 expression in AM was significantly associated with the increased clinical recurrence. The loss of claudin-1 may underlie the locally invasive nature of AM.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Otorhinolaryngology, Oncology"

The TBP derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups, including cyano, and nitro moieties, exhibited solvatochromic properties due to the internal charge transfer (ICT) effect. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the nitro-substituted TBP derivative (8) possessed the highest change in dipole moment upon excitation (Δμ) yielding the most distinctly large stokes shift and low fluorescence quantum yields as the solvent polarity increased. In addition, compound 8 displayed an apparent fluorescence quenching in the presence of hydrogen bond-donating molecules (e.g. methanol, ethanol, water); therefore, it was chosen to be utilized as a trace water detector in four common solvents, including, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile (MeCN), acetone, and dimethylformamide (DMF). The satisfying linear relationship between the ratios of the blank fluorescence intensity to the decreased fluorescence intensity (I0/I) and the trace water content was used to determine the limits of detection (LOD) of water. The low LODs (0.028% for THF, 0.013% for MeCN, 0.021% for acetone, and 0.045% for DMF) confirmed the capability of compound 8 as a super-sensitive water sensor in organic solvents.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

UV radiation tends to damage the key cellular machinery, cells may adapt by developing several defense mechanisms as a response to such damage; otherwise, the cellular destiny is cell-death. Since microalgae are one of the primary biotic components, any drastic effects caused by UV radiation may imbalance the entire ecosystems. However, survival of microalgae under billions of years of fluctuating environmental changes has pressurized them to develop a number of tolerance mechanisms against environmental UV stress. The high resilience of the microalgal community in the face of UV stress is attributed to the activation of several photo/dark repair mechanisms, antioxidant systems, and biosynthesis of UV-photoprotectants such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), scytonemin (Scy), carotenoids and polyamines. The focus of this review underlies an overview of various resilience mechanisms adopted by microalgae, by which cells are able to survive under UV stressed environment. Moreover, the current progress on genetic engineering to enhance the survival of microalgae in response to intense solar UV radiation has also been conferred.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; plant biotechnology; energygy, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The radius of gyration of AQP1 increases on increasing the temperature before saturating to a random-coil morphology in denatured phase at high temperatures. Three regions of persistent globularization are identified, toward the end segments 1M-25V and 250V-269K and a narrow region in the middle 155A-163D along the backbone. Varying the temperature leads to a systematic redistribution of self-organizing residues with globular and fibrous morphologies with an effective dimension D ~ 2 (random coil) at high temperature and D ~ 3 (globular conformation) in native phase. A preliminary analysis is also presented on the effect of a crowded membrane environment on the protein structure by incorporating effective solute constituents. Conformation of the protein is found to be pinned by selective binding of solute to specific targets; the matrix directed structure differs considerably from that of a protein in a generic solvent. The structure of AQP1 can be controlled by temperature and constitutive elements of the underlying matrix.",biochemistryistry,"Physiology, Endocrinology"
Late Holocene hydroclimatic variation in central Asia and its response to mid-latitude Westerlies and solar irradiance,"Lan J., Zhang J., Cheng P., Ma X., Ai L., Chawchai S., Zhou K., Wang T., Yu K., Sheng E., Kang S., Zang J., Yan D., Wang Y., Tan L., Xu H.",2020-06-15,"Anthropogenic forcing, Bulk carbonates, Carbon isotopes, Enhanced effects, High resolution, North Atlantic oscillations, Northwestern China, Solar irradiances, Central Asia, Hydroclimatic variation, Late holocene, Mid-latitude Westerlies, North Atlantic oscillation, Solar irradiance","Hydroclimatic variations in central Asia are widely recognized to be tele-connected with the North Atlantic climate via the mid-latitude Westerlies. However, the long-term hydroclimatic variation and its response to North Atlantic climate changes are not fully understood. Here we report multi-decadal and centennial hydroclimatic variations in central Asia during the late Holocene using high-resolution oxygen and carbon isotopes of bulk carbonate from a remote hydrologically closed alpine lake in Tianshan Mountains, northwestern China. The hydroclimatic variations inferred from the covariance between δ18Ocarb and δ13Ccarb and published multi-proxy in the Lake Sayram together agree well with the records from the central Asia, showing enhanced effective moisture at the intervals of 4000-3780, 3590-3210, 2800-2160, 1700-1370 and 890-280 cal yr BP during the negative phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Comparison with European hydroclimatic changes on centennial scale, our records not only provide valuable insight into the hydroclimatic variations in central Asia, but also indicate all broadly contemporaneous changes with that of southern Europe whereas antiphase with that of northern Europe. We then conclude that the observed antiphase hydroclimatic pattern between northern Europe and southern Europe-central Asia on centennial time scale during the late Holocene were persistently controlled by the north-south migration of mid-latitude Westerlies and changes of NAO phase in response to solar irradiance forcing. However, further research is necessary to fully disentangle the natural and anthropogenic forcing mechanisms for enhanced effect moisture and/or precipitation in central Asia.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; environmentalronments, water engineeringneering, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

Statistical distributions can be used to characterize wind speeds through considering uncertainty in wind resources. However, the selection of the most suitable probability density function (PDF) is still a challenging task. Therefore, this study aims at developing a framework to accurately evaluate the performance of different PDFs to fit wind speeds, as well as presenting a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm method, called Social Spider Optimization (SSO), for wind characterization purposes. Seven sites in Saudi Arabia are used as case studies. Results indicate that combined PDFs outperform single PDFs in representing the observed wind speeds frequencies at all considered sites. Weibull distribution appears to be the most prevalent single distribution while no combined PDF dominates the others. In addition, the proposed SSO method is found to be the most efficient method for estimating PDFs parameters in Saudi Arabia. Overall, this proposed framework can be used to evaluate different wind PDFs in other countries.","petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; unconventional, the atmosphere, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Previous surgical approaches have often been too invasive and necessitated sacrifice of normal function and anatomical structures, particularly in the retromandibular nerve region. Therefore, we sought to identify an approach corridor to this area that requires less sacrifice and report an innovative approach through a retromandibular fossa route to the IPL. Methods: Five cadaveric specimens were dissected bilaterally with a trans-tympanic plate and styloid process approach. These specimens were investigated microanatomically and morphometrically to examine the extent of the approach in the parapharyngeal space. The clinical application of this approach was compared to previous approaches to the IPL used in our clinical series of 20 cases. Results: Using this novel approach, the inferior alveolar nerve was identified in all specimens, while the chorda tympani and lingual nerve were identified in 6 (60%) and 4 (40%) dissections, respectively. In all specimens, the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery and the exit of the lower cranial nerve were identified. The average length of the exposed lower cranial nerves was 16.6 ± 3.8 mm (range: 11–25 mm). Conclusions: The described approach is feasible for accessing the IPL at the retromandibular nerve and is less invasive than conventionally used approaches.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

To achieve high performance LIB, the surface-confined strategy has been applied to design and fabricate a new anode material of NiCo-LDH nanosheet anchored on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene (NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2). The ultra-thin, bended and wrinkled α-phase crystal with an interlayer spacing of 8.1 Å can arrange on the conductive substrates Ti3C2 MXene directly, resulting in high electrolyte diffusion ability and low internal resistance. Furthermore, chemical bond interactions between the highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene and NiCo-LDH nanosheets can greatly increase the ion and electron transport and reduce the volume expansion of NiCo-LDH during Li ion intercalation. As expected, the discharge capacity of 562 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 for 800 cycles without degradation can be achieved, rate capability and cycle performance are better than that of NiCo-LDH (~100 mAh g−1). Furthermore, the density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed to demonstrate that NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 system can be used as a highly desirable and promising anode material for lithium ion battery.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

Methods: In total, 15 healthy volunteers (HV) and 15 pH-positive non-erosive GERD (NERD) patients underwent single-photon emission computed tomography after ingesting 2 g of chili or placebo in capsules in a randomized double-blind crossover fashion with a one-week washout period. GA was the maximal postprandial gastric volume (GV) after 250 mL of Ensure® minus the fasting GV. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated by using a visual analog scale. Results: NERD patients but not HV had significantly greater GA after chili compared to a placebo (451 ± 89 vs. 375 ± 81 mL, p < 0.05). After chili, the postprandial GVs at 10, 20, and 30 min in NERD patients were significantly greater than HV (10 min, 600 ± 73 vs. 526 ± 70 mL; 20 min, 576 ± 81 vs. 492 ± 78 mL; 30 min, 532 ± 81 vs. 466 ± 86 mL, all p < 0.05). In NERD, chili was associated with significantly less satiety, more severe abdominal burning (p < 0.05), and a trend of more severe heartburn (p = 0.06) compared to the placebo. In HV, postprandial symptoms after chili and placebo ingestion were similar (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Chili enhanced GA in NERD patients but not in HV.

However, it can also be caused by more serious conditions, especially posterior circulation stroke. Differentiating between these two conditions by clinical presentations and imaging studies during the acute phase can be challenging. This study aimed to identify serum microRNA (miRNA) candidates that could differentiate between posterior circulation stroke and peripheral vertigo, among patients presenting with acute vertigo. Methods: Serum levels of six miRNAs including miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-376a-3p, and miR-433-5p were evaluated. Using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the serum miRNAs were assessed in the acute phase and at a 90 day follow-up visit. Results: A total of 58 patients with posterior circulation stroke (n = 23) and peripheral vertigo (n = 35) were included in the study. Serum miR-125a-5p (P = 0.001), miR-125b-5p (P < 0.001), miR-143-3p (P = 0.014) and miR-433-5p (P = 0.0056) were present at significantly higher levels in the acute phase, in the patients with posterior circulation infarction.

"Amino-functionalized mesoporous silica-magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposites as water-dispersible adsorbents for the removal of the oxytetracycline antibiotic from aqueous solutions: adsorption performance, effects of coexisting ions, and natural organic matter","Prarat P., Hongsawat P., Punyapalakul P.",2020-02-01,"Adsorption, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Graphite, Ions, Magnetic Phenomena, Nanocomposites, Oxytetracycline, Silicon Dioxide, Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Adsorption, Competitive adsorption, Mesoporous silica-magnetic graphene oxide, Ocytetracycline, Surface complexation","The amino-functionalized mesoporous silica-magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite (A-mGO-Si) was synthesized and used for oxytetracycline (OTC) removal from water. Various factors like the effects of initial concentration, contact time, and influence of pH were investigated. Selective adsorption experiments in connection with coexisting ions and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were also investigated. In this study, humic acid (HA) and tannic acid (TA) were representative of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOM, respectively. Results indicated that A-mGO-Si had an adsorption ability for OTC that was relatively greater than that of virgin magnetic graphene oxide (mGO), graphene oxide (GO), Fe3O4 particles, and SBA-15 mesoporous silica and also showed a better uptake removal capacity for OTC at low initial concentration in comparison with the other adsorbents. The adsorption behavior of OTC onto A-mGO-Si could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. The electrostatic interaction has no influence on the OTC absorbed when the OTC is in an aqueous medium in its zwitterion form (3.22 < pH < 7.46). At high pH, the weak π–π EDA interactions and hydrogen bonding may manifest themselves, hence causing a lower adsorption capacity. The main adsorption mechanisms were plausibly activated by H-bonding, and π–π EDA interactions, while the electrostatic interaction (cation–π interaction) might be the minor adsorption mechanism. Addition of individually exogenous ions (Na+, Mg2+, NO−, and CO3 2−) resulted in a decrease of OTC adsorption due to the emergence of a competitive effect. Considering the presence of HA and TA in mixed solute systems, the DOM was likely to form a stronger interaction system with mGO-Si, thereby resulting in an adsorption level which was more competitive in the process at low aqueous phase concentration of OTC. In contrast to the high aqueous phase, the coexistence of DOM could promote OTC adsorption. The phenomenon may reflect the result that a surface complexation mechanism could achieve in adsorptions.","genergyal, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The main cause is the releasing of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The reduction of CO2 is thus a tremendous challenge. The CO2 capture processes then are invented to account this problem. One of the essential basic information for designing and operating of these separation processes is the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. In this study, the equilibrium isotherms on potassium carbonate on gamma-alumina (K2CO3∕γ-Al2O3) solid sorbent were correlated with Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Toth models. The CO2 sorption capacities were measured with pressures at different system temperatures (45–90 °C). From the result, it was found that Sips isotherm was the suitable model (R2 ranged between 0.91–0.99 with an error of less than 2.09%). When comparing the CO2 capture capacity with pure K2CO3, the obtained CO2 capture capacities were improved by impregnating K2CO3on the γ-Al2O3 support.","mixing and separation, energy",Energy (all)

C. albicans administration in dextran-sulfate solution (DSS) induced-colitis mouse model (DSS+Candida) might resemble more to human condition, therefore, a DSS colitis model with Candida administration was studied; first, to test the influence of fungi in DSS model and second, to test the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34. We demonstrated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) elevation in patients with IBD and endoscopic moderate colitis in clinical remission, supporting the possible influence of gut fungi toward IBD in human. Then, in mouse model, Candida gavage was found to worsen the DSS model indicated by higher mortality rate, more severe colon histology and enhanced gut-leakage (FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, serum BG and blood bacterial burdens) but did not affect weight loss and diarrhea. DSS+Candida induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines both in blood and in intestinal tissue. Worsened systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in DSS+Candida compared with DSS alone was possibly due to the more severe translocation of LPS, BG and bacteria (not fungemia) from gut into systemic circulation. Interestingly, bacteremia from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated from DSS+Candida than DSS alone. In parallel, P. aeruginosa was also isolated from fecal culture in most of the mice in DSS+Candida group supported by prominent Gammaproteobacteria in fecal microbioata analysis. However, L. rhamnosus L34 attenuated both DSS+Candida and DSS model through the attenuation of gut local inflammation (cytokines and histology), gut-leakage severity, fecal dysbiosis (culture method and microbiome analysis) and systemic inflammation (serum cytokines). In conclusion, gut Candida in DSS model induced fecal bacterial dysbiosis and enhanced leaky-gut induced bacteremia. Probiotic treatment strategy aiming to reduce gut-fungi and fecal dysbiosis could attenuate disease severity. Investigation on gut fungi in patients with IBD is highly interesting.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Gastroenterology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

In this study, the performance of several satellite selection methods in multipath mitigation was evaluated, based on the concept that better quality signals and more accurate solutions will be obtained, the more multipath signals can be excluded. Three methods were performed and compared: 1) azimuth-dependent elevation mask based on fisheye image technique, 2) receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), and 3) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mask in the SPP method. To examine the effect of the satellite selection methods on multipath error, the static test (single-point positioning (SPP) in real-time 1 Hz test) was performed in a multipath environment. The preliminary results showed a possible impact on improving the horizontal positioning accuracy of SPP. Among the three techniques assessed in this study, the results indicated that the SNR mask set at 36 dB-Hz in every elevation showed the most promising result. The SNR mask method could improve positioning accuracy by up to 46.80% compared to the SPP method.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Space and Planetary Science

The key to differentiation is the use of a conformationally constrained peptide nucleic acid (PNA) that was immobilized on carboxymethylcellulose-modified paper. This was then used for target DNA binding and visualization by an enzyme-catalyzed pigmentation. The biotinylated target DNA bound to the immobilized probe was visually detected via alkaline phosphatase-linked streptavidin. This enzyme conjugate catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, leading to a series of reactions that generate an intense, dark blue pigment. The test was validated with 100 DNA samples, which shows good discrimination among different genotypes (normal, HbE, and heterozygous) with 100% accuracy when optimal conditions of analysis were applied. The method does not require temperature control and can be performed at ambient temperature.

To address the knowledge gap, we analyzed factors associated with the risk of SPT and OS by treatment modality for medulloblastoma. Methods: We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 database for patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma in 1973-2014. Patients were then grouped by age, gender, race, geographic region, histology, adjuvant treatment (no radiation [RT] and no chemotherapy [CT], RT and CT, RT alone, or CT alone), era of diagnosis (1973-1994 or 1995-2014), and survival time. Cumulative incidence, factors associated with SPT and OS were analyzed. Results: Of 2271 patients, 146 developed SPT, of which 42 were benign. The incidence of SPT was 3.1% and 4.9% at 10 and 15 years, respectively. The incidence of SPT was 3.1% with RT + CT versus 3.7% with RT alone at 10 years. The most common site for an SPT was the central nervous system. Female gender (P = 0.01) and longer OS of ≥21 years (P < 0.01) were associated with higher risk of SPT. RT + CT led to better OS than RT only (66.1% and 61.4% vs 55.6% and 49.7% at 10 and 15 years) (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Medulloblastoma patients have a relatively low risk of SPT at 10 years with treatment. Use of RT + CT led to better OS with no statistical difference in SPT compared with the RT alone.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Hematology, Oncology"

In this study, we explore the phenotype of TS in diverse populations using clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data from 78 individuals and images from 108 individuals with TS from 19 different countries were analyzed. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p <.001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p <.001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.","human genetics, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

Mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-41 zeolite) was synthesized from illite waste as a silica source. The MCM-41 synthesis was carried out by hydrothermal and post-synthesis for Ni loading. Various characterization techniques, such as XRD, SEM, and BET were employed to thoroughly characterize catalyst. High surface area (737.88 m2/g) and a typical type IV pattern of hysteresis loop (0.25 –0.40) obtained 5Ni/MCM-41 catalyst is calculated by N2 adsorption–desorption technique. Catalyst characterization and discussion of results are presented in this work. 5Ni/MCM-41 catalyst strongly enhances the H2 and CO production from gasification of torrefied CR at a temperature of 700ºC. Carbon and hydrogen conversions were 80.17% and 27.39%, respectively while liquid yield was lower than 10 wt%. The syngas from the conversion maintained H2/CO ratio of 0.55 with the highest gaseous efficiency of 49.35%. Obviously, synergy of synthesized 5Ni/MCM-41 catalyst and torrefied CR with gasification is valuable useful as potential renewable energy generation process.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Converting landfilled sulfur waste into materials merges the ecological imperative of resource efficiency with economic considerations. A strategy to convert sulfur into polymeric materials is the inverse vulcanization reaction of sulfur with alkenes. However, the materials formed are of limited applicability, because they need to be cured at high temperatures (>130 °C) for many hours. Herein, we report the reaction of elemental sulfur with styrylethyltrimethoxysilane. Marrying the inverse vulcanization and silane chemistry yielded high sulfur content polysilanes, which could be cured via room temperature polycondensation to obtain coated surfaces, particles, and crosslinked materials. The polycondensation was triggered by hydrolysis of poly(sulfur-r-styrylethyltrimethoxysilane) (poly(Sn-r-StyTMS) under mild conditions (HCl, pH 4). For the first time, an inverse vulcanization polymer could be conveniently coated and mildly cured via post-polycondensation. Silica microparticles coated with the high sulfur content polymer could improve their Hg2+ ion remediation capability.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Scenario-based stochastic programming is applied to the provided case study to model the cooling demand uncertainty (CDU), and the downside risk constraints (DRC) are implemented to model the associated risks. The risk-averse performance of the MCS is compared with the risk-neutral one to show the positive effects of the DRC. The proposed model is implemented under the DICOPT solver in GAMS software. The comparison results show that the expected power consumption of MCS is increased slowly, while the expected risk-in-power consumption (ERIPC) is decreased promptly.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Nanosized Titania-Nickel mixed oxide for visible light photocatalytic activity,"Rajendran S., Manoj D., Nimita Jebaranjitham J., Kumar B.G., Bharath G., Banat F., Qin J., Vadivel S., Gracia F.",2020-08-01,"Degradation of methyl oranges, Methyl orange dyes, Nanocomposite catalyst, Photocatalytic property, Polluted water treatments, UV absorption spectrum, Visible light photocatalytic activity, Visible light region, Degradation, Methyl Orange, Nanomaterial, Photocatalyst, Visible light","Colourful dyes are primarily used in the textiles, toys, food, inks, paper and plastics. These dyes are water soluble and contaminate the water. The dyes are not bio-degradable and sustain in the water for long time create diseases like bladder tumour and chromosomal damage. Hence dyes are the major cause of pollution and must be removed from domestic and drinking water. The photocatalysts are energy-less technology for dye degradation and expected to solve clean water problems. Most of the photocatalysts are metal oxides and absorbed in the ultra violet region. But, sun light mostly consists of visible light, hence to use the sunlight effectively the absorption spectrum of the photocatalysts must be tuned to the visible region. Herein, we proposed visible light absorbed new TiO2/NiO nanocomposite for methyl orange dye degradation. The integration of NiO modified the TiO2 nanocomposite UV absorption spectrum into visible light region. The photocatalyst was prepared using mechano-thermal method and characterised using PXRD, TGA, FT-IR, HR-TEM, EDS, UV, PL and DRS methods. The photocatalytic property was explored using the degradation of methyl orange and compared the activity with different time intervals and wide range of pH. Within 60 min of irradiation, 98% of degradation was observed. Similarly, at all pH range more than 50% of degradation was observed, but the best performance (98%) was observed at pH = 7 (neural). Thus, the TiO2/NiO nanocomposite catalyst was effective in neutral, acidic and basic polluted water treatment. The synthesized TiO2/NiO nanocomposite is tuneable to visible light and degrade the methyl orange dye in all pH range.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Thus, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been studied for traffic signs and vehicle identification in an urban traffic context. However, there is a lack of priority vehicle classification algorithms with high accuracy, fast processing, and a lightweight solution. For filling those gaps, a vehicle detection system is proposed, which is integrated with an intelligent traffic light. Thus, this work proposes (1) a novel vehicle detection model named Priority Vehicle Image Detection Network (PVIDNet), based on YOLOV3, (2) a lightweight design strategy for the PVIDNet model using an activation function to decrease the execution time of the proposed model, (3) a traffic control algorithm based on the Brazilian Traffic Code, and (4) a database containing Brazilian vehicle images. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions were evaluated using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) tool. Results show that PVIDNet reached an accuracy higher than 0.95, and the waiting time of priority vehicles was reduced by up to 50%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","highway traffic control, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The electric field analysis at the composite cross-arm is very important for the high voltage system. The electric field at corona rings and grading rings must be confirmed that can withstand the corona threshold field. But the geometry of cross-arm is very complicated for computing. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to compute the 3 phase electric field by using ANSYS Maxwell software base on the finite element method (FEM). We separately calculate in each phase in order to reduce the computation time. Firstly, the 3-dimensional (3D) model of composite crossarm is simulated in a close domain. Then the average potential from the 2-dimensional (2D) model is defined as a boundary condition in case of the 3-dimensional model. Finally, the maximum electric field values in each phase are compared. From the results, the highest electric field occurs at phase B, and the electric field of tension-type grading ring is slightly higher than other types of ring. However, all values are lower than the electric field criteria.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Respondents recorded their demographic data, including age, sex, nationality, workplace, income, and education. Each respondent chose a single day to record their contacts; this resulted in a total of more than 8300 contacts. The characteristics of contacts were recorded, including their age, sex, nationality, location of contact, and occurrence of physical contact. More than 75% of all contacts occurred among migrants aged 15 to 39 years. The contacts were highly clustered in this age group among migrant workers of all three nationalities. There were far fewer contacts between migrant workers with younger and older age groups. The pattern varied slightly among different nationalities, which was mostly dependent upon the types of jobs taken. Half of migrant workers always returned to their home country at most once a year and on a seasonal basis. The present study has helped us gain a better understanding of contact mixing patterns among migrant workers in urban settings. This information is useful both when simulating disease epidemics and for guiding optimal disease control strategies among this vulnerable section of the population.","genergyal, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, the pathogenesis evaluation of DTMUV has been restricted to cluster 2.2 Chinese DTMUVs. In this study, the pathogenesis of a cluster 2.1 Thai DTMUV was investigated in three ages of Cherry Valley ducks (1-, 4- and 27-week-old). In each age, 35 ducks were inoculated with a cluster 2.1 Thai DTMUV and evaluated for clinical signs, virus distribution and shedding, pathology and serological response. Our results demonstrated that all duck ages were susceptible to Thai DTMUV; however, Thai DTMUV induced greater disease severity in younger ducks (1- and 4-week-old) when compared to older ducks (27-week-old) reflected by higher morbidity and mortality rates, and higher degree of pathological severity. Corresponding to these results, longer-term viremia, higher levels of viral loads in tissues and lower neutralizing antibody titers were also observed in younger ducks compared to those in older ducks. However, it should be noted that a significant drop in egg production was found in older ducks, which also indicates the susceptibility to Thai DTMUV in older ducks. Interestingly, prolonged shedding period with high viral loads was observed in older ducks even without showing clinical signs, suggesting the potential role of the older ducks as the carriers of Thai DTMUV. This finding highlights the importance of monitoring DTMUV and preventing the transmission of DTMUV in adult ducks. Overall, this study provides insights into the pathogenesis and infection dynamics of a cluster 2.1 Thai DTMUV in ducks.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Veterinary (all)"

However, toxicities and drug resistance limit the use of cisplatin. This study was aimed to improve cisplatin delivery using a targeting strategy to reduce the toxicity. In the present study, combinations of poly lactic-co-glycolic acids (PLGA) and liposomes were used as carriers for cisplatin delivery. In addition, to target the nanoparticle towards tumor cells, the liposome was conjugated with Avastin®, an anti-VEGF antibody. Cisplatin was loaded into PLGA using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method and further encapsulated in an Avastin® conjugated liposome (define herein as L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin®). Their physicochemical properties, including particle size, ζ-potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug release profiles were characterized. In addition, a study of the efficiency of tumor targeted drug delivery was conducted with cervical tumor bearing mice via intravenous injection. The therapeutic effect was examined in a 3D spheroid of SiHa cell line and SiHa cells bearing mice. The L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin® prompted a significant effect on cell viability and triggered cytotoxicity of SiHa cells. A cell internalization study confirmed that the L-PLGA-Cis-Avastin® had greater binding specificity to SiHa cells than those of L-PLGA-Cis or free drug, resulting in enhanced cellular uptake. Tumor targeting specificity was finally confirmed in xenograft tumors. Taken together, this nanoparticle could serve as a promising specific targeted drug for cervical cancer treatment.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The data used in this research is the number of international tourist arrivals from those countries recorded monthly from Jan 2013 to Sep 2018. The performance of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA) and the multiple regression model are evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Several important economic factors such as income, price, exchange rate, and qualitative factors, represented by dummy variables of seasonal effect are explored to understand their effects on international tourism demand. The results show that the SARIMA is preferred to forecast international tourism arrivals from Malaysia, while multiple regression provides lowest errors for other interested countries.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering

Points of interest inside and outside the target were considered to quantify the magnitude of calculation uncertainties in current and previous proton therapy practice that might especially have an impact on the dose in organs at risk (OARs). Methods: The RayStation treatment planning system (RaySearch Laboratories), offering two dose calculation algorithms for pencil beam scanning in proton therapy, i.e., Pencil Beam (PB) and Monte Carlo (MC), was utilized. Treatment plans for a target located behind the interface of the heterogeneous tissues were generated. Dose measurements within and behind the target were performed in a water phantom with embedded slabs of various tissue equivalent materials and 24 PinPoint ionization chambers (PTW). In total 12 test configurations encompassing two different target depths, oblique beam incidence of 30 degrees and range shifter, were considered. Results: PB and MC calculated doses agreed equally well with the measurements for all test geometries within the target, including the range shifter (mean dose differences ± 3%). Outside the target, the maximum dose difference of 9% (19%) was observed for MC (PB) for the oblique beam incidence and inserted range shifter. Conclusion: The accuracy of MC dose algorithm was superior compared to the PB algorithm, especially outside the target volumes. MC based dose calculation should therefore be preferred in treatment scenarios with heterogeneities, especially to reduce clinically relevant uncertainties for OARs.","radiology, biochemistryistry, medical, physics","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Physics and Astronomy (all)"

Blockade of PD-1/PD-L pathway has tended to become a promising therapeutic strategy as it improved the outcome of bacterial sepsis and postsepsis secondary fungal infection. Recently, the controversial effects of PD-1 blockade on infectious diseases, including aspergillosis, have been demonstrated; therefore, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 drug still remains to be elucidated.Methods:Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was conducted as a mouse sepsis model. Aspergillus fumigatus spores were intravenously inoculated on day 5 post-CLP, when the immune cells succumbed to exhaustion. Amphotericin B was medicated together with or without anti-PD-1 treatment after Aspergillus infection.Results:Amphotericin B alone was not effective to treat the CLP-mice with secondary aspergillosis. In contrast, antifungal medication with the adjunctive anti-PD-1 treatment attenuated the fungal burdens in blood and internal organs, and improved the survival rate of the mice with secondary aspergillosis. These outcomes of PD-1 blockade were concurring with the enhanced CD86 expression on splenocytes, the augmented serum IFN-γ, and the dampened IL-10. Activated T cells from anti-PD-1-treated mice also highly increased IFN-γ and diminished IL-10 production.Conclusion:The blockade of PD-1 on postsepsis aspergillosis presumably reinvigorated exhausted antigen-presenting cells and T cells by upregulating CD86 expression and IFN-γ production, and dampened IL-10 production, which consequently leaded to the attenuation of secondary aspergillosis. The adjunctive anti-PD-1 therapy may become a promising strategy for the advanced immunotherapy against lethal fungal infection.",medical,"Emergency Medicine, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

The reactor is applied to determine ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus and to study whether EMA-qPCR can assess the viral infectivity after ozone disinfection. Methods: Ozone disinfection of poliovirus was conducted in the developed CQF, and the disinfection kinetics were tested in the range of 0·7–5·0 s at ozone concentration of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1. Inactivation, damage on viral genome and damage on capsid integrity were determined by plaque assay, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and ethidium monoazide treatment coupled with RT-qPCR (EMA-qPCR), respectively. Results: By using CQF, 2·18 and 2·76 log10 reductions were observed at the reaction time of 0·7 s and ozone concentration of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1, respectively, followed by tailing. Ozone disinfection kinetics of poliovirus 1 were better fit by the efficiency factor Hom model than by the Chick-Watson model, or the modified Chick-Watson model. Kinetics observed were similar between RT-qPCR and EMA-qPCR assays at the reaction times of <2·0 s and ozone concentrations of 0·08 and 0·25 mg l−1. At reaction times > 5 s, viral concentration evaluated by EMA-qPCR was reduced in comparison to stable RT-qPCR results. Both assays still underestimated the virus inactivation. Conclusion: The simple developed reactor can be used to investigate viral ozone disinfection kinetics and to elucidate inactivation characteristics or mechanisms at very short exposure times. Significance and Impact of the Study: The developed CQF reactor is beneficial for better understanding of virus inactivation by ozone, and the reactor can be used to better elucidate disinfection kinetics and mechanisms for future research. This work constitutes an important contribution to the existing knowledge of the application and limitation of the EMA/PMA-qPCR to assess virus infectivity after ozone disinfection.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
No news is good news? Three-year postdischarge mortality of octogenarian and nonagenarian patients following emergency general surgery,"Narueponjirakul N., Hwabejire J., Kongwibulwut M., Lee J.M., Kongkaewpaisan N., Velmahos G., King D., Fagenholz P., Saillant N., Mendoza A., Rosenthal M., Kaafarani H.M.A.",2020-07-01,"Age Factors, Aged, 80 and over, Comorbidity, Emergencies, Female, Humans, Hypoalbuminemia, Liver, Male, Mortality, Patient Discharge, Postoperative Complications, Risk Factors, Surgical Procedures, Operative, emergency general surgery, mortality, Octogenarian, outcomes","BACKGROUND Outcome data on the very elderly patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) are sparse. We sought to examine short- and long-term mortality in the 80 plus years population following EGS. METHODS Using our institutional 2008-2018 EGS Database, all the 80 plus years patients undergoing EGS were identified. The data were linked to the Social Security Death Index to determine cumulative mortality rates up to 3 years after discharge. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of in-hospital and 1-year cumulative mortality. RESULTS A total of 385 patients were included with a mean age of 84 years; 54% were female. The two most common comorbidities were hypertension (76.1%) and cardiovascular disease (40.5%). The most common procedures performed were colectomy (20.0%), small bowel resection (18.2%), and exploratory laparotomy for other procedures (15.3%; e.g., internal hernia, perforated peptic ulcer). The overall in-hospital mortality was 18.7%. Cumulative mortality rates at 1, 2, and 3 years after discharge were 34.3%, 40.5%, and 43.4%, respectively. The EGS procedure associated with the highest 1-year mortality was colectomy (49.4%). Although hypertension, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated liver enzymes predicted in-hospital mortality, the only independent predictors of cumulative 1-year mortality were hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.27; p = 0.025) and elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT) level (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-4.70; p = 0.029) at initial presentation. Patients with both factors had a cumulative 1-year mortality rate of 75.0%. CONCLUSION More than half of the very elderly patients undergoing major EGS were still alive at 3 years postdischarge. The combination of hypoalbuminemia and elevated liver enzymes predicted the highest 1-year mortality. Such information can prove useful for patient and family counseling preoperatively.

In addition, users were required to use their ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a generic game architecture, using blockchain, that allows players to own their ""spent time"" in a game. The value of this spent time can be passed on to new games as ERC20 token on the Ethereum network and redeemed in such games. Our architecture can be used with any public blockchain. It can benefit many roles such as player, blockchain node, and game developer. Our experiment shows that the proposed architecture can be accepted by players, but other factors such as the type of gameplay and how the spent time is exchanged in a game can greatly affect the player acceptance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Software, Information Systems and Management, Modeling and Simulation"

Recently, it has become apparent that a remarkably large subgroup is suffering from often difficult-to-treat epilepsy. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and efficacy of commonly used anti-epileptic-drugs (AEDs) in patients with ATP1A3 related seizures. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study of patients in combination with a systematic literature-based review. Inclusion criteria were: verified ATP1A3 mutation, seizures and information about AED treatment. The literature review yielded records for 188 epileptic ATP1A3 patients. For 14/188 cases, information about anti-epileptic treatment was available. Combined with seven unpublished records of ATP1A3 patients, a sample size of 21 patients was reached. Most used AED were levetiracetam (n = 9), phenobarbital (n = 8), valproic acid (n = 7), and topiramate (n = 5). Seizure reduction was reported for 57% of patients (n = 12). No individual AEDs used (either alone or combined) had a success rate over 50%. There was no significant difference in the response rate between various AEDs. Ketogenic diet was effective in 2/4 patients. 43% of patients (n = 9) did not show any seizure relief. Even though Epilepsy is a significant clinical issue in ATP1A3 patients, only a minority of publications provide any information about patients’ anti-epileptic treatment. The findings of treatment effectiveness in only 57% (or lower) of patients, and the non-existence of a clear first-line AED in ATP1A3 related epilepsy stresses the need for further research.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; epilepsy, medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"

It was successfully prepared and purified from coconut husk by alkali treatment and delignification process. 10, 20 and 30 wt% of purified cellulose was incorporated into poly vinyl alcohol-based hydrogel composite. Sodium tetraborate was employed as a crosslinking agent. X-ray diffraction reported that the existence of purified cellulose did not provide the effect on crystal phase of poly vinyl alcohol. Thermal decomposition behavior of composite was slightly enhanced when the cellulose was integrated. Hydrogel composite was thermally stable up to 300 ◦C. The glass transition temperature was slightly shifted to lower, while the melting temperature was slightly shifted to be higher. The morphological properties of purified cellulose were presented in the porous network of hydrogel. The porous structure of composite was presented due to freeze–dry technique. The composite swelling behavior was tested for 180 min in deionized water, phosphate buffer saline and 0.1 M of sodium chloride solution. The degree of swelling behavior in phosphate buffer saline and 0.1 M of sodium chloride was superiority. With the existence of 20 wt% of cellulose in poly vinyl alcohol provided the highest degree of swelling. The cumulative release of methylene blue was rapid at the initial stage (within 10 min) and it was stable up to 180 min. The degradation test was completely degraded within a day. The remaining weight was constant within 12 h and it was rapidly reduced from 13 to 24 h. It was remarkable to note that the purified cellulose and poly vinyl alcohol-based hydrogel exhibited the attractive potential in various applications such as drug delivery system, artificial cartilage, wound dressing as well as facial mask and cosmetic.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

For applying kinetics of pyrolysis reaction in commercial simulation tools, a representative single reaction of overall pyrolysis reaction would be preferable in provided toolboxes.

The results showed that verification of using the quadratic regression models derived via Friedman method (Ea=−488.68X2+587.78X+64.104 and ln(A)=−106.58X2+116.71X+17.232) had very close agreement with the experiments in entire range of conversion.

Rice Os3BGlu7 and Os7BGlu26 β-glycosidases show a less strong preference, but Os3BGlu7 and Os7BGlu26 prefer glucosides and mannosides, respectively. Previous studies of crystal structures with glucoimidazole (GIm) and mannoimidazole (MIm) complexes and metadynamic simulations suggested that Os7BGlu26 hydrolyzes mannosides via the B2,5 transition state (TS) conformation preferred for mannosides and glucosides via their preferred4H3/4E TS conformation. However, MIm is weakly bound by both enzymes. In the present study, we found that MIm was not bound in the active site of crystallized Os3BGlu7, but GIm was tightly bound in the −1 subsite in a4H3/4E conformation via hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues. One-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations showed that GIm was stably bound in the Os3BGlu7 active site and the glycone-binding site with little distortion. In contrast, MIm initialized in the B2,5 conformation rapidly relaxed to a E3 /4H3 conformation and moved out into a position in the entrance of the active site, where it bound more stably despite making fewer interactions. The lack of MIm binding in the glycone site in protein crystals and simulations implies that the energy required to distort MIm to the B2,5 conformation for optimal active site residue interactions is sufficient to offset the energy of those interactions in Os3BGlu7. This balance between distortion and binding energy may also provide a rationale for glucosidase versus mannosidase specificity in plant β-glycosidases.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

The mechanical mixture of catalysts and sorbents as a conventional approach is complex and requires high temperatures for regeneration, which results in serious sintering of Cu-based catalysts. This paper describes a novel Cu-MgO/Al2O3 bifunctional catalysts (xCMA, x is denoted as the mass fraction of Cu, 0%–10%) via a sol–gel method for the SESRM process. We find that Cu species, including metallic Cu and Cu ions, co-exist on the catalyst. The metallic Cu on the catalyst surface is an active site for methanol steam reforming while the Cu ion in MgO lattice promotes the CO2 sorption capacity. Moreover, the incorporation of Cu ion into MgO also facilitates CO2 desorption by forming more bidentate carbonates. Due to the strong interaction between Cu and MgO, the Cu sintering is inhabited in comparison with the mechanical mixture of catalysts and sorbents. Meanwhile, MgO is found to induce more formate species to inhibit the generation of carbon monoxide. As a result, the optimal bifunctional catalyst, 8 wt% Cu-MgO/Al2O3 (8CMA) shows a superior performance in both catalytic reforming and CO2 sorption with a highest H2 selectivity of 99.3% and lowest CO selectivity (<0.15%) over 10 repeated cycles. This study suggests that the appropriate control of bifunctional catalysts can lead to powerful potential for high H2 production performance in SESRM.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Catalysis, Environmental Science (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

However, the quality of BIM models affects the quality of BIM-based quantity takeoff. Our research focuses on drywalls, which consist of wall framings and wall panels. If BIM models from the design phases do not contain wall framing models, contractors or sub-contractors cannot perform quantity takeoff for purchasing materials. Developing wall framing models under a tight schedule in the construction phase is time-consuming, cost-intensive, and error-prone. The increased geometries in a BIM model also slow down the software performance. Therefore, in this research, an automatic method is proposed for calculating quantities of wall framings from drywalls in a BIM model. Building elements that overlap with the drywalls are subtracted from the drywall surfaces before calculation. The quantities of wall framings are then embedded into the properties of drywall in the BIM model and hence they can be extracted directly from the BIM model. A prototype system is developed and the proposed method is validated in an actual construction project. The results of the case study showed that the prototype system took 282 s to deliver accurate quantities of wall framings with deviations of 0.11 to 0.30% when compared to a baseline, and the file size of the BIM model after applying the proposed method was increased very slightly from 47.0 MB to 47.1 MB. This research contributes to developing an approach for quantity takeoff of wall framings that are not present in a BIM model. Accurate quantities of wall framings can be obtained while the time and cost of developing wall framings for quantity takeoff can be saved. The proposed method does not increase the geometries in the BIM model; therefore, the file size of the model does not increase greatly, which stabilizes the software performance.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Computer Science Applications"

Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA was conducted to investigate the gut microbiome profiles of H. taichui-infected participants compared with those of parasite-free participants. Prevotella copri was the dominant bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in the study population. The relative abundance of three bacterial taxa, Ruminococcus, Roseburia faecis and Veillonella parvula, was significantly increased in the H. taichui-infected group. Parasite-negative group had higher bacterial diversity (α diversity) than the H. taichui-positive group. In addition, a significant difference in bacterial community composition (β diversity) was found between the two groups. The results suggest that H. taichui infection impacts the gut microbiome profile by reducing bacterial diversity and altering bacterial community structure in the gastrointestinal tract.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary parasitology; epidemiology and transmission of infections, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Animal Science and Zoology, Infectious Diseases"
Development and Validation of a Universal One-Step RT-PCR Assay for Broad Detection of Duck Tembusu Virus,"Ninvilai P., Tunterak W., Prakairungnamthip D., Oraveerakul K., Thontiravong A.",2020-09-01,"Animals, Ducks, Flavivirus, Flavivirus Infections, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Poultry Diseases, Thailand, diagnosis, duck, duck Tembusu virus, universal RT-PCR","Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has been identified as a causative agent of an emerging disease in ducks. Since its first report in 2010, several clusters of DTMUV have increasingly been identified and caused outbreaks in many Asian countries. This highlights the need for improved and novel broad detection assays in order to detect all circulating clusters of DTMUV. In this study, a universal one-step reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting a highly conserved region of the NS5 gene was developed and validated for broad detection of all DTMUV clusters. The newly developed universal RT-PCR assay could specifically detect all clusters of DTMUV without cross-reactions with common duck viruses and other related flaviviruses. The assay was able to detect DTMUV as low as a 0.001 50% embryo lethal dose/milliliter. The performance of the assay was evaluated by using experimental and field clinical samples. The assay could successfully detect DTMUV in all experimentally DTMUV-infected samples and gave a higher DTMUV detection rate (36%) than the previously reported envelope-specific RT-PCR assay (30%) in field clinical samples. All the positive samples were confirmed DTMUV-positive by DNA sequencing. In conclusion, the newly developed universal RT-PCR assay exhibited high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in broad DTMUV detection, thus providing an improved screening assay for routine detection and epidemiologic surveillance of DTMUV.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; diagnosis, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Immunology and Microbiology (all)"

In this study, we verified crystalline states using various crystal faces and excipients during high-shear wet granulation based on non-contact low-frequency (LF) Raman probe monitoring. Four model drugs [indomethacin (IND), acetaminophen (APAP), theophylline (TP), and caffeine (CAF) polymorphs and cocrystals] were mixed with microcrystalline cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose with the addition of water over time. The LF Raman probe showed comparatively high sensitivity in monitoring 5–20% APAP and IND in a wet mass. Notably, as observed from the characteristic LF Raman peak shifts, form I TP and CAF and their cocrystals were more susceptible to transformation to the monohydrate form than form II. This method was also shown to be applicable in monitoring a commercial formulation of eight excipients and revealed crystalline transformations after 15 min of mixing. Therefore, probe-type LF Raman spectroscopy can be successfully employed to distinguish and monitor the crystalline state of APIs in real time during high-shear wet granulation, in which there is a risk of crystal transformation.","drug literature index, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical Science"

Although MALR mass transfer and gas–liquid hydrodynamic performance have been investigated, scaling has not yet been examined. Therefore, this work studies scale effects and defined scaling criteria to construct empirical correlations for multi-scale MALRs. Five different MALR working volumes or scales were examined (2.2, 4.4, 6.6, 17.5, and 140 dm3) in similar geometries. The results of scale effect on KLa and hydrodynamics showed that every MALR scale provided better KLa compared with regular reactors. Moreover, 1.1- to 1.6-fold higher KLa was obtained from the 140 dm3 reactor compared with 17.5 dm3. Scaling criteria analysis was divided into three types: multi-dimensional, liquid height, and combined processes. The KLa coefficient was defined as the scaling criteria compared to investigated parameters, i.e., oxygen transfer rate and efficiency, and aeration efficiency, for all three scaling types. Thus, KLa prediction correlations were constructed with respect to reactor configuration and operating conditions. KLa was well presented by all considered models, with R2 = 92–99% and discrepancy = 10–20%.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering, Mathematics","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Applied Mathematics"

Few studies have assessed the immunohistological features of KFD, and most employed limited antibody panels that lacked many of the novel immunohistochemistry markers currently available. Methods and results: We used immunohistochemistry to reappraise the microanatomical distribution of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), follicular helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, B cells, follicular dendritic cell (FDC) meshworks, and histiocytes in lymph nodes involved by KFD. The study group consisted of 138 KFD patients (89 women; 64.5%) with a median age of 27 years (range, 3–50 years). Cervical lymph nodes were most commonly involved, in 108 (78.3%) patients. The numbers of pDCs were increased, predominantly around and within apoptotic areas and the paracortex, and tapering off within xanthomatous areas. pDCs formed sizeable tight clusters, most notably around apoptotic/necrotic areas. T cells consisted mostly of CD8-positive cells with predominant expression of T-cell receptor-β. There were notable increases in the numbers of CD8-positive T cells within lymphoid follicles, and their numbers correlated with alterations in FDC meshworks (P < 0.001). The number of follicular helper T cells was decreased within distorted FDC meshworks. CD21 highlighted frequent distortion of FDC meshworks, even in lymph node tissue that was distant from apoptotic/necrotic areas. Distorted FDC meshworks spanned all morphological patterns, and FDC meshwork characteristics (intact; distorted; remnant/nearly absent) correlated with morphological patterns (P < 0.01). Conclusions: The immunohistological landscape of KFD is complex and characterised by increased numbers of pDCs that frequently cluster around apoptotic/necrotic foci, increased numbers of cytotoxic T cells, and substantial distortion of FDC meshworks.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology"

However, users are becoming increasingly aware of the access these applications have to their personal information and the risk that applications may transmit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to external servers, sometimes unknowingly to users. There is no easy way to know whether or not an application transmits PII. If this information could be made available to users as early as when they are browsing application markets looking for new applications to install on their devices, they can weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision on the associated risk of their private information potentially being exposed. Previously, detection of PII transmission has been tackled using heavy-weight techniques such as static code analysis and dynamic behavior analysis requiring from several minutes to hours of testing and analysis per application. In constrast, we propose using light-weight methods to extract features that we then use to develop a classification model to detect PII transmission in under a minute with performance that rivals the heavy-weight techniques. We evaluate our model using an extensive set of more than 8700 top-ranked Android applications. Our approach is precise and fast, making it suitable for real-time detection and analysis of PII transmission in mobile applications.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, sociology","Computer Science (all), Law"

However, its low water solubility is the major obstacle for its use in pharmaceutical applications. To increase the water solubility of MGS, complex formation with beta-cyclodextrins (βCDs), particularly with the native βCD and/or its derivative2,6-dimethyl-β-CD (DMβCD) is a promising technique. Although there have been several reports on the adsorption of βCDs on the lipid bilayer, the release of the MGS/βCDs inclusion complex through the biological membrane remains unclear. In this present study, the release the MGS from the two different βCDs (βCD and DMβCD) across the lipid bilayer was investigated. Firstly, the adsorption of the free MGS, free βCDs, and inclusion complex formation was studied by conventional molecular dynamics simulation. The MGS in complex with those two βCDs was able to spontaneously release free MGS into the inner membrane. However, both MGS and DMβCD molecules potentially permeated into the deeper region of the interior membrane, whereas βCD only adsorbed at the outer membrane surface. The interaction between secondary rim of βCD and the 1-palmitoeyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) phosphate groups showed the highest number of hydrogen bonds (up to 14) corresponding to the favorable location of βCD on the POPC membrane. Additionally, the findings suggested that electrostatic energy was the main driving force for βCD adsorption on the POPC membrane, while van derWaals interactions played a predominant role in DMβCD adsorption. The release profile of MGS from the βCDs pocket across the lipid bilayer exhibited two energy minima along the reaction coordinate associated with the permeation of the MGS molecule into the deeper region of the POPC membrane.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Since extremum conditions of the investigated factors may inefficient, optimum levels are required to identify. 2 k factorial and response surface design of Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology were applied to optimize these complex variables in terms of overall liquid mass transfer coefficient (K L a) of clean water. As a result, the main effective factors of MALR with their optimum value are amount of baffles (N b ∼ 3 baffles), baffle angle (α ∼ 50°), position of base area (Y r ∼ 10 cm), open space on baffle (A s ∼ 90 cm2), and gas flow (Qg). Increasing Qg resulted better K L a for the studied ranges (2–18 LPM). At the optimum condition, the improvement of MALR in terms of K L a coefficient was increased up to 97% and 28% compared to the regular bubble column and airlift reactor, respectively, at a certain gas flow without any extra energy.

However, rechargeable ZABs suffer from a limited cycle life. This paper reports that potassium persulfate (KPS) additive in an alkaline electrolyte can effectively enhance the performance and electrochemical characteristics of rechargeable zinc–air flow batteries (ZAFBs). Introducing redox additives into electrolytes is an effective approach to promote battery performance. With the addition of 450 ppm KPS, remarkable improvement in anodic currents corresponding to zinc (Zn) dissolution and limited passivation of the Zn surface is observed, thus indicating its strong effect on the redox reaction of Zn. Besides, the addition of 450 ppm KPS reduces the corrosion rate of Zn, enhances surface reactions and decreases the solution resistance. However, excess KPS (900 and 1350 ppm) has a negative effect on rechargeable ZAFBs, which leads to a shorter cycle life and poor cyclability. The rechargeable ZAFB, using 450 ppm KPS, exhibits a highly stable charge/discharge voltage for 800 cycles. Overall, KPS demonstrates great promise for the enhancement of the charge/discharge performance of rechargeable ZABs.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The major menaquinones were MK-10(H8), MK-10(H6) and MK-9(H8). The predominant cellular fatty acids were isoC16:0, anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The detected phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. Strain 3MP-10T had a genome size of 7.2 Mb with a genome G+C content of 73.4 mol%. Results of in silico genome-based similarity analysis revealed ANIb values of 84.94 and 84.77%, ANIm values of 88.01 and 87.92%, and dDDH values of 29.9 and 29.6% when compared with S. zhaozhouensis DSM 42101T and S. sedi JCM 16909T, respectively.

Human Caesarean scar-derived feeder cells: A novel feeder cell type for culturing human pluripotent stem cells without exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor supplementation,"Pavarajarn W., Pavarajarn W., Rungsiwiwut R., Numchaisrika P., Virutamasen P., Pruksananonda K.",2020-06-01,"Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, Cesarean Section, Cicatrix, Coculture Techniques, Feasibility Studies, Feeder Cells, Female, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Humans, Karyotype, Paracrine Communication, Phenotype, Pluripotent Stem Cells, Pregnancy, Signal Transduction, differentiation, embryoid body, pluripotency, reprogramming, stem cells","In a feeder-dependent culture system of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), coculture with mouse embryonic fibroblasts may limit the clinical use of hPSCs. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using human Caesarean scar fibroblasts (HSFs) as feeder cells for the culture of hPSCs. HSFs were isolated and characterised and cocultured with hPSCs, and the pluripotency, differentiation ability and karyotypic stability of hPSCs were determined. Inactivated HSFs expressed genes (including inhibin subunit beta A (INHBA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFB1), collagen alpha-1(I) (COL1A1) and fibronectin-1 (FN1) that have been implicated in the maintenance of hPSC pluripotency. When HSFs were used as feeder cells, the pluripotency and karyotypic stability of hPSC lines did not change after prolonged coculture. Interestingly, exogenous FGF2 could be omitted from the culture medium when HSFs were used as feeder cells for hESCs but not hiPSCs. hESCs cocultured with HSF feeder cells in medium without FGF2 supplementation maintained their pluripotency (as confirmed by the expression of pluripotency markers and genes), differentiated in vitro into embryonic germ layers and maintained their normal karyotype. The present study demonstrates that HSFs are a novel feeder cell type for culturing hPSCs and that supplementation of exogenous FGF2 is not necessary for the Chula2.hES line.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical",Medicine (all)
Anthocyanin-enriched riceberry rice extract inhibits cell proliferation and adipogenesis in 3t3-l1 preadipocytes by downregulating adipogenic transcription factors and their targeting genes,"Kongthitilerd P., Suantawee T., Cheng H., Thilavech T., Marnpae M., Adisakwattana S.",2020-08-01,"3T3-L1 Cells, Adipocytes, Adipogenesis, Animals, Anthocyanins, CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha, CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta, Cell Proliferation, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression, Glucose, Mice, Obesity, Oryza, Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts, PPAR gamma, Transcription Factors, Triglycerides, 3T3-L1 cells, Adipogenesis, Anthocyanin, Cell proliferation, Obesity, Preadipocytes, Riceberry rice","Riceberry rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a new pigmented variety of rice from Thailand. Despite its high anthocyanin content, its effect on adipogenesis and adipocyte function remains unexplored. We investigated whether Riceberry rice extract (RBE) impacted cell proliferation by examining viability and cell cycle, using preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. To test RBE’s effect on adipocyte formation, cells were cultured in adipogenic medium supplemented with extract and adipocyte number and triglyceride levels were quantified. Furthermore, Akt1 phosphorylation along with RT-qPCR and intracellular calcium imaging were performed to obtain an insight into its mechanism of action. The effect of RBE on adipocyte function was investigated using glucose uptake and lipolysis assays. Treatment of cells with RBE decreased preadipocyte number without cytotoxicity despite inducing cell cycle arrest (p < 0.05). During adipogenic differentiation, RBE supplementation reduced adipocyte number and triglyceride accumulation by downregulating transcription factors (e.g., PPARγ, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ) and their target genes (p < 0.05). The Akt1 phosphorylation was decreased by RBE but insignificance, however, the extract failed to increase intracellular calcium signals. Finally, the treatment of adipocytes with RBE reduced glucose uptake by downregulating Glut4 mRNA expression and enhanced isoproterenol-induced lipolysis (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that RBE could potentially be used in the treatment of obesity by inhibiting adipocyte formation and proliferation.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"
Behavior of concrete confined with epoxy bonded fiber ropes under axial load,"Hussain Q., Ruangrassamee A., Tangtermsirikul S., Joyklad P.",2020-12-10,"Axial compressive strength, External confinement, Fiber reinforced polymer composites, Reinforced polymer composites, Reinforced polymers, Strengthening technique, Ultimate compressive strength, Uni-axial compression, Compressive strength, Concrete, Confinement, Confinement model, Cotton, Deformability, Fiber Reinforced Polymers, FRRP, Hemp, Polyester, Rope","In the past, several experimental and theoretical studies investigated the axial compressive strength and strain of plain concrete (PC) externally confined with natural and synthetic fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Typical types of synthetic FRP(s) are aramid, glass, carbon, PEN (polyethylene naphthalates) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), whereas natural FRP(s) include flax, sisal, hemp and jute. In this article, the performance of a novel, low-cost and sustainable strengthening technique i.e., fiber rope reinforced polymer (FRRP) composites to enhance the axial compressive strength, strain and deformability of concrete specimens through external wrapping is explored. The outstanding benefits of the newly proposed FRRP composites are low-cost, wide availability, easy application and more environmentally friendly. In this research, 39 circular plain concrete (PC) cylinders were tested to failure under uniaxial compression. The research parameters covered fiber rope type (such as hemp, cotton and polyester) and number of FRRP layers. Experimental results proved that external confinement by using FRRP is very effective to enhance ultimate strength, strain and deformability of the concrete. Further, based on the test results, the implementation of the existing ultimate compressive strength and strain models established for the synthetic and natural FRP(s) is evaluated to assess their application to the newly proposed FRRP confinement. It is found that more or less all considered models do not accurately predict the tested ultimate compressive strength and strain of the FRRP-confined concrete. In the end, new ultimate strength and strain models are proposed to accurately predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of concrete specimens confined with fiber rope reinforced polymer composites. The predicted ultimate compressive strength and strain values compare favorably with the experimental results of the present study.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

Through interviews with the aircrew planner, four objectives are considered vital for effective roster preparation; minimisation of nautical mile cost, balance workload among cockpit crews, maximisation of preferential requests from senior pilots and minimisation of the number of repeated flight patterns flown by individual pilots. Since the problem is NP-hard with many conflicting objectives that need to be optimised simultaneously, multi-objective evolutionary optimisation is an effective technique to solve this problem. As a result, the hybridisation between MOEA/D and HBMO algorithms, namely MOEA/D-HBMO, is developed. The proposed algorithm is compared to MOEA/D and HBMO. It is observed that MOEA/D-HBMO outperforms the counterparts in convergence related metrics and it could discover the best extreme points to meet every objective.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, has been managed by beekeepers for millennia for both honey and wax production and for crop pollination. Here we use both microsatellite markers and sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene to evaluate genetic variation of managed A. mellifera in Thailand, where the species is introduced. Microsatellite analysis revealed high average genetic diversity with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.620 ± 0.184 to 0.734 ± 0.071 per locus per province. Observed heterozygosities were generally lower than those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, both locally and across the population as a whole. Mitochondrial sequencing revealed that the frequency of two evolutionary linages (C - Eastern European and O - Middle Eastern) are similar to those observed in a previous survey 10 yr ago. Our results suggest that Thai beekeepers are managing their A. mellifera in ways that retain overall genetic diversity, but reduce genetic diversity between apiaries.","environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Ecology, Insect Science"
Diesel-Contaminated Soil Washing by Mixed Nonionic Surfactant Emulsion and Seed Germination Test,"Rongsayamanont W., Tongcumpou C., Phasukarratchai N.",2020-06-01,"Contaminated soils, Diesel-contaminated soil, Environmental contamination, Extraction efficiencies, Hydrophile-lipophile balance, Petroleum hydrocarbons, Surfactant properties, Surfactant solution, Diesel, HLB, Interfacial tension, Nonionic surfactant, Seed germination, Soil treatment","Petroleum hydrocarbons are applied in various energy activities. If accidents happen, they may result in environmental contamination, especially in soil. Petroleum hydrocarbons have low evaporation rates and are adsorbed on the soil surface, making it necessary to treat contaminated soil before the pollutants spread to other areas. Soil washing with surfactant solution is a method used to treat petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. The process relies on surfactant properties which reduce surface tension and desorb diesel from soil particles prior to flushing out with water. The relationship between efficiency of diesel extraction from contaminated soil and factors of both single surfactants (Span20, Tween20, Tween80, Dehydol LS9) and mixed surfactants (Span20+Tween20, Span20+Tween80, Span20+Dehydol LS9) were investigated including hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) and interfacial tension (IFT) to select a suitable surfactant. Diesel was analyzed by GC-FID. Findings revealed that extraction efficiency significantly increased when the HLB of the surfactant increased in every solution pair (p = 0.05). Span20+Dehydol LS9 solution with HLB 12 showed the lowest IFT (17.767 ± 0.013 mN/m) and the highest diesel extraction efficiency (66.2%). The water washing process, repeated twice after washing with 1% (w/v) Span20+Dedydol LS9, resulted in less toxicity on germination and growth of tomato, rice, and green bean compared with diesel washing solution and fresh washing solution. Diesel-contaminated soil washing with mixed surfactant is an interesting alternative as an environmentally friendly soil treatment.

We convened a 1-d multi-stakeholder participatory workshop in Bangkok. We provide a meeting summary and reactions from DMS investigators. Methods: Workshop members viewed de-identified interview excerpts from DMS participants. They deliberated on the findings and made recommendations regarding informed choice for remission trials. Notes and recordings were used to create a summary report, which was reviewed by members and refined. Results: Workshop members’ recommendations included HIV education and psychosocial support to establish the basis for informed choice, key trial information to be provided in everyday language, supportive decision-making processes and psychosocial care during and after the trial. Concerns included participant willingness to restart antiretrovirals after trial-mandated treatment interruption, unintended influence of the research team on decision-making and seemingly altruistic motivations for trial participation that may signal attempts to atone for stigmatized behavior. Conclusions: The workshop highlighted community perspectives and resulted in recommendations for supporting informed choice and psychosocial and physical health. These are the first such recommendations arising from a deliberative process.

Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) is a technique for assessing LA function. This study aimed to evaluate the LA function in HCM cats compared to normal cats, using 2D-STE. Results: Seventeen client-owned cats affected with HCM and twenty healthy control cats were studied. Conventional echocardiographic and 2D-STE variables were measured and compared between groups (control and HCM groups). Variability of the peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) displayed good reproducibility with 4.7% intra-observer and 14% inter-observer repeatability. The mean value of PALS in the HCM group (13.16 ± 8.64) was lower than that in the control group (28.54 ± 10.31) (P < 0.001). PALS was lowest in the LA roof region. The atrial longitudinal strains of septal and lateral regions were significantly lower in the HCM group than in the normal group. The PALS correlated with the percentage of the LA fractional shortening (LA-FS) (r = 0.538, P = 0.001), the percentage of the LA ejection fraction (LA-EF) (r = 0.797, P < 0.001), and the LA fractional area change (FAC) (r = 0.746, P < 0.001).

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of drinking green tea on bone resorption in ligature-induced periodontitis in mice. Methods: Sixty C57BL/6 eight-week-old male mice were used. To induce periodontitis, a ligature was placed for 7 days around the upper left second maxillary molar. After ligature removal, the animals were administered different concentrations of green tea (1.5 g/60 mL, 3 g/60 mL, or 6 g/60 mL) or distilled water. At 1 and 2 weeks of administration, the animals were sacrificed and micro-CT images of the maxillae were taken. Next, the depth and area of alveolar bone loss in the buccal and palatal sides were measured. The number of inflammatory cells and osteoclasts in histological sections were counted. Results: The result showed ligature-induced alveolar bone loss. Green tea inhibited ligature-induced bone loss in the buccal side in a dose-dependent manner. Histologically, ligature increased the number of inflammatory cells and osteoclasts, but this effect was alleviated by green tea. Conclusions: Evidence from this animal experiment suggested that drinking green tea would be potentially beneficial to reduce alveolar bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis.","medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Medicine (miscellaneous), Dentistry (all), Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

High-capacity dual-electrolyte aluminum-air battery with circulating methanol anolyte,"Teabnamang P., Kao-Ian W., Nguyen M.T., Yonezawa T., Cheacharoen R., Kheawhom S.",2020-05-01,"Alkaline aqueous electrolytes, Anion exchange membrane, Anion-exchange membrane separators, Discharge current density, Dual electrolyte systems, High energy densities, Non-aqueous electrolytes, Polymer gel electrolytes, Aluminum, Aluminum-air battery, Anion exchange membrane, Dual electrolyte, Flow battery, Methanol, Potassium hydroxide","Aluminum-air batteries (AABs) have recently received extensive attention because of their high energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, a critical issue limiting their practical application is corrosion of aluminum (Al) anode in an alkaline aqueous electrolyte, which results from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To effectively solve the corrosion issue, dissolution of Al anode should be carried out in a nonaqueous electrolyte. However, the main cathodic reaction, known as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), is sluggish in such a nonaqueous electrolyte. Adual-electrolyte configuration with an anion exchange membrane separator allows AABs to implement a nonaqueous anolyte along with an aqueous catholyte. Thus, this work addresses the issue of anode corrosion in an alkaline Al-air flow battery via a dual-electrolyte system. The battery configuration consisted of an Al anode | anolyte | anion exchange membrane | catholyte | air cathode. The anolytes were methanol solutions containing 3 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) with different ratios of water. An aqueous polymer gel electrolyte was used as the catholyte. The corrosion of Al in the anolytes was duly investigated. The increase of water content in the anolyte reduced overpotential and exhibited faster anodic dissolution kinetics. This led to higher HER, along with a greater corrosion rate. The performance of the battery was also examined. At a discharge current density of 10 mA cm-2, the battery using the anolyte without water exhibited the highest specific capacity of 2328 mAh/gAl, producing 78% utilization of Al. At a higher content of water, a higher discharge voltage was attained. However, due to greater HER, the specific capacity of the battery decreased. Besides, the circulation rate of the anolyte affected the performance of the battery. For instance, at a higher circulation rate, a higher discharge voltage was attained. Overall, the dual-electrolyte system proved to be an effective approach for suppressing anodic corrosion in an alkaline Al-air flow battery and enhancing discharge capacity.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, corrosion, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

MnO2/graphite hybrids with the increase of contact surface and interfacial interaction are beneficial to construct an interfacial 3D conductive network and improve the inherent stability, which achieve the minimum volume change. As expected, the rate and cycling performance of MnO2/graphite hybrids (230 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 80 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 80.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1) are better than that of MnO2 (113 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 24 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, 51.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). The reduced volume change during charging/discharging can be observed via in situ optical observations.

Herein, we evaluated the prognostic significance of EFS12 in patients with stage 1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Out of 282 patients with stage 1 DLBCL who received intensive therapy, 227 (80.5%) achieved EFS12. The 4-year overall survival (OS) was 91.4% and 4.0% for patients who achieved and failed to achieve EFS12, respectively. Multivariable analyses demonstrated response to treatment and achievement of EFS12 as independent predictors for OS. In conclusion, our study demonstrated EFS12 as a powerful prognostic factor for stage 1 DLBCL. Further validation in more extensive prospective studies is warranted.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Oncology, Cancer Research"

Methods: A systematic literature search in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases was conducted through January 2020 to identify studies that provided data on the AKI incidence and AKI-associated mortality risk in adult patients with implantable LVADs. Pooled effect estimates were examined using random-effects, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian-Laird. Results: Fifty-six cohort studies with 63,663 LVAD patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of reported AKI was 24.9% (95%CI: 20.1%–30.4%) but rose to 36.9% (95%CI: 31.1%–43.1%) when applying the standard definition of AKI per RIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO criteria. The pooled incidence of severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) was 12.6% (95%CI: 10.5%–15.0%). AKI incidence did not differ significantly between types of LVAD (p =.35) or indication for LVAD use (p =.62). While meta-regression analysis did not demonstrate a significant association between study year and overall AKI incidence (p =.55), the study year was negatively correlated with the incidence of severe AKI requiring RRT (slope = −0.068, p <.001). The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of mortality at 30 days and one year in AKI patients were 3.66 (95% CI, 2.00–6.70) and 2.22 (95% CI, 1.62–3.04), respectively. The pooled ORs of mortality at 30 days and one year in severe AKI patients requiring RRT were 7.52 (95% CI, 4.58–12.33) and 5.41 (95% CI, 3.63–8.06), respectively. Conclusion: We found that more than one-third of LVAD patients develop AKI based on standard definitions, and 13% develop severe AKI requiring RRT. There has been a potential improvement in the incidence of severe AKI requiring RRT for LVAD patients. AKI in LVAD patients was associated with increased 30-day and 1 year mortality.",medical,"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine, Nephrology"

Little is known regarding the nutritional status among elderly people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to study the prevalence of malnutrition and the associated factors in a Thai aging cohort. A cross-sectional study was conducted among PLHIV >50 years of age on long-term antiretroviral therapy and HIV-negative controls, frequency matched by sex and age in Bangkok, Thailand. Nutritional status was assessed by the Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA) tool. Abnormal nutritional status was defined as MNA score <24 (malnutrition and at risk of malnutrition). Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using Body Composition Analyzer. Demographic and disease-related factors were assessed for their association with abnormal nutrition status using multivariable logistic regression. There were 349 PLHIV and 103 HIV-uninfected controls, with median age 55 years. The majority were male (63%) with median body mass index (BMI) of 23.4 kg/m2. PLHIV had lower BMI [median, 23.1 (IQR, 20.8-25.2) vs. 25.3 (22.3-28.7) kg/m2, p < .001], lower fat percent [22.8% vs. 26.3%, p < .001] and lower fat mass [14.2 vs. 16.9 kg, p < .001] and higher abnormal nutritional status (18.05% vs. 6.8%, p = .005) than controls. In the multivariate model, older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.06, 95% confident interval [CI]: 1.01-1.12, p = .03), positive HIV status (aOR, 2.67, 95% CI: 1.07-6.65, p = .036), diabetes mellitus (aOR, 2.21, 95% CI: 1.003-4.87, p = .049), lower fat mass (aOR, 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.86, p < .001), and lower BMI (aOR, 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51-0.78, p < .001) were independently associated with abnormal nutritional status.

In this commentary, we identify challenges and opportunities at human–primate interfaces in light of COVID-19, focusing on examples from Asia, and make recommendations for researchers working with wild primates to reduce zoonosis risk and leverage research opportunities. First, we briefly review the evidence for zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss risks of zoonosis at the human–primate interface. We then identify challenges that the pandemic has caused for primates, including reduced nutrition, increased intraspecific competition, and increased poaching risk, as well as challenges facing primatologists, including lost research opportunities. Subsequently, we highlight opportunities arising from pandemic-related lockdowns and public health messaging, including opportunities to reduce the intensity of problematic human–primate interfaces, opportunities to reduce the risk of zoonosis between humans and primates, opportunities to reduce legal and illegal trade in primates, new opportunities for research on human–primate interfaces, and opportunities for community education. Finally, we recommend specific actions that primatologists should take to reduce contact and aggression between humans and primates, to reduce demand for primates as pets, to reduce risks of zoonosis in the context of field research, and to improve understanding of human–primate interfaces. Reducing the risk of zoonosis and promoting the well-being of humans and primates at our interfaces will require substantial changes from “business as usual.” We encourage primatologists to help lead the way.","genergyal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Animal Science and Zoology"

The position of obstacle can be detected by the IWR1443 radar imaging sensor. The shape of the obstacle is assumed that is a cylindrical shape. The data of the sensor is represented in the form of a position, which has no information about shape. The proposed algorithm has two stages, which are separation and estimation. The obstacles are separated by K-mean with the K-selection algorithm. The position of obstacles is estimated by using a circle-fitting method in the XY-coordinate. Since the estimated radius has an error, we propose multiplying and summation parameters to compensate for the estimated radius. By adjusting the radius, we could design the possible path based on RRT*. Our results show the path between the starting point to the goal point with two obstacles. The path of the RRT∗ can avoid the obstacle with the information from the IWR1443 sensor. This algorithm is used to avoid obstacles in 2D space. The compensate parameter is defined by the environment, the robot, and the user.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Here, we show that Plasmodium yoelii EBL (PyEBL) can shape disease severity by modulating the surface structure of infected RBCs (iRBCs) and host immune responses. We identified an amino acid substitution (a change of C to Y at position 741 [C741Y]) in the protein trafficking domain of PyEBL between isogenic P. yoellii nigeriensis strain N67 and N67C parasites that produce different disease phenotypes in C57BL/6 mice. Exchanges of the C741Y alleles altered parasite growth and host survival accordingly. The C741Y substitution also changed protein processing and trafficking in merozoites and in the cytoplasm of iRBCs, reduced PyEBL binding to band 3, increased phosphatidylserine (PS) surface exposure, and elevated the osmotic fragility of iRBCs, but it did not affect invasion of RBCs in vitro. The modified iRBC surface triggered PS-CD36-mediated phagocytosis of iRBCs, host type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, and T cell differentiation, leading to improved host survival. This study reveals a previously unknown role of PyEBL in regulating host-pathogen interaction and innate immune responses, which may be explored for developing disease control strategies. IMPORTANCE Malaria is a deadly parasitic disease that continues to afflict hundreds of millions of people every year. Infections with malaria parasites can be asymptom-atic, with mild symptoms, or fatal, depending on a delicate balance of host immune responses. Malaria parasites enter host red blood cells (RBCs) through interactions between parasite ligands and host receptors, such as erythrocyte-binding-like (EBL) proteins and host Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). Plasmodium yoelii EBL (PyEBL) is known to play a role in parasite invasion of RBCs. Here, we show that PyEBL also affects disease severity through modulation of host immune responses, particularly type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. This discovery assigns a new function to PyEBL and provides a mechanism for developing disease control strategies.",Immunology,"Microbiology, Virology"

This work aims to design and develop the integrated network of biochemical and biofuel productions into existing pulp mills for sustainable purposes. The systematic methodology aided by computation tools is undertaken using the three-stage approach including process synthesis, design and innovation. Previously, the optimal technologies of the biorefinery-integrated pulping processes were successfully determined in the synthesis stage providing the highest cost-effective incorporation; 48 million USD/year of profit was estimated according to the integration of succinic acid and dimethyl ether productions into the soda pulping process. Herein, the process designs of the integrated processes were performed followed by evaluations of the process performances and identifications of the hot spots and targets for establishments of the innovations. In this work, the biomass gasification option is designed and implemented to enhance the material and energy utilizations in the previously determined biorefinery-integrated pulping processes. Electricity and biofuel are produced and sold, which contributes positively to the economic and environmental impacts of these processes. The hot spots and targets are subsequently identified prior to the innovation stage. According to this stage, the cleaner alternatives that implements the CO2 utilization via methanol synthesis and solar cell installations are selected in order to minimize the CO2 emission. A net CO2 reduction of 42% is achieved when the cleaner alternatives are applied. Accordingly, these biorefinery-integrated innovations are not only conducive to the enhanced sustainability of existing pulp mills but also adaptive in response to the change of paper consumption trend.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

This study quantifies elemental composition of rainwater and aerosol collected simultaneously during 2019 monsoon season from Kolkata, a megacity in Eastern India marred by air pollution to understand sources and estimate wet deposition flux. Elemental composition (Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) of rainwater was measured in ICP MS along with pH, conductivity, chloride (Cl−), nitrate (NO3−) and sulphate (SO42−) ions. Trace metal composition of PM10 collected in between rain events were also analysed to understand anthropogenic sources and atmospheric leaching of metals. Crustal enrichment factors (EFs) identified anthropogenic sources for Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in PM10. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three anthropogenic sources, industrial emission, traffic emission and waste incineration in addition to the natural background from the crustal dust for the aerosol metals. Majority of rainwater samples had almost neutral pH (average 6.81 ± 0.74, 1SD), with a range of 5.4 to 8.0. In rainwater, Na and Cl− had marine origin and majority of SO42− had non-marine sources. Cu, Zn, Cd, V, Cr and Pb concentrations of rainwater follow the trend in PM10 most likely because part of the metals are derived from aerosol leaching. The EFs indicated that all the metals except Fe had anthropogenic origin in rainwater. The wet deposition fluxes were in the order of Ca > Na > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Mn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > V > Cd. Overall, the results show significant influence of anthropogenic sources on rainwater chemistry in addition to natural soil dust and marine aerosols. In spite of anthropogenic influence, the trace metal and anion concentrations in rainwater are well within the limits prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO), European Union (EU), USA and Indian Drinking Water Standards.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, environmental, Materials Science, physics, coastal engineering, earth sciences","Engineering (all), Environmental Science (all), Materials Science (all), Physics and Astronomy (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

First, ""guilty"" participants completed a mock crime, whereas ""innocent"" participants completed an innocent act. Next, some of the guilty participants were asked to imagine a false alibi that corresponded to the innocent act. Finally, all groups completed the aIAT. Across experiments, we varied the type of aIAT used and also compared the effectiveness of the false alibi countermeasure when only imagined once, versus when it was repeatedly imagined over a week-long period. The aIAT accurately detected the mock crime as true for guilty participants without a false alibi, but was consistently less able to detect the mock crime as true for guilty participants who had imagined a false alibi. The findings suggest that if guilty suspects fabricate an alibi, this may create a memory for the alibi that appears to be true based on the aIAT, which is problematic for its real-life applications in concealed memory detection.",psychology,Experimental and Cognitive Psychology

There are many researchers trying to study and create the mathematical model to improve the pairs trading strategy on various assets such as cointegration method, OLS, Kalmann filter, Machine learning, etc. The purpose of the models is to generate the precise signals from pairs of assets to maximize the return based on statistical arbitrage of pairs trading strategy. In this paper, Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is studied further. Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is easy, straightforward and profitable. However, There are many factors which influence the profitability of the strategy, causing the loss trades. We purpose a novel approach by using the machine learning algorithm to learn the historical trades of Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy in foreign exchage rates and to predict the profitability in the future trades. The pairs of the exchange rate are filtered by choosing only the pairs which generate the positive average return per trade from Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy in the past. The capability of the ML models is to classify whether the signals from Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is profitable or not before opening the positions. The powerful ML models, Artificial Neural network and XGBoost, are implemented in this study. Several factors which could influence the profitability such as correlation, volatility OLS beta are collected and used to train the model following the common step of ML training procedures such as features selection, Hyperparameter tuning and k-Fold cross validation to generate the capable models. Next, the performance of ANN and XGBoost is compared that which one performs better by the score matrix. The result shows that the performance of predicting the profitability is not significantly different. Both models mostly achieve 60% accuracy in In-sample data, but the accuracy in out-of-sample data is quite fluctuated. In other words, ML models are capable to classify the profitable signal from price behavior but may lack of consistency.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics","Management Science and Operations Research, Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Control and Optimization"
Probabilistic assessment of the daily intake of microelements and toxic elements via the consumption of rice with different degrees of polishing,"Hensawang S., Lee B.-T., Kim K.-W., Chanpiwat P.",2020-08-01,"Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Food Handling, Humans, Manganese, Nickel, Oryza, Seeds, Trace Elements, arsenic, brown rice, dietary reference intake, essential elements, intake assessment, white rice","BACKGROUND: The polishing process plays a key role in determining the beneficial quality of rice. However, the effects of polishing on human exposure to essential and toxic elements are not well reported. This study evaluated the effects of polishing on the levels of essential and toxic elements in rice grains and evaluated the status of their daily intake using probabilistic assessment. RESULTS: The levels of essential elements decreased as the degree of polishing increased. The highest reduction percentages of essential elements [24% of copper (Cu), 26% of nickel (Ni), and 52% of manganese (Mn)] were found after the first polishing step. The highest zinc (Zn) reduction (15%) was found after the fourth polishing step. For toxic elements, polishing significantly reduced the arsenic (As) concentration (15–31%) from that of the whole grains, of which 26% was removed after the first step. CONCLUSION: Polishing removed both essential and toxic elements from rice grains. The highest losses of Cu, Mn, Ni, and As were found after the first polishing step since these elements generally localize in the aleurone layers of rice grains. The last polishing step caused a significant Zn reduction from the grain. Polishing had no significant effect on the cadmium (Cd) concentration in grains. The consumption of all types of rice could not supply sufficient amounts of all microelements except Mn to maintain optimum health. Both As and Cd intake levels were lower than the benchmarks of toxic health effects. Thus, the potential health impacts of both of these elements in rice can be neglected. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","toxicology; clinical toxicology (by agent); food and food additives, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Biotechnology, Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Various preparation parameters were investigated and optimized to achieve the highest As(III) removal efficiency, including metal oxides type, supporting materials, preparation solvents, and number of loading cycles. The results from five imaging techniques (SEM-EDX, TEM, XRD, XANES, EXAFS) confirmed that amorphous ferric and manganese oxides nanoparticles were successfully dispersed throughout the matrix of the parent macroporous anion exchanger. The changes in oxidation state of the Mn oxides from +4 to +2 and + 2 to +4 were observed by XANES during As(III) removal and regeneration runs, respectively. The EXAFS was used to investigate the neighborhood atoms surrounding arsenic during As(III) removal by HA502P-Fe/Mn. The bond distance between As[sbnd]Fe and As[sbnd]Mn of HA502P-Fe/Mn are 3.35 and 2.94 Å, respectively, suggesting that As(III) was oxidized to As(V) and adsorbed on the surface of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxide nanoparticles by formation of inner-sphere complex. As(III) was oxidized by MnO2 nanoparticles under the absence of oxygen environment and only As(V) was observed after adsorption. The equilibrium As(III) sorption isotherms, effect of pH, competing ions, and NOM were also evaluated. Fixed-bed column experiments using NSF challenge water standard 53 (300 μg As(III)/L, pH 6.5) were carried out and found that the material can remove As(III) equivalent to 4300 bed volumes (BVs) compared with 2000 BVs using commercial arsenic selective material (Layne-RT). The exhausted material can be regenerated using 10 BVs of regeneration solution and 98% of adsorbed arsenic can be recovered.","chemistry, environmental, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Lower efficacy was observed in children with < 9 years old and dengue-naïve individuals. More importantly, risk of hospitalization and severe dengue was in-creased in the youngest vaccine recipients (2-5 years) compared to controls. Thus, the quest of a better vaccine candidate continues. There are two live-attenuated vaccine candidates currently testing in phase III trial including DENVax, developed by US CDC and Inviragen (now licensed to Takeda) and TV003/TV005, constructed by US NIAID.

Based on our formulated linear programming, our proposed SCCC model can provide green service resource allocation for data centers by maximizing the green energy usage. We evaluate the SCCC formulation with the green energy usage per each data center and overall of green energy usage in optimizing green metrics. Afterward, we compare our model with a well-known algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem i.e. round-robin. The model can be applied in the smart city whose data centers have different accessibility to on-site renewable energy sources. Besides, the proposed model can adjust parameters which are design criteria for green computing; the size of tasks, different power sources; and can be used as design guidelines for green computing in smart cities with more than one power source; grid, on-site renewable energy, battery energy storage.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering

Neurocognitive slopes were modeled to establish two subgroups [above (n = 145) and below average (n = 140) trajectories). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions (GBM) with five-fold cross validation were conducted to examine baseline (pre-ART) and longitudinal predictive features derived from demographic, HIV disease, immune, mental health, and physical health indices (i.e. complete blood count [CBC]).Results:The baseline GBM established a classifier of neurocognitive group designation with an average AUC of 79% built from HIV disease severity and immune markers. GBM analysis of longitudinal predictors with and without interactions improved the average AUC to 87 and 90%, respectively. Mental health problems and hematocrit levels also emerged as salient features in the longitudinal models, with novel interactions between mental health problems and both CD4+cell count and hematocrit levels. Average AUCs derived from each GBM model were higher than results obtained using logistic regression.Conclusion:Our findings support the feasibility of machine learning to identify children with pHIV at risk for suboptimal neurocognitive development. Results also suggest that interactions between HIV disease and mental health problems are early antecedents to neurocognitive difficulties in later childhood among youth with pHIV.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

Cellulose powder from eucalyptus pulp and bacterial cellulose (BC) was used as a microcellulose (MC) and nanocellulose (NC) reinforcing agent, respectively. NRLF, NRLF-MC, and NRLF-NC exhibited interconnected macroporous structures with a high porosity and a low-density. The composite foams contained pores with sizes in a range of 10–500 µm. As compared to MC, NC had a better dispersion inside the NRLF matrix and showed a higher adhesion to the NRLF matrix, resulting in a greater reinforcement. The most increased tensile strengths for MC and NC incorporated NRLF were found to be 0.43 MPa (1.4-fold increase) and 0.73 MPa (2.4-fold increase), respectively, by reinforcing NRLF with 5 phr MC and 15 phr NC, whereas the elongation at break was slightly reduced. Compression testing showed that the recovery percentage was improved to 34.9% (1.3-fold increase) by reinforcement with 15 phr NC, whereas no significant improvement in the recovery percentage was observed with MC. Both NRLF-MC and NRLF-NC presented hydrophobic surfaces and good thermal stability up to 300◦C. Due to their highly porous structure, after a prolong immersion in water, NRLF composites had high water uptake abilities. According to their properties, the composite foams could be further modified for use as green absorption or supporting materials.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Data from the Kīholo aquifer on the Kona Coast of Hawai‘i Island are used to numerically illustrate optimal joint management strategies and test the sensitivity of those strategies to variations in physical and behavioral parameter values. We find that for a plausible range of watershed management costs, protecting part of the recharge capture area is always optimal. Without watershed protection, maintaining a safe minimum standard growth rate for a GDE-dependent marine indicator species, reduces net present value non-trivially, but optimal investment in watershed conservation offsets that potential reduction by 75 %. In general, we find that optimal watershed management and groundwater pumping are most sensitive to changes in water demand growth and parameters that describe nearshore salinity.","water engineeringneering, Economics",Economics and Econometrics

PAT measurement was carried out using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a finger photoplethysmogram (PPG). PTT was measured by the time interval between the peak of two-channel PPG, one placing above the elbow and another is at the index finger. Four volunteers were asked to perform a running exercise to raise the blood pressure, which causes PAT and PTT variation. The results show that PAT is closely related to SBP from three out of four subjects, giving MAD accuracy level < 7 mmHg according to IEEE std 1708™-2014.

In fact, TiO2 support with different crystalline phases can result in differences of physico-chemical properties of the catalyst. Therefore, the present work reports on the catalytic be-haviors that were altered with different phases of TiO2 in catalytic ethanol dehydration to diethyl ether or ethylene as a major product. To prepare the catalysts, three different phases [anatase (A), rutile (R), and mixed phases (P25)] of TiO2 supports were impregnated with 10 wt% of tungsten (W). It was found that the W/TiO2-P25 catalyst revealed higher activity among other catalysts. At 300 °C, all catalysts can produce the diethyl ether yield of 24.1%, 22.8%, and 10.6% for W/TiO2-P25, W/TiO2-A, and W/TiO2-R catalysts, respectively. However, when the reaction temperature was increased to 400°C, ethylene is the major product. The W/TiO2-P25 and W/TiO2-A catalysts render the ethylene yield of 60.3% and 46.2%, respectively, whereas only 15.9% is obtained from W/TiO2-R catalyst. The most important pa-rameter influencing their catalytic properties appears to be the proper pore structure, acidity, and dis-tribution of W species.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology"

Methods: Motion analysis and the force plate system were used to analyze the STS movement in 77 healthy participants. All participants were asked to perform the STS movement using an adjustable bench with a self-selected pattern. Statistical analysis was done with respect to age (4–6, 7–9, 10–12, 18–25 years) and body height (1.00–1.20, 1.20–1.40, 1.40–1.60, 1.60–1.80 meters). Results: Children aged 4–6 years (or 1.0–1.20 m height) took less time to accomplish STS movement than adults (or 1.60–1.80 m height). Children aged 4–9 years performed STS movement by using more trunk and hip flexion and anterior pelvic tilt, but less knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion than children aged 10–12 years and adults. At the final standing position, children aged 4–12 years exhibited more knee extension and more ankle plantar flexion than adults. In addition, children aged 4–12 years had more peak trunk-pelvic extension and less peak knee extension moments than adults. Significance: Different strategies to achieve the STS task were found among children aged 4–12 years in terms of total movement time, joint angle, and joint moments. Adult-like kinematic and kinetic STS patterns were not seen in children up to 12 years old.","biochemistryistry, medical","Biophysics, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Rehabilitation"
Two Flavonoid-based compounds from murraya paniculata as novel human carbonic anhydrase isozyme II inhibitors detected by a resazurin yeast-based assay,"Sangkaew A., Samritsakulchai N., Sanachai K., Rungrotmongkol T., Chavasiri W., Yompakdee C.",2020-01-01,"Carbonic Anhydrase II, Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors, Catalytic Domain, Esterases, Flavonoids, Humans, Inhibitory Concentration 50, Molecular Docking Simulation, Molecular Structure, Murraya, Oxazines, Plant Extracts, Plant Leaves, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Xanthenes, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, Flavonoid, Glaucoma, Human carbonic anhydrase isozyme II (hCAII), Murraya paniculata, Yeast-based assay","Human carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozyme II has been used as protein target for disorder treatment including glaucoma. Current clinically used sulfonamide-based CA inhibitors can induce side effects, and so alternatives are required. This study aimed to investigate a natural CA inhibitor from Murraya paniculata. The previously developed yeast-based assay was used to screen 14 compounds isolated from M. paniculata and identified by NMR analysis for anti-human CA isozyme II (hCAII) activity. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was also tested using the same yeast-based assay but in a different cultivation condition. Two flavonoid candidate compounds, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3', 4', 5'- heptamethoxyflavone (4) and 3,5, 7, 8, 3', 4', 5'-heptamethoxyflavone (9), showed potent inhibitory activity against hCAII with a minimal effective concentration of 10.8 and 21.5 μM, respectively, while they both exhibited no cytotoxic effect, even at the highest concentration tested (170 μM). The results from an in vitro esterase assay of the two candidates confirmed their hCAII inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.0 and 34.3 μM, respectively. To investigate the potential inhibition mechanism of compound 4, in silico molecular docking was performed using the FlexX and SwissDock software. This revealed that compound 4 coordinated with the Zn2+ ion in the hCAII active site through its methoxy oxygen at a distance of 1.60 Å (FlexX) or 2.29 Å (SwissDock). The interaction energy of compound 4 with hCAII was -13.36 kcal/mol. Thus, compound 4 is a potent novel flavonoid-based hCAII inhibitor and may be useful for further anti-CAII design and development.","biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
Semantic labeling in remote sensing corpora using feature fusion-based enhanced global convolutional network with high-resolution representations and depthwise atrous convolution,"Panboonyuen T., Jitkajornwanich K., Lawawirojwong S., Srestasathiern P., Vateekul P.",2020-04-01,"Back-bone network, Convolutional networks, Gradient orientations, Low-level features, Route optimization, Segmentation models, Semantic labeling, Semantic segmentation, Convolutional neural network, Deep learning, Depthwise atrous convolution, Feature fusion, Global convolution network, High-resolution representations, ISPRS vaihingen, Landsat-8","One of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing is the semantic segmentation on the aerial and satellite images. It plays a vital role in applications, such as agriculture planning, map updates, route optimization, and navigation. The state-of-the-art model is the Enhanced Global Convolutional Network (GCN152-TL-A) from our previous work. It composes two main components: (i) the backbone network to extract features and (ii) the segmentation network to annotate labels. However, the accuracy can be further improved, since the deep learning network is not designed for recovering low-level features (e.g., river, low vegetation). In this paper, we aim to improve the semantic segmentation network in three aspects, designed explicitly for the remotely sensed domain. First, we propose to employ a modern backbone network called ""High-Resolution Representation (HR)"" to extract features with higher quality. It repeatedly fuses the representations generated by the high-to-low subnetworks with the restoration of the low-resolution representations to the same depth and level. Second, ""Feature Fusion (FF)"" is added to our network to capture low-level features (e.g., lines, dots, or gradient orientation). It fuses between the features from the backbone and the segmentation models, which helps to prevent the loss of these low-level features. Finally, ""Depthwise Atrous Convolution (DA)"" is introduced to refine the extracted features by using four multi-resolution layers in collaboration with a dilated convolution strategy. The experiment was conducted on three data sets: two private corpora from Landsat-8 satellite and one public benchmark from the ""ISPRS Vaihingen"" challenge. There are two baseline models: the Deep Encoder-Decoder Network (DCED) and our previous model. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all baselines. It is the winner in all data sets and exceeds more than 90% of F1: 0.9114, 0.9362, and 0.9111 in two Landsat-8 and ISPRS Vaihingen data sets, respectively. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy beyond 90% on almost all classes.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Natural rubber latex (NRL), abundantly found in South East Asia, and wood flour (WF) were added to recycled high-density polyethylene (reHDPE) forming a three-phase composite with the aim of improving the composite's mechanical resilience, where WF strengthens the composite. The composition of reHDPE was fixed at 80 wt. % and the two fillers were varied to observe the effects of fillers on the mechanical properties, specifically impact resistance. The addition of only 5 wt.% NRL (WF15 NRL5) raises the impact resistance up to 100 % with respect to the composite with only 20 wt.% wood flour. The composition with 5 wt.% WF and 15 wt.% NRL (WF5 NRL15) exhibited the highest impact resistance of 483 J/m and the best processing conditions due to the dispersion of NRL in the polymer matrix. The flexible properties were improved in the NRL-dominated composition. Additionally, higher NRL content increases the decomposition temperature, thus allowing tunable adjustments to the compositions for practical applications. Processing a three-phase reHDPE/WF/NRL composite showed favorable results towards low-cost products from recycled raw materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"
Phylogeography of montane dragons could shed light on the history of forests and diversification processes on Sumatra,"Shaney K.J., Maldonado J., Smart U., Thammachoti P., Fujita M., Hamidy A., Kurniawan N., Harvey M.B., Smith E.N.",2020-08-01,"Animals, Biodiversity, Forests, Gene Flow, Genome, Mitochondrial, Indonesia, Lizards, Phylogeny, Phylogeography, Biogeography, Competition, Endemic, Extinction, Pleistocene forest, Sundaland","Biogeographical evidence, both, for and against the “regional endemism paradigm” hypothesis has been uncovered across the Greater Sunda Region (Sundaland) of Southeast Asia. Additionally, there are competing hypotheses regarding how Pleistocene forests may have impacted biological patterns and processes in Sumatra. Using montane agamid lizards from Sumatra, we derived and analyzed a phylogenetic dataset, genetic divergence estimates, and contemporary distributional patterns among species. We tested whether (1) Sumatra's highland Draconinae diversification fits the regional endemism paradigm hypothesis and (2) Draconinae phylogeography provides biological evidence for Pleistocene forest extent at various points in history. Our results suggest in situ diversification was the main driver behind montane Draconinae lizard diversification in Sumatra, rejecting the “regional endemism paradigm”. Contemporary distribution of endemic species and their genetic relationships may potentially provide biological evidence for determining more precise elevational lower limits of montane forests during the Pleistocene epoch. Our data suggests montane forests did not retreat more than 700–750 m during glacial maxima because lower retreating forests would have become interconnected, allowing for widespread dispersal, exchange of gene flow and sympatric distributions contemporarily. To the contrary, our divergence estimates show that cloud forest dragons have been isolated for millions of years, suggesting there may have been a continuous disconnect between some areas, predating the Pleistocene. There may also be other ecological and evolutionary factors that impacted Draconinae distributions, such as competition, making this an excellent system for testing questions regarding montane biogeography. Additionally, we provide the first phylogeny for a wide range of Sundaland agamid species and identify some biogeographic pressures that may have triggered montane Draconinae diversification in Sumatra.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

Twelve children with SDCP were tested with three conditions of STS task: low chair with horizontal seat (control), low chair with anterior seat inclination (AiC), and high chair with horizontal seat (HiC) conditions. A 3D motion analysis system and two force plates were used to collect and analyze the movement time, mechanical work, kinematics, and kinetics. The results showed that in the AiC and HiC conditions, movement time and mechanical work during STS were significantly reduced when compared with the control condition. In addition, in the AiC condition, trunk alignment at the beginning of the STS task improved and the range of pelvis movement reduced, whereas in the HiC condition, the range of movement of hip, knee, and ankle joint and maximum hip and knee extension moment were reduced in children with SDCP when compared with the control condition. These results suggest that chair height and anterior seat inclination may have a positive effect on STS ability in children with SDCP.

A pre-acclimated Biocord biofilter, with an initial nitrification rate of 17.1 ± 12.4 mg total ammonia nitrogen-N/m2/d was applied in a marine whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture tank. Throughout the experiment, the aerobic nitrification activity of the biofilter was sufficient to control the ammonia and nitrite levels below 0.2 mg-N/L with an accumulation of nitrate up to 50 mg-N/L. The remaining nitrate was successfully removed after shrimp harvest with the same biofilter through anoxic denitrification in conjunction with a methanol supplement at a chemical oxygen demand: nitrate-N ratio of 5:1. With complete nitrogen removal, the water was re-aerated and the next crop of shrimp culture was initiated. In this study, a two-crop shrimp cultivation was performed in sequence in the same tank without water exchange. The microbial diversity was monitored using high-throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, which demonstrated that Proteobacteria (45.3 %), Chloroflexi (18.4 %), and Bacteroidetes (17.1 %) were the most abundant phyla. With an emphasis on nitrogen removal, the family Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae were the dominant nitrifying bacteria during the aerobic nitrification, while a high relative abundance of the Methylophaga and Methylotenera genera was observed under the anoxic condition.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental exploitation; aquaculture and fisheries, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Aquatic Science

Each year nearly 85,000 tons of eggshells, one of wastes overlooked generated by both food industries and households, are left to be disposed of mostly by landfilling. As it is well known that eggshells contain mainly CaCO3, thus the objective of this work aimed to recycle eggshells and use them as a substitution of CaCO3 from limestone. Eggshells were treated and tested for optimum condition such as heating time and temperature to obtain high purity CaCO3 suitable for industrial applications. In this study, eggshells were used as flux for copper sludge smelting comparing with commercial-grade CaCO3. It was found that coarse crushed eggshells gave the best condition for calcination due to the low packing density allowing high air circulation sufficient for burning off organic substances compared with fine crushed ones. By heating at 500̊C for 3 hours, 98-99 wt% of CaCO3 were obtained. In the copper sludge smelting experiment, eggshells treated under different conditions were tested against commercial-grade samples. Eggshells calcined at 500̊C and commercial-grade samples produced similar results of copper recovery from the sludge around 91.5 wt%. However, air-dry eggshells without calcination comprising 94 wt% CaCO3 provided higher copper recovery accounted for 97.6 wt% due to carbon presence in the organic matter acting as a reducing agent converting copper oxides to copper.","fluidex; related topics, environmental",Environmental Science (all)

The increases in the dynorphin/KOR system and β-endorphin/MOR system are significantly intercorrelated and are both strongly associated with increased IL-6 and IL-10 levels. Dynorphin, β-endorphin, KOR and both cytokines showed a good diagnostic performance for MDD versus controls with a bootstrapped (n = 2000) area under the receiver operating curve of 0.972. The dynorphin/KOR system is significantly decreased in depression with comorbid nicotine dependence.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that, in MDD, immune activation is associated with a simultaneous activation of dynorphin/KOR and β-endorphin/MOR signaling and that these opioid systems may participate in the pathophysiology of depression by (a) exerting immune-regulatory activities attenuating the primary immune response and (b) modulating reward responses and mood as well as emotional and behavioural responses to stress.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Recent work has employed deep learning techniques to learn user and item representations from reviews, which are then used to predict ratings. Such representations are usually learned by considering every word in previous reviews, including words that are irrelevant to user preferences or item features. Some approaches try to identify and extract significant words from reviews based on a predefined list of contexts, where contexts such as the season or weather could have strong influences on user decisions about items, and which are more relevant to their preferences or sought-after features. Specifying optimal values for contexts, however, is not a trivial task and the values are mostly restricted to a single word format. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised method for extracting contexts from reviews, which are then utilized to construct user and item representations. To this end, we adopt a region embedding technique to automatically extract a context as any word in a text region that influences patterns of rating distributions in reviews. Instead of considering every word in all previous reviews, our user and item representations are dynamically constructed based on different relevance levels among the extracted contexts from a particular review by applying our interaction and attention modules. Experiments demonstrated that utilizing our representations for rating prediction could outperform existing state-of-the-art context-aware and review-based recommendation techniques.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Water and sludge sampling was performed at the inlet and outlet of primary and secondary treatment units. The results indicate that the average MPs removal efficiency of the WWTPs was ca. 84%, with the aeration tank as the main removal unit by transferring MPs from the water phase to sludge. Primary treatment comprising of screening and grit chambers could not remove MPs effectively. Most of the MPs observed in the WWTPs were fibers (32–57%), mostly made of polyester, polyethylene, polyacrylate, and polypropylene. From these results, it is suggested to implement tertiary treatment options to improve MPs removal efficiency in WWTPs, and to apply post-treatment to the WWTPs’ raw sludge to prevent the MPs’ release into the environment when the sludge is applied to agricultural land.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

R&D investment that enhances IT firm survival,Patrakosol B.,2020-01-01,"Advanced researches, Innovation process, IT firms, IT industry, Risky investments, Value creation, Competitive risk mitigation, IT industry, R&D investment","IT industry is a research-intensive industry. IT firms focus on advanced research activities to stay relevant. Their survival depends on value creations from innovations based on the research. Source of fund to these innovation-related activities are commonly expressed in terms of R&D investment. However, this investment is not the direct indicator of innovation outcome, which impacts firm's survival. This is the gap between R&D investment and survivability of the firm. To narrow the gap, innovation process and value creation have been focuses of firm's innovation literature. The literature has narrowed the gap, but uncertainty still largely exists. Both researchers and practitioners often classified R&D investment as a risky investment. This study continues this line of conversation and offers empirical evidence suggesting that R&D investment could be risk mitigator rather than risk enhancer. Data of 2,087 firm-years in IT industry revealed that successful IT firms may invest in R&D to mitigate innovation-related competitive risks. When risk is under control, survivability of the firm increases. IT firm should, therefore, prioritize R&D investment for innovations and products that mitigate competitive risks. This insight is particularly relevant to post CoVID-19 pandemic world because the survival of IT firms depends on how they perceive risks associated with the new-normal world and how they innovate to mitigate those risks.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science","Business, Management and Accounting (all), Computer Science (all)"

The primary screening method is based on cytology in all countries except for India and Indonesia. In India and Indonesia, visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) is mainly used as a primary screening method, and a “see and treat” strategy is applied to women with a positive VIA result. The starting age of NCSP ranges from 18 years in China to 30 years in Thailand. The screening interval is 2 years in all countries except for China and Indonesia, in which it is 3 years. Uptake rates of NCSP vary from 5.0%–59.7%. Many women in low-and middle-income countries still do not participate in NCSP. To improve uptake rates and thereby prevent more cases of cervical cancer, Asian countries should continue to promote NCSP to the public using various approaches.",medical,"Oncology, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

However, the use of hole transport materials (HTMs) with hygroscopic dopants, which cause the inevitable instability of device performance, has hampered commercialization. Herein, a dopant-free polymeric HTM with functional aromatic rings was used to optimize the HTM/perovskite interface and employed in a planar n-i-p configuration. Poly(1,4-(2,5-bis((2-butyloctyloxy)phenylene)-2,7-(5,5,10,10-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-5,10-dihydro-s-indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene)) (IDTB) co-polymer constructed with indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and bis(alkyloxy)benzene units adopts an S⋅⋅⋅O intramolecular bond linked ladder-like planar conjugated polymer backbone. Without any dopant, the hole mobility of IDTB is in the same order of magnitude as a doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Also, the hydrophobic nature of IDTB facilitated the long-term stability of the perovskite underneath. The unencapsulated PSC devices made of IDTB-based HTM achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.38 % with a high moisture stability, retaining above 80 % of initial power conversion efficiency at 65 % relative humidity for more than 10 days.

This study aims to investigate characteristics of reversible and irreversible fouling of the submerged polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) MBR for treating eucalyptus P&P wastewater. Six batches of MBR experiments with different mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations were performed. The membrane cleaning protocol included three-steps: backwashing with DI water and subsequently NaOH solution, and then soaking with NaOCl solution, for which achieved 54.6?»±?»11 %, 76.6?»±?»10 % and 97.8?»±?»2 % of flux recovery, respectively. Formation of a cake layer comprised of organic substance and soluble microbial products (SMPs), mostly polysaccharides and proteins, was the main contributor to flux decline of the MBR. Concentration of proteins in the irreversible foulant was found to be positively correlated with degree of membrane fouling. Using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analysis revealed that, during MBR treatment, protein-like substances in the permeate water significantly decreased, simultaneously with the increase in relative proportions of humic-like and fulvic-like substances. Further analysis on the irreversible foulants showed that protein-like substances, including tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like substances, were disproportionately more important to membrane fouling than humic-like substances relative to their respective concentration in raw P&P wastewater.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Although several dural substitutes have been developed, their manufacturing processes are complicated and costly and that many of them have been implicated in causing postoperative complications. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of new bilayer ORC/PCL composites in a rabbit model. Methods: Two formulations of bilayer oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)/poly ε-caprolactone (PCL) knitted fabric-reinforced composites and an autologous graft (pericranium) were employed for dural closure in forty-five male rabbits. Systemic reaction and the local reaction of the samples were assessed and compared at one-, three- and six-months post-implantation by blood chemistry and gross, and microscopic assessment using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome stains. Results: No signs of CSF leakage or systemic infection were seen for all samples. All samples demonstrated minimal adhesion to adjacent tissues. The degree of host fibrous connective tissue ingrowth into both composites was comparable to that of the autologous group, but bone formation and osteoclast activities were significantly greater. Both composites progressively degraded over times and the residual thickness of the nonporous layer was 50% of the initial thickness at six months post-implantation. Discussion: Bilayer ORC/PCL composites were successfully employed for dural closure in the rabbit model. They were biocompatible and could support dural regeneration comparable to that of the autologous group, but induced greater osteogenesis.","genergyal, neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

In this study, α-Ti materials with superior tensile strength and good ductility were fabricated via additive manufacturing (AM). To improve the mechanical properties, core-shell structured Ti-(N) powder was used to introduce nitrogen atoms into selective laser melting (SLM) fabricated Ti materials. The microstructural analysis of as-fabricated Ti materials revealed an α microstructure with various grain morphologies such as irregular/massive grains, equiaxed grains, and refined acicular martensite grains (α՛) when different energy densities (E) from 83 J/mm3 to 278 J/mm3 were applied. Furthermore, we observed that grain refinement occurred with increasing solute nitrogen atoms. The mechanical properties were evaluated based on interrelated aspects, including nitrogen content and energy density, by changing the scanning parameters. Our results showed that as the nitrogen content in the as-fabricated Ti materials increased, a significant improvement in tensile strength and hardness was observed. The yield strength (σys) and ultimate tensile strength (σUTS) increased up to 1072 MPa and 1126 MPa, respectively, when the nitrogen content was approximately 0.5 wt.%, which was approximately three times that of SLM-processed pure Ti (∼0.01 mass% N). The increment in yield strength was further discussed mainly in terms of solid solution strengthening using the Labusch model and grain refinement strengthening using the Hall-Petch equation. This calculation raises the ability to quickly predict the yield strength of Ti materials with nitrogen solid solution produced by selective laser melting.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science (all), Engineering (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

These constructs provide an insight on the phenome of schizophrenia and show how pathway-phenotypes mediate the effects of genome X environmentome interactions on the symptoma-tology/phenomenology of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge how to construct pathway-phenotypes using Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA). This paper aims to provide a step-by-step utilization guide for the construction of pathway-phenotypes that reflect aberrations in the neuroimmune-brain circuit axis (NIBCA) in deficit schizophrenia. This NIBCA index is constructed using immune biomarkers (CCL-2, CCL-11, IL-1β, sIL-1RA, TNF-α, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) and neurocognitive tests (Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia) predicting overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS) in 120 deficit SCZ and 54 healthy participants. Using SmartPLS path analysis, a latent vector is extracted from those biomarkers and cognitive tests, which shows good construct reliability (Cronbach alpha and composite reliability) and repli-cability and which is reflectively measured through its NIBCA manifestations. This NIBCA pathway-phenotype explains 75.0% of the variance in PHEMN (psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative) symptoms. Using SIMCA, we constructed a NIBCA pathway-class that defines deficit schizophrenia as a qualitatively distinct nosological entity, which allows patients with deficit schizophrenia to be authenticated as belonging to the deficit schizophrenia class. In conclusion, our nomothetic approach to develop a nomological network combining neuro-immune and neurocognitive phenome markers to predict OSOS and cross-validate a diagnostic class generated replicable models reflecting the key phe-nome of the illness, which may mediate the effects of genome X environmentome interactions on the final outcome phenome features, namely symptomatology and phenomenology.",pharmacology,Drug Discovery

Effects of Heat Treatment on Mechanical Properties of Jute Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites for Concrete Confinement,"Jirawattanasomkul T., Likitlersuang S., Wuttiwannasak N., Ueda T., Zhang D., Voravutvityaruk T.",2020-12-01,"Confined compressive strengths, Effect of heat treatments, Effects of heat treatment, Fiber reinforced polymer composites, Fiber reinforced polymers, Heat treatment conditions, Natural cellulose fibers, Natural fiber reinforced, Compressive strength, Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), Heat treatment, Natural fiber","Some natural fibers such as jute which have high tensile strength can be applied in natural fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Natural cellulose fibers are hydrophilic, resulting in lower reinforcement performance. Heat treatment can reduce water content in natural fibers and possibly improve the properties of natural FRP in terms of enhancing fiber and polymer composite action. This paper presents an improvement of jute fiber-reinforced polymer (JFRP) composites by heat treatment. The heat treatment conditions (i.e., temperature and duration) were considered. Coupons of heated JFRPs were tested to investigate their tensile properties. The application of JFRP on confinement was investigated by compression tests on concrete cylinders with JFRP wrapping. The experimental results indicated that a suitable heat treatment condition of 80°C for 24 h can significantly increase the tensile strength of JFRP coupons and the compressive strength of JFRP-confined concrete. The testing results of concrete confinement can be used to validate the existing predicting equations for confined compressive strength. In addition, a new equation was proposed for the effect of heat treatment of JFRP.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"
The influence of soaking time on photocatalytic performance of g-c3n4 under visible light irradiation,"Narkbuakaew T., Sujaridworakun P.",2020-01-01,"Chemical composition analysis, Crystallographic information, Dye adsorption, Muffle furnaces, Photocatalytic performance, Rhodamine B dye, Visible light responsive, Visible-light irradiation, Calcination, G-C3N4, Photocatalyst, Soaking time, Visible light","In this research, visible-light responsive g-C3N4, photocatalyst was achieved through the simple calcination of urea at 600 °C by using the muffle furnace. The effects of calcination soaking time on preparation of high performance g-C3N4 were studied at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. The g-C3N4 prepared at various soaking times were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystallographic information and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for chemical composition analysis. Further, in the case of morphology and surface area of prepared photocatalysts, the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) were applied. The results demonstrated that g-C3N4 with tri-s-triazine based units could be synthesized by calcination of urea at 600 °C and soaking for 1-4 h, as evidently confirmed by XRD and FTIR. For photocatalytic performance in rhodamine B dye degradation under visible light irradiation of achieved g-C3N4 tended to increase as soaking time increased. Moreover, the dye adsorption ability of prepared photocatalysts was obviously developed upon increase of soaking times. Herein, the highest photocatalytic performance was obtained from sample which was soaked at 4 h.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: We measured serum zinc and copper, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, interferon-γ, and transforming growth factor-β1 in 40 controls and 133 depressed patients. The clinical efficacy of the treatment was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and 8 weeks later. Results: We found significantly reduced serum zinc and copper in association with upregulation of all cytokines, indicating activation of the immune-inflammatory responses system (IRS) and the compensatory immune regulatory system (CIRS). Treatment with sertraline significantly increased zinc and decreased copper. During treatment, there was a significant inverse association between serum zinc and immune activation. The improvement in the BDI-II during treatment was significantly associated with increments in serum zinc coupled with attenuation of the IRS/CIRS. Conclusions: Lower zinc is a hallmark of depression, while increments in serum zinc and attenuation of the immune-inflammatory response during treatment appear to play a role in the clinical efficacy of sertraline.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

This study aimed to investigate relationships of serum adiponectin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), interleukin (IL)-6, and physical performance in knee OA patients. A total of 175 knee OA patients and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Serum adiponectin, 25(OH)D, IL-6, biochemical markers, knee pain and functional scores, muscle strength, physical performance, metabolic parameters, and body composition were evaluated. Serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher in knee OA patients than that in controls, while its serum levels were significantly decreased in obese patients, especially those with sarcopenia. Furthermore, there were independent relationships of serum adiponectin with body composition parameters, knee pain scores, physical function tests, and metabolic parameters in knee OA patients. Besides, serum adiponectin levels were positively associated with 25(OH)D levels, and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels in knee OA. Additionally, low serum adiponectin could be used to distinguish knee OA patients with sarcopenic obesity from those without sarcopenic obesity. Circulating adiponectin levels may serve as a possible surrogate biomarker for exacerbated physical function in knee OA patients—particularly sarcopenic obesity.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

However, cytology in self-sampled specimen cannot be used as a triage test. Therefore, other methods for triage should be considered. CyclinA1 (CCNA1) promoter methylation has strong association with cervical precancerous and cancerous lesion. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of CCNA1 and self-sampled specimen for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions or worse (CIN2+). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted. Women with abnormal cytology or positive for high risk HPV (hrHPV) indicated for colposcopic examination were enrolled. Self-collected sampling for hrHPV DNA (SS-HPV) and CCNA1 were performed. hrHPV DNA testing was done by Cobas 4800 method. CCNA1 promoter methylation was detected by CCNA1 duplex methylation specific PCR. Histopathologic result as CIN2+ obtaining from colposcopic directed biopsy or excisional procedure was considered as positive a gold standard. The results of hrHPV and CCNA1 were reported as positive or negative. Sensitivity specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of SS-HPV and CCNA1 were calculated by comparing the results with the gold standard. RESULTS: Two hundreds and eighty women were recruited. High-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancer (CIN2+) were diagnosed in 21.8% (61 cases) of the patients. The most common type of hrHPV was non 16, 18 subtype, followed by HPV16 and 18. CCNA1 was positive in 13 patients out of whom, twelve were CIN2+. Sensitivity of CCNA1 was 19.7 % and its specificity and accuracy were 99.5% and 82.14%, respectively. The sensitivity of SS-HPV was 70.5%, and its specificity and accuracy were 39.2% and 43.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to high specificity and positive predictive value of CCNA1, it can be used as alarming sign of having high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions, especially in patient who has positive hrHPV DNA test based on self-collected sampling.<br />.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

The tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) device structure, located inside the magnetic read-write head of a hard drive, is the most complex and sensitive component, which contains sensitive components, such as a touchdown sensor and a near-field transducer. The laser used in the writing process might cause degradation of magnetic head components. The effects of laser irradiation on the TMR device have been investigated using a quasi-static test measurement to observe the characteristic changes of the magnetic response sensitivity function. The results showed only the amplitude degradation, as the resistance and asymmetry parameters were unchanged. The nanostructure of the degradation TMR devices was investigated by using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry. It was found that the manganese depletion in the antiferromagnetic layer causes a nonactive zone due to the poor magnetic coupling pinning function and reduces the functioning of the HDD. The ratio of active and nonactive zone elements has a strong correlation to the amplitude degradation of individual TMR devices. The TMR structure with shorter strip height can have a higher risk of device degradation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials"

Most patients have mild and transient hepatitis. Acute liver failure (ALF) in dengue infection is rare but results in an extremely poor prognosis. AIM To identify prognostic predictors of ALF and death in patients with dengue-induced severe hepatitis (DISH). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 2311 serologically confirmed adolescent and adult dengue patients who were hospitalized during a 12-year study period (between 2007 and 2019) at the university hospital of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Patients with DISH [n = 134 (5.80%)], defined as a baseline transaminase > 10 times the normal reference cut-off level, and DISH with subsequent ALF as defined by the American Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases 2011 criteria [n = 17 (0.74%)], were included. Predictors of ALF and in-hospital death were identified using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 151 dengue-infected patients with severe liver injury or ALF, 51% were female, with a mean age of 27.9 ± 14.5 years. Capillary leakage syndrome (CLS) occurred in 68.2% (n = 103) of DISH and 100% of ALF patients. The mortality rate was low in DISH patients (0.8%) but was remarkably high if ALF developed (58.8%). In univariate analysis, age, sex, hematocrit, white blood count, atypical lymphocyte count, platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), bilirubin, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, creatinine, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, presence of liver comorbidity and presence of CLS were identified as potential prognostic parameters for ALF or death. In multivariate analysis, the MELD score remained the only predictor of ALF with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.5; P = < 0.001]. An initial MELD score ≥ 15 was associated with ALF from DISH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.91, 88.2% sensitivity and 87.3% specificity. Regarding mortality prediction, the deterioration of liver function to ALF was the most significant factor related to death in DISH patients (aOR 108.5, 95%CI: 5.5-2145.4, P = 0.002). Other independent factors associated with death included baseline INR (aOR 10.4, 95%CI: 2.6-40.5, P = 0.001). An INR ≥ 1.5 predicted death from DISH with an AUROC of 0.83 (81.8% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity). CONCLUSION The MELD score is the best predictor of ALF in DISH patients, a complication from dengue that is associated with high mortality. The presence of ALF and the baseline INR level are independent markers of death in DISH patients.",medical,Gastroenterology

For this purpose, a Conductor-Like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) was employed to study the molecular structures of the ILs, and therefore, predict their extraction potential. The capacity values of 22 anions combined with 16 cations based ILs, were investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of ILs in the extraction of DHA. It was found that among the investigated ILs, a combination of tetramethyl ammonium with SO4 or Cl was the best fit for DHA extraction, followed by pyrrolidinium, imidazolium, pyridinium and piperidinium. Furthermore, it was observed that the extraction capacity and the selectivity of ILs decreased with an increase in alkyl chain length; therefore, ethyl chain-ILs, with the shortest chain lengths, were found to be most suitable for DHA extraction. The predicted results were validated through the experimentally calculated extraction yield of a DHA compound from Nannochloropsis sp. Microalgae. Five selected ILs, namely [EMIM][Cl], [BMIM][Cl], [TMAm][Cl], [EMPyr][Br] and [EMPyrro][Br], were selected from COSMO-RS for empirical extraction purposes, and the validation results pinpointed the good prediction capabilities of COSMO-RS.

Since the probiotic yogurt incorporated with the pigment of riceberry rice extract was previously developed, the present study was aimed to investigate the acute effect of riceberry rice yogurt consumption on postprandial glycemic response, antioxidant capacity, and subjective ratings in healthy adults. In a cross-over design, 19 healthy participants were randomized to consume 350 g of yogurt supplemented with 0.25% (w/w) riceberry rice extract or the control yogurt. Postprandial plasma glucose, antioxidant status, and subjective ratings were measured at fasting and intervals (0–3 h) after ingestion of yogurt. The primary outcome was glycemic response; the secondary outcomes were plasma antioxidant capacity. In comparison to the yogurt control, riceberry rice yogurt reduced plasma glucose concentration after 30 min of consumption. The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was significantly lower after riceberry rice yogurt load than after the control yogurt load. The consumption of riceberry yogurt caused an acute increase in plasma ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) from the baseline values after 60 min of 0.25 ± 0.06 mM FeSO4, 253.7 ± 35.5 mM Trolox equivalents, and 166.8 ± 28.9 mM Trolox equivalents, respectively. Furthermore, the iAUCs for FRAP, TEAC, ORAC, and protein thiol were higher in riceberry yogurt consumption compared with the control yogurt (1.6-, 1.6-, 2.9-, and 1.9-fold, respectively). A decrease in iAUC for plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was also observed in the riceberry yogurt group. However, consumption of riceberry rice yogurt and control yogurt showed similar subjective rating scores of hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and satiety. In conclusion, acute consumption of riceberry rice yogurt suppressed postprandial glucose level and improved plasma antioxidant capacity in healthy volunteers.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

In Thailand, FMD is endemic with 183 and 262 outbreaks occurring in the years 2015 and 2016, respectively. In this study, we aimed to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of FMD outbreaks among cattle in Chiang Mai and Lamphun provinces in the northern part of Thailand during the period of 2015-2016. A retrospective space-time scan statistic including a space-time permutation (STP) and the Poisson and Bernoulli models were applied in order to detect areas of high incidence of FMD. Results: Results have shown that 9 and 8 clusters were identified by the STP model in 2015 and 2016, respectively, whereas 1 and 3 clusters were identified by the Poisson model, and 3 and 4 clusters were detected when the Bernoulli model was applied for the same time period. In 2015, the most likely clusters were observed in Chiang Mai and these had a minimum radius of 1.49 km and a maximum radius of 20 km. Outbreaks were clustered in the period between the months of May and October of 2015. The most likely clusters in 2016 were observed in central Lamphun based on the STP model and in the eastern area of Chiang Mai by the Poisson and Bernoulli models. The cluster size of the STP model (8.51 km) was smaller than those of the Poisson and Bernoulli models (> 20 km). The cluster periods in 2016 were approximately 7 months, while 4 months and 1 month were identified by the Poisson, Bernoulli and STP models respectively. Conclusions: The application of three models provided more information for FMD outbreak epidemiology. The findings from this study suggest the use of three different space-time scan models for the investigation process of outbreaks along with the follow-up process to identify FMD outbreak clusters. Therefore, active prevention and control strategies should be implemented in the areas that are most susceptible to FMD outbreaks.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)

As part of ongoing vaccine evaluation, we aimed to compare the hepatitis B immunogenicity profiles of children who had received either the pentavalent (DTwP-HB-Hib) or the hexavalent (DTaP-HB-Hib-IPV) vaccine. Methods: Two groups of infants, whose mothers previously received the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), were randomly vaccinated with either pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age, following monovalent HB vaccine at birth. Blood samples were obtained at birth, one-month post-primary series immunization (mo 7), pre-booster (mo 18), one-month post-booster (mo 19), and six months post-booster (mo 24). The third group of infants, whose mothers did not receive Tdap, was vaccinated with DTwP-HB-Hib (EPI pentavalent group). Levels of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs were evaluated by means of an automated Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay. Results: Anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml were achieved in 99.2% (hexavalent group), 99.2% (pentavalent group), and 98.5% (EPI pentavalent group) of infants, after four-dose immunization (at 0, 2, 4, 6 months of age). One month after the additional dose given at 18 months of age, anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml were observed in 100% (hexavalent group), 99.2% (pentavalent group), and 93.8% (EPI pentavalent group) of infants. At 24 months of age, higher percentages of infants achieving anti-HBs levels ≥10 mIU/ml were found in the hexavalent group (98.3%) compared to the pentavalent group (86.5%). Conclusions: Both vaccines were effective in inducing anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/ml, and therefore either can be used as a single formula booster at 18 months of age to simplify vaccine administration under the Expanded Program on Immunization in Thailand.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Hypoglycemia can cause brain damage and increase risk of developmental delay. Nevertheless, the data regarding hypoglycemia prevention by oral sucrose are still limited. The present study aimed to investigate whether oral sucrose solution can prevent hypoglycemia in high-risk infants. Patients and Methods: Four hundred and twenty-five infants with high hypoglycemic risk were randomized into two groups (214 infants in the intervention and 211 infants in the control groups). The intervention group received one dose of 0.8 ml/kg of 24% oral sucrose solution followed by enteral feed and was compared to the control group receiving enteral feed alone. Glucose levels were evaluated by Dextrostrix. Results: There was no significant difference in antenatal and perinatal risk factors of neonatal hypoglycemia between groups. Glucose level on admission was 72.1±20.3 and 72.1±24.1 mg/dl in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Although no significant difference was recognized in terms of capillary blood glucose levels between groups, data analysis revealed that the glucose increase over time was significantly higher in the intervention group at 1 h (mean±SE=3.61±1.27 mg/dl; p<0.005), 3 h (mean±SE=7.95±1.57 mg/dl, p<0.001), and 6 h (mean±SE=6.31±1.62 mg/dl, p<0.001) in comparison to those of the control. No serious adverse event was observed in either group. Conclusion: A single dose of 24% sucrose solution enhanced the increase of glucose level at 1, 3 and 6 h. However, routine early feeding alone is not inferior to the addition of an oral sucrose solution.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology"

A Dual Approach in Direct Ink Writing of Thermally Cured Shape Memory Rubber Toughened Epoxy,"Chen Q., Sukmanee T., Rong L., Yang M., Ren J., Ekgasit S., Advincula R.",2020-12-11,"Coating application, Fracture strain, Polybutadiene rubbers, Printing system, Rubber-toughened, Shape memory behavior, Thermomechanical properties, Thixotropic fluids, 3D printing, shape memory, thixotropic rheology, tough epoxy, tunable properties","Bisphenol A-based epoxies are much used in a wide range of composite and coating applications due to their excellent thermomechanical properties. However, their 3D printability remains a challenge with most reported materials suffering from high brittleness and low toughness. Here, we have described especially modified epoxy resins that enable 3D printing with both fast and slow curing rates. These materials exhibit greatly enhanced toughness, tunable thermomechanical properties, and excellent shape memory behavior. Two different printing systems, including a two-part static mixing printhead and a single extrusion printhead, were developed for fast- and slow-curing epoxies, respectively. The rheology of inks in both systems has been modified into printable thixotropic fluids with the aid of silica nanoparticles and other additives. Epoxide-functionalized telechelic polybutadiene was added into the resins, which are then introduced inside the epoxy network after cross-linking. The addition of polybutadiene rubber significantly improves the toughness (over 135%), fracture strain (over 200%), and shape memory behavior. By adding different amounts of the rubber telechelic, thermomechanical properties, including modulus, elongation, and Tg of epoxy, can be well controlled in a wide range to satisfy different applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Process Chemistry and Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Materials and Methods: Infants ≤1,250 g birth weight (BW) were studied prospectively at two outpatient visits: 12-15 and 18-22 months corrected age (CA). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (BSID-III) were performed at 18-22 months CA. Results: In this pilot study, 51 preterm infants (gestational age 27.8 ± 2.6 weeks and BW 893 ± 204 g) were evaluated. While anthropometric z-scores were significantly lower at discharge compared with birth, z-scores returned to birth levels by 12-15 months CA (length and head circumference [HC]) and 18-22 months CA (weight). Body composition at 2 years of age was similar to term-matched controls. Inpatient growth was significantly correlated with bone density, lean mass (LM), and fat-free mass at 18-22 months CA. Increased mother's own milk (MOM) was significantly correlated with decreased fat mass indices. BSID-III showed that 0% of cognitive composite scores were <70. Conclusions: In addition to returning to BW, length, and HC z-scores by 2 years of age, body composition analysis revealed that increase in body size was appropriate as reflected by LM and bone density similar to matched term controls without an increase in fat mass. No child had severe cognitive developmental delay using a cutoff score of 70. Inpatient growth and increased receipt of MOM correlated with favorable growth and body composition outcomes. Positive outcomes as shown in this study to confirm postdischarge safety of an EHM diet during hospitalization.","Nursing, medical","Pediatrics, Health Policy, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternity and Midwifery"

Performance improvement of adaptive wavelet thresholding for speech enhancement using generalized Gaussian priors and frame-wise context modeling,"Bhattacharya P.C., Tangsangiumvisai N., Worapishet A.",2020-01-01,"Adaptive wavelet thresholding, Generalized Gaussian, Perceptual evaluation of speech qualities, Short time Fourier transforms, Speech enhancement algorithm, Statistical characteristics, Wavelet coefficients, Wavelet thresholding, Context modeling, Speech enhancement, Wavelet thresholding","This work aims at developing an adaptive wavelet thresholding algorithm for speech enhancement with significant performance improvement over other wavelet-based counterparts. This is accomplished through the formulation of the optimum threshold for noise reduction, based on the generalized Gaussian priors to fully characterize the statistics of speech and noise wavelet coefficients. In addition, through the frame-wise context modeling which enables tracking of the statistical characteristics of each individual coefficient on the frame-wise basis, the optimum threshold is accurate and adaptive at both the coefficient level and frame level. The frame-wise context model is formulated by virtue of the context subspace projection of the wavelet coefficients, with the context index employed as the invariant correspondence between successive frame parameters, thereby enabling the frame-wise tracking at the coefficient level. Simulation results show significant improvement over the wavelet-based speech enhancement algorithms in terms of the segmental signal-to-noise ratio improvement by as much as 226%, the perceptual evaluation of speech quality by 36%, the short-time objective intelligibility by 17.8% and the cepstral distance by 33.3%. When benchmarked with the well-established short-time-Fourier-transform-based counterparts, the proposed wavelet thresholding algorithm offers favorable and more robust performances, particularly under non-stationary noise conditions, with no adverse musical noise effect.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form αE(t)=a(1+e-c(t-{t0)-nas an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n = 1 and n\ne 1are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n\ne 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n = 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Mathematical Physics, Condensed Matter Physics"

The reaction conditions were optimized using response surface methodology based on a central composite design. Three following varia-bles were studied: methanol to OA molar ratios (2.5:1-7.5:1), reaction time (50-70 min) and catalyst loading (2-5 wt.%) to provide a statistical model with the coefficient of regression (R2) of 0.9407. Based on the model, the optimum OA conversion of 95.6% was predicted at 5.8:1 methanol to OA molar ratio, 60 min and 3.05 wt.% catalyst loading. The experimental validation indicated that the model gave a good prediction of OA conversion (2.8% error). Furthermore, the reaction was found to be reasonably described by the pseudo-first order kinetics. The dependency of the reaction rate constant on temperatures gave a value of the activation energy of 64 kJ/mol.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Two promising mesoporous acidic catalysts were synthesized using char as a support material. Two char samples were collected from either a dual-stage or a rising co-current biomass gasification plant. The catalysts produced from both gasification char samples were characterized for their physiochemical and morphological properties using N2 physorption measurement, total acidity evaluation through TPD-NH3, functional groups analysis by FT-IR, and morphology determination via FESEM. Results revealed that the dual-stage char-derived mesoporous catalyst (DSC-SO4) with higher specific surface area and acidic properties provided higher catalytic activity for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production from waste cooking oil (WCO) than the mesoporous catalyst obtained from char produced by rising co-current gasification (RCC-SO4). Furthermore, the effects of methanol/oil molar ratio (3:1-15:1), catalyst concentration (1-5 wt.% of oil), and reaction time (30-150 min) were studied while keeping the transesterification temperature constant at 65 °C. The optimal reaction conditions for the transesterification ofWCOwere 4 wt.% catalyst concentration, 12:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, and 90 min operating time. The optimized reaction conditions resulted in FAME conversions of 97% and 83% over DSC-SO4 and RCC-SO4 catalysts, respectively. The char-based catalysts show excellent reusability, since they could be reused six times without any modification.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The protective efficacy was evaluated upon challenge with highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV-2, either alone or in combination with PRRSV-1. Forty-two, castrated male, PRRSV-free pigs were randomly allocated into 7 groups of 6 pig each. IM/HPPRRSV2, IM/CoChallenge, ID/HPPRRSV2 and ID/CoChallenge groups were vaccinated IM or ID with PRRSV-1 MLV (UNISTRAIN® PRRS, Laboratorios Hipra S.A., Amer, Spain) in accordance to the manufacturer's directions. NV/HPPRRSV2 and NoVac/CoChallenge groups were nonvaccinated/challenged controls. NoVac/NoChallenge group was left as the control. Antibody response, IFN-γ-secreting cells (IFN-γ-SC) and IL-10 production were evaluated following vaccination. At 35 days post vaccination (DPV), all challenged groups were intranasally inoculated with HP-PRRSV-2, either alone or in combination with PRRSV-1. PRRSV viremia and lung lesion scores were evaluated following challenge. The results demonstrated that ID vaccinated pigs had significantly lower IL-10 levels and higher IFN-γ-SC than that of IM vaccinated pigs. Following challenge with HP-PRRSV-2 either alone or with PRRSV-1, PRRSV viremia and lung lesions, both macroscopically and microscopically, were significantly reduced in vaccinated pigs than that of nonvaccinated pigs, regardless to the route of vaccine administration. ID vaccinated pigs had significantly lower levels of PRRSV viremia and lung lesion scores than that of IM vaccinated pigs. The results of the study suggested that the administration of PRRSV-1 MLV, either IM or ID, provided partial protection against HP-PRRSV-2, either alone or when cochallenged with PRRSV-1, as demonstrated by the reduction in lung lesions and viremia. The ID route might represent an alternative to improve vaccine efficacy, as it resulted in lower IL-10 levels and higher IFN-γ-SC levels.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; animal vaccines, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Microbiology, Veterinary (all)"

Moreover, each customer request comprises of a pair of services - namely pickup and delivery - not necessarily be completed in the same wave. If the request had been picked, it must be also be delivered by the end of the day. We explored how numbers of daily dispatch waves affect major service performance metrics, including total rewards from serving customer orders and the overall service level on 20 randomly generated instances. We found that, by increasing the numbers of daily dispatch waves, all service performance metrics could be potentially improved as expected, with greater numbers of dispatched waves. However, having too frequent daily dispatch waves would not significantly improve such metrics due to limited operational interval, i.e. planning horizon. In contrast, the computational times required grow exponentially; and, thence, cautious trade-offs between the desired service performance and operational costs must be made. While our mathematical formulation is only preliminary for the practical WSDPD, with high level of uncertainty, it could be regarded as a prelude to the development of efficient heuristics and policies that will be explored in the next steps.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics","Management Science and Operations Research, Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that H7N9 AIV is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential. We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development.

To overcome their drawbacks, such as low peel strength and deformation, the performance improvement of the TPUs-HMAs has become a challenging issue. In this study, the enhancement properties of the TPUs-HMAs were achieved from the copolymerization of a soft-segment technique. Two types of polycarbonate diols (PCDs) were utilized for the TPU production as a co-diol of the soft segment. The properties and phase behaviour of the TPUs with various ratios of copolymerized soft segment were analysed. The compatibility between the different types of the PCDs is defined by the concentration of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the hard and soft phases and the dimensions of the hard domains. The homogeneous dispersion of the hard domains in the soft phase promotes better stress transfer enhancing the mechanical properties and adhesion properties. The peel strength is measured between the TPUs/stainless steel joint, in which the highest value is accomplished with the formulation of 60:40 wt% of copolymerized soft segment, which is associated with the superior mechanical strength and the optimum compatible properties of the soft segment.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, engineering, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Mechanics of Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Design Economic evaluation using a decision-analytical model. Setting Thailand. Participants Patients with refractory sJIA who were ≥2 years old. Methods The use of tocilizumab as an add-on therapy to standard treatment was compared with standard treatment alone. A simulated health state transition model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes from a societal perspective. Direct medical costs were collected from tertiary hospital databases while direct non-medical costs were derived from interviews. Health-related quality of life (QoL) was measured using the proxy version of three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Future costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The base case population was patients aged 9.41 years old at refractory disease onset. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in US dollar (USD). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate parameter uncertainty. The 5-year budget impact was estimated from a governmental perspective. Results The ICER of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was US$35 799 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with standard treatment alone, which was not cost-effective at the threshold of US$5128 per QALY gained. The estimated 5 years budget impact was approximately US$4.8 million. Conclusions The use of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was not cost-effective in the Thai context, which has limited data. However, there is currently no second-line treatment for refractory sJIA in the Thai National List of Essential Medicines; thus, patients must receive higher doses of standard treatment which can cause many side effects. In contrast, tocilizumab showed obvious efficacy in clinical trials in improving treatment response and QoL. Therefore, the price of tocilizumab should be negotiated to reduce the financial impact on the healthcare system.",medical,Medicine (all)

These levels were then compared using paired samples Mann-whitney test (U-test) with significance level at p &lt; 0.05. A total of 60 subjects from Daeng Yai Sub-district, Ban Mai Chaiyapot district were selected and divided into two groups, comprising 30 e-waste dismantling workers and 30 non-e-waste workers who live in villages not involved in e-waste dismantling. The results showed that the mean blood lead level of e-waste workers (6.61 ± 3.07 µg/dl) was significantly higher than that of non-e-waste workers (2.73 ± 0.49 µg/dl) with p &lt; 0.05, while the mean blood cadmium level of e-waste workers was slightly lower than that of non-e-waste workers with values of 1.00 ± 0.33 µg/l and 1.17 ± 0.39 µg/l, respectively. These results suggest that e-waste dismantling workers have a higher risk of lead exposure from e-waste dismantling activity and therefore workers should be recommended to use personal protective equipment during dismantling activities.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"

The surface of JFs was modified by three different surface treatments, namely, alkali treatment, combined alkali/stearic acid treatment and combined alkali/silane treatment. Surface modified JFs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The reinforcing effect of untreated and surface treated JFs in NR composites was comparatively evaluated in terms of cure, mechanical, morphological and thermal properties. Combined alkali/silane treated JFs filled NR composite showed considerably higher torque difference, tensile modulus, hardness and tensile strength as compared to either untreated or other surface treated JFs filled NR systems. A crosslink density measurement suggested effective rubber-fibers interaction in combined alkali/silane treated JFs filled NR composite. Morphological analysis confirmed the improvement in the interfacial bonding between NR matrix and JFs due to combined alkali/silane treatment allowing an effcient ""stress-transfer"" mechanism. As a whole, combined alkali/silane treatment was found to be most effcient surface treatment method to develop strong interfacial adhesion between NR matrix and JFs.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The extraction and defibrillation of nanometer-scale cellulose fibers from such waste using strong chemical solutions have been extensively investigated. However, the using of strong chemical solutions can cause adverse effects to the fibers as well as negatively affect the environment. Some evidence has shown that mechanical treatments, such as steam explosion and high-pressure homogenization, are environmentally friendly when compared with chemical treatment techniques. This work aimed to isolate the cellulose nanofibers from sugarcane bagasse waste using steam explosion pretreatment at various temperatures (195, 200, 205, and 210 °C) and durations (5, 10, and 15 min) before passing through a microfluidizer within 12 passes of 200 mL cellulose suspension. The mean separation analysis using Duncan's Multiple Range test showed that higher temperatures significantly improved the efficiency of non-cellulosic substances reduction, as evidenced by an increment of whiteness index (81.39–90.02), thermal degradation temperature (313.92–326.34 °C) and crystallinity index (74.27–81.42%). The obtained cellulose nanofibers exhibited very fine diameter within the range of 3–7 nm, had a high cellulose content (92.74 ± 0.14%) and a low density (0.8989 g/cm3).

It is a small kiln for charcoal, biochar and wood vinegar production. It consists of a 200 l oil drum covered with fiberglass and galvanized steel as an insulator. The heat distribution pipe with slots is installed in the middle part of the kiln. There are four exhaust chimneys for smoke ventilation and wood vinegar collection. The chimneys are covered with condensers for wood vinegar condensation. Two types of biomass for this experiment were tamarind wood and corncob. For tamarind wood, the drum kiln loaded about 40 kg of wood with moisture content of 20–24% using 10–19 kg of firewood. It took about 3.5–5 h to reach maximum temperature (300-430 °C), and cooled down within 3–5 h. In sum, therefore, it took about 8 h for the complete tamarind wood charcoal process. The products were 11–12 kg of tamarind wood charcoal and 12–13 kg of wood vinegar. There was no incompletely carbonized wood and ash. Properties of tamarind wood charcoal were tested following ASTM D7582–15 and ASTM D5865–10. Tamarind wood charcoal showed 5% moisture content, 20–21% volatile matters, 68.7–69.8% fixed carbon, 3.8–5.6% of ash and 30–31 MJ kg−1 heat value. The energy conversion efficiency of the drum kilns with heat distribution pipe was about 40–48%. For biochar production, the drum kiln contained about 20 kg of corncob with moisture content of 21–22%. The process used about 6 kg of firewood. It took about 2.5 h for heating up to 300 °C, and it cooled down within 2.5 h. The products consisted of 5 kg of corncob biochar and 9.4 kg of corncob vinegar. The SEM micrograph presented porous structure of the corncob biochar.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, sociology, energy, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Survival of shiga toxin–producing escherichia coli in various wild animal feces that may contaminate produce,"Topalcengiz Z., Jeamsripong S., Spanninger P.M., Persad A.K., Wang F., Buchanan R.L., Lejeune J., Kniel K.E., Jay-Russell M.T., Danyluk M.D.",2020-08-01,"Animals, Animals, Wild, Cattle, Deer, Escherichia coli Proteins, Feces, Florida, Ohio, Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli, Animal intrusion, O157 and non-O157, Persistence, Produce, Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli serotypes","Domestic and wild animal intrusions are identified as a food safety risk during fresh produce production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival of Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in cattle, feral pig, waterfowl, deer, and raccoon feces from sources in California, Delaware, Florida, and Ohio. Fecal samples were inoculated with a cocktail of rifampin-resistant STEC serotypes (O103, O104, O111, O145, and O157) (104 to 106 CFU/g of feces). Inoculated feces were held at ambient temperature. Populations of surviving cells were monitored throughout 1 year (364 days), with viable populations being enumerated by spread plating and enrichment when the bacteria were no longer detected by plating. Representative colonies were collected at various time intervals based on availability from different locations to determine the persistence of surviving STEC serotypes. Over the 364-day storage period, similar survival trends were observed for each type of animal feces from all states except for cattle and deer feces from Ohio. STEC populations remained the highest in cattle and deer feces from all states between days 28 and 364, except for those from Ohio. Feral pig, waterfowl, and raccoon feces had populations of STEC of,1.0 log CFU/g starting from day 112 in feces from all states. E. coli O103 and O104 were the predominant serotypes throughout the entire storage period in feces from all animals and from all states. The survival of both O157 and non-O157 STEC strains in domesticated and wild animal feces indicates a potential risk of contamination from animal intrusion.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; spoilage and contamination, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

The CLSM specimens were mixed by varying the proportion of Portland cement type I, silica sand, fly ash, water and air-entraining agent. The laboratory tests including flow, setting time, air content, and breeding were performed to characterise the properties of fresh CLSM. The engineering properties of hardened CLSM were investigated by means of California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength and resilient modulus tests. In addition, the dynamic moduli from shear wave velocity measurement were carried out by a free-free resonant method. The result shows that the unconfined compressive strength at 28 days curing of CLSM can be controlled in the range of 1-10 MPa to serve for the requirement of different activities of fill material. Additionally, the result also suggests the resilient modulus and shear wave velocity of CLSM for pavement and geotechnical applications.",earth sciences,Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology
"Machine hermeneutics, postphenomenology, and facial recognition technology",Hongladarom S.,2020-01-01,"Artificial intelligence algorithms, Conscious machines, Don Ihde, Facial recognition, Human being, Technical excellence, Through the lens, Artificial intelligence, Don Ihde, Machine hermeneutics, Material hermeneutics, Perception","I would like to introduce the notion of machine hermeneutics in this paper. The notion refers to hermeneutical activity performed by machines. Machines are now capable of making the very interpretive tasks, using artificial intelligence algorithms based on the technology of machine learning that used to be the exclusive domain of human beings. In making this claim, I am not talking about possible conscious machines of the future, but those existing here and now. With facial recognition algorithms, for example, machines are now performing routinely what must be regarded as hermeneutical analyses with astounding accuracy and power. Thus, machine hermeneutics supplements Don Ihde’s notion of material hermeneutics. In the latter, it is still human beings who do the interpretation, through the lenses provided the natural sciences; in this case, the natural sciences, or the technology afforded by the sciences, intervene between the human being and the world. In machine hermeneutics, on the contrary, the intervening comes in two layers. On the one hand, there is the usual intervention that Ihde talks about, but on the other, the artificial intelligence algorithm performs its own kind of intervention and interpretation, presenting an already interpreted result to the human beings, who then perceive it through the aid of the usual intervention such as the normal eyeglasses. Then the paper discusses the problem of how to justify the kind of perception that undergoes this process. In what sense can it be said that the algorithm is performing the right action, i.e., one such that the process comes up with a right picture of the world? I contend that this does not merely consist of technical excellence for the technology involved, but also ethical excellence. The two cannot be considered one apart from the other.","fluidex; related topics, arts, computer science","Philosophy, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence"

The National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU) translocated wild-borne macaques to reared colony for research purposes. At present, no studies focus on fungal microbiome (Mycobiome) of this macaque. The functional roles of mycobiome and fungal pathogens have not been elucidated. Thus, this study aimed to investigate and compare oral and fecal mycobiome between wild and captive macaques by using high-throughput sequencing on internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA. The results showed that the mycobiome of wild macaque has greater alpha diversity. The fecal mycobiome has more limited alpha diversity than those in oral cavity. The community is mainly dominated by saprophytic yeast in Kasachstania genus which is related to aiding metabolic function in gut. The oral microbiome of most captive macaques presented the Cutaneotrichosporon suggesting the fungal transmission through skin-oral contact within the colony. The potential pathogens that would cause harmful transmission in reared colonies were not found in either group of macaques but the pathogen prevention and animal care is still important to be concerned. In conclusion, the results of gut mycobiome analysis in Thai cynomolgus macaques provide us with the basic information of oral and fecal fungi and for monitoring macaque's health status for animal care of research use.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Genetics"

Tackling this burden requires healthcare professionals (HCPs) to acquire evidence-based current knowledge and counselling skills. We assessed the needs of HCPs in SEA and developed a continuing medical education/professional development (CME/CPD) program using an e-learning platform to reduce existing gaps. Methods: European, Thai and Malaysian universities collaborated with SEA national nutrition associations in the Early Nutrition eAcademy Southeast Asia (ENeA SEA) project. We assessed HCPs’ needs using questionnaires and mapped CME/CPD programmes and regulations through stakeholder questionnaires. Using a co-creation approach, we established an e-learning platform. Evaluation in users was undertaken using questionnaires. Results: HCPs in SEA reported major training gaps relating to the first 1000 days of nutrition and limited impact of existing face-to-face training. Existing pre/postgraduate, residency and CME/CPD programmes did not adequately address the topic. To address these gaps, we produced a targeted e-learning platform with six modules and CME-tests. National ministries, Thai and Malaysian universities, and professional associations endorsed the training platform. To date, over 2600 HCPs have registered. Evaluation shows high acceptance and a very positive assessment. Conclusions: Dedicated e-learning can reduce major gaps in HCP training in SEA regarding nutrition during the first 1000 days of life at scale and is highly valued by both users and key stakeholders.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Methods: All necessary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from Asian population were gathered to develop mathematic models with first order elimination. Meropenem concentration-time profiles were calculated to evaluate efficacy based on the probability of target attainment (PTA) of 40%fT>4MIC. A group of 5000 virtual patients was created and tested using Monte Carlo simulations for each dose in the models. The optimal dosing regimens were defined as the doses achieved at least 90% of the PTA. Results: The recommended meropenem dosing regimen for Asian critically ill patients receiving CRRT with standard (20–25 mL/kg/h) and high (35 mL/kg/h) effluent rates was 750 mg q 8 h to manage Gram negative infections with expected MIC < 2 mg/L in virtual Asian patients. Some meropenem dosages from available clinical resources could not achieve the aforementioned target. The volume of distribution, body weights and nonrenal clearance significantly contributed to drug dosing adaptation especially in the specific population. Conclusions: A meropenem regimen of 750 mg q 8 h was recommended for Asian critically ill patients receiving 2 different CRRT modalities with standard and high effluent rates.

Thus, this study aims to develop an on-line optimal operational strategy of the VRFB. A dynamic model of the VRFB based on the mass transport equation coupled with electrochemical kinetics and a vanadium ionic diffusion is adopted to determine the optimal flow rate of the vanadium electrolyte by solving an on-line dynamic optimization problem, taking into account the battery capacity degradation due to electrolyte imbalance. Based on the measurement of modified open-circuit voltage, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is implemented to estimate a change in the concentration of vanadium, which is used to on-line update the optimal vanadium flow rate. The results show that the on-line optimization of the vanadium flow rate incorporated with the EKF estimator can enhance the system efficiency (7.4% increase in state of charge) when the VRFB is operated under the intermittent current density. Also, it can prevent the battery voltage from reaching the limiting voltage before the battery achieves the desired state of charge.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The analogs display a wide range of CD4 down-modulating and anti-HIV potencies, including some with greater potency than CADA, proving that a highly basic nitrogen atom in the 12-membered ring is not required for potency and that hydrophobic substituents enhance potency of pyridine-fused CADA compounds. Cytotoxicities of the new compounds compared favorably with those of CADA, showing that incorporation of a pyridine ring into the macrocyclic scaffold can produce selective compounds for potently down-modulating proteins of medicinal interest.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; aids and hiv, biochemistryistry, pharmacology, chemistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Semen samples were collected from 39 men with asthenozoospermia, and their spermatozoa were isolated by two-layer Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Kinetic parameters of the isolated spermatozoa (baseline before intervention) were determined immediately by computer-aided semen analysis. Total anti-oxidant capacity and protein carbonyl levels, as markers of oxidative stress, were also measured in the baseline spermatozoa. The baseline spermatozoa suspension was divided equally into two portions, one for CoQ10 supplementation (50 µg/ml for 1 hr) and the other as an un-supplemented vehicle control. The total motility of the CoQ10-supplemented spermatozoa was significantly higher than in the control (p =.009) and progressive motility tended to be higher (p =.053). Immotile sperm concentration in the CoQ10-supplemented spermatozoa was significantly lower than in both the baseline (p =.026) and control (p =.009). Total anti-oxidant capacity and protein carbonyl levels between the baseline, CoQ10-supplemented and control spermatozoa were not significantly different. Our data suggest that CoQ10 treatment reactivated sperm motility. We propose short-term supplementation of post-wash asthenozoospermic spermatozoa with CoQ10 before intrauterine insemination.","biochemistryistry, medical","Endocrinology, Urology"

The relationship between curing behavior, rheological, and thermal properties of the modified DGEBA is investigated using photo-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and photo-rheometer techniques. It is seen that the addition of the hyperbranched epoxy resin can increase UV conversion (αUV) and reduce gelation time (tgel). After photo-initiation polymerization (dark reaction) occurred, a second exothermic peak in the DSC thermogram takes place: namely, the occurrence of curing reaction owing to the activated monomer (AM) mechanism. Consequently, the glass transition temperature decreased, and at the same time, UV intensity increased which was due to the molecular weight between crosslinking points (Mc). Furthermore, the radius of gyration (Rg) of the network segment is determined via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It is noted that the higher the Mc, the larger the radius of gyration proves to be, resulting in low glass transition temperature.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

These variables are usually set based on past experience, which lead to inefficient operations such as having a short operating cycle and increasing the probability of severity in the process. Furthermore, frequent process shutdown for decoking furnace with short cycle lengths leads to high operating cost and coil deterioration. In this study, stepwise regression models are developed to determine the relationship between ten input process variables of the cracking furnace and the transfer line exchanger outlet temperature as the output so that key process parameters could be controlled to maintain the desired operating conditions and to predict the outlet temperature three and seven days in advance so that the maintenance schedule for decoking could be planned. By using stepwise regression, the model of process relationship reveals that only eight from ten process variables and their 2nd order interactions best explains the output variable, with the R-squared adjusted of 93.63%. For the 3-day and 7-day ahead prediction models, fewer process variables and their interactions are used to explain the output variable, with MAPE of 4.65% and 1.83% respectively.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics","Management Science and Operations Research, Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Among the non-vascular complications from filler injection, the most frequent one is nodule formation. It could occur as early or late onset even with HA injection. One of the causes of these nodule formation is from poor injection technique leading to visible skin beads and lumps.

PNMAis of interest owing to its higher solubility in organic solvents when compared to the unsubstituted polyaniline. However, the electrical conductivity of polyaniline derivatives suffers from chemical substitution. PNMAwas synthesized via emulsion polymerization using three different anionic surfactants, namely sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT). The effects of surfactant structures and concentrations on electrical conductivity, doping level, crystallinity, morphology, and thermal stability were investigated. The re-doping step using perchloric acid (HClO4) as a dopant was sequentially proceeded to enhance electrical conductivity. PNMA synthesized in SDBS at five times its critical micelle concentration (CMC) demonstrated the highest electrical conductivity, doping level, and thermal stability among all surfactants at identical concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the PNMAparticle shapes and sizes critically depended on the surfactant types and concentrations, and the doping mole ratios in the re-doping step. The highest electrical conductivity of 109.84 20.44 S cm-1 and a doping level of 52.45% were attained at the doping mole ratio of 50:1.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Nonetheless, few studies have determined the explicit arterial localization and topography related to the facial soft tissues and landmarks. Therefore, this study aimed to determine an arterial distribution and topography on the middle forehead region correlated with facial landmarks to grant an appropriate guideline for enhancing the safety of injection. Nineteen Thai embalmed cadavers were discovered with conventional dissection and 14 Thai healthy volunteers were investigated with ultrasonographic examination on the middle forehead. This study found that at the level of mid-frontal depression point, the transverse distance from the medial canthal vertical line to the superficial and deep branches of supraorbital artery were 9.1 mm and 15.1 mm, respectively. Whereas the depths from the skin of these arteries were 4.1 mm and 4.3 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the frontal branch of superficial temporal artery was detectable in 42.1% as an artery entering the forehead area. At the level of lateral canthal vertical line, the vertical distance of frontal branch was 31.6 mm, and the depth from skin of the artery was 2.7 mm. In conclusion, a proper injection technique could be performed based on an intensive arterial distribution and topography, and ultrasonographic examination before the injection is also suggested in order to restrict the opportunity of severe complications.",medical,"Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

Methods: This was a retrospective non-comparative case series. Medical records of TED patients with unilateral eyelid retraction, who underwent a contralateral MMCR from November 2015 to September 2017, were reviewed. Standard photographs of pre-operative, post-phenylephrine test and post-operative were measured for eyelid positions including MRD1, MRD2 and inter-palpebral fissure width. MMCR was indicated on the contralateral eyelid only in patients who had a cosmetically acceptable result from phenylephrine test and were willing to receive the operation on the normal eye. Results: Twelve TED patients who underwent MMCR on the normal eyelid were included in the study. Mean pre-operative MRD1 of retracted and normal eyelid were 5.7 mm (SD = 0.86) and 3.5 mm (SD = 0.65), respectively. Mean post-operative MRD1 of retracted and normal eyelid were 4.4 mm (SD = 0.76) and 4.1 mm (SD = 0.46), respectively. The asymmetry of MRD1 between eyes was significantly decreased from 2.1 mm (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 1.5–2.9 mm) pre-operatively to 0.3 mm (IQR = 0.1–0.7 mm) post-operatively (p =.002). None of these patients needed further eyelid correction surgery and there was no complication. Conclusions: In TED patients with unilateral eyelid retraction, using phenylephrine test on their normal eyes should be initiated. If eyelid position was satisfactorily equalized, performing MMCR on the normal eyelid is considered an effective alternative treatment with a predictable outcome.",medical,Ophthalmology

Purpose: To compare the accuracy of position and parallelism of two implants, using static and dynamic CAIS systems. Materials and methods: Thirty patients received two implants (60 implants) randomly allocated to two different CAIS systems. Optimal implant position and absolute parallelism was planned based on preoperative cone beam CT (CBCT). Patients received implants with a surgical guide (static CAIS, n = 30) or real-time navigation (dynamic CAIS, n = 30). Implant three-dimensional deviation and parallelism was calculated after surgery. Results: The mean 3D deviation in the static and dynamic CAIS group at implant platform were 1.04 ± 0.67 vs 1.24 ± 0.39 mm, at apex were 1.54 ± 0.79 vs 1.58 ± 0.56 mm and angulation were 4.08° ± 1.69° vs 3.78° ± 1.84°, respectively. The angle deviations between two placed implants (parallelism) in static and dynamic CAIS groups were 4.32° ± 2.44° and 3.55° ± 2.29°, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in all parameters between groups. Conclusion: Static and dynamic CAIS provides similar accuracy of the 3D implant position and parallelism between two implants.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"

Since saliva directly contacts the tumors and saliva collection is non-invasive, easily accessible and cost effective, salivary biomarkers are practical to be used for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of these diseases. However, there is limited knowledge of protein expression in saliva for canine oral tumors. The present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers from the salivary proteome of dogs with early- and late-stage oral melanoma (EOM and LOM, respectively), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), benign oral tumors (BN), and periodontitis and healthy controls (CP), using an in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The relationships between protein candidates and chemotherapy drugs were explored and the expression of potential biomarkers in saliva and tissues was verified by western blot analysis. Results: For saliva samples, increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 5 (PTPN5) was shown in all tumor groups compared with the CP group. Marked expression of PTPN5 was also observed in LOM and OSCC compared with that in BN and EOM. In addition, tumor protein p53 (p53), which appeared in the PTPN5-drug interactions, was exhibited to be expressed in all tumor groups compared with that in the CP group. For tissue samples, increased expression of p53 was shown in LOM compared with the control group.

We believe that new architectural facades when seamlessly integrated with augmented architecture, enhanced with multiple functionalities, interactivity and performative qualities can extend a building's use beyond its typical function and limited lifespan. Augmented facades or “Fantastic Facades,” can be seen as a separate entity from the internal spaces inside the building but at the same time, can also be seen as an integral part of the building as a whole that connects users, spaces, functions and interactivity between inside and outside. An option design studio for 4th year architecture students was offered to conduct this investigation for a duration of one semester. During the process of form generations, students experimented with various 2D and 3D techniques including biomimicry and generative designs, biomechanics or animal movement patterns, leaf stomata patterns, porous bubble patterns, and origami fold patterns. Eventually, five facade designs were carried on towards the final step of incorporating performative interactions and contextual programs to the facade requirements of an existing building or structure in Bangkok.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Building and Construction"

The composite films were prepared by chill roll cast film extrusion, by varying the silver zeolite content from 0.5 to 4 %wt. The silver content in zeolite was examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The morphology and crystal structure of silver zeolite were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, respectively. The incorporation of silver did not influence the zeolite morphology and its crystal structure. The antibacterial action of composite films was investigated against gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The results revealed that the PBS composite films containing SZSM-5 showed 99.9% of bacterial reduction. The optimal SZSM-5 content in PBS composite films was 0.5%wt because it was the lowest concentration that showed high efficiency of antibacterial behavior. In case of biodegradable ability, PBS composite films incorporated with 0.5%wt of SZSM-5 exhibited the degradation after three-month of soil burial test, although they exhibited slower rate than neat PBS films. The SEM micrographs of the films after soil burial test displayed the cavity on film surface, indicating the biodegradable properties of the films. PBS composite films incorporated with 0.5%wt of SZSM-5 showed the potential to be used as the food packaging.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

We implemented an Active Case Management Network to promote early ART initiation Aiming for Cure (ACC) in August 2014. We describe ACC implementation, early infant diagnosis (EID) coverage and ART initiation during August 2014 to July 2018 compared with a national EID survey during October 2007 to September 2011 (pre-ACC). Methods: Thailand's 2014 HIV Treatment Guidelines recommend that HIV-exposed infants have HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at birth, one month and at two to four months. Testing is done at 14 national HIV PCR laboratories. When an HIV-positive infant (HIV PCR+) is identified, PCR laboratory staff send the result to the hospital staff responsible for the infant's care and to the national laboratory case manager (CM). As part of ACC, the national laboratory CM alerts a regional CM who contacts the hospital staff caring for the infant to offer technical support with ART initiation and ART adherence. CMs enter clinical, demographic and laboratory data into the national ACC database. We analysed the ACC data from August 2014 to July 2018 to assess the ACC's impact on EID coverage, ART initiation and time-to-ART initiation. Results: The uptake of EID increased from 64% (pre-ACC) to >95% in 2018 (ACC). The number of HIV-positive infants born declined from 429 cases (pre-ACC) to 267 cases (ACC). Median age at the first-positive PCR declined from 75 days (pre-ACC) to 60 days (ACC); P < 0.001. Among 429 infants diagnosed before ACC was started, 241 (56%) received ART; during ACC, 235 (88%) of 267 HIV-positive infants received ART. The median age at ART initiation declined from 282 days before ACC to 83 days during ACC (P < 0.001) and the median time from blood collection to ART initiation declined from 168 days before ACC to 23 days during ACC (P < 0.001). Conclusions: An innovative case management network (ACC) has been established in Thailand and results suggest that the network is promoting EID and early ART initiation. The ACC model, using case-managed PCR notification and follow-up, may speed ART initiation in other settings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

In addition, in some areas, groundwater quality has degraded due to agrochemical contamination from agricultural areas. The aims of this research pertains to aquifers as follows: (1) to evaluate hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater using multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and (2) to integrate the stable isotopes 18O and 2H with hydrochemical data to evaluate the origin of the groundwater and indirectly identify the pollution sources of groundwater contaminated with nitrate (NO3). Water samples were collected from 60 groundwater wells with different hydrogeological characteristics and land use types in both the rainy season (in October) and the summer seasons (in February) in the Cha Am district of Phetchaburi Province. The groundwater was separated into 3 types: Ca-Na-Cl, Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl, and Na-Cl. Two groundwater wells (no. 19 and 41), which were located southeast and southwest of the study area, had relatively high NO3- concentrations (47 mg/L NO3 and 50 mg/L NO3, respectively) that were higher than the groundwater quality standards. These two wells corresponded to the second group that was exposed by HCA. The PCA results revealed the influence of seawater intrusion. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis (PC 2) revealed that the NO3- that is mainly released from potassium nitrate (KNO3), for example, during pineapple cultivation, directly contaminated the groundwater system.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

This study aimed to quantify microplastics at the high-tide line of 21 beaches along the eastern Gulf of Thailand. Observed amounts ranged from 420 to >200,000 counts/kg. Anthropogenic and environmental factors affect distribution and amount of microplastics. Tide-dominated beaches and beach sections protected by beachrocks exhibit higher microplastic amounts due to lesser hydrodynamics. While human activities have a visible impact, in some cases environmental factors seem to predominate. Despite effective protection efforts led by the government and NGOs, our study shows that the substantial microplastic pollution of beach sand requires a proper management system with appropriate laws and regulations, and a public awareness campaign to reduce effects of microplastics on organisms and their ecosystems.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; marine, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, coastal and ocean engineeringneering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

Time marker of 137Cs fallout maximum in lake sediments of Northwest China,"Lan J., Wang T., Chawchai S., Cheng P., Zhou K., Yu K., Yan D., Wang Y., Zang J., Liu Y., Tan L., Ai L., Xu H.",2020-08-01,"Chernobyl accident, Human activities, Isotopic ratios, Lake sediments, Lake-sediment records, Natural sources, NorthWest China, Nuclear testing, Anthropocene, Central Asia, Chronology, Ice core, Radionuclides, Recent lake sediment","Caesium-137 (137Cs) has no natural source and is commonly employed in establishing the chronology of recent lake sediments in the Anthropocene epoch. Because of their location in the northern mid-latitude Westerlies circulation region, downwind of the Chernobyl accident and their proximity to the Lop Nur Chinese Nuclear Testing (CNT) site, lake sediments in NW China record a137Cs fallout maximum of global atmospheric thermonuclear weapon tests (GTWT) in 1963–1964 Common Era (CE), with probably local fallout subpeaks due to the Chernobyl accident in 1986 CE and CNT in 1976 CE. This complexity means that the use of 137Cs fallout maximum in lake sediments as a time marker in NW China is thus far not well constrained, impeding assessment of recent and future changes in paleoclimate and human activities. To identify the 137Cs time marker and provide a reliable chronology of surface lake sediments for investigating paleoclimatic changes and for defining the Anthropocene epoch in NW China during the last 50–100 years, here we describe chronologies of 6 near-surface sediment cores from NW China based on 137Cs and 210Pb activities, and review the chronology of 23 lake sediments and 10 ice cores from NW China and central Asia based on 137Cs, 210Pb, 239+240Pu, 3H, 241Am, and beta-activity dating methods, and annual layer counting, as well as 240Pu/239Pu isotopic ratios. Based on the potential influence of radioactivity transport from the Chernobyl accident and CNT, and the comparison with deposition records of 26 European lake sediments and 5 Alpine ice cores, we propose that the 137Cs fallout maximum of lake sediments in NW China and central Asia is primarily attributable to GTWT and that there is no unambiguous evidence to confirm the Chernobyl- and CNT-derived 137Cs local-fallout subpeaks. Taking into account the approximately one-year delay between injection of 137Cs into the atmosphere and its incorporation in lake sediment records, we conclude that the 137Cs fallout maximum in lake sediments of NW China provides a reliable GTWT time marker for 1964 CE.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; aquatic pollution; freshwater, water engineeringneering, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

The antibacterial and antifungal activities of these analogs against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus flavus were investigated. The structure-activity relationship study revealed that the length of the alkyl chain, as well as the type of substituent, has a dramatic impact on the antimicrobial activities. Particularly, the brominated analogs 3j with a nonyl side chain exhibited exceptional antifungal activities against A. flavus (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.05 μg/mL), which surpassed that of the amphotericin B used as a positive control. The antibacterial activity against S. aureus, although not as potent, showed a similar trend to the antifungal activity. The data suggest that the 4-hydroxy-2-quinolone is a promising framework for the further development of new antimicrobial agents, especially for antifungal treatment.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
"The uterine-chemokine-brain axis: menstrual cycle-associated symptoms (MCAS) are in part mediated by CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8 and CXCL10","Roomruangwong C., Sirivichayakul S., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2020-05-15,"Brain, Chemokine CCL11, Chemokine CCL2, Chemokine CCL5, Chemokine CXCL10, Female, Humans, Menstrual Cycle, Uterus, Chemokines, Depression, Inflammation, Neuro-immune, Premenstrual syndrome","Objective: To examine associations between chemokines and menstrual cycle associated symptoms (MCAS). Methods: Forty-one women completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) rating scale during 28 consecutive days of the menstrual cycle. MCAS is diagnosed when the total daily DRSP score during the menstrual cycle is > 0.666 percentile. We assayed plasma CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL8, CXCL10, EGF, IGF-1, and PAI-1 at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle. Results: CCL2, CCL5, CCL11 and EGF are significantly higher in women with MCAS than in those without. Increased CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL8, CCL11 and CCL5 levels are significantly associated with DRSP scores while CCL2 is the most significant predictor explaining 39.6% of the variance. The sum of the neurotoxic chemokines CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 is significantly associated with the DRSP score and depression, physiosomatic, breast-craving and anxiety symptoms. The impact of chemokines on MCAS symptoms differ between consecutive weeks of the menstrual cycle with CCL2 being the most important predictor of increased DRSP levels during the first two weeks, and CXCL10 or a combination of CCL2, CCL11 and CCL5 being the best predictors during week 3 and 4, respectively. Discussion: The novel case definition “MCAS” is externally validated by increased levels of uterus-associated chemokines and EGF. Those chemokines are involved in MCAS and are regulated by sex hormones and modulate endometrium functions and brain neuro-immune responses, which may underpin MCAS symptoms. As such, uterine-related chemokines may link the uterus with brain functions via a putative uterine-chemokine-brain axis.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The initiative was focused on Asian countries, so participants comprised experts in the management of PD from key centers in Asia, with additional insight provided by European and the North American movement disorders experts. Analysis of peer-reviewed publications on patient perceptions of PD and the factors that they consider important to their wellbeing identified several contributing factors to the mismatch of views, including gaps in knowledge of PD and its treatment, an understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of PD, and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. The faculty proposed options to bridge these gaps to ensure that PD patients receive the personalized treatment they need to achieve the best possible outcomes. It was considered essential to improve patient knowledge about PD and its treatment, as well as increasing the awareness of clinicians of PD heterogeneity in presentation and treatment response. A multidisciplinary and shared-care approach to PD was needed alongside the use of patient-centered outcome measures in clinical trials and clinical practice to better capture the patient experience and improve the delivery of individualized therapy.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

The electrochemical performance of the air-cathode has a decisive impact on the discharge performance of ZABs because the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics increase the overpotential of the air-cathode and hence the performance of ZABs. In this work, reduced graphene oxide decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNP/rGO) is synthesized using simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide and silver ions. Different amounts of silver loading are examined for the synthesis of AgNP/rGO. The synthesized AgNP/rGO samples are analyzed using a rotating disk electrode in order to investigate ORR activity. Then, the synthesized AgNP/rGO electrocatalyst is applied on a tubular designed zinc–air battery in order to study the performance of the zinc–air battery. Results demonstrate that AgNP/rGO is an efficient and cost-effective ORR electrocatalyst for its practical application in ZABs.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The effect of the added nano-SiO2 on the mechanical properties and ballistic impact responses of the composites was quantified using a variety of techniques and related to the interfacial interactions between the two materials. Impact response was effectively mitigated by the added nano-SiO2 as composite panels which contained the additive exhibited smaller damage areas as well as lower penetration depths after being subjected to 5.56 × 45 mm projectiles when compared to composite panels that lacked the additive. Furthermore, a series of numerical simulations predicted that composites of appropriate thickness should protect against the penetration of projectiles with velocities of 930 ± 20 m/s and ballistic limit velocities as high as 1075 m/s. Collectively, these results indicate that the composites may be used as strike panels in ballistic armor applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

Architecture designs often grow in depth and usually outperform their predecessors. However, these deep networks are not optimized for a specific application, especially with limited datasets such as X-ray dataset. Moreover, training these networks require considerable GPU resources. YOLOv3 is an object detection network iterated to include the recent developments in the deep learning research field. Thus, it also has a deep backbone network similar to Residual Network. The developments incorporated are effective in general datasets and benchmarks but needlessly big for a specialized application. Hence, this paper proposes methods to create a suitable backbone for YOLOv3 with Neuroevolution. Neuroevolution is an optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm, which does not require gradients to optimize. Using Neuroevolution, a small network for limited dataset can be designed without human expertise. Experimental results show that it can compete with the larger networks in terms of accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)"

It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favorable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus. This report sought to provide fundamental knowledge as preliminary experimental data to propose an existing nutraceutical material against viral infection. Collectively, it is suggested that molecular modelling and molecular docking are suitable tools to search and screen for new drugs and natural compounds that can be used as future treatments for viral diseases.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

A selective literature review was performed concerning the influence on safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of mixing wP- and aP-containing vaccines for primary immunization of infants. In addition, local data were collected from various countries and the results discussed in a face-to-face meeting. Very few data addressing issues of mixing combination vaccines were identified, and no data were available concerning the effectiveness or duration of protection. It was also found that pharmacovigilance data are scarce or lacking in those countries where they would be needed the most. We then identified frequent problems occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where both vaccine types are used. Relying on local knowledge, we give practical recommendations for a variety of situations in different settings. Specific needs for additional data addressing these issues were also identified. International bodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as vaccine producers should try to find ways to highlight the problems of mixing wP- and aP-containing combination vaccines with robust data.

Assessment was performed before and immediately after bite-raising. The bite-raising was done by adding light-cured orthodontic band cement (3 3 5 3 2-mm width 3 length 3 height) on the palatal cusps of the upper first molars. The masticatory performance index (MPI) was calculated from chewed test food particles using a sieving method. For the subjective evaluation, the participants performed the food intake ability (FIA) test using a questionnaire with six types of food. The correlation between the evaluation methods was determined. Results: The MPI and FIA scores of the participants were significantly reduced after bite-raising (P, .001). The MPI and FIA score reduction was not significantly different between females and males. No significant correlations were found between the changes in MPI and FIA scores. Conclusions: Masticatory function after bite-raising with light-cured orthodontic band cement was immediately reduced, both objectively and subjectively. However, because there was no significant correlation between the objective and subjective results, an individual may not perceive his/her decreased masticatory ability to the same degree as masticatory performance was reduced.

The results indicated that the increase in the mass fraction TBAB decreased the induction time. However, it did not significantly affect the methane uptake. In the presence of CP, the increase in the CP concentration resulted in an increase in the induction time due to the increasing thicknesses of the CP layer in the unstirred reactor. Moreover, the methane uptake was varied proportionally with the CP concentration. The addition of TBAB resulted in a higher methane uptake than that of CP, since the presence of TBAB provided the cavities in the hydrate structure to accommodate the methane gas during the hydrate formation better than that of CP. On the contrary, the presence of CP significantly increased the induction time. Although the methane recovery remained relatively the same regardless of TBAB and CP concentrations, the recovery was higher in the presence of TBAB.","petroleum engineeringneering, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Therefore, continuous monitoring of IBV genotypes and lineages recently circulating in chickens worldwide is essential. In this study, we characterized the complete S1 gene from 120 IBVs circulating in chickens in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene of 120 Thai IBVs revealed that the 2014–2016 Thai IBVs were divided into 3 lineages (GI-1, GI-13, and GI-19) and a novel IBV variant. Our results also showed that GI-19 lineage has become the predominant lineage of IBV circulating in chicken flocks in Thailand from 2014 to 2016. It is interesting to note that a novel IBV variant, which was genetically different from the established IBV lineages, was identified in this study. The recombination analysis demonstrated that this novel IBV variant was a recombinant virus, which was originated from the GI-19 and GI-13 lineage viruses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the circulation of different lineages of IBV and the presence of a novel recombinant IBV variant in chicken flocks in Thailand. This study highlights the high genetic diversity and continued evolution of IBVs in chickens in Thailand, and the importance of continued IBV surveillance for effective control and prevention of IB.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

In this study, the authors aimed to identify the differences in web space anatomy of the foot and the hand and provide a guideline of flap design for web space reconstruction in the foot and the hand. The right hands and right feet of adult volunteers were measured, including surgical landmarks (i.e., the dorsal prominence of proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints [or metatarsophalangeal joints]), proximal phalangeal length, tip of the web space, and width of web space. The web spaces and other parameters were analyzed and compared between the foot and the hand by using a paired t test with p <.05 to indicate statistical significance. A total of 108 web spaces of the foot and hand from 18 adult volunteers were analyzed. The parameters that were significantly different between the foot and the hand included (1) proximal phalangeal length (34.63 vs 60.16 mm), (2) average web height ratio (0.72 vs 0.51), (3) average web width ratio (0.69 vs 0.81), (4) mean slope angle (4.89° vs 19.26°), and (5) average abduction angle (25.33° vs 31.07°). In conclusion, the foot web space had a higher slope angle, less abduction angle, and shorter proximal phalangeal length. Therefore, the flap design for foot web space reconstruction requires a longer and narrower flap than the design for the hand. The recommended flap design length should be at least 72% of proximal phalangeal length for the foot versus 51% for the hand, and the width should be at least 69% of the distance between the tips of adjacent metatarsophalangeal joints for the foot versus 81% for the hand.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

Methods: This study examined a) IDO in association with interferon (IFN)-γ, Interleukin (IL)-4 and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β1 in 140 drug-naïve MDD patients and 40 normal controls; and b) the effects of an eight-week treatment of sertraline with or without ketoprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) on the same biomarkers in 44 MDD patients. Results: Baseline IDO, IFN-γ, TGF-β1 and IL-4 were significantly higher in MDD patients as compared with controls. Treatment with sertraline with or without ketoprofen significantly reduced the baseline levels of all biomarkers to levels which were in the normal range (IDO, TGF-β1, and IL-4) or still somewhat higher than in controls (IFN-γ). Ketoprofen add-on had a significantly greater effect on IDO as compared with placebo. The reductions in IDO, IL-4, and TGF-β1 during treatment were significantly associated with those in the BDI-II. Conclusion: MDD is accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory pathways (including IDO) and the Compensatory Immune-Regulatory System (CIRS). The clinical efficacy of antidepressant treatment may be ascribed at least in part to decrements in IDO and the immune-inflammatory response.

Materials and Methods: Eighty neonates aged 7 to 30 days, with antenatal hydronephrosis and mild to moderate IH on neonatal renal ultrasound, were recruited from August 2015 to December 2016. Neonates were randomly assigned to CAP until hydronephrosis resolution or aged 12 months (CAP group, n=40) or to watchful observation (control group, n=40). The primary outcome was UTI. The probability of UTI was compared between the randomized groups using the Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test. Results: Nonadherence occurred in 6/40 parents in the CAP arm (15.0%). Thus, only 34 patients received CAP. UTI occurred in 5/34 patients in the CAP group (14.7%) and in 4/40 controls (10.0%).

The piglets were weighed on day 0 (<1 h), 1 (24 h), 3, 10 and 17 after birth to determine the colostrum and milk yields of the sows using a prediction equation. Milk samples were collected manually within 1 h of the onset of parturition and on days 3, 10 and 17 after farrowing to evaluate milk composition. A general linear model procedure was used to analyze the effects of sow parity numbers on colostrum yield and composition and a general linear mixed model procedure was used to analyze the effects of sow parity numbers on yield and composition of milk. The model included the fixed effects of sow parity number and time (day after parturition).

Recurrent gross tumor volume (rGTV) and centroid (geometric center of rGTV) were delineated. In-field failure was classified as centroids originating within the original planning target volume. Dose-volume histograms for each rGTV were used to further classify in-field recurrences as central high-dose (dose to 95% of rGTV [rGTVD95%] ≥95% of dose prescribed to PTV) or peripheral high-dose (rGTVD95% <95% of dose prescribed to PTV). Results: 634 patients received SABR from 2004 to 2014 with 48 local recurrences. 35 of these had evaluable images with 16 in-field recurrences: 9 central high-dose, 6 peripheral high-dose, and 1 had both. Time to and volume of recurrence were not statistically different between central versus peripheral high-dose recurrences. However mean rGTV dose, mean centroid dose, and rGTVD95% were higher for central versus peripheral high-dose recurrences. Conclusion: We report a standardized method for analysis and classification of in-field recurrence after SABR. There were more central as opposed to peripheral high-dose recurrences, suggesting biological rather than technical issues underlying majority of in-field failures.",medical,"Hematology, Oncology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"
"Mapping the natural distribution of bamboo and related carbon stocks in the tropics using google earth engine, phenological behavior, landsat 8, and sentinel-2","Venkatappa M., Anantsuksomsri S., Castillo J.A., Smith B., Sasaki N.",2020-09-02,"Classification methods, Emission reduction, Enhanced vegetation index, Mapping applications, Natural distribution, Operational land imager, Remote sensing data, Vegetation phenology, Bamboo mapping, Carbon stocks, CDM, Google Earth Engine, Landsat 8 OLI, PBTC, REDD+, Sentinel-2, Threshold classification, Threshold values, Vegetation phenology","Although vegetation phenology thresholds have been developed for a wide range of mapping applications, their use for assessing the distribution of natural bamboo and the related carbon stocks is still limited, especially in Southeast Asia. Here, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to collect time-series of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 images and employed a phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) to map the natural bamboo distribution and estimate carbon stocks in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. We processed 337 collections of Landsat 8 OLI for phenological assessment and generated 121 phenological profiles of the average vegetation index for three vegetation land cover categories from 2015 to 2018. After determining the minimum and maximum threshold values for bamboo during the leaf-shedding phenology stage, the PBTC method was applied to produce a seasonal composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for Landsat collections and assess the bamboo distributions in 2015 and 2018. Bamboo distributions in 2019 were then mapped by applying the EVI phenological threshold values for 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery by accessing 442 tiles. The overall Landsat 8 OLI bamboo maps for 2015 and 2018 had user’s accuracies (UAs) of 86.6% and 87.9% and producer’s accuracies (PAs) of 95.7% and 97.8%, respectively, and a UA of 86.5% and PA of 91.7% were obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery for 2019. Accordingly, carbon stocks of natural bamboo by district in Siem Reap at the province level were estimated. Emission reductions from the protection of natural bamboo can be used to offset 6% of the carbon emissions from tourists who visit this tourism-destination province. It is concluded that a combination of GEE and PBTC and the increasing availability of remote sensing data make it possible to map the natural distribution of bamboo and carbon stocks.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

However, for many of these diseases, other receptors and targets have been the focus of the most, such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors in Alzheimer’s and dopamine replacement in Parkinson’s. The currently available drugs for these diseases have limited success resulting in the requirement of an alternative approach to their treatment. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the potential role of the sigma receptors and their ligands as part of a multi receptor approach in the treatment of the diseases mentioned above. The literature reviewed was obtained through searches in databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Expert opinion: Given sigma receptor agonists provide neuroprotection along with other benefits such as potentiating the effects of other receptors, further development of multi-receptor targeting ligands, and or the development of multi-drug combinations to target multiple receptors may prove beneficial in the future treatment of degenerative diseases of the CNS, especially when coupled with better diagnostic techniques.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery, Clinical Biochemistry"

A narrow web flexographic printing press was set up and opperated. Print quality parameters such as optical density, tone reproduction, print contrast and print uniformity were investigated. Results showed that these compostable films were hydrophobic in nature, in combination with fracture and voids of substrates’ surface. Even the substrates could be printed relatively well but showed poor ink adhesion. Surface treatment, therefore, was necessary, but having limitation. Anilox line screen 700 lpi and printing speed at 30 m/min were preferable to achieve the optimum tone reproduction and print contrast. This was based on the image resolution of 133 lpi and corona dosage at 500 watt-min/m2 . Images of printed samples from SEM and SPM indicated that the fracture surface and void of films could lead to decrease their printability. It was found that starch blend gave better results as being a filler of the surface roughness of the substrate..","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Antibiofilm activity and cytotoxicity of silk sericin against Streptococcus mutans bacteria in biofilm: An in vitro study,"Aramwit P., Napavichayanum S., Pienpinijtham P., Rasmi Y., Bang N.",2020-04-01,"Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Biofilms, Bombyx, Humans, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Pressure Ulcer, Sericins, Streptococcus mutans, biofilm, cytotoxicity, extraction, sericin, Streptococcus mutans","Objective: To investigate the potential of sericin extracted by different methods to inhibit biofilm formation (prevention) and disrupt already formed biofilm (treatment). Method: In this in vitro study, sericin was extracted by heat, acid, alkali and urea. Streptococcus mutans bacteria were cultivated in the presence of various concentrations of sericin to evaluate antibiofilm formation using cell density assay (inhibition effect before biofilm formed). Conversely, various concentrations of sericin were added to a biofilm already formed by Streptococcus mutans bacteria, and the viability of bacteria assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (disruption effects after biofilm formed). Structures of extracted sericin were evaluated using circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. Results: The urea-extracted sericin at all concentrations (12.5mg/ml, 25mg/ml, 50mg/ml and 100mg/ml) showed the highest potential antibiofilm activity in terms of both inhibition and disruption effects, compared with sericin extracted by heat, acid or alkali. The heatextracted and acid-extracted sericin were found to reduce the biofilm formation dose-dependently, while the alkali-extracted sericin did not show either inhibition or disruption effect on the bacterial biofilm. The urea-extracted sericin also killed the bacteria residing within the biofilm, possibly due to its modified structure which may destabilise the bacterial cell wall, leading to membrane disintegration and, finally, cell death. Conclusion: Our results demostrated the antibiofilm activity of sericin. This could form the basis of further research on the mechanism and application of sericin as a novel antibiofilm agent.",Nursing,"Fundamentals and Skills, Nursing (miscellaneous)"
Phenol-derived products from fast pyrolysis of organosolv lignin,"Soongprasit K., Sricharoenchaikul V., Atong D.",2020-11-01,"Aromatic chemicals, Aromatic structures, Chemical compositions, Molecular compounds, Phenolic compounds, Pyrolysis temperature, Sugar-cane bagasse, Thermal fragmentation, Biorefinery, Delignification, Fast pyrolysis, Lignin, Organosolv, Phenol","Lignin is the largest aromatic bio-polymer feedstock with a huge potential of being refined for aromatic chemical platform and building block. Organosolv process for lignin extraction has a low impact on the environment due to its low chemical requirement, the absence of sulfur, and as it is more practical for chemical recovery. Therefore, refinement of extracted lignin to valuable molecular compounds such as purified lignin and its derivative is the key success for biorefinery industry. In this study, sugarcane bagasse from a local sugar manufacturer in Thailand, noted as BG-lignin, was selected as feedstock for lignin extraction using ethanol and water. The chemical composition of this lignin was slightly different than that of commercially available organosolv lignin, noted as Comm-OS-lignin, in that BG-lignin has more combustible constituents (volatile organic compounds and fixed carbon) of 96.14% and low ash content of 0.09%. The chemical structure of BG-lignin contains a higher number of aliphatic hydrocarbon and aliphatic hydroxy side chains than Comm-OS-lignin, as confirmed by the FT-IR and 1H-NMR analyses. The study on fast pyrolysis of lignin, using Py-GCMS technique, found 2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran as a major constituent at any tested pyrolysis temperature. H-unit, G-unit, and S-unit are distributed in resemble fraction with a H∕G∕S ratio of 1∕1∕0.7 and 0.8∕1∕1 for Comm-OS-lignin and BG-lignin, respectively, at pyrolysis temperature of 400–600 °C, except for H-unit which was enhanced at 700 °C to 28.82% of Comm-OS-lignin and 29.66% of BG-lignin. At a temperature of 400–600 °C, phenolic selectivity of pyrolyzed products, mainly methoxy phenol (Ph-OCH3) and alkylated phenol (R-Ph-OCH3), was done. A higher pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C led to the elimination of aromatic side group and is more favorable in alkyl phenol (R-Ph) and phenol selectivity. However, reduction of the phenolic compound was observed with a higher temperature due to thermal fragmentation of the C–C linkage in the aromatic structure. Products selectivity related to lignin feedstock and pyrolysis temperature could be applied as a conceptual guideline for conducting further study of chemical upgrading process to obtain high-value biochemical products.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Aims of the study were to evaluate the pedobarography and ankle kinematics of the clubfoot post-surgery and compare with controls. Methods: Twenty-two patients (33 clubfeet) and 22 normal children (44 feet) were enrolled into the cross-sectional study. Demographic data were recorded. Plantar force measurements and ankle kinematic data were obtained and compared between clubfoot patients and controls by pedobarography and 3-dimensional gait analysis. Results: Clubfoot patients were operated at an average age of 12.8 ± 8.1 months. The average follow-up was 9.9 ± 3.9 years. Demographic data were comparable between the two groups. The plantar force in clubfoot patients was significantly lower than controls (108.2 ± 86.7 vs. 150.9 ± 73.9 N, p = 0.03). Clubfoot patients demonstrated a longer contact time, larger contact area, lower peak pressure, and force relative to body weight in toe, midfoot, and heel areas. The impulse was comparable between the two groups but the contact area, force, and force time integral concentrated at the midfoot region of the clubfoot. The ankle kinematics in clubfoot patients demonstrated a dorsiflexed position through late toe off. Range of dorsiflexion in the clubfoot was significantly higher than in controls. Foot adduction during stance, limited inversion-eversion, and limited plantar flexion during loading response and toe off were observed. Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of limited soft tissue release during clubfoot surgery. Although the procedure could preserve range of motion at the ankle joint, muscle weakness and flatfoot deformity are prevalent.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

Such systems may, however, need FP operation from time to time. This paper addresses the problem by implementing a fully compatible 64-bit IEEE-754 FP library for 8-bit PicoBlaze processor, which is synthesizable on almost all XILINX FPGAs. This reduces the resource required dramatically. For example, the number of Lookup Tables (LUT) required by an FP IP Core is 31,131; whilst the soft-core processor consumes only 123 LUTs, a 250-fold decrease. A 64-bit FP division operation using the proposed library takes an average clock count of 6,850 cycles. A test bench is setup to perform code verification using comparison method to ensure exactness of results with an ARM-based hardcore FP unit. Verification mechanism is based on Inter-Processor Communication (IPC), shared memory, and interrupt signalling which they are all implemented on an all programmable System- on-Chip XILINX Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA platform.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"

Two other nano-materials—GN and nano-ZnO—were also used to compare them with GN-ZnO. Increasing the content of GN-ZnO gradually enhanced the antibacterial and barrier properties, but the addition of 0.3 phr GN-ZnO led to agglomeration that caused defects in the nanocomposites. Herein, we investigated the antibacterial and barrier properties of HDPE nanocomposites infused with different nanoparticles (GN, ZnO, GN-ZnO) of varying concentrations. HDPE and the nanoparticles were melt-blended together in a Haake-Buchler Rheomixer to produce a new environment-friendly nano-material with improved physical and chemical properties. The following characterizations were conducted: tensile test, thermogravimetric analysis, morphology, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, antibacterial test, and oxygen and water vapor permeation test. The results showed that the crystallinity of HDPE was affected with the addition of GN-ZnO, and the nanocomposites had effective antibacterial capacity, strong mechanical properties, high thermal stability, and excellent barrier performance. This type of HDPE nanocomposites reinforced with GN-ZnO would be attractive for packaging industries.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

This work is very challenging due to many factors, such as the complexity of the background, the shadow, and the various type of aircraft. To handle these problems, in this paper we implement the deeply supervised salient object detection with short connections (DSS) with our dataset which is divided into two categories: simple case and dificult case, and we propose some idea of post-process which can increase some accuracy by using pre-trained and adding L2-normalization in some layer of DSS architecture to create the mask that can reduce the noise from background effectively. From the experimental result, using L2-normalization with our post-processing can increase the performance by 0.61% and 2.14% in the simple case and difficult case respectively, compared with using only the DSS method. So our method performs well when the background is complicated, which always occurs in reality.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Engineering (miscellaneous), Computational Mathematics, Control and Optimization, Modeling and Simulation, Computational Theory and Mathematics"

The soil medium under consideration consists of a number of layers overlying a homogeneous half-space. The exact stiffness matrices for each layer and the half-space are obtained explicitly from the analytical general solution derived by applying the triple-dimensional Fourier transformation to the governing equations based on Biot's poroelastodynamics theory. The solution to the global equation system yields displacements and pore pressure in the Fourier transform domain at the layer interfaces. Time domain solutions are obtained by applying the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and an accurate numerical quadrature scheme. Comparison with existing solutions on moving load problems is presented to verify the accuracy of the present solution scheme. A parametric study is then carried out to investigate the influence of various parameters on displacements and pore pressure of multilayered saturated soils under moving loads. The proposed solution scheme is also extended to study dynamic interaction between flexible pavement under a moving load and multi-layered soils.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology

This article reviews the similarities and differences between pediatric and adult CRS. Recent Findings: Rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory disease of the nose and the paranasal sinuses. In adults, inflammation in CRS without polyps (CRSsNP) mainly manifests with T-helper 1 lymphocytes while in CRS with polyps (CRSwNP) manifests with T-helper 2 lymphocytes and eosinophilic inflammation. In children, CRS inflammation manifests with neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. The associations between the ostiomeatal complex occlusion and CRS are revealed in adults but are not so evident in children. Although the relationship between the CRS and allergic rhinitis is still controversial, recent findings have shown an association between allergen sensitization and a specific group of adults with rhinosinusitis. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline constitute the first-line of medical treatment for both pediatric and adult rhinosinusitis. Low-dose macrolides are used for immunomodulatory activities and beneficial effects to adult patients with CRSsNP were demonstrated by recent meta-analyses. For surgical treatment, adenoidectomy is a key strategy to eradicate mature biofilms in pediatric CRS and effective in treating children with CRS regardless of the adenoid size. Although endoscopic sinus surgery has been proven to improve quality of life outcomes in adult CRS, it should be only considered in the pediatric CRS after failure of adenoidectomy. Summary: Pediatric and adult CRS are different in many aspects, including immunopathogenesis and management. Investigations should be considered in specific cases. After failure of medical treatments, endoscopic sinus surgery is recommended for adults, while adenoidectomy is primarily considered for children.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine"

Herein, we aimed to provide an efficient technique for target prediction using homopharma and network-based methods, which is reliable and expeditious to hunt for the possible human targets of three phenolic lipids (anarcardic acid, cardol, and cardanol) related to dengue viral (DENV) infection as a case study. Using several databases, the similarity search and network-based analyses were applied on the three phenolic lipids resulting in the identification of seven possible targets as follows. Based on protein annotation, three phenolic lipids may interrupt or disturb the human proteins, namely KAT5, GAPDH, ACTB, and HSP90AA1, whose biological functions have been previously reported to be involved with viruses in the family Flaviviridae. In addition, these phenolic lipids might inhibit the mechanism of the viral proteins: NS3, NS5, and E proteins. The DENV and human proteins obtained from this study could be potential targets for further molecular optimization on compounds with a phenolic lipid core structure in anti-dengue drug discovery. As such, this pipeline could be a valuable tool to identify possible targets of active compounds.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The optimum condition to synthesize the adsorbent was to irradiate the PAN fibers with 100 kGy gamma ray, amidoximate in 3 (w/v)% hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution for 75 min at 75 °C, yielding the PAN nitrile group conversion of approximately 60%. At 100 kGy, the degree of crystallinity of the irradiated fibers was also highest at 79.1%. The performances of the adsorbent in seawater samples were excellent. By submersion in the seawater sample spiked with 250 ppb of uranium for 4 weeks, the prepared fibers exhibited the adsorption capacity of 32.28 mg/g adsorbent. By submersion in seawater samples spiked with 76.5 ppm of uranium for 1 week and 945 ppm of uranium for up to 4 weeks, the fibers exhibited the adsorption capacities of 111.25 and 200.07 mg/g adsorbent, respectively. The adsorbent showed a uranium adsorption capacity of 0.11 mg/g adsorbent for 8 weeks of soaking in brine concentrate from a seawater reverse osmosis plant. The kinetics of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 300% in 5 min or less. Another important finding was that the prepared PAN fibers exhibit the characteristics of a superabsorbent material (equilibrium swelling ratio in DI water of 5,550%). The low cost and the ease of preparation of the fibers offer a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ions released into seawater following a nuclear accident.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, coastal and ocean engineeringneering, physics",Radiation

A total of 168 APEC isolates, equal numbers from Australian and Thai broilers/broiler breeders, were identified and tested for their susceptibility to ten antimicrobial agents. Most of the Thai APEC isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) (60.7%) whilst Australian APEC isolates showed a MDR rate of just 10.7%. The Thai APEC isolates exhibited high resistance to tetracycline (TET) (84.5%), amoxicillin (AMX) (70.2%) and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (51.2%) whilst the Australian APEC isolates showed lower levels of resistance (TET 36.9%, AMX 29.8%, SXT 17.86%). The 34 Thai APEC and four Australian APEC isolates which were resistant to nalidixic acid were characterized for their carriage of mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. While no mutations were detected in gyrB in the Thai isolates, the Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn substitutions in gyrA and Ser80Ile in parC were common (n = 9/34). In regard to the Australian isolates, the Ser83Leu and Asp678Glu substitution in gyrA, Pro385Ala and Ser492Asn in gyrB and Met241Ile and Asp475Glu in parC were identified (n = 3/4). Rep-PCR analysis of the 84 Thai and 84 Australian APEC isolates showed 16 main clusters that mostly contained isolates from both countries. Our results suggest that the emergence of MDR is a major concern for the Thai APEC isolates and that more prudent use of antimicrobial agents in Thai poultry production is required.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Immunology and Microbiology (all)"

An IoT-Based Thermal Model Learning Framework for Smart Buildings,"Zhang X., Pipattanasomporn M., Chen T., Rahman S.",2020-01-01,"Building climate controls, Building energy managements, Building Thermal models, Building thermal simulation, Energy savings potential, Environmental conditions, Internet of Things (IOT), Reduce energy consumption, Building energy management (BEM), building thermal model, Internet of Things (IoT), smart buildings","With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, implementing intelligent controls in buildings to reduce energy consumption is becoming increasingly popular. Building climate control is of strong research interest due to high energy savings potentials associated with heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) controls. Because the operation of HVAC systems directly influences occupant thermal comfort, building-specific thermal models are needed for proper control. Such models describe how indoor temperature changes under different environmental conditions and HVAC status. Previous studies mainly developed thermal models for accurate building thermal simulation which are not practical for use in real-world applications as they require domain knowledge and lengthy building-by-building configuration. In this article, taking advantage of IoT technologies, a plug-and-play learning framework is proposed to automatically identify the thermal model of each thermal zone in a building without manual configuration. In contrast to the existing methods, a thermal model is learned using low-resolution temperature readings from IoT-based smart thermostats. The learning framework has been validated using the data collected from an IoT platform installed in a building over a summer. The performance of the learned model and the error of indoor temperature prediction based on this model have been evaluated and quantified. Findings demonstrate the learning process can be automated with either edge-computing or cloud-computing. This article shows the validity of the proposed IoT-based thermal model learning framework and offers a pragmatic solution for providing reliable thermal models to future smart building climate controls.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Signal Processing, Information Systems, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications"

The ripeness checking of durian is very important for fruit marketing and durian exports. To check the ripeness of durians in Thailand, there are many existing methods to increase the efficiency of the durian harvesting and exporting. A common method is knocking a few times using a rubber-tipped stick. This paper proposes a method to indicate the ripeness of durians. The total of 30 durian samples is used to collect the knocking sound data. Then we separate sound data into 0.3 seconds of each durian knocking sound interval. The dataset was recorded from a durian exporter in the Chanthaburi Province using a smartphone. Our method applies the convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the durian sound. The durian sound received from the percussion is then contained in a dataset. The dataset. We, then, classify each dataset into three classes of ripeness: ripe, mid-ripe, and unripe. A process of audio extraction applies Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient spectrogram (MFCC) to extraction a feature of durian sound and utilizes a set of feature as training data. This dataset is used as the training information for CNN. An experimental results of our model shows an accuracy around 90.78% of validation data and 89.47% of testing data.

The alternative solution is the combustion unit that prevents CO2 from releasing. Chemical looping combustion is the combustion unit that can achieve this objective and provides high purity of a CO2 product for meaningful uses. The high efficiency of the process is achieved by designing good reactor hydrodynamics. A dual circulating fluidized bed reactor was then investigated in this study. The two parameters were studied; the temperature of the reactor (A) and the ratio of coal velocity to the weight of oxygen carrier (B). The two responses were analyzed; 1) combustible gas percentage from a fuel reactor, and 2) CO2 percentage from an air reactor. The 3k factorial experimental was used for systematic experimental design which included the curvature behavior of the result. The results indicated that parameters A and B affected the combustible gas percentage from the fuel reactor. However, only B affected the CO2 percentage from the air reactor. The high A and B gave a high combustible gas percentage from the fuel reactor and high CO2 percentage from the air reactor. The high combustible gas percentage from the fuel reactor indicated the incomplete combustion and the high CO2 percentage from the air reactor indicated the high CO2 releasing to the environment. The low values of A and B then supported the proper hydrodynamics in these reactors which will provide the efficiency of fuel usage, the reduction of CO2 emission to the environment, and the mitigation of the environmental crisis.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)

The biomimetic synthesis of rhytidenone A was achieved by a Michael reaction/aldol/lactonization cascade in a single step from the proposed biosynthetic precursor rhytidenone F. Moreover, the mode of action of the highly cytotoxic rhytidenone F was investigated. The pulldown assay coupled with mass spectrometry analysis revealed the target protein PA28γ is covalently attached to rhytidenone F at the Cys92 residue. The interactions of rhytidenone F with PA28γ lead to the accumulation of p53, which is an essential tumor suppressor in humans. Consequently, the Fas-dependent signaling pathway is activated to initiate cellular apoptosis. These studies have identified the first small-molecule inhibitor targeting PA28γ, suggesting rhytidenone F may serve as a promising natural product lead for future anticancer drug development.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Therefore, this cross-sectional study investigated the association between TBS and severe periodontitis. Methods: Eight hundred and five Thai participants, aged 30 to 82 years, underwent bone quality assessment. Their mean TBS was calculated from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images at the L1 to L4 lumbar spine using TBS software. Each participant was classified as normal, partially degraded, or degraded TBS. Full-mouth periodontal examinations determined plaque score, probing depth, clinical attachment level (CAL), and the number of remaining teeth. The participants were classified as non-severe or severe periodontitis. Differences in periodontal parameters between the TBS groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The association between TBS and severe periodontitis was assessed with multivariate binary logistic regression. For severe periodontitis, the additive interaction between TBS and oral hygiene status was also analyzed. Results: The mean CAL was 0.9-mm higher in the degraded TBS group compared with the normal TBS group. Degraded TBS was associated with severe periodontitis with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 4.26). The combination of degraded TBS and plaque score ≥80% increased the adjusted OR to 5.71 (95% CI = 1.15 to 28.43). Conclusions: Degraded TBS is associated with severe periodontitis and has a synergistic effect with poor oral hygiene, suggesting monitoring decreased bone quality and good oral hygiene for promoting the periodontal-systemic health of these individuals.",dentistry,Periodontics

Among the different types of oil palm residues, i.e., trunk, frond, and empty fruit bunch, the trunk residue offers the highest synthesis gas (syngas) (H2 and CO) yields via the gasification process; therefore, it was selected as the biomass model compound. The effect of gasification operating conditions on the syngas composition, yield, bio-methanol production, energy consumption, and exergy performance was examined. The yield of syngas increased with increasing gasifying temperature, whereas that of bio-methanol exhibited the opposite trend due to the decrease in H2 concentration of the syngas. The gasifier was an important unit for enhancing the exergy efficiency of the system, which was decreased when the equivalent ratio (ER) and gasifying temperature increased. Recirculating pressure swing adsorption offgas to the gasifier did not benefit bio-methanol production, nor did it improve energy and exergy performance. The maximum yield of bio-methanol was achieved by a once-through process that maintained the gasifying temperature at 750 °C and ER at 0.25. Under these conditions, the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies were 38.57 and 25.44%, respectively.","petroleum engineeringneering, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Etiologies for acute kidney injury (AKI) vary by geographic region and socioeconomic status. While considerable information is now available on AKI in the Americas, Europe and China, large comprehensive epidemiologic studies of AKI from Southeast Asia (SEA) are still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates and characteristics of AKI among intensive care unit (ICU) patients in Thailand. Methods. We conducted the largest prospective observational study of AKI in SEA. The data were serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission by registration in electronic web-based format. AKI status was defined by full Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria. We used AKI occurrence as the clinical outcome and explored the impact of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors on the development and progression of AKI. Results. We enrolled 5476 patients from 17 ICU centres across Thailand from February 2013 to July 2015. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 2471 of 4668 patients (52.9%). Overall, the maximum AKI stage was Stage 1 in 7.5%, Stage 2 in 16.5% and Stage 3 in 28.9%. In the multivariable adjusted model, we found that older age, female sex, admission to a regional hospital,medical ICU, high body mass index, primary diagnosis of cardiovascular-related disease and infectious disease, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, non-renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, underlying anemia and use of vasopressors were all independent risk factors for AKI development. Conclusions. In Thai ICUs, AKI is very common. Identification of risk factors of AKI development will help in the development of a prognostic scoring model for this population and should help in decisionmaking for timely intervention, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.","clinical chemistryistry; physicsiology; kidney; pathophysicsiology, medical","Nephrology, Transplantation"

This result was strongly consistent with the XRF analysis. The ratio of activated carbon to sodium chloride 1:2 (w/w) exhibited the highest iodine number (180.95±10.82 mg/g). The factors of adsorption including initial concentration (20-150 ppm) and adsorption time (2-10 h.) The result showed that the optimum conditions of adsorption containing concentration were 65 ppm and adsorption time was 10 h.

In this regard, radon and thoron measurement studies have been widely conducted all over the world. Generally, the techniques used relate to passive nuclear track detectors. Some surveys have shown that passive monitors for radon are sensitive to thoron, and hence some measured results have probably overestimated radon concentrations. This study investigated radon and thoron measurements in domestic and international surveys using the passive radon–thoron discriminative monitor, commercially named RADUET. This paper attempts to provide an understanding of discriminative measurements of radon isotopes and to present an evidence-based roadmap.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; radiation, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Cause of Color Modification in Tanzanite after Heat Treatment,"Pluthametwisute T., Wanthanachaisaeng B., Saiyasombat C., Sutthirat C.",2020-08-01,"Aluminum, Calcium, Color, Coloring Agents, Hot Temperature, Silicates, Titanium, Vanadium, Color, Heat treatment, Tanzanite, Zoisite","Natural tanzanites usually show strongly trichroic coloration from violet to blue, and brown colors in different directions. However, this characteristic is easily changed to violet-blue dichroism after heat treatment. Moreover, the cause of color modification after heating is still controversial. A few researchers have previously suggested that trace amounts of either vanadium or titanium substituted in aluminum site should be the main determinant of color after the heat treatment. Alteration of either V3+ to V4+ or Ti3+ to Ti4+ may relate to light absorption around 450–460 nm, which is the main cause. UV/vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), a utility of synchrotron radiation, were applied for this experiment. As a result, the violet-blue absorption band (centered around 450–460 nm) as well as green absorption band (centered around 520 nm) were obviously decreased along the c-axis after heating, and XAS analysis indicated the increasing of the oxidation state of vanadium. This result was well supported by the chemical composition of samples. Consequently, vanadium was strongly suggested as the significant coloring agent in tanzanite after heat treatment.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The most suitable pretreatment condition was found to be saponification with sodium hydroxide at 2× the saponification value, 90 °C for 40 min, providing 100% and 63.5% conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids, respectively, and a 79.4% γ-oryzanol yield. Addition of calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution at 0.3 g CaCl2:1 g of sodium soap (Na-FA) effectively induced the precipitation of γ-oryzanol-containing calcium soap (Ca-FA). Based on experimental solubility measurements, theoretical Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), and a preferential extractability study, the most suitable extraction solvents were suggested to be ethyl acetate and furfural. Ethyl acetate gave a γ-oryzanol selective extractability and recovery of 55.4% and 59.3%, respectively, whilst those for furfural were 55.3% and 62.8%, respectively. In addition to obtaining a high γ-oryzanol yield in a relatively simple and energy efficient process, Ca-FA residue, a high price animal feed supplement, was also obtained by this proposed process.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

However, data among male adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) are limited.Setting: We investigated the incidence and persistence of HR-HPV in anogenital compartments and associated factors among PHIV in comparison to HIV-uninfected (HU) male adolescents in Thailand.Methods: PHIV and HU males aged 12-24 years were enrolled. At baseline and 3 subsequent annual visits, specimens from the scrotum, penis, and anal area were obtained for HPV and other testing.Results: From June 2013 to October 2017, 49 PHIV and 47 HU male adolescents with a median age of 18 (interquartile range 17-20) years were enrolled. PHIV had higher incidence of any HR-HPV infection than HU adolescents {33.05 [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.82 to 52.46] vs. 15.73 [95% CI: 8.18 to 30.22] per 100 person-years, P = 0.04}. The persistence of any HR-HPV genotypes (detected at ≥2 annual visits) was not different by group (PHIV 27% vs. HU 23%, P = 0.75). Having ≥3 sex partners in past 6 months (adjusted prevalence ratio 2.39, 95% CI: 1.14 to 5.05; P = 0.02) and co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (syphilis, chlamydia, and/or gonorrhea) were associated with persistent HR-HPV infection (adjusted prevalence ratio 6.21, 95% CI: 2.87 to 13.41; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Thai PHIV male adolescents had a higher incidence of HR-HPV infection than those without HIV. Having multiple sex partners and co-infection with sexually transmitted infections was associated with persistent HR-HPV infection. These data demonstrate the need to prioritize PHIV male adolescents in routine and catch-up HPV vaccination programs.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

Materials and methods: Left atrial appendages of 65 cadaveric hearts were examined. Results: The prevalence of Cauliflower, Windsock, Cactus and Chicken wing type of LAA were 27.7%, 27.7%, 26.1%, and 18.5%, respectively. LAA with two lobes was the most common. All specimens showed no accessory LAA. The relation of the ostium to the LSPV was found in two types which were mid-type (LAA ostium was at the same level as LSPV) in 29 (44.6%) cases and inferior type (LAA ostium was below the level of LSPV) in 36 (55.4%) cases. The shapes of LAA ostium were oval and round with a prevalence of 55.4% and 44.6%, respectively. The diameter of round type ranged from 9.53 to 21.51 mm with a mean of 14.56 ± 2.6 mm. While in oval type, the long and short diameters ranged from 11.61 to 31.71 mm with a mean of 14.23 ± 4.2 mm and from 6.70 to 23.90 mm with a mean of 11.66 ± 3.5 mm, respectively. The surface area of the ostium was calculated from the ostium diameter, range from 71.29 to 594.92 mm2 with a mean of 169.56 ± 84.73 mm2. There was no statistically significant difference of the surface area between LAA types. The mean functional depth of LAA was 11.57 ± 4.43 mm. The functional depth of the Windsock-type appeared to be statistically significant from the others. However, there was no correlation between the functional depth and the ostium surface area. Conclusions: This morphometric data might be beneficial for deployment of LAA closure device in the Thai population.","genergyal, medical","Anatomy, Histology"
Decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions of the manufacturing and industrial sector in Thailand,"Chontanawat J., Wiboonchutikula P., Buddhivanich A.",2020-01-01,"Carbon emissions, Decomposition analysis, Divisia index method, Emission factors, Industrial sector, International community, Manufacturing sector, Thailand, Carbon emissions, Decomposition, Manufacturing sector, Thailand","Since the 1990s, CO2 emissions have increased steadily in line with the growth of production and the use of energy in the manufacturing sector in Thailand. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Method is used for analysing the sources of changes in CO2 emissions as well as the CO2 emission intensity of the sector in 2000–2018. On average throughout the period, both the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity increased each year relative to the baseline. The structural change effect (effect of changes of manufacturing production composition) reduced, but the intensity effect (effect of changes of CO2 emissions of individual industries) increased the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity. The unfavourable CO2 emission intensity change came from the increased energy intensity of individual industries. The increased use of coal and electricity raised the CO2 emissions, whereas the insignificant change in emission factors showed little impact. Therefore, the study calls for policies that decrease the energy intensity of each industry by limiting the use of coal and reducing the electricity used by the manufacturing sector so that Thailand can make a positive contribution to the international community’s effort to achieve the goal of CO2 emissions reduction.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this work, the adsorption of bovine serum albumin by multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified with mixed H2SO4/HNO3 was investigated. The minimum time to reach adsorption equilibrium was determined to be 6 h for pristine MWCNTs and for MWCNTs with a modified surface. The maximum adsorption capacities of BSA on the pristine and treated MWCNTs were 532.56 and 771.87 mg/g, respectively. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were well fitted to the adsorption data and could best describe the behavior of the adsorption process. The modified surface of the MWCNTs exhibited higher absorbability than the pristine MWCNTs because the modified MWCNTs possessed a greater surface area and large amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups. Moreover, the release characteristics of BSA with MWCNTs exhibited a relatively rapid initial release phase, followed by a phase involving a sustained release. The study could be used for prolonged drug release model in medical applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

There was a plateau in the shear storage modulus in the low frequency region, demonstrating that such solutions have a network structure attributed to hydrogen bonding of the PVA. The value of the plateau modulus evidently decreased with temperature and with the addition of lithium salts. The experimental results also demonstrated that the anion species in the salt plays an important role in determining the rheological properties, including the magnitude of the plateau modulus. The iodide anion, which is classified as a “water-structure-breaker” ion in the Hofmeister series, effectively decreased both oscillatory shear moduli including the plateau modulus. However, the effect of adding LiI decreased at high temperatures, owing to the reduced extent of hydrogen bonding.","fluid mechanics, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

As a proof of concept study, we activated macrophages with BG combined with LPS (BG + LPS). We found that BG + LPS predominantly upregulated Syk expression and proinflammatory cytokines in FcgRIIb-/- macrophages compared with wild-type (WT) macrophages. Syk inhibition downregulated several inflammatory pathways in FcgRIIb-/- macrophages activated with BG + LPS, as determined by RNA sequencing analysis, suggesting the potential anti-inflammatory impact of Syk inhibitors in lupus. Indeed, administration of a Syk inhibitor prior to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis in FcgRIIb-/- mice reduced baseline lupus-induced proinflammatory cytokines and attenuated sepsis severity as evaluated by mortality, organ injury, serum LPS, and post-sepsis serum cytokines. In conclusion, it was easier to induce Syk expression in FcgRIIb-/- macrophages than in WT macrophages. This might be because of the loss of inhibitory signaling, which might be responsible for prominent Syk abundance in the spleens of 40-week-old FcgRIIb-/- mice and the potent effect of Syk inhibitor in lupus mice compared with WT.",medical,Immunology and Allergy

Expanding statin use may help alleviate this burden. However, the choice of statin in the context of antiretroviral therapy is challenging. Pravastatin and pitavastatin improve cholesterol levels in PLHIV without interacting substantially with antiretroviral therapy. They are also more expensive than most statins. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin and pitavastatin for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. Methods: We developed a discrete-state microsimulation model that randomly selected (with replacement) individuals from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database cohort who were aged 40 to 75 years, receiving antiretroviral therapy in Thailand, and not using lipid-lowering therapy. The model simulated each individual’s probability of experiencing CVD. We evaluated: (1) treating no one with statins; (2) treating everyone with pravastatin 20mg/day (drug cost 7568 Thai Baht ($US243)/year) and (3) treating everyone with pitavastatin 2 mg/day (drug cost 8182 Baht ($US263)/year). Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assigned in annual cycles over a 20-year time horizon and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed the Thai healthcare sector perspective. Results: Pravastatin was estimated to be less effective and less cost-effective than pitavastatin and was therefore dominated (extended) by pitavastatin. Patients receiving pitavastatin accumulated 0.042 additional QALYs compared with those not using a statin, at an extra cost of 96,442 Baht ($US3095), giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,300,000 Baht ($US73,812)/QALY gained. These findings were sensitive to statin costs and statin efficacy, pill burden, and targeting of PLHIV based on CVD risk. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Baht ($US5135)/QALY gained, we estimated that pravastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 415 Baht ($US13.30)/year and pitavastatin would become cost-effective at an annual cost of 600 Baht ($US19.30)/year. Conclusions: Neither pravastatin nor pitavastatin were projected to be cost-effective for the primary prevention of CVD among PLHIV in Thailand who are not currently using lipid-lowering therapy. We do not recommend expanding current use of these drugs among PLHIV in Thailand without substantial price reduction.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a latency-based hazard perception test for Thai drivers. The initial test comprised our full item pool of 77 clips containing traffic conflicts captured on video from the driver's perspective on Thai roads. We evaluated the validity of this test by examining whether performance differed as a function of driving experience in a sample of 135 Thai drivers. We found that experienced drivers (n = 87) performed significantly better than novice drivers (n = 48) after adjusting for individual differences in computer mouse skill, mirroring crash risk differences between these groups. The final 30-item version of the test, which comprised the best items from the initial test, yielded novice/experienced driver differences with or without adjusting for computer mouse skill. These results offer preliminary support for the validity of the latency-based test as a measure of hazard perception ability in Thai drivers.","accidentistrys and accidentistry prevention, fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology, psychology","Civil and Structural Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Transportation, Applied Psychology"

Using positional information at 3.6 and 4.5 μm (from Spitzer-IRAC) as well as the Very Large Array (VLA) at 3 GHz, we explore the presence of galaxies detected at 1.1 mm with ALMA below our original blind detection limit of 4.8-σ, at which the number of spurious sources starts to dominate over that of real sources. In order to ensure the most reliable counterpart association possible, we have investigated the astrometry differences between different instruments in the GOODS-South field. In addition to a global offset between the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) already discussed in previous studies, we have highlighted a local offset between ALMA and the HST that was artificially introduced in the process of building the mosaic of the GOODS-South image. We created a distortion map that can be used to correct for these astrometric issues. In this Supplementary Catalog, we find a total of 16 galaxies, including two galaxies with no counterpart in HST images (also known as optically dark galaxies), down to a 5σ limiting depth of H = 28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). This brings the total sample of GOODS-ALMA 1.1 mm sources to 35 galaxies. Galaxies in the new sample cover a wider dynamic range in redshift (z = 0.65-4.73), are on average twice as large (1.3 vs 0.65 kpc), and have lower stellar masses (M∗SC = 7.6 × 1010 M· vs M∗MC = 1.2 × 1011 M·). Although exhibiting larger physical sizes, these galaxies still have far-infrared sizes that are significantly more compact than inferred from their optical emission.","extraterrestrial physicsics and stellar phenomena, fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

This novel approach is designed to suppress the contribution to the signal of the increased number of out-of-time interactions per beam crossing following the reduction of the accelerator bunch spacing from 50 to 25 ns at the start of Run 2 of the LHC. Execution of the algorithm is sufficiently fast for it to be employed in the CMS high-level trigger. It is also used in the offline event reconstruction.

This mismanagement can cause many negative effects to both environment and the quality of life of the residential area nearby. One of the common mismanagements for WEEE in Thailand is mostly occurred for WEEE waste collection centers, leading to high possibilities in contamination and spreading of hazardous materials. In this study, the waste collecting area in the north-eastern part of Thailand were selected as an investigation area for monitoring and analyzing the collection-route of the WEEE. Geographic Information System (GIS) were applied to demonstrates the collecting route of the wastes and the precise location of the stakeholders in waste collection and transportation based on recorded GPS data from 9 GPS device, attached to 12 pick-up trucks. The results showed that WEEE was transported from nearby provinces which mainly were Khon Kaen, Chaiyaphum, and Nakhon Ratchasima. Spatial analysis, considered to be one of the most effective geographical method, were applied to designate the suitable area or coordinates based on significant criteria which was regulations regarding to water resources, residential area, and airport. The information of waste collecting route, land use, water resources and regulations were integrated in order to specify the suitable area for the developing of the official WEEE waste collection center. The results of the study indicate that current wastes collection area and transportation should be diminished and the suitable area for setting up the new center can be specified.","water engineeringneering, environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"

Recent studies suggest the potential of mosquito-associated microbiota as a source for new biocontrol agents or new insecticidal chemotypes. In this study, we identified a strain of Serratia marcescens that has larvicidal activity against Anopheles dirus, an important malaria vector in Southeast Asia. This bacterium secretes heat-labile larvicidal macromolecules when cultured under static condition at 25°C but not 37°C. Two major protein bands of approximately 55 kDa and 110 kDa were present in spent medium cultured at 25°C but not at 37°C. The Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of these two protein bands identified several proteases and chitinases that were previously reported for insecticidal properties against agricultural insect pests. The treatment with protease and chitinase inhibitors led to a reduction in larvicidal activity, confirming that these two groups of enzymes are responsible for the macromolecule's toxicity. Taken together, our results suggest a potential use of these enzymes in the development of larvicidal agents against Anopheles mosquitoes.","genergyal, Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

The heterogeneity of ME/CFS and the confusion over its classification have undoubtedly contributed to this, although this would seem a consequence of the complexity of the array of ME/CFS presentations and high levels of diverse comorbidities. This article reviews the biological underpinnings of ME/CFS presentations, including the interacting roles of the gut microbiome/permeability, endogenous opioidergic system, immune cell mitochondria, autonomic nervous system, microRNA-155, viral infection/re-awakening and leptin as well as melatonin and the circadian rhythm. This details not only relevant pathophysiological processes and treatment options, but also highlights future research directions. Due to the complexity of interacting systems in ME/CFS pathophysiology, clarification as to its biological underpinnings is likely to considerably contribute to the understanding and treatment of other complex and poorly managed conditions, including fibromyalgia, depression, migraine, and dementia. The gut and immune cell mitochondria are proposed to be two important hubs that interact with the circadian rhythm in driving ME/CFS pathophysiology.","cell and developmental biology; membranes and cell transport; cytoplasmic membranes; mitochondria, pharmacology, neuroscience","Pharmacology, Biological Psychiatry"
Heteroatom doped iron-based catalysts prepared by urea self-combustion method for efficient CO2 hydrogenation,"Guo L., Li J., Zeng Y., Kosol R., Cui Y., Kodama N., Guo X., Prasert R., Tharapong V., Liu G., Wu J., Yang G., Yoneyama Y., Tsubaki N.",2020-09-15,"Catalyst preparation, Catalytic hydrogenation, Catalytic performance, CO2 hydrogenation, Iron-based catalyst, Olefin hydrogenation, Self-combustion, Spinel catalyst, Bimetallic catalyst, CO2 hydrogenation, Iron catalyst, Olefins, Spinel structure","This work describes a novel route for the fabrication of heteroatom doped iron-based catalysts (spinel-like structure) through urea self-combustion method, and catalytic performances over these self-combustion catalysts are investigated in detail. It is found that catalytic performances are affected by the properties of doped metals. Owing to the high methanation activity of Ni and Co, NiFe2Ox and CoFe2Ox catalysts present high CH4 selectivity compared to Fe2O3 catalysts. MgFe2Ox exhibits high olefin hydrogenation ability. By contrast, the utilization of Cu and Zn promotes catalytic activity and olefins selectivity via regulating surface CO2 adsorption and carbides content. Among these spinel catalysts, the ZnFe2Ox catalyst shows the best CO2 hydrogenation performance. Enhanced CO2 adsorptions as well as active species of carbides result in the benign hydrogenation behavior. Meanwhile, the effects of Zn/Fe molar ratio are also investigated. It is worth noting that the catalytic performance can be improved regardless of the added amount of Zn promoter. Nevertheless, the catalytic performance reaches the best level when the Zn/Fe molar ratio equals 1/2. The proposed method provides a new strategy different from traditional catalyst preparation process for catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into highly valuable products.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

However, some POLSTs contain combinations of orders that do not translate into a cohesive care plan (eg, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] without intensive care, or intensive care without antibiotics). This study characterizes the prevalence and predictors of POLSTs with conflicting orders. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Large academic health system. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,123 POLST users with chronic life-limiting illness who died between 2010 and 2015 (mean age = 69.7 years). MEASUREMENTS: In a retrospective review of all POLSTs in participants' electronic health records, we describe the prevalence of POLSTs with conflicting orders for cardiac arrest and medical interventions, and use clustered logistic regression to evaluate potential predictors of conflicting orders. We also examine the prevalence of conflicts between POLST orders for antibiotics and artificial nutrition with orders for cardiac arrest or medical interventions. RESULTS: Among 3,924 complete POLSTs belonging to 3,123 decedents, 209 (5.3%) POLSTs contained orders to “attempt CPR” paired with orders for “limited interventions” or “comfort measures only”; 745/3169 (23.5%) POLSTs paired orders to restrict antibiotics with orders to deliver non-comfort-only care; and, 170/3098 (5.5%) POLSTs paired orders to withhold artificial nutrition with orders to deliver CPR or intensive care. Among POLSTs with orders to avoid intensive care, orders to attempt CPR were more likely to be present in POLSTs completed earlier in the patient's illness course (adjusted odds ratio = 1.27 per twofold increase in days from POLST to death; 95% confidence interval = 1.18–1.36; P <.001). CONCLUSION: Although most POLSTs are actionable by clinicians, 5% had conflicting orders for cardiac arrest and medical interventions, and 24% had one or more conflicts between orders for cardiac arrest, medical interventions, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition. These conflicting orders make implementation of POLST challenging for clinicians in acute care settings.",medical,Geriatrics and Gerontology

It carries the initial boom for most emerging nations in their journey towards improved economic growth. The present study employs Quantile on Quantile regression, which is a unique methodology and has the tendency to establish the relationship between variables that are non-linear in nature across various quantile distributions. Moreover, the method stated helps in explaining the asymmetric response in the quantiles of economic growth of the countries studied caused by the quantiles of the textile and clothing industry. The quarterly data ranges from 1990 to 2018, and findings therefrom endorse the presence of a positive relationship between TTC and economic growth in all Asian Countries studied. In addition to this, the direction of the relationships in the quantiles was also evaluated by Granger causality, which revealed the presence of bidirectional causal effects in all countries, excluding Japan, Pakistan and Turkey, where it was found as uni-directional. Lastly, based on the findings, the government and policy making institutions are recommended for the introduction of certain programs that will incentivize and provide subsidies to potential investors, thus relaxing the competition for new entrants in the TTC sector.","fluidex; related topics, Business, Materials Science, environmental, engineering","Business and International Management, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Environmental Science (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Diversion of unused opioids contributes to the opioid epidemic.Methods:Patients ≥16 years old undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or inguinal hernia repair in 14 hospitals from 8 countries during a 6-month period were included. Medical records were systematically reviewed to identify: (1) preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics, (2) opioid intake within 3 months preoperatively, (3) opioid prescription upon discharge, and (4) opioid refills within 3 months postoperatively. The median/range and mean/standard deviation of number of pills and OME were compared between the US and non-US patients.Results:A total of 4690 patients were included. The mean age was 49 years, 47% were female, and 4% had opioid use history. Ninety-one percent of US patients were prescribed opioids, compared to 5% of non-US patients (P < 0.001). The median number of opioid pills and OME prescribed were 20 (0-135) and 150 (0-1680) mg for US versus 0 (0-50) and 0 (0-600) mg for non-US patients, respectively (both P < 0.001).

It consists of two main processes: a fuel reactor and an air reactor. In the fuel reactor, fuel reacts with solid metal oxide particles to produce heat, CO2 and H2O vapor which later can be easily separated by the condensation. The reacted solid metal is then sent to the air reactor for regenerating via an oxidation reaction with air before being returned to the fuel reactor. In this study, these reactors in the CLC system are integrated as a circulating fluidized bed system and a dynamic model has been developed for the system. The fuel reactor (or downer) operates in bubbling fluidization regime where the air reactor (or riser) operates in fast fluidization regime. Using the developed dynamic model, the transient responses of various control variables such as the temperature of two fluidized bed reactors, pressure and the liquid level of a condenser have been controlled by manipulating variables such as heat transfer rates of the reactors, gas outlet flow rate and liquid outlet flow rate of the condenser. A proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller was tuned for controlling purpose. The integral of the absolute value of error (IAE) is used to evaluate the control system performance.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)

The effects of surfactants viz. Tween 80 (at 0.25 to 0.75% wt) and lecithin (at 1% wt) and of a stabilizer viz. chitosan (at 0 to 0.375% wt) on the characteristics of curcumin-based emulsions as well as on physicochemical properties of the resulting spray-dried encapsulated powder were determined. The optimal emulsion was noted to be the one formulated with 0.50 and 0.25% wt, respectively, of Tween 80 and chitosan (T0.50/C0.25). Spray-dried powder prepared from the optimal emulsion was compared to that prepared from an emulsion with 0.5% Tween 80 and 0% chitosan (T0.50/C0.00), as well as that from an emulsion with 0.25% Tween 80 and 0.25% chitosan (T0.25/C0.25). Physical properties of all powders were not significantly different. However, the encapsulation efficiency of T0.50/C0.25 powder (72.28%) was significantly higher than those of T0.50/C0.00 (47.19%) and T0.25/C0.25 powder (51.61%). Ferric reducing antioxidant powers of T0.50/C0.25 and T0.25/C0.25 powders were comparable but significantly higher than that of T0.50/C0.00 powder. After reconstitution, the mean particle sizes of T0.50/C0.25 and T0.25/C0.25 remained unchanged due to the protection by chitosan. T0.50/C0.00 powder was noted to exhibit the highest bioaccessibility (89.32%) in the simulated gastrointestinal tract. Practical Application: The results of this study can be used as a guideline to develop a stable formulation of curcumin feed emulsion that can later be transformed into an encapsulated powdery form via spray drying. Such a guideline should prove useful for a company looking for a way to produce high-quality functional ingredients and/or products from curcumin.","genergyal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of cyanidin against MG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. Exposure of cells to cytotoxic levels of MG (500 µM) for 12 h caused a significant reduction in cell viability. However, the pretreatment of cells with cyanidin alone (6.25–100 µM) for 12 h, or cotreatment of cells with cyanidin (3.13–100 µM) and MG, protected against cell cytotoxicity. In the cotreatment condition, cyanidin (33.3 and 100 µM) also decreased MG-induced apoptosis as determined by caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, INS-1 cells treated with MG increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during a 6 h exposure. The MG-induced increase in ROS production was inhibited by cyanidin (33.3 and 100 µM) after 3 h stimulation. Furthermore, MG diminished the activity of glyoxalase 1 (Glo-1) and its gene expression as well as the level of total glutathione. In contrast, cyanidin reversed the inhibitory effect of MG on Glo-1 activity and glutathione levels. Interestingly, cyanidin alone was capable of increasing Glo-1 activity and glutathione levels without affecting Glo-1 mRNA expression. These findings suggest that cyanidin exerts a protective effect against MG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells by increasing the activity of Glo-1.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The spatial variability of ks and van Genuchten parameters (a, n) are simulated by random field theory using the Cholesky decomposition technique. An infinite unsaturated soil slope model is employed for stability analysis. A transient seepage analysis is conducted by random finite element method (RFEM) to obtain the pore water pressure distribution. Next, a stability analysis is performed to indicate the failure mechanism of slope. A numerical procedure for a probabilistic analysis of slope is performed based on Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the failure probability of slope is highly influenced by the spatial variability of SWCC.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology

Methods: Patients who underwent rectus muscle surgery between November 2018 and April 2019 were included. During surgery, the limbal-insertion distance (LID) distance was measured in millimeters with calipers from the limbus to the center of the insertion at the anterior border of the rectus muscle prior to and after disinsertion. The primary outcome was the shift of the rectus muscle insertion after disinsertion. This was calculated by subtracting the LID after disinsertion from the LID before disinsertion. The secondary outcome was the identification of preoperative and intraoperative factors that influenced insertion shift. Randomization was performed to select one rectus muscle per patient. Patients with a history of prior scleral buckle procedure, glaucoma drainage device, orbital wall fracture and strabismus surgery in the same rectus muscle were excluded. Results: 110 patients were included. The median (Q1, Q3) LID before disinsertion was shortest for the medial rectus muscle [5.0 (4.5, 6.0)], followed by lateral rectus muscle [6.0 (6.0, 7.0)] and inferior rectus muscle [6.0 (5.5, 7.0)]. The overall median (Q1, Q3) insertion shift was 1.0 (0.8, 1.0) mm (p < .001), which did not significantly differ between each rectus muscle subgroup (p = .158). Factors that influenced the amount of shift were moderate to severe restriction on forced duction testing (FDT) (B = 0.320, SE = 0.105, p = .003) and longer LID before disinsertion (B = 0.172, SE = 0.036, p < .001). Conclusions: We found a significant anterior insertion shift after disinsertion of rectus muscles. Moderate to severe restriction on FDT and longer LID before disinsertion can result in larger insertion shifts.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

Herein, we reported the fabrication and testing of new sensing composite materials based on the conductive poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) nanoparticle and zeolites for sulfur dioxide (SO2) detection at room temperature under the effects of doping, zeolite type, zeolite content, SO2 concentration as well as interferences and humidity. The relative electrical conductivity response depended critically on the doping agent type, doping ratio, and doping temperature. The addition of porous zeolites into the doped-PPP (dPPP) matrix induced the improvement in selectivity and sensing performances towards SO2 as it promoted more surface area for SO2 adsorption and its new synergistic effect with the conductive dPPP, related to the additional conductive polymer doping from the dissolution of the SO2 in intrazeolitic water as identified and reported here. Among all materials, the dPPP/ZSM-5 composite with perchloric acid (HClO4) as the doping agent, the doping ratio of 50:1, the doping temperature of 70 °C, and the zeolite content of 30% exhibited the highest relative response of 25.42 towards 500 mg L−1 SO2 with good repeatability. This composite provided the SO2 sensitivity of 0.0483 L mg−1 with R2 of 0.9927 and the limit of detection (LOD) of 5 mg L−1 as determined from the electrical conductivity signal to noise ratio. The present sensing material is a potential candidate in the practical detection of SO2 at room temperature.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, environmental","Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Spectroscopy"
Forecasting Inbound Tour Daily Demand with Multi Seasonality Pattern: A Case Study of a Tour Operator in Thailand,"Niamjoy P., Phumchusri N.",2020-04-01,"Accurate modeling, Exogenous variables, Mean absolute error, Resource planning, Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages, Seasonal patterns, Time series models, Tour operator, component, forecasting, SARIMA, SARIMAX, TBATS, tour operators, tourism industry","Tour operators is playing an important role in Tourism industry which is the essential part of industries for Thai economy. Accurate tourist forecasting is very important input for resource planning (e.g., tour guides, vehicle, etc.) for Tour operators. This paper proposes and compares time-series models to forecast daily demand (number of tourists) for a case study tour operator using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with exogenous variables model (SARIMAX) and Trigonometric ARMA errors, trend and multiple seasonal patterns (TBATS). The performances are evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). The results show that TBATS is the overall most accurate model to forecast the number of tourists using this tour operator's services. Comparing with the same day last year method (the present method which is the case-study company's existing model), TBATS can reduce errors by 48.9% for tour A, 30.6% for tour B and 15.8% for tour C, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences, engineering, Mathematics","Management Science and Operations Research, Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Control and Optimization"

Although there have been several learning methods recently proposed, based on the interesting concept of discard-after-learn, the performance of these issues: the learning speed, number of redundant neurons, and classification accuracy of these methods can be further improved in terms of faster speed, less number of neurons, and higher accuracy. The following new concepts and approaches were proposed in this paper: (1) a more generic structure of hyper-ellipsoidal function called Scalable Hyper-Ellipsoidal Function (SHEF) capable of handling the problem of a curse of dimensionality by introducing a regularization parameter into the covariance matrix of SHEF; (2) a new recursive function to update the covariance matrix of SHEF based on only the incoming data chunk; (3) a fast and easy conditions to test the states of being overlapped, inside, and touching of two SHEFs; (4) a new distance measure for determining the class of a queried datum based on the projected distance on only one discriminant vector, namely the Projection Ratio. The experimental results show the significant improvement when compared with the results from VLLDA, ILDA, LOL, VEBF, and CIL in terms of classification accuracy, the number of generated neurons, and computational time.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

We hypothesized that low nitric oxide bioavailability due to the presence of cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) increases vascular tone in severe malaria. METHODS: Patients with severe malaria (n = 119), uncomplicated malaria (n = 91), or suspected bacterial sepsis (n = 56), as well as healthy participants (n = 50), were recruited. The systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was estimated from the echocardiographic cardiac index and the mean arterial pressure. RESULTS: SVRI and hematocrit levels were lower and plasma CFH and asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were higher in patients with malaria, compared with healthy participants. In multivariate linear regression models for mean arterial pressure or SVRI in patients with severe malaria, hematocrit and CFH but not asymmetric dimethylarginine were significant predictors. The SVRI was lower in patients with suspected bacterial sepsis than in those with severe malaria, after adjustment for hematocrit and age. Plasma CFH levels correlated positively with the core-peripheral temperature gradient and plasma lactate levels and inversely with the perfusion index. Impaired peripheral perfusion, as reflected by a low perfusion index or a high core-peripheral temperature gradient, predicted mortality in patients with severe malaria. CONCLUSIONS: CFH is associated with mean arterial pressure, SVRI, and peripheral perfusion in patients with severe malaria. This may be mediated through the nitric oxide scavenging potency of CFH, increasing basal vascular tone and impairing tissue perfusion.",medical,Medicine (all)

The climbing vine Mucuna macrocarpa (Fabaceae) needs mammalian pollinators for fruit set. This species is widely distributed in Asia and is pollinated by different mammals in different regions. This study assessed the effects of different pollinators, including their ability to fly, and of herbivores on the fruit set height of M. macrocarpa. The heights of inflorescences and fruits were measured in Kyushu, Okinawa-jima Island (Okinawa), Taiwan, and Thailand. Flying mammalian pollinator (bat) activity was recorded in Okinawa, and non-flying mammalian pollinator activity was recorded in the other three regions. The flowers were observed from the ground to canopy levels in all regions; no fruits were observed at the ground level on Okinawa, whereas fruits were observed from the ground to the canopy levels in Kyushu, Taiwan, and Thailand. In Kyushu, however, fruits were less frequently observed at the ground level. Although pollinators visited flowers located near the ground level, camera traps frequently recorded sika deer (Cervus nippon) feeding on the flowers and fruits near the ground level. Our data show that both the flying ability of pollinators and the density of large-sized herbivores affect the fruit set position.","Agricultural and Biological Sciencescultural products, fluidex; related topics, pollination and seed dispersal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Forestry

Polymorphism of CYP2B6 516G > T has been found to predominantly contribute to efavirenz variability. However, dosage recommendations incorporating CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism have not been investigated in the Thai population. This study aimed to develop a population model of the pharmacokinetic properties of efavirenz, and to investigate the impact of patients' characteristics and CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism on the pharmacokinetic properties of efavirenz. Model-based simulations were performed to provide genotype-based dosage optimization in a Thai population. Methods: Plasma efavirenz concentrations measured at 12 h post-dose in 360 Thai HIV-infected patients with and without tuberculosis were analyzed by the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was used for describing the pharmacokinetic properties of efavirenz. Findings: The allele frequency of CYP2B6 516G > T was 34.17%. The efavirenz oral clearance were 11.9, 8.0, and 2.8 L/h in patients weighing 57 kg and having the CYP2B6 516 GG, 516 GT, and 516 TT genotypes, respectively. The use of rifampicin increased efavirenz oral clearance by 28%. The results from the simulations suggest that efavirenz dosages of 400, 300, and 100 mg once daily in Thai HIV mono-infected patients, and 800, 600, and 200 mg once daily in HIV/tuberculosis co-infected patients carrying CYP2B6 516 GG, 516 GT, and 516 TT, respectively. Implication: The results from this study provide a rationale for efavirenz dose adjustment based on CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism in Thai HIV-infected patients, which could help to improve treatment outcomes in this population.

The key formulation is based upon the principle of stationary total potential energy and the solution procedure follows the concept of Rayleigh-Ritz approximation. A crucial aspect of the proposed technique is to supply the adaptivity to the solution space allowing the accurate representation of the buckled shape via a simple iterative scheme. The bases of such solution space are constructed in an elementwise fashion using the exact, closed-form buckled shape. An element axial force contained in the element shape functions is chosen as an adaptive parameter and the exact buckled shape of each element is achieved when such adaptive parameter converges to the element buckling load. In this study, various effects including the lateral restraints, shear deformation, and material nonlinearity are taken into account, and this, as a result, allows plane frames with/without lateral bracings, columns resting on elastic foundations, inelastic columns, and those with shear deformation to be treated. Results from an extensive numerical study have indicated that the proposed technique yields highly accurate buckling loads, comparable to the analytical and reference solutions, without the mesh refinement. In addition, a relatively low number of iterations is required to achieve the converged buckling load.","engineering, Mathematics","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

Therefore, different retail prices are usually determined for various consumers in the retail market. However, imposed risks from uncertain parameters are a big challenge in the real-time retail market pricing process. This paper proposed a real-time pricing (RTP) framework for various users including residential, commercial, and industrial consumers by the electricity retailer. In addition, uncertainties of various input parameters such as output power of renewable energy resources, electricity demand, and pool market price are modeled using scenario-based stochastic approach while downside risk constraints method is proposed to model risk associated with uncertainties. By implementing this method, electricity retailer will be able to select various risk-based strategies. Furthermore, numerical results illustrate the various risks versus various profits by the occurring of each scenario which helps the retailer for decisions-making in different scenarios. According to obtained results, retailer by choosing of zero risk strategy can reduce its risk by 100% while expected profit is reduced by 2.07%. In addition, offered RTP by the retailer is higher for industrial, commercial, and residential customers, respectively. Finally, risk-averse and risk-neutral strategies of electricity retailer are determined in the power procurement problem.","fluidex; related topics, fuel and energygy, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Energy (all), Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, TLR3 signaling can also harbor pro-tumorigenic consequences. Therefore, we examined the status of TLR3 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cases to better understand TLR3 signaling and explore the potential therapeutic target in CCA. Methods: The expression of TLR3 and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in primary CCA tissues was assayed by Immunohistochemical staining and their associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival data were evaluated. The effects of TLR3 ligand, Poly(I:C) and Smac mimetic, an IAP antagonist on CCA cell death and invasion were determined by cell death detection methods and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL and inhibitors targeting NF-κB and MAPK signaling were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Results: TLR3 was significantly higher expressed in tumor than adjacent normal tissues. We demonstrated in a panel of CCA cell lines that TLR3 was frequently expressed in CCA cell lines, but was not detected in a nontumor cholangiocyte. Subsequent in vitro study demonstrated that Poly(I:C) specifically induced CCA cell death, but only when cIAPs were removed by Smac mimetic. Cell death was also switched from apoptosis to necroptosis when caspases were inhibited in CCA cells-expressing RIPK3. In addition, RIPK1 was required for Poly(I:C) and Smac mimetic-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Of particular interest, high TLR3 or low RIPK1 status in CCA patients was associated with more invasiveness. In vitro invasion demonstrated that Poly(I:C)-induced invasion through NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, the loss of RIPK1 enhanced Poly(I:C)-induced invasion and ERK activation in vitro. Smac mimetic also reversed Poly(I:C)-induced invasion, partly mediated by RIPK1. Finally, a subgroup of patients with high TLR3 and high RIPK1 had a trend toward longer disease-free survival (p = 0.078, 28.0 months and 10.9 months). Conclusion: RIPK1 plays a pivotal role in TLR3 ligand, Poly(I:C)-induced cell death when cIAPs activity was inhibited and loss of RIPK1 enhanced Poly(I:C)-induced invasion which was partially reversed by Smac mimetic. Our results suggested that TLR3 ligand in combination with Smac mimetic could provide therapeutic benefits to the patients with CCA.

The composition of emulsion, i.e. tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and n-octadecane or methyl palmitate, was varied to find the optimal conditions for encapsulation. The influence of composition and process time on PCM's emulsion stability, size and structure of microcapsules, and encapsulation efficiency were investigated. The results showed that the optimal PCM to silica ratio was determined by the maximum quantity that could maintain the rigidity of the microcapsule structure. The low surfactant concentration that could still sustain emulsion stability contributed to improved encapsulation efficiency.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)
Pd modification and supporting effects on catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene and diethyl ether over W/TiO2 catalysts,"Tresatayawed A., Glinrun P., Autthanit C., Jongsomjit B.",2020-01-01,"Catalyst characterization, Catalytic dehydration, Ethanol conversion, Ethanol dehydration, Incipientwetness impregnation, Reaction temperature, Sequential impregnation, Supporting effect, Catalysis, Chemical Phenomena, Ethanol, Ether, Ethylenes, Hydrolysis, Palladium, Temperature, Titanium, Tungsten, Diethyl ether, Ethanol dehydration, Ethylene, Palladium, Titania, Tungsten","In the present work, the palladium (Pd) modification and supporting effect of W/Ti02 catalysts on catalytic ethanol dehydration to ethylene and diethyl ether were investigated. The Pd modification with different sequence of Pd and W impregnation on the catalysts was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation technique. The catalyst characterization and activity testing revealed that the different sequence during impregnation influenced the physicochemical properties and ethanol conversion of catalyst. The differences in structure and surface properties were investigated by XRD, BET, SEM, EDX, XPS and NH3-TPD. Upon the reaction temperature between 200 to 400°C, it was found that the conversion increased with increasing of temperature for all catalysts. The Pd incorporated into catalysts enhanced the ethanol conversion depending on the sequence of impregnation. At low temperature (ca. 200 to 300°C), diethyl ether is a major product and the Pd modification over W/Ti02 catalyst resulted in increased diethyl ether yield. This is because an increase of ethanol conversion was obtained with Pd modification, while diethyl ether selectivity did not change. This can be attributed to the higher amount of weak acids sites present after Pd modification into catalyst. Among all catalysts, the PdW/Ti02 catalyst (coimpregnation) achieved the highest diethyl ether yield of 41.4% at 300°C. At high temperature (ca. 350 to 400°C), ethylene is the major product. The W/Pd/Ti02 catalyst (with sequential impregnation of Pd on Ti02 followed by W) exhibited the highest ethylene yield of 68.1% at 400°C. It can be concluded that the modification of Pd onto W/Ti02 upon different sequence of Pd and W impregnation can improve the diethyl ether and ethylene yield in catalytic ethanol dehydration.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Materials and methods: 3D proton density CUBE MRI of 6 cadaveric knees without significant osteoarthritis (OA) was acquired, 0.25-mm resolution. Menisci were evaluated and classified intact or torn. MR data were transferred to ImageJ program to segment tibial 3D volume of interest (VOI). Data was subdivided into meniscus-covered/meniscus-uncovered regions. Segmented VOI was classified into binary data, trabeculae/bone marrow. The trabecular bone data was used to measure MR biomarkers (apparent subchondral plate–connected bone density (adapted from spine MR), apparent trabecular bone volume fraction, apparent mean trabecular thickness, apparent connectivity density, and structure model index (SMI)). Mean value of parameters was analyzed for the effects of meniscal tear/tibial coverage. Results: Nine torn menisci and 3 intact menisci were present. MR measures of bone varied significantly due to meniscal coverage/tear. Subchondral plate–connected bone density under covered meniscus regions increased from 10.9 to 23.5% with meniscal tear. Values increased in uncovered regions, 19.3% (intact) and 32.4% (torn). This reflects higher density when uncovered (p = 0.048) with meniscal tear (p = 0.007). Similar patterns were found for trabecular bone fraction (coverage p < 0.001, tear p = 0.047), trabecular thickness (coverage p = 0.03), connectivity density (coverage p = 0.002), and SMI (coverage p = 0.015). Conclusion: Quantitative trabecular bone evaluation emphasizes intrinsic structural differences between meniscus-covered/meniscus-uncovered tibias. Results offer insight into bone adaptation with meniscal tear and support the hypothesis that subchondral bone plate–connected bone density could be important in early subchondral bone adaptation.",medical,"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

RESULTS: Thickness and transparency were variable and dependent on the formulations. Alterations in color properties of all supplemented films were unnoticeable by unaided human eyes, with ΔE less than 3. Lactobacillus casei-01® and Orafti®GR were associated with higher water solubility of the films. Lactobacillus casei-01® decreased the water vapor permeability of the films while Orafti®GR promoted it. The mechanical properties in all combinations remained unchanged, although those with Orafti®GR showed profoundly reduced tensile strength. Scanning electron micrographs and Fourier transform infrared spectra of the films confirmed good homogeneity and intermolecular attraction between the prebiotic and konjac glucomannan. Cell viability in the films stored at room temperature decreased sharply, becoming less than the minimum recommended level after day 4, while viable L. casei-01® in coatings on bread buns gradually decreased, with a reduction of ca. 2 log colony-forming units (CFU) portion−1 over the 7 day storage period at room temperature. CONCLUSION: The synbiotic film and coating developed in this study are a relatively simple strategy for incorporating L. casei-01® and Orafti®GR into bread buns, which are short shelf-life foods.

Proteomic profiles of unilateral cryptorchidism in pigs at different ages using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS) approaches,"Yimpring N., Roytrakul S., Jaresitthikunchai J., Phaonakrop N., Krobthong S., Suriyaphol G.",2020-10-02,"Age Factors, Animals, Chromatography, Liquid, Cryptorchidism, Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein, Male, Peptide Fragments, Proteome, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Swine, Swine Diseases, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Testis, Cryptorchidism, In-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), Pig, Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18)","Background: Cryptorchidism is a condition that occurs when one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum. It is a common congenital disorder, causing economic loss in pig production. However, there have been only limited studies of differential protein expression profiles in undescended testes (UDTs) in the abdomen and descended testes (DTs) in cryptorchid pigs, especially at the peptidome and proteome levels. The present study aimed to analyze the peptidome of UDTs and DTs in unilateral cryptorchid pigs aged 1-2, 6, 15 and 20 weeks and in normal testes of healthy pigs aged 1-2 and 12 weeks, using peptide mass fingerprinting and three-dimensional principal component analysis (3D-PCA) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and to identify potential protein candidates, using in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). Western blot analysis was used to verify protein expression. Protein sequence was affirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: A PCA plot showed a discrete cluster for each sample group. Peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) demonstrated unique peptide fragments in UDTs at different ages. A number of markedly expressed proteins from GeLC-MS/MS were identified, including the multifunctional tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18), in DTs at 1-2 and 6 weeks and in UDTs at 15 and 20 weeks of age. Using western blot analysis, high expression of TNFRSF18 was observed in the UDTs at 15 weeks. Using the STITCH database, this protein was found to be related to apoptosis, corresponding to the previous report in the UDTs at the same age. Conclusions: The present study revealed the specific PMFs and clusters for porcine cryptorchidism, and a novel protein, TNFRSF18, associated with the disease mechanism. These results could provide further insights into the pathogenesis of the disease.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

We demonstrate a Liquid Deposition Modeling (LDM) type for controlling the pattern of TiO2 electrode. The advantage of this type of printer is able to vary the numbers of printed layer as well as different levelling pattern of TiO2 thin films by one time operation. Our aim was to study the effects of operating parameters of the 3D printer, such as nozzle size, speed and pressure on the thickness and uniformity of the printed TiO2 films. Using a commercial TiO2 paste, TiO2 precursor films were deposited on a conductive F-doped SnO2 glass by adjusting nozzle size, speed and pressure. The precursor films with different printed layers and levelling pattern were sintered using oven to produce porous TiO2 electrodes. The thickness and surface roughness of obtained TiO2 electrodes were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and 3D Measuring Laser Microscope. The printed TiO2 substrates were applied to dye-sensitized solar cells as electrodes. Our LDM type 3D printing will provide a new way of levelling design of device components for versatile optoelectronic applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: This longitudinal study examined 41 women who completed the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) rating scale during 28 consecutive days and assayed plasma levels of complement C3 and C4, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), haptoglobin (Hp), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), sulfhydryl (-SH) groups and the activity of paraoxonase (PON)1 at days 7 (D7), 14 (D14), 21 (D21) and 28 (D28) of the MC. MC Associated Syndrome (MCAS) was diagnosed when the summed DRSP score during the MC is >0.666 percentile. Results: All biomarkers, except hsCRP, showed significant alterations during the MC. Arylesterase (AREase) was lowered at D28, while LOOH increased at D14 and C4 at D21 in MCAS. Total DRSP scores were predicted by the combined effects of C4 (positively) and AREase and malondialdehyde (MDA) (both inversely associated). Progesterone lowered levels of LOOH, AOPP and C3 and estradiol lowered levels of Hp while both sex hormones increased 4-(chloromethyl)phenyl acetate (CMPA)ase and AREase activities and levels of -SH groups. Conclusion: PMS/MCAS is not accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response. Lowered MDA and antioxidant defenses and increased C4 may play a role in MC symptoms while sex hormones may have a protective effect against oxidative stress toxicity.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The objective of this study was to investigate the treatment effects of genistein and running exercise in ovariectomized (OVX) rats with NASH. METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups, control; OVX with standard diet; OVX with high fat and high fructose (HFHF) diet for 4 weeks; OVX with HFHF and genistein treatment (16 mg/kg BW/day) for 5 weeks (OVX + HFHF+GEN); OVX with HFHF and moderate intensity exercise for 5 weeks (OVX + HFHF+EX); OVX with HFHF and combined treatments (OVX + HFHF+GEN + EX). Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), hepatic glutathione (GSH), and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Liver histology was examined to determine NASH severity. RESULTS: OVX + HFHF group had the highest levels of hepatic FFA compared with OVX and control groups (5.92 ± 0.84 vs. 0.37 ± 0.01 vs. 0.42 ± 0.04 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in both OVX and OVX + HFHF groups as compared with controls (112.13 ± 6.50 vs. 121.47 ± 3.96 vs. 86.13 ± 2.40 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.01). In OVX + HFHF group, hepatic MDA levels were higher, while GSH levels were lower than in OVX and control groups (MDA; 0.98 ± 0.04 vs. 0.82 ± 0.02 vs. 0.78 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein, and GSH; 46.01 ± 0.91 vs. 55.21 ± 1.40 vs. 57.94 ± 0.32, respectively; p < 0.01 for both). Comparing with OVX + HFHF group, rats that received genistein, exercise and combined treatments demonstrated an improvement in liver histopathology, decreased levels of hepatic FFA (1.44 ± 0.21 vs. 0.45 ± 0.04 vs. 0.49 ± 0.05 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01), serum IL-6 (82.80 ± 2.07 vs. 83.47 ± 2.81 vs. 94.13 ± 1.61 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.01), and hepatic MDA (0.80 ± 0.03 vs. 0.76 ± 0.02 vs. 0.76 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01).

Materials and methods: A systematic review of OHL and PCC were obtained from four electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest and Scopus) was undertaken. These searches covered the period from January 2008 to December 2017. The quality assessment tool was the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool for systematic reviews of effectiveness. Results: The final review included nine studies amongst a total of 1475 studies. They showed three learning programmes (workshops, training and community-based rotation) and 17 related teaching techniques to promote OHL and PCC. The most commonly used learning programmes to enhance OHL and PCC for healthcare providers were workshops, and the teaching techniques included feedback and reflection. The intervention periods of the programmes took 20 minutes to half a day. The three studies did not have a follow-up, whilst the rest showed a follow-up range of 2 months to 3 years. Interestingly, there was one study, which applied double follow-ups to show the effectiveness of the programme. Conclusion: Either workshops or training programmes with a combination of teaching techniques were effective in terms of enhancing their OHL or PCC. The more frequent follow-up might increase the long-term effectiveness of the learning programme.","sociology, dentistry","Education, Dentistry (all)"

Mitigating bed agglomeration in a fluidized bed gasifier operating on rice straw,"Nisamaneenate J., Atong D., Seemen A., Sricharoenchaikul V.",2020-11-01,"Agglomerate formations, Agglomerated particles, Agricultural by-products, Fluidized bed gasification, Fluidized bed gasifiers, Operating parameters, Operational challenges, Reaction temperature, Alkali, Biomass, Defluidization, Gasification, Renewable energy","Fluidized bed gasifier is a promising technology with respect to converting biomass to useful energy. Bed agglomeration is an operational challenge that arises during fluidized bed gasification with rice straw as raw materials. Rice straw contains high amounts of potassium and other components that may lower the melting point of ash, causing bed agglomeration. Using alternative bed materials such as alumina, in the place of silica, can mitigate this problem. In Thailand, rice straw is an agricultural by-product of the rice milling processes, produced in large quantities every year. Usually, rice straw management comprises open field burning, which releases greenhouse gases, particulate matter, and other pollutants. In this paper, the behaviors of bed agglomeration and defluidization were investigated during the fluidized bed gasification of rice straw, using silica and alumina as bed materials. The effect of the percentage ratio of silica and alumina (0:100; 25:75; 50:50; 75:25; 100:0) was examined. The operating parameters were as follows: rice straw particle size of 425–850μm, reaction temperature of 700–900 °C, and equivalence ratios (ER) of 0.2 and 0.4. The results showed that the percentage ratio of silica and alumina, 0:100 at 700 °C, had extended the defluidization time of 60 min. The effect of equivalence ratio on bed agglomeration was found to be apparently heightened at a high temperature. The result of SEM/EDX analysis showed that the major elements at the linkage point of the agglomerated particle were Si, K, and Ca, with regard to any proportion of the alumina bed and temperature. In conclusion, low temperature agglomerate formation can be explained by a K2O-CaO-Si2O phase diagram. The results from this investigation can be applied to biomass-fluidized bed gasification, where bed agglomeration entails a plant shutdown and is expensive in terms of maintenance.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)

However, the use of MPA in therapeutic applications is limited to its poor oral bioavailability, low aqueous solubility, and undesired gastrointestinal side effects. Polymeric micelles are a drug delivery system that has been used to enhance the water solubility of pharmaceuticals. In this work, poloxamer 407 (P407) and MPA were conjugated via an ester linkage resulting in a P407-MPA conjugate. The P407-MPA conjugate was investigated for micellization, particle size, size distribution, MPA release in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and human plasma, and antipsoriatic activity. 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that polymeric micelles formed from the P407-MPA conjugate exposed its polyethylene oxide chain to the aqueous environment while restricting the conjugated MPA within the inner core. The P407-MPA conjugate has an improved micellization property with the over 12-fold lower critical micelle concentration compared to P407. The conjugate exhibited an enzyme-dependent sustained-release property in human plasma. Finally, the conjugate exhibited an improved antiproliferation activity in tumor necrosis factor-α-induced HaCaT cells, which is an in vitro psoriasis model. Therefore, the prepared P407-MPA conjugate, with an improved aqueous solubility and biological activity of MPA, has the potential to be further developed for psoriasis treatment.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

Similar to the structure of the well-known Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP) package, MATPLAN comprises six modules: LOAD-CALC, EXIST-GEN, CANDI-GEN, CONFIG, OPTIMIZE and ELCC. MATPLAN takes into account the variable nature of renewable energy sources, including both solar and wind farms, and allows a user to consider renewable energy as options for expansion planning using a probability-based model. In contrast to the current practice that treats renewable energy sources as negative loads, MATPLAN enables system planners to take renewable sources as normal options for generation expansion planning problems, which can directly determine the optimal expansion policy and ELCC analysis of a system with high renewable penetration. MATPLAN is also designed as an open access software package which academics and practitioners can adapt to their specific situations and run many case studies as a screening tool. In the case studies, the tool was validated by comparing its resulting optimal expansion planning plan against that of the well-known WASP package and further tested using realistic field data. The complete MATPLAN code repository has been released under open-source licenses for public access, URL: https://github.com/wasp2019/MATPLAN.

It is structurally dominated by NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW trending normal faults as a result of multistage rifting since the Late Oligocene. Half-graben and full-graben basin geometries can be observed from 2D regional seismic sections. In this study, structural restoration techniques were applied to validate the structural interpretation of the original hardcopy of the 2D seismic sections. Stratigraphic information is compiled from published papers and well reports. Our results revealed that most of the deformation was concentrated during the Late Oligocene. Main depocenters for the syn-rift sediments focused in the basin center along the west-dipping normal faults. These faults cut the prerift section and their orientations were possibly controlled by the Permo-Triassic fabrics that underlie the Phetchabun Basin. By measuring the length of the profiles before and after faulting, the restorations show that the extensions of the Wichianburi Subbasin decrease from 12.30% during the main rift phase (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) to 2.53% during the second phase of rifting. Rifting only focused in the basin center with the development of NNW-SSE to N-S trending intrarift faults. Since the Middle Miocene, the Wichianburi Subbasin has developed under the tectonic phase of post-rift subsidence with interruption by intrusive activities.","fluidex; related topics, regional structure and tectonics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics (ABS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were chosen as the model plastic and bacteria, respectively. The 500 °C calcined TiO2 successfully provided the best photoantibacterial activity, with an approximately 62% decrease of E. coli colony counts following 30 min of exposure. Heat treatment improved the crystallinity of anatase TiO2, resulting in low electron-hole recombination, while effectively adsorbing reactants on the surface. ABS with 500 °C-calcined TiO2 at the concentration of 1 wt % gave rise to the highest performance due to the improved distribution of TiO2. At this point, blending silane coupling agent could further improve the efficacy of photoantibacterial activity up to 75% due to greater interactions with the polymer matrix. Moreover, it could promote a 1.6-fold increase of yield strength via increased adherent bonding between TiO2 and the ABS matrix. Excellent photocatalytic and material stability can be achieved, with constant photocatalytic efficiency remaining for up to five reuse cycles without loss in the yield strength.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

We here report post-marketing safety data on the use of the vaccines in individuals in the community obtained through active pharmacovigilance surveillance including pregnant women participating in a prospective observational study. Between May 2017 and February 2020 for TdaPgen and between June 2018 and February 2020 for aPgen, participating health care providers vaccinated and collected safety data for 11,429 exposed adolescents and adults. This included 1778 pregnant women. The incidence rate of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) was 11.5 per 1000 of vaccinated individuals (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 9.7–13.6). AEFIs mostly concerned local pain at the injection site and muscle pain, and symptoms were mild and mostly resolved within a few days with no complications. The incidence rate of AEFIs in women vaccinated during pregnancy was 1.1 per 1000 (95% CI 0.3–4.1). Of 833 pregnant women vaccinated with recombinant aPgen or TdaPgen, 91.4% (95% CI 89.3–93.3) had uncomplicated pregnancies and 98.7% (95% CI 97.7–99.4) of the 855 babies delivered by these women were born healthy, which exceeds rates generally reported in Thailand. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the surveillance period. In conclusion, active pharmacovigilance confirms that the recombinant pertussis vaccines aPgen (Pertagen) and TdaPgen (Boostagen) are safe in adolescents and adults, including pregnant women vaccinated in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Many researches aim to improve detection accuracy, but due to the problem mentioned above, it makes many proposed methods perform less effectively. Therefore in this paper, we proposes a practical saliency map that can significantly reduce noise from the background by using Viridis colormap, Gaussian blur, Otsu's thresholding method, and closing morphological operation to reduce noise from the background and create a binary image. Then, we find a contour of all objects in the binary image and fill a hole inside them to get the better binary image. After that, we combine a grayscale image with the binary mask to create the saliency map. Finally, we use the four channels image, which composes of three channels from an RGB input image and one channel from the saliency map, as the input for training with the CNN model based on the S3FD network. The experimental results show that applying the saliency map and the RGB input image can improve the recall rate from 94.99% to 98% compared to using only the RGB input image with the S3FD network.

The objective of this study is to define the factors associated with severe adverse outcomes of pediatric FN. Methods: A retrospective and prospective descriptive study performed in pediatric patients diagnosed with FN at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2013 to December 2017. Severe adverse events defined as the presence in one of these following oxygen therapies, mechanical ventilator, shock, admission to ICU, renal dysfunction, and liver dysfunction. Results: The study included 267 patients with 563 febrile neutropenia episodes. The median (range) age was 5.1 years (1 month-15 year). Among 563 febrile neutropenia episodes, 115 episodes (20%) developed severe adverse events. The FN patients were classified into low and high-risk groups, 91% of patients with severe adverse events and all 21 patients who died were in high risk group. The overall mortality rate was 3.1%. Factors associated with severe adverse events were fungal infection (aOR 6.51, 95%CI 2.29-18.56), central venous catheter insertion (aOR 4.28, 95% CI 2.51-7.29), CPG defined high risk (aOR 3.35, 95%CI 1.56-7.17), viral infection (aOR 2.72, 95%CI 1.05-7.06), lower respiratory tract infection (aOR 2.52, 95%CI 1.09-5.82) and treatment not according to CPG (aOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.51-4.03). Conclusions: Fungal and viral infection, central venous catheter insertion, lower respiratory tract infection, CPG defined high risk and treatment not according to CPG were associated factors of increased risk for severe adverse events. Our current institutional CPG for FN in children was applicable and improved clinical outcomes for this group of patients.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

They had glass transition temperatures in ascending order from glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltodextrin to soluble starch. The soluble starch demonstrated the best protection to cell during drying process and storage. The accretion of soluble starch higher than 2.5% in feed-in mixture for spray drying exhibited the increase in the viscosity of mixtures and the particle size of products. These products contained less number of viable cells and higher cell injury. The encapsulated products with 2.5% soluble starch exhibited a better storage stability than those with 1.5%. The encapsulated product was applied as a co-starter in pla-som fermentation without additional of carbon sources and also demonstrated fast acid production. The fermentation with encapsulated products displayed better inhibitory effect on inoculated pathogenic bacteria than indigenous fermentation. The soluble starch serves as a protective agent for encapsulated culture and also a good carbon source for lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation of pla-som.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; probiotics, mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of bread made from anthocyanin-rich Riceberry rice on the postprandial glycemic response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), antioxidant status, and subjective ratings of appetite. In the crossover design, 16 healthy participants (six men and 10 women) completed four sessions involving blood collection in the fasting state and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after food consumption (50 g of available carbohydrate) in a randomized order: 1) glucose solution, 2) wheat bread (WB), 3) Riceberry rice bread (RRB), and 4) Hom Mali bread (HMB). Consumption of RRB resulted in significantly lower postprandial plasma glucose concentration at 30 and 60 min when compared to HMB. No difference in postprandial glucose concentration between RRB and WB was observed. In addition, postprandial plasma insulin showed a significant decrease in the group which received RRB at 15 and 60 min, as compared to HMB. In comparison with 50 g of glucose, as a reference, the glycemic index (GI) of RRB, WB, and HMB was 69.3 ± 4.4, 77.8 ± 4.6, and 130.6 ± 7.9, respectively. Interestingly, the ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) level was shown to significantly increase after consumption of RRB. In the meantime, a significant decrease in the postprandial FRAP level was also observed following an intake of WB and HMB. All breads caused increases in the postprandial plasma protein thiol group and had similar effects on hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and satiety ratings. However, consumption of RBB, WB, and HMB did not change plasma GLP-1 and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels when compared to the baseline. The findings suggest that anthocyanin-rich Riceberry rice can be a natural ingredient for gluten-free bread which reduced glycemic response together with improvement of antioxidant status in healthy subjects.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Its value has decreased, because of new analytical methods. Our goal was to compare AG reference intervals for different instruments and Southeast Asian populations. Methods: We studied AG at three hospitals. One used the cobas 8000; two others, the Architect c16000. We included consecutive adults ≥18 years whose samples were sent for electrolytes and creatinine. We assessed AG for all patients and patients with normal electrolytes. Results: AG means differed significantly (P < 0.001) between the three hospitals for all patients and the normal electrolyte subgroup. AG reference intervals from all patients were 9–19, 5–15, and 5–15 mmol/L, and for the normal electrolyte subgroup, 10–17, 6–14, and 5–12 mmol/L, respectively. Compared to the normal albumin group, hypoalbuminemia patients showed lower AG in two hospitals (P < 0.001, P = 0.03), whereas patients with hyperalbuminemia demonstrated higher AG in all three hospitals (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Different instruments produce different AGs. There is a weak correlation between albumin levels and AG. Laboratorians should verify reference intervals used when detecting laboratory errors and assisting clinicians in the differential diagnosis of acid base disorders and other medical conditions.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

While previously described in Western countries, DDX41 variants have not been reported in a Southeast Asian population. We performed targeted sequencing of blood or bone marrow samples from 109 Thai patients with myeloid malignancies. Among the 109 patients (75 MDS, 8 MPN, 11 MDS/MPN and 15 AML), the most frequent mutations were in ASXL1 (17.4%), TET2 (16.5%) and SRSF2 (12.8%), respectively. DDX41 variants were detectable in six (5.5%) cases. Four patients exhibited three presumable germline DDX41 mutations: p.S21fs (n = 2), p.F235fs (n = 1), and p.R339H (n = 1). While p.S21fs was previously reported in myeloid neoplasm, the latter two variants have not been described. Two of these cases harbored concomitant probable germline/somatic DDX41 mutations (p.S21fs/p.R525H and p.R339H/p.K494T), while the other two patients carried only somatic mutations (p.R525H and p.F438L). The p.K494T and p.F438L variants have not been previously reported. In patients with DDX41 alterations, the diagnoses were MDS with excess blasts (4), secondary AML (1) and low-risk MDS (1).

Methods: This was a prospective, non-intervention, multicenter study in 4023 singleton pregnancies, at 11 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation, in 11 recruiting centers in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Women were screened for preterm PE between December 2016 and June 2018 and gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Maternal and pregnancy characteristics were recorded and mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI) and maternal serum placental growth factor (PlGF) were measured in accordance with The Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) standardized measurement protocols. MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF were transformed into MoMs using the published FMF formulae, derived from a largely Caucasian population in Europe, which adjust for gestational age and covariates that affect directly the biomarker levels. Variations in biomarker MoM values and their dispersion (SD) and cumulative sum tests over time were evaluated in order to identify systematic deviations in biomarker measurements from the expected distributions. Results: In the total screened population, the median (95% CI) MoM values of MAP, UtA-PI and PlGF were 0.961 (0.956–0.965), 1.018 (0.996–1.030) and 0.891 (0.861–0.909), respectively. Women in this largely Asian cohort had approximately 4% and 11% lower MAP and PlGF MoM levels, respectively, compared with those expected from normal median formulae, based on a largely Caucasian population, whilst UtA-PI MoM values were similar. UtA-PI and PlGF MoMs were beyond the 0.4 to 2.5 MoM range (truncation limits) in 16 (0.4%) and 256 (6.4%) pregnancies, respectively. QA assessment tools indicated that women in all centers had consistently lower MAP MoM values than expected, but were within 10% of the expected value. UtA-PI MoM values were within 10% of the expected value at all sites except one. Most PlGF MoM values were systematically 10% lower than the expected value, except for those derived from a South Asian population, which were 37% higher. Conclusions: Owing to the anthropometric differences in Asian compared with Caucasian women, significant differences in biomarker MoM values for PE screening, particularly MAP and PlGF MoMs, were noted in Asian populations compared with the expected values based on European-derived formulae. If reliable and consistent patient-specific risks for preterm PE are to be reported, adjustment for additional factors or development of Asian-specific formulae for the calculation of biomarker MoMs is required. We have also demonstrated the importance and need for regular quality assessment of biomarker values. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG.

To overcome the limitation of these classical studies and explicitly dissect the structure and function of these two pathways, we performed selective optogenetic activation of each pathway in male mice with channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) expression by Cre driver using double viral vector techniques. Brief photostimulation of the crossed pathway evoked short latency contraversive orienting-like head turns, while extended stimulation induced body turn responses. In contrast, stimulation of the uncrossed pathway induced short-latency upward head movements followed by longer-latency defense-like behaviors including retreat and flight. The novel discovery was that while the evoked orienting responses were stereotyped, the defense-like responses varied considerably depending on the environment, suggesting that uncrossed output can be influenced by top-down modification of the SC or its target areas. This further suggests that the connection of the SCd-defense system with non-motor, affective and cognitive structures. Tracing the whole axonal trajectories of these two pathways revealed existence of both ascending and descending branches targeting different areas in the thalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla, and/or spinal cord, including projections which could not be detected in the classical studies; the crossed pathway has some ipsilaterally descending collaterals and the uncrossed pathway has some contralaterally descending collaterals. Some of the connections might explain the context-dependent modulation of the defense-like responses. Thus, the classical views on the tectal output systems are updated.",neuroscience,Neuroscience (all)

However, high levels of disease or mortality in such flocks impair economic development and challenge the livelihoods of many rural households. We investigated 61 diseased small-scale flocks (122 chickens) for evidence of infection with 5 bacteria, 4 viruses, and helminths. Serological profiles (ELISA) were also determined against 6 of these pathogens. The aims of this study were the following: (1) to investigate the prevalence of different pathogens and to compare the probability of detection of bacterial pathogens using PCR and culture; (2) to investigate the relationship between detection of organisms in birds' tissues and the observed morbidity and mortality, as well as their antibody profile; and (3) to characterize risk factors for infection with specific viral or bacterial pathogens. We used PCR to test for viral (viruses causing infectious bronchitis [IB], highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], Newcastle disease, and infectious bursal disease [IBD]) and bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale [ORT]). The latter two were also investigated in respiratory tissues by conventional culture. Colisepticemic Escherichia coli was investigated by liver or spleen culture. In 49 of 61 (80.3%) flocks, at least one bacterial or viral pathogen was detected, and in 29 (47.5%) flocks, more than one pathogen was detected. A. paragallinarum was detected in 62.3% flocks, followed by M. gallisepticum (26.2%), viruses causing IBD (24.6%) and IB (21.3%), septicemic E. coli (14.8%), ORT (13.1%), and HPAI viruses (4.9%). Of all flocks, 67.2% flocks were colonized by helminths. Mortality was highest among flocks infected with HPAI (100%, interquartile range [IQR]: 81.6–100%) and lowest with flocks infected with ORT (5.3%, IQR: 1.1–9.0%). The results indicated slight agreement (kappa ≤ 0.167) between detection by PCR and culture for both A. paragallinarum and ORT, as well as between the presence of cestodes and ORT infection (kappa = 0.317). Control of A. paragallinarum, viruses causing HPAI, IBD, and IB, M. gallisepticum, and gastrointestinal helminths should be a priority in small-scale flocks.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Animal Science and Zoology

Herein the effect of ensiling and alkaline pretreatment on acidification of Napier grass in anaerobic leached bed reactors was investigated. The results depicted clearly that grass preparation affected its chemical properties and leaching ability differently. After pretreatment in 3.0% of NaOH, lignin was reduced significantly by 50.1% to 68.0%, while less deterioration was found for ensiling. About 18.9% to 54.1% of the produced soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of these biomasses was increased subsequently compared to 0.102 kg SCOD or 0.56 kg SCOD/kg VSadded of raw grass digestion. However, about 3.3% of SCOD was reduced after the ensiling. An extension of biomass soaking time and heat supplementation under alkali-thermal conditions of raw grass promoted more production of SCOD for 18.9% to 29.9% and 54.1%, respectively. While about 45.5% to 54.4% of SCOD was increased for alkali-thermal pretreated residue. The solid content and lignocelluloses were changed differently and accordingly with treatment conditions. Similar profiles of leachates contained mainly acetic acid were obtained. These results confirm the beneficial application of alkaline soaking and ensiling as a pretreatment method to enhance the solubilization of grass biomass under the leached bed acidification process.","mixing and separation, environmental",Environmental Engineering

Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings (also known as chlorhexidine patches, CHG patches) are reported to decrease CLABSIs in adults. This study aims to determine the efficacy of CHG patches in reducing CLABSIs in children. Methods: An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in children aged 2 months to 18 years, requiring a short-term catheter. Patients were randomized into two groups, allocated to receive CHG patches or standard transparent dressings. Care of the catheter was in accordance with Asia Pacific Society of Infection Control (APSIC) recommendations. Central-line-associated bloodstream infections were defined using National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance criteria. Results: From April 2017 to April 2018, 192 children were enrolled. There were 108 CHG patch catheters and 101 standard dressing catheters, contributing to 3,113 catheter days. The median duration of catheter dwelling was 13 days, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 8–20 days. Half were placed at the jugular vein and 22% at the femoral vein. There were 23 CLABSI events. Incidence rates for CHG patches and standard dressings were 7.98 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.25–13.65) and 6.74 (95% CI, 3.23–12.39) per 1,000 catheter days, respectively (incidence rate ratio 1.18; 95% CI, 0.52–2.70). The CLABSI pathogens were 15 Gram-negative bacteria, six Gram-positive bacteria, and two Candida organisms. Catheter colonization of CHG patches and standard dressings were 2.02 (95% CI, 0.42–5.91) and 3.07 (95% CI, 1.00–7.16) per 1,000 catheter days, respectively. Only local adverse effects occurred in 6.8% of the participants. Conclusions: In our setting, there was no difference in CLABSI rates when the chlorhexidine patch dressings were compared with the standard transparent dressings.

Chronic HIV-1 infection is associated with loss of the CD161+ CD4 T cell population, and non-human primate studies suggest that their depletion is associated with disease progression. However, the dynamics of the CD161+ CD4+ T cell population during acute HIV-1 infection remains unknown. In this study, we characterize peripheral blood CD161+ CD4+ T cells in detail, and examine how they are affected during the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. Unbiased surface proteome screening and principal component analysis indicated that CD161+ CD4+ T cells are relatively phenotypically homogeneous between donors, and are intermediates between conventional CD4 T cells and innate-like T cells. In acute untreated HIV-1 infection, the circulating CD161+ CD4+ T cell population decreased in frequency, as did absolute cell counts starting from peak viral load, with elevated levels of activation and exhaustion markers expressed throughout acute HIV-1 infection. The capacity of these cells to respond to stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 was also reduced. Early initiation of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) during acute HIV-1 infection restored the functionality of peripheral blood CD161+ CD4+ T cells, but not their frequency. In contrast, early ART initiation prevented the decline of colonic CD161+ CD4+ T cells that otherwise started during acute infection. Furthermore, loss of peripheral and colonic CD161+ CD4+ T cells in untreated infection was associated with levels of viral load. These results suggest that acute HIV-1 infection has profound effects on the CD161+ CD4+ T cell population that could not be completely prevented by the initiation of ART.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Here, we present a new multi-proxy (δ18O and δ13C values, trace element concentrations, and grayscale values) data set of stalagmite KPC1 from Khao Prae cave in western Thailand spanning the last 1400 years (500–1900 CE; the Common Era). These multi-proxy data reveal a high variability between the wet and dry periods during 500–850 CE and 1150–1300 CE, stable climate conditions during 850–1150 CE, and overall dry conditions since 1300 CE. The δ13C values, trace elements concentrations, and grayscale values show centennial-scale fluctuations, which were probably driven by local hydrological processes. In contrast, variations in the stalagmite δ18O values reflect integrated changes in rainfall amount from the ISM. The KPC1 record agrees with other speleothem δ18O records of Southeast Asian summer monsoon from the last millennium, as well as the lake multi-proxy and tree-ring PDSI data from Mainland Southeast Asia, but diverges from records from the Indo-Pacific equatorial regions and the western Pacific. We conclude that hydroclimate variability at the western side of Mainland Southeast Asia is mainly driven by changes in moisture transport of the ISM. On socially relevant timescales, the KPC1 data set shows that a period of stable rainfall (850–1150 CE) coincides with the early success of the early empires (e.g., Pagan, Angkor, and Dai Viet) in Mainland Southeast Asia. In line with previous studies in the region, we speculate that the high variability in rainfall between 1150 and 1300 CE and droughts during 1300–1550 CE played a significant role in the demise of ancient societies in Southeast Asia.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; genergyal ecology; historical ecology; environmentalronments, the atmosphere, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

The results indicated that hydrothermal process at 200°C for 12 h and activation with H3PO4 at 900 °C for 2 h, exhibited the highest surface area, porosity and pore volume leading to increased distribution of metal on the carbon support.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Adsorptive performance of activated carbon reused from household drinking water filter for hexavalent chromium-contaminated water,"Sangkarak S., Phetrak A., Kittipongvises S., Kitkaew D., Phihusut D., Lohwacharin J.",2020-10-15,"Adsorption, Charcoal, Chromium, Drinking Water, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Water Purification, Chromium-contaminated water, Heavy metal, Hexavalent chromium, Powdered activated carbon block, Surface complexation","Powdered activated carbon blocks (PACBs) are waste products obtained from household drinking water purification systems. In this study, we demonstrate that they can be used as adsorbents for the cost-effective and environmentally benign removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from contaminated-water and rinse electroplating wastewater. To evaluate Cr(VI) sorption onto the PACB, studies on equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics were performed using batch mode experiments. The experimental results indicated that Cr(VI) ions were efficiently adsorbed under acidic conditions (i.e., at initial pH below 3) and low initial Cr(VI) concentrations. The adsorptive behaviors of the PACB for Cr(VI) were well explained by the Langmuir isotherm, as well as pseudo-second-order kinetic models, suggesting that a Cr(VI) monolayer was adsorbed onto the PACB surface via chemisorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) onto the PACB was determined to be 6.207 mg/g. The results of thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption process of Cr(VI) onto PACB was endothermic and non-spontaneous. Additionally, analysis of the PACB after Cr(VI) adsorption at an initial pH of 2 using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the interaction between the surface oxygenic functional groups on the PACB and Cr(VI) was primarily responsible for Cr(VI) sorption via surface complexation and electrostatic interactions. Based on the result of XPS analysis, the presence of trivalent chromium on the PACB surfaces indicated that some synergistic redox reactions involving Cr(VI) could have occurred during the sorption process. Although a commercially available powdered activated carbon outperformed the PACB adsorbent with respect to Cr(VI) removal from wastewater, complete Cr(VI) adsorption could be achieved using relatively large quantities of the PACB. These findings indicate that the PACB adsorbent could be used as a cheap and efficient material for the removal of Cr(VI) from wastewater.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Duplex optical amplifier for 10 Gb/s ethernet link over 120 km SSMF and 15 km DCF,"Vorapamorn V., Worasucheep D.-R., Wada N.",2020-01-01,"Aggregation network, Burst mode, Dispersion-compensation fibers, Ethernet link, Extended distance, Operating wavelength, Optical bandpass filters, Standard single mode fibers, 5G, Aggregation network, Burst-mode EDFA, Duplex optical amplifiers, Erbium-doped fiber amplifier, Ethernet link, Extended distance","This paper focuses on extending the maximum link distance between typical optical transceivers in mobile aggregation networks. Our duplex optical amplifier is inserted between base-stations in suburban or border areas, in order to amplify 10 Gigabit Ethernet data transmitted in C-band wavelength (1530 - 1565 nm). It consists of two Conventional Erbium- Doped Fiber Amplifiers (C-EDFAs), each for unidirectional transmission. It can support 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/5G network application at 10 Gb/s and higher bit-rates. The measured parameters of duplex optical amplifier are operating wavelength range, amplifier gain, and noise figure (NF). Their operating ranges of both C-EDFAs are from 1530 nm to 1562 nm. Their maximum gains are approximately 24.5 dB at 0.2-Ampere pump current and 1550-nm input wavelength. Their NFs are below 6.3 dB at -3 dBm input power and 1550-nm input wavelength. In addition, we measured a Burst-Mode EDFA (BM-EDFA) to compare with C-EDFAs. The BM-EDFA's operating range is from 1537 to 1561 nm. Its maximum gains are approximately 24.5 dB and 31 dB at pump current of 0.175 Ampere and 0.38 Ampere respectively. Its NF is below 6 dB at the same input power and wavelength as in C-EDFAs. From these parameter results, the characteristics of C-EDFA and BM-EDFA are likely the same. However, from 10 Gb/s data transmission experiment, BM-EDFA has the lowest power variation on Ethernet packets, compared to duplex C-EDFA and another commercial EDFA. Furthermore, the effects of EDFA noises and Chromatic Dispersion (CD) over a link's performance has been investigated and shown by Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements. The Dispersion Compensation Fiber (DCF) and 1-nm Tunable Optical Band-Pass Filter (TOBPF) were added after C-EDFAs, to reduce CD and noises respectively. Finally, the data transmission over 120 Km Standard Single-Mode Fiber (SSMF) & 15 Km DCF by using duplex optical amplifier at 10 Gb/s bit-rate was achieved with 0.5-dB power penalty at 10-9 BER. Moreover, we can identify that BM-EDFA is more suitable for Ethernet link than C-EDFAs. Hence, we propose that C-EDFAs in duplex optical amplifier should be replaced by BM-EDFA to improve the link performance.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, computer science, Mathematics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Computer Science Applications, Applied Mathematics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Typically this involves detailed molecular genetic testing which may not be available in all centers. The purpose of the present study was to find a simplified approach to assign molecular subtypes of MB for routine use in centers with more limited resources. The molecular subtypes of MBs from 32 Thai patients, aged 0.5 to 35 years, were first determined by NanoString. These results were then compared with those obtained using a combination of limited immunohistochemistry (IHC) (β-catenin, GAB-1, YAP-1, p75-NGFR, OTX2) and CTNNTB exon 3 mutation analysis. By NanoString assay, there were 6 MBs (19%) in the wingless (WNT) group, 8 (25%) in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) group, 7 (22%) in group 3, and 11 (34%) in group 4. Although β-catenin immunostaining missed 4/6 WNT MBs, CTNNTB mutation analysis confirmed all WNT MB cases with amplifiable DNA. The IHC panel correctly assigned all the other molecular subtypes, except for 1 MB in group 4. Thus, our protocol was able to correctly categorized 31/32 cases or 97% of cases. Our study is the first to report molecular subtypes of MB in Southeast Asia. We found that molecular subgroups of MBs can be reliably assigned using a limited IHC panel of β-catenin, GAB-1, YAP-1, p75-NGFR, OTX2, together with CTNNTB exon 3 mutation analysis. This simplified approach incurs lower cost and faster turnaround time compared with more elaborate molecular methodologies and should be beneficial to centers with reduced laboratory resources.","cancer, medical, Health Professions","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology, Medical Laboratory Technology"

Objective: To objectively evaluate, using axial inertial sensors (the NIGHT-Recorder), the ability of PD patients and controls to turn in bed from prone to supine position and to correlate these parameters with disease severity scores. Patients and Methods: Turning in bed from prone to supine position was assessed in 16 PD patients with a moderate disease stage and 16 age-matched controls using the NIGHT-Recorder. Successful turning was defined as a full 180 ° turn from prone to supine position as evidenced by the NIGHT-Recorder. Objective parameters included duration, velocity, and acceleration of turn. The ability to turn in bed was determined by torque per kilogram body weight (T/kg). Results: Two out of 16 PD patients (12.5%) could not initiate their turns. PD patients turned with a significant longer duration (p = 0.04), slower velocity (p = 0.04), and acceleration (p = 0.04) compared to controls. Although PD patients had lower T/kg than controls, the difference was not significant. Several significant correlations were demonstrated between turning parameters and clinical rating scales (Duration vs. UPDRS axial: r=0.51, p = 0.04; T/kg vs. PDSS-2: r=0.53, p = 0.03; T/kg vs. NHQ: r=0.52, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our study provides objective evidence of impaired turning in bed from prone to supine position in PD patients with nocturnal hypokinesia. Appropriate measures should be taken to improve nocturnal mobility in those at risk.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"
Deposition of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 by pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering for selective hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol,"Pongthawornsakun B., Kaewsuanjik P., Kittipreechakun P., Ratova M., Kelly P., Mekasuwandumrong O., Praserthdam P., Panpranot J.",2020-12-01,"Catalyst surfaces, Initial depositions, Partial hydrogenation, Pulsed DC magnetron sputtering, Pulsed direct current, Selective hydrogenation, Supported-metal catalysts, Vanillin, Platinum, Pulsed DC magnetron sputtering, Selective hydrogenation, Vanillin, Vanillyl alcohol","Pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (PDC-MSD) was employed for the deposition of Pt nanoparticles (ca. 0.1 wt.%) on anatase TiO2 powder. According to the H2-TPR, XPS, and TEM-EDX results, the characteristics and properties of the deposited nanoparticles depended on the deposition time. During the initial deposition stage (45–90 sec), low-coordinated small spherical Pt nanoparticles were formed. Prolonging the deposition time (135–180 sec), led to the formation of larger Pt nanoparticles, which strongly interacted with the TiO2. The catalytic activities of the prepared Pt/TiO2 with different deposition times in the aqueous phase partial hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol ranged as follows: Pt/TiO2 MSD-45 < Pt/TiO2MSD-90 < Pt/TiO2MSD-180 < Pt/TiO2 MSD-135, which was in good agreement with the atomic Pt/Ti ratio and coordinated surface Pt atoms on the catalyst surface. The high catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 MSD-135 was attributed to the presence of well-dispersed small Pt nanoparticles with more highly-coordinated Pt surface atoms deposited on the TiO2 anatase. PDC-MSD has been proven to be a more effective method for the preparation of supported metal catalysts, compared to those obtained by conventional impregnation technique.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Therefore, we assessed the incidence of AKI and the utilization of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Indonesia. Methods: Demographic and clinical data were collected from 952 ICU participants. The participants were categorized into AKI and non-AKI groups. The participants were further classified according to the 3 different stages of AKI as per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Results: Overall incidence of AKI was 43%. The participants were divided into three groups based on the AKI stages: 18.5% had stage 1, 33% had stage 2, and 48.5% had stage 3. Primary diagnosis of renal disease and high APACHE II score were the risk factors associated with AKI (OR = 4.53, 95% CI: 1.67-12.33, p = 0.003 and OR = 1.14 per 1 unit increase, 95% CI: 1.09-1.20, p < 0.001, respectively). Chronic kidney disease was the risk factor for severe AKI. Sepsis was the leading cause of AKI. Among the AKI participants, 24.6% required RRT. The most common RRT modalities were intermittent hemodialysis (71.7%), followed by slow low-efficiency dialysis (22.8%), continuous renal replacement therapy (4.3%), and peritoneal dialysis (1.1%). Conclusions: This study showed that AKI was a common problem in the Indonesian ICU. We strongly believe that identification of the risk factors associated with AKI will help us develop a predictive score for AKI so we can prevent and improve AKI outcome in the future.",medical,Nephrology

The device pattern was designed and printed on low-cost filter paper to construct a disposable paper-based analytical device (PAD) using a wax printing technique. The sensor consisted of a capture anti-OTC antibody (anti-OTC) and OTC-conjugated bovine serum albumin (OTC-BSA). Anti-OTC was first anchored onto the functionalized PAD, followed by the competitive binding of the OTC target and OTC-BSA. The amount of the captured OTC was examined by observing the signal response of the redox [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. In the presence of OTC, the current response was significantly increased with increasing OTC concentration, whereas the signal response was negligible in the absence thereof. The detected OTC concentration was linear over a range of 1−200 ng mL-1, and the corresponding values of 0.33 and 1.1 ng mL-1 were obtained for the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), respectively. This introduced sensor displayed high sensitivity and specificity, and the amounts of OTC were successfully quantified in agricultural products. This developed signal-on sensor may be an alternative tool for determining OTC residues and broader antibiotic targets.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The transmission of DTUMV involves mosquito vectors; however, the exact role of mosquitoes in the ecology of DTMUV in Thailand remains unclear. This study was conducted to examine DTMUV detection and characterization from mosquitoes in duck farms in central Thailand. Mosquitoes were collected from two duck farms in Sing Buri Province and two duck farms in Ang Thong Province from September 2015 to July 2016 using four CDC-light traps. A total of 30,841 mosquitoes were collected and identified to seven species (Anopheles (An.) barbirostris, An. stephensi, Culex (Cx.) gelidus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Mansonia (Ma.) annulifera and Ma. uniformis). The most common collected species from each duck farm and each collection time was Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Mosquitoes were pooled according to species, location, and collection time and then examined for DTMUV by RT-PCR. A total of 273 mosquito pools were examined, with only one pool of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected from Sing Buri Province in November 2015 testing positive for DTMUV. Phylogenetic analysis of the polyprotein genes demonstrated that a mosquito-derived Thai DTMUV was grouped into subcluster 2.1 and most closely related to the 2013 Thai DTMUVs. Thus, this study indicated that Cx. tritaeniorhynchus may play a role as a vector in the transmission of DTMUV in Thailand. However, additional studies concerning the vector competence of this mosquito for DTMUV are needed.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Most importantly, the properties of ENR/GW composites were compared with those of ENR composites filled with most widely used non-reinforcing filler calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In both ENR/GW and ENR/CaCO3 composites, the values of torque difference, hardness and tensile modulus increased steadily with increasing filler content. However, at same filler loading level, the mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties of ENR/GW composites were better as compared to those of ENR/CaCO3 composites. ENR/GW composite also exhibited considerably higher thermal stability as compared to either unfilled ENR or ENR/CaCO3 composite. As a whole, GW could be used as a cost-effective semi-reinforcing filler in ENR composites.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

AIM To identify the association of baseline GGT level and QRISK2 score among patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS This was a retrospective study involving 1535 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients from 10 Asian centers in 8 countries using data collected by the Gut and Obesity in Asia (referred to as ""GO Asia"") workgroup. All patients with available baseline GGT levels and all 16 variables for the QRISK2 calculation (QRISK2-2017; developed by researchers at the United Kingdom National Health Service; https://qrisk.org/2017/; 10-year cardiovascular risk estimation) were included and compared to healthy controls with the same age, sex, and ethnicity. Relative risk was reported. QRISK2 score > 10% was defined as the high-CVD-risk group. Fibrosis stages 3 and 4 (F3 and F4) were considered advanced fibrosis. RESULTS A total of 1122 patients (73%) had complete data and were included in the final analysis; 314 (28%) had advanced fibrosis. The median age (interquartile range [IQR]) of the study population was 53 (44-60) years, 532 (47.4%) were females, and 492 (43.9%) were of Chinese ethnicity. The median 10-year CVD risk (IQR) was 5.9% (2.6-10.9), and the median relative risk of CVD over 10 years (IQR) was 1.65 (1.13-2.2) compared to healthy individuals with the same age, sex, and ethnicity. The high-CVD-risk group was significantly older than the low-risk group (median [IQR]: 63 [59-67] vs 49 [41-55] years; P < 0.001). Higher fibrosis stages in biopsy-proven NAFLD patients brought a significantly higher CVD risk (P < 0.001). Median GGT level was not different between the two groups (GGT [U/L]: Median [IQR], high risk 60 [37-113] vs low risk 66 [38-103], P = 0.56). There was no correlation between baseline GGT level and 10-year CVD risk based on the QRISK2 score (r = 0.02). CONCLUSION The CVD risk of NAFLD patients is higher than that of healthy individuals. Baseline GGT level cannot predict CVD risk in NAFLD patients. However, advanced fibrosis is a predictor of a high CVD risk.",medical,Gastroenterology

The design procedure combines finite-element (FE), genetic programming (GP), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An optimum patch design is defined as the combination of design parameters that simultaneously minimizes the patch volume and reduces the stress intensity factor (SIF) range below the fatigue threshold range. A patching correction factor, which accounts for the positive effects of material and geometric properties of the patch and adhesive layer on the SIF solution, is proposed. The correction factor is developed by performing symbolic regression via GP analyses on the SIF values obtained from the three-dimensional FE models. The closed-form SIF solution facilitates the visualization of the effects of design parameters, simplifies the calculation of fatigue life, and reduces the computation effort for design optimization. An example of the center-cracked steel plate subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loading and then repaired with double-sided adhesive-bonded FRP patches is used to illustrate the optimization procedure.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

These were prepared by co-condensation at different 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane (MPMDS):tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) ratios and subsequent oxidation (x-SO3H-KIT-6, where x is the molar ratio of MPMDS). Isoamyl acetate production was performed via esterification of fusel oil with acetic acid in a batch reactor at different reaction temperatures and reaction times. The optimal conditions were: 80 °C, 3 h, catalyst loading of 5 wt.%, and a 2:1 (v/v) acetic acid:fusel oil ratio. Under these conditions, a 95% yield of isoamyl acetate was achieved. The efficiency in terms of turnover frequency (TOF) was strongly affected by the number and accessibility of the acid sites, and therefore by the MPMDS:TEOS ratio. The highest yield was found for 0.3-SO3H-KIT-6, while 0.1-SO3H-KIT-6 had the highest TOF. The 0.3-SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst also exhibited excellent reusability over four cycles, with only a small reduction in isoamyl acetate yield in each cycle. Overall, the 0.3-SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst exhibited catalytic activity comparable to that of a commercial esterification catalyst. This novel catalyst has potential practical applications in selective production of isoamyl acetate.","petroleum engineeringneering, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

We assessed ART initiation and attrition outcomes of the HIV continuum from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation in youth living with HIV (YLHIV) and factors associated with ART initiation. Methods: We studied YLHIV aged 15 to 24 years who were registered on the National AIDS Program (NAP) from January 2008 to May 2019. The study period was divided into 2008 to 2013 (initiated ART by CD4-guided criteria) and 2014 to 2018 (initiate ART at any CD4). Date of registration was used as a surrogate for the diagnosis date and defined as the baseline. The database included ART prescription and laboratory results, and the vital status was linked daily with the National Death Registry. Competing risk methods were used to assess factors associated with accessing ART, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) and death considered as competing events. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with rapid ART initiation, defined as initiation ≤1 month after registration. Results: Overall, 51,607 youth registered on the NAP (42% between 2008 and 2013). Median age was 21 (IQR 20 to 23) years; 64% were male. Overall ART initiation was 80% in the first period and 83% in the second. The ART initiation rate was higher among YLHIV aged 15 to 19 years (86%) than 20 to 24 years (82%) (p < 0.001) in the second period. The proportion of youth starting rapid ART increased significantly from 27% to 52% between the two periods (p < 0.001). Factors associated with ART initiation were age 15 to 19 years (aSHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.11), female (aSHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.29) and registration year 2014 to 2018 (aSHR 1.73, 95% CI 1.69 to 1.76). The cumulative incidence of LTFU/death prior to ART initiation at 12 months was 3.8% (95% CI 3.6% to 4.1%) in the first period and 1.9% (95% CI 1.8% to 2.1%) in the second period. Conclusions: In the era of universal treatment of all at any CD4 level, 83% of YLHIV registered on the Thai National AIDS Program initiated ART. The majority initiated within one month of registration.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Utility of Plasmodium falciparum DNA from rapid diagnostic test kits for molecular analysis and whole genome amplification,"Srisutham S., Suwannasin K., Mathema V.B., Sriprawat K., Smithuis F.M., Nosten F., White N.J., Dondorp A.M., Imwong M.",2020-05-27,"Blood Specimen Collection, Diagnostic Tests, Routine, DNA, Protozoan, Myanmar, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, Plasmodium falciparum, Time Factors, Plasmodium falciparum, RDT, Whole genome amplification","Background: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become the most common diagnostic tool for detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, in particular in remote areas. RDT blood spots provide a source of parasite DNA for molecular analysis. In this study, the utility of RDTs for molecular analysis and the performance of different methods for whole genome amplification were investigated. Methods: Positive P. falciparum RDTs were collected from Kayin, Myanmar from August 2014 to January 2016. The RDT samples were stored for 6 months, 9 months, 20 months, 21 months, and 32 months before DNA extraction and subsequent molecular analysis of P. falciparum kelch 13 (pfkelch13) mutations, P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pfplasmepsin2) gene amplification. In addition, performance of four whole genome amplification (WGA) kits were compared, including REPLI-g®, MALBACTM, PicoPLEX®, and GenomePlex®, for which DNA quantity and quality were compared between original DNA and post-WGA products. Results: The proportion of successful amplification of the different molecular markers was similar between blood spots analysed from RDTs stored for 6, 9, 20, 21, or 32 months. Successful amplification was dependent on the molecular markers fragment length (p value < 0.05): 18% for a 1245 bp fragment of pfkelch13, 71% for 364 bp of pfkelch13, 81% for 87 bp of pfmdr1, 81% for 108 bp of pfplasmepsin2. Comparison of the four WGA assay kits showed that REPLI-g®, MALBACTM, and PicoPLEX® increased the quantity of DNA 60 to 750-fold, whereas the ratio of parasite DNA amplification over human DNA was most favourable for MALBAC®. Sequencing results of pfkelch13, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and six microsatellite markers assessed from the post-WGA product was the same as from the original DNA. Conclusions: Blood spots from RDTs are a good source for molecular analysis of P. falciparum, even after storage up to 32 months. WGA of RDT-derived parasite DNA reliably increase DNA quantity with sufficient quality for molecular analysis of resistance markers.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Herein, a cost-effective and highly stable zinc (Zn) electrode, based on Zn electrodeposited on iron fibers (Zn/IF), is duly examined. Electrochemical characteristics of the proposed electrode are seen to compete with a conventional zinc/nickel foam (Zn/NF) electrode, implying that it can be a suitable alternative for use in ZABs. Results show that the Zn/IF electrode exhibits an almost similar trend as Zn/NF in cyclic voltammetry (CV). Moreover, by using a Zn/IF electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrates lower charge transfer resistance. In the application of a rechargeable ZAB, the fibrous Zn/IF electrode exhibits a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 78%, close to the conventional Zn/NF (80%), with almost similar capacity and lower charge transfer resistance, after 200 charge/discharge cycles. It is evident that all the positive features of Zn/IF, especially its low cost, shows that it can be a valuable anode for ZABs.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Incorporation of unripe (10–15%) and ripe (5–15%) gac fruit powder containing phenolic compounds and carotenoids remarkedly reduced the starch digestibility of pasta. Furthermore, gac fruit powder also decreased the percentage of rapidly digestible starch with a concomitant increase in the percentage of undigested starch in pasta. The dietary fiber content was markedly increased by the addition of gac fruit powder into pasta. The cooking loss, yellowness (b*), hardness and cohesiveness of pasta was increased with higher amount of ripe gac fruit powder. The replacement of wheat flour with unripe (5%) and ripe gac fruit powder (5–10%) had no effect on sensory acceptability of pasta. The findings suggest that gac fruit seems to be a promising functional ingredient to incorporate with pasta for reduction of starch digestibility.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Solute particles are found to reach their targeted residue due to their unique interactions with the residues. Degree of slowing down of the protein depends on the interaction strength f. Unlike a predictable dependence of the radius of gyration of the same protein on interaction in an effective medium, it does not show a systematic dependence on interaction due to pinning caused by the solute binding. Spread of the protein chain is quantified by estimating its effective dimension (D) from scaling of the structure factor. Even with a lower solute–residue interaction, the protein chain appears to conform to a random-coil conformation (D ∼ 2) in its native phase where it is globular in absence of such solute environment. The structural spread at small length scale differs from that at large scale in presence of stronger interactions: D ∼ 2.3 at smaller length scale and D ∼ 1.4 on larger scale with f = 3.5 while D ∼ 1.4 at smaller length scale and D ∼ 2.5 at larger length scales with f = 4.0.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, physics","Statistics and Probability, Condensed Matter Physics"

They were ultrasonographically examined to assess renal length, aortic luminal diameter, cortical thickness and medullary thickness. Results: Regardless of gonadal status, the renal length, aortic luminal diameter, cortical thickness and medulla thickness of males were greater than those of females (P <0.05). In general, neutered cats had thicker medullae (0.36 ± 0.08 cm) and higher mean renal length:aortic luminal diameter ratio (12.15 ± 1.48) than intact cats (0.32 ± 0.08 cm and 11.22 ± 1.37 cm, respectively) (P <0.05), but no differences were observed in renal length, cortical thickness or aortic luminal diameter. Interestingly, when comparing between sexes with relatively equal body weight, only sex had an impact on renal length.

The SPPA is a scheme where the investors propose to directly sell electricity from rooftop PVs to the customers. The proposed rates are typically performed in terms of the discount rates on the time-of-use (TOU) tariff with demand charges. The operation modes of the BESS should also be designed in accordance with the proposed rates. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to design the discount rates and operation modes of the BESS which will minimize the electricity charges of the customers while maintaining the revenue of the investors under the SPPA and BTMS. The reverse power flow is considered as additional revenue to the investors. This paper also implements the proposed methodology with tariff structure in Thailand. The result showed that the installed capacity of rooftop PVs and battery capacity directly affect the discount rates and operation modes of the BESS. The rate of excess energy also has a significant impact on the discount rates but not affect the operation modes.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical characteristics of EAOC patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective case–control study was conducted by analyzing data of patients from 1999 to 2014. Cases were endometriotic-cyst associated ovarian cancer with pathologically confirmed diagnosis. Controls were randomly selected with year-matched patients with benign ovarian endometriotic cyst. Univariate and multivariate with logistic regression analyses were used to identify patients’ characteristics that were risk factors for endometriotic-cyst associated ovarian cancer. Results: Altogether, 158 controls and 79 EAOC cases were recruited. Mean age of the EAOC group was 13 years older than that of the control group (49 vs. 36 years). The most common stage of EAOC was stage I (59.74%). Clear cell subtype is the most commonly found in this population (60.76%). Univariate analysis showed that age ≥42 years, menopause, weight loss, cyst diameter ≥8.33 cm, presence of solid area, bilaterality and CA 125 higher than 117.6 units/ml were significant. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with age ≥42 years (OR 7.69, 95%CI: 2.47, 23.87), menopause (OR 33.19, 95%CI: 2.37, 465.12), weight loss (OR 11.94, 95%CI: 1.52, 94.08), cyst diameter ≥ 8.3 cm (OR 10.56, 95%CI: 4.39, 25.35) and presence of solid area by ultrasonography (OR 6.70, 95%CI: 2.19, 22.35) were significant risk factors for EAOC.

Dysregulation of Lipid Metabolism in Macrophages Is Responsible for Severe Endotoxin Tolerance in FcgRIIB-Deficient Lupus Mice,"Jaroonwitchawan T., Visitchanakun P., Dang P.C., Ritprajak P., Palaga T., Leelahavanichkul A.",2020-06-09,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases, Animals, Cells, Cultured, Disease Models, Animal, Endotoxemia, Energy Metabolism, Female, Lipid Metabolism, Lipopolysaccharides, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Macrophages, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Knockout, Mitochondria, Phagocytosis, Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase, Phosphorylation, Receptors, IgG, AMPK, endotoxin tolerance, Fc gamma receptor IIb, lupus, macrophage, phosphatidylethanolamine","FcgRIIB dysfunction is commonly found in patients with lupus, especially in Asia. LPS-tolerance is prominent in FcgRIIB–/– lupus mice. LPS-tolerant macrophages demonstrate cell energy depletion, which might affect lipid metabolism. Therefore, to explore lipid metabolism, LPS-tolerance was induced twice by LPS administration in macrophages and in mice. LPS-tolerant FcgRIIB–/– macrophages demonstrated lesser mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), more severe ATP depletion, lower cytokine production, and higher lipid accumulation (oil red O staining) compared to LPS-tolerant WT cells. Mass-spectrometry-based lipidomic analysis demonstrated a higher abundance of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) phospholipid in LPS-tolerant FcgRIIB–/– macrophages than WT cells. This was at least in part due to the lower expression of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (pemt), an enzyme that converts PE to phosphatidylcholine (PC). Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), a pemt inhibitor, worsens LPS-tolerance in WT macrophages and supports the impact of pemt upon LPS-tolerant FcgRIIB–/– macrophages. Additionally, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK-p), a molecule for ATP-restoration associated with pemt, and phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase, a downstream signaling of AMPK-p, were higher in LPS-tolerant FcgRIIB–/– macrophages than WT. Furthermore, Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, attenuated LPS-tolerance in both FcgRIIB–/– macrophages and mice. Taken together, the intense decrease in cytokine production after the second LPS stimulation (LPS-tolerance) in FcgRIIB–/– macrophages was possibly due to the impact of an immense cytokine synthesis after the first dose of LPS. This includes using up PEMT, an enzyme of phospholipid synthesis during cytokine production, and AMPK-p induction in response to profound ATP-depletion. Therefore, the manipulation of the AMPK/PEMT axis provides a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of severe LPS-tolerance in lupus.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Physical biometric data such as the face, iris, and fingerprints are the main characteristics to recognize people. However, this information can be easily stolen and can be challenging to get far away from the camera. It becomes a problem in person identification to prove reliability. Furthermore, face features based person identification is not natural to recognize people in some circumstances, such as a considerable distance from the camera, poor lighting conditions, and large occlusions. The other biometric features as gait, skeleton data, full-body gestures, and poses are complicated to imitate and can capture in long-distance. In this paper, the gait biometric-based person identification using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)method is proposed to recognize the critical discriminative gait-features for human identification. The technique uses Gait Energy Images (GEI) of humans for identification. The proposed method has evaluated on the CASIA-B gait dataset. The empirical results showed suitable effectiveness compared with the state-of-art machine learning model for recognition in the environment with clothes changes and viewing angles variation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Computer Networks and Communications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

The present study aimed to determine factors influencing pre-ovulatory follicle diameter and weaning-to-ovulation interval (WOI) in spontaneously ovulating sows in tropical climates with special emphasis on breed, parity and backfat thickness at weaning. In total, 80 sows were included in the study. Follicle development was determined by using transrectal real-time B-mode ultrasonography every 6 hr after standing oestrus. Weaning-to-oestrous interval (WEI), oestrous-to-ovulation interval (EOI), WOI and the diameter of graafian follicles were investigated in relation to breed, parity number (1, 2–3 and 4–7) and backfat thickness (low, moderate and high) of sows. Overall, WEI, EOI, WOI and the pre-ovulatory follicle diameter were 92.5 ± 21.6 hr, 64.3 ± 19.3 hr, 156.3 ± 29.1 hr and 10.3 ± 2.0 mm, respectively. Pre-ovulatory follicle size was smaller in primiparous sows compared with sows of greater parity, 4–7 (9.7 ± 0.51 and 11.7 ± 0.52 mm, respectively, p <.05). Weaning-to-ovulation interval was positively correlated with WEI (r = 0.75, p <.001) and EOI (r = 0.66, p <.001), but negatively correlated with size of the graafian follicle (r = –0.34, p <.01). Sows with a shorter WEI had a larger pre-ovulatory follicle diameter (at 64 hr after oestrus) (r = –0.37, p <.01). Sows with low backfat thickness had a WOI 23.4 hr longer than those with moderate backfat thickness (p <.05) and 17.6 hr longer than sows with a high backfat thickness (p =.140). The follicle diameter in primiparous sows with high backfat thickness (11.7 ± 1.1 mm) was higher than in those with low (8.9 ± 0.7 mm, p <.05) or moderate (8.6 ± 0.8, p <.05) backfat thickness. In conclusion, factors influencing follicle diameter and WOI in sows included parity number and backfat thickness at weaning. The impact of backfat thickness on follicle diameter, WEI and WOI was most pronounced in primiparous sows.","endocrinology and metabolism; biochemistryistryhemistry and physicsiology of reproduction; female; ovarian cycle and ovulation, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biotechnology, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"

After weaning, the sows were divided into CONTROL (n = 212) and FIXED-TIME (n = 212) groups. Sows in the CONTROL group were inseminated at 12 and 36 h after the onset of oestrus, while sows in the FIXED-TIME group were administered 10 μg of GnRH at 72 h after weaning and were inseminated 32 h later. Reproductive performance parameters, including total born, born alive, mummified foetuses and stillborn piglets per litter, piglet birth weight, variation of piglet birth weight within litter, regular return-to-oestrus and farrowing rate, were compared between the two groups. Season was classified into two groups: cool (n = 170) and hot (n = 254), and insemination technique was classified into two groups: conventional AI (n = 171) and intra-uterine insemination (IUI) with a reduced number of spermatozoa (n = 253). On average, regular return-to-oestrus (3.3 vs. 5.6%, P > 0.05) and farrowing rates (92.8 vs. 88.1%, P > 0.05) did not differ between CONTROL and FIXED-TIME groups. However, the total born and born alive piglets per litter in the FIXED-TIME were lower than in the CONTROL group (12.0 vs. 12.8 piglets/litter; P = 0.030 and 11.3 vs. 12.2 piglets/litter, P = 0.007). Interestingly, the number of total born piglets in the FIXED-TIME group was lower than in the CONTROL group only in the sows inseminated in the hot season (11.7 ± 0.32 and 12.9 ± 0.31, respectively, P = 0.005). Piglet birth weight, variation of piglet birth weight within litter, number of piglets at weaning and body weight of piglets at weaning did not differ between groups, irrespective of the season (P > 0.05). The total number of piglets born per litter in the FIXED-TIME group was lower than that in the CONTROL group in sows inseminated via IUI (11.7 ± 0.32 and 12.9 ± 0.32, respectively, P = 0.013), but not in sows inseminated using conventional AI (12.7 ± 0.42 and 12.5 ± 0.41, respectively, P = 0.772). Single fixed-time AI could be successfully performed in sows under a tropical climate, with a promising reproductive performance. However, a decreased litter size at birth after single fixed-time AI was observed when insemination was performed in the hot season. Moreover, single fixed-time AI using IUI with a reduced number of spermatozoa also decreased litter size at birth.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

At present, a large number of researches in stability analyses of tunneling in rock masses have been conducted; however, a lack of an accurate and reliable design equation for the tunnel stability prediction is obvious. This paper presents a new design equation for stability analyses of shallow unlined circular tunnels in rock masses obeying the Generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion. Because of the complexity of the problem’s nature, a closed-formed analytical solution of the problem is not possible to be achieved. Hence, the computational framework of the finite element limit analysis is selected to numerically derive the upper and lower bound solutions of the problem. A complete set of the dimensionless parameters covering the shallow cover-depth ratios of tunnels, the normalized uniaxial compressive strength of intact rocks, and the Hoek-Brown material parameters are comprehensively investigated. A new design equation for stability analyses of shallow unlined circular tunnels in rock masses is developed by employing a nonlinear regression analysis to the numerically derived average bound solutions. It is found that the proposed new design equation is highly accurate and provides a convenient and reliable tool for stability analyses of shallow unlined tunnels in rock masses in practice.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

Incidence and risk factors associated with injuries during static line parachute training in Royal Thai Army,"Maneechaeye W., Deepreecha K., Jiamjarasrangsi W.",2020-06-07,"Adolescent, Adult, Aviation, Cohort Studies, Humans, Incidence, Male, Military Personnel, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Teaching, Thailand, Wounds and Injuries, Injuries, Parachute, Paratroopers","Background: Incidence and risk factors of parachute injuries has been studied in developed countries, but not in trainees of the airborne forces in the Royal Thailand Army. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 992 military personnel who attended the basic airborne training program from February to July 2018. Information sheets were used to collect data about (a) personal demographics; (b) environmental conditions surrounding the parachute practice; and (c) parachute-related injuries. The incidence rate of injury was then calculated. Risk factors were examined using multilevel Poisson regression analysis and presented as incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: A total of 166 parachute-related injuries occurred in 4677 jumps. The incidence rate of injury was 35.50 per 1000 jumps (95%CI: 30.04-41.21). Factors significantly related to parachute injury included: jumping with equipment versus without equipment [adjusted IRR (95% CI): 1.28 (0.88-1.87)], higher wind speed [1.54 (1.27-1.87) per knot], airplane versus helicopter exit [1.75(0.68-4.55)], side versus rear exit [2.13 (1.43-3.23)], night versus day jumping [2.19 (0.81-5.90)], and presence of motion sickness [3.43 (1.93-6.92)]. Conclusions: To prevent military static line parachute injuries, the following factors should be taken into consideration: type of aircraft, aircraft exit, time of the day, equipment, motion sickness and wind speed. Trial registration: The project was certified by the Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB No. 697/60).","occupational Health Professionsth and industrial medicalcine, medical",Medicine (all)

HIV Western blot assay was also performed to assess HIV-specific antibodies.Results:The 2ndG IA demonstrated the highest frequency of seroreactivity in children (69%) followed by the 4thG IA (40%) and the RDT (26%) after one year of ART. Infants initiating ART during ages 3-6 months (N = 15) showed a greater frequency (range: 53%-93%) and breadth (median and range: 3 [1-4]) of reactivity across the assays compared with those treated within 3 months (N = 43):16%-61% and breadth (1 [0-4]). The 4thG IA showed significantly reduced reactivity relative to the 2ndG IA at one (P = 0.016) and 3 (P = 0.004) years of ART. Western blot profiles following 3 years of ART showed the highest frequency of reactivity to HIV Gag p24 (76%) and lowest reactivity to Env gp120 and gp41, with only 24% of children confirmed positive by the assay.Conclusions:These results suggest that the use of 4thG IA and RDT test combination algorithms with limited HIV antigen breadth may not be adequate for diagnosis of HIV-infected children following early treatment.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

Effect of Pd particle size on activity and cis-trans selectivity in partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived FAMEs over Pd/SiO2 catalysts,"Numwong N., Prabnasak P., Prayoonpunratn P., Triphatthanaphong P., Thunyaratchatanon C., Mochizuki T., Chen S.-Y., Luengnaruemitchai A., Sooknoi T.",2020-06-15,"Cis-trans, Fatty acid methyl ester, Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Pd/SiO2 catalysts, cis-trans selectivity, Fatty acid methyl ester, Oxidative stability, Partial hydrogenation, Particle size, Pd/SiO2 catalyst","Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was performed to improve oxidative stability of biodiesel. The reaction was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 100 °C, 0.4 MPa. The effect of Pd particle size on activity and cis-trans selectivity was investigated over SiO2- and MCM-41-supported Pd catalysts, with different Pd loadings (0.5 and 1 wt.%). For Pd/SiO2 catalysts with relatively large Pd particle sizes (6.1–7.8 nm), the adsorption of polyunsaturated C18:2 and C18:3 FAMEs was promoted on the flat metal surface, providing 2- to 3-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) compared with Pd/MCM-41 catalysts. In contrast, the Pd/MCM-41 catalysts with relatively small Pd particle sizes (2.7–4.0 nm), showed higher selectivity towards the desired monounsaturated C18:1 FAMEs due to lower affinity of isolated double bond (presented in C18:1) on the Pd surface. In addition, selectivity towards the desired cis-C18:1 FAMEs was found to be highly sensitive to Pd particle size. The 0.5Pd/MCM-41 catalyst with small Pd particle size (2.7 nm), provided high cis-C18:1 selectivity, resulting in a biodiesel with better cold flow property compared with the trans-isomers. With partial hydrogenation over the prepared Pd catalysts, biodiesel with significantly improved oxidative stability (>10 h) could be obtained.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

In this work, a phospholipid, namely, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DMPG), was used to induce and accelerate the gelation process of SF solutions. Due to the amphipathic nature and negative charge of DMPG, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the phospholipids and SF chains will occur, inducing the structural transition of SF chains to the beta sheet and consequently a rapid gel formation is observed (less than 50 min). Moreover, the gelation time can be controlled by varying the lipid concentration. To assess the potential of the hydrogels as cell carriers, several mammalian cell lines, including L929, NIH/3T3, SaOS-2, and CaSki, were encapsulated into the hydrogel. The silk-based hydrogels supported the normal growth of fibroblasts, corroborating their cytocompatibility. Interestingly, an inhibition in the growth of cancer-derived cell lines was observed. Therefore, DMPG-induced SF hydrogels can be successfully used as a 3D platform for in situ cell encapsulation, opening promising opportunities in biomedical applications, such as in cell therapies and tissue regeneration.","fluidex; related topics, medical, Materials Science, engineering","Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

The rheological properties of the uncured neat epoxy and epoxy composite with graphite, graphene, and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) were evaluated to observe the macroscopic flow behavior and the microstructure by shear force. The results showed that epoxy/carbon composites at high filler content exhibited shear-thinning behavior with a high yield stress value and epoxy/MWCNT at 30 phr showed this characteristic obviously. The fractured surface and particle dispersion in the epoxy matrix were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Epoxy/carbon composites at high filler content displayed rough fracture surface with particle agglomeration, thus the electrical conductivity increased. The result showed that the epoxy/MWCNT composites had high potential to use as a conductive adhesive with a 3D printing process due to high electrical conductivity with high viscosity that could be formed easily during processing.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Background: The early repolarization pattern refers to abnormal ending of the QRS complex in subjects with structurally normal hearts and has been associated with VF. Methods: We studied a patient with slurring of the QRS complex in leads II, III, and aVF of the ECG and recurrent episodes of VF. Echocardiographic and imaging studies did not reveal any abnormalities. Endocardial mapping was normal but subxyphoidal epicardial access was not possible. Open chest epicardial mapping was performed. Results: Mapping showed that the inferior right ventricular free wall activated the latest with local J-waves in unipolar electrograms. The last moment of epicardial activation concurred with QRS-slurring in the ECG whereas the J-waves in the local unipolar electrograms occurred in the ST-segment of the ECG. Myocardial biopsies obtained from the late activated tissue showed severe fibrofatty alterations in the inferior right ventricular wall where fractionation and local J-waves were present. After ablation, the early repolarization pattern in the ECG disappeared and arrhythmias have been absent since (follow-up 18 months). Conclusions: In this patient, the electrocardiographic early repolarization pattern was caused by late activation due to structurally abnormal myocardium. The late activated areas were marked by J-waves in local electrograms.

Under on and off electric field, the MWCNT/PLA/DBP composites showed electromechanical recoverability with typical fast response times less than 1 min. The 0.1%v/v MWCNT-1200/PLA/DBP possessed the highest positive storage modulus sensitivity value of 1.95 at the electric field strength of 1.5 kV/mm. The storage modulus response with a value close to zero was observed at a MWCNT content between 0.8 and 0.9 %v/v. At high MWCNT concentrations, the storage modulus response became negative definite at high electric field strengths. This negative electrostriction behavior was in contrast to the positive definite electrostrictive responses of other materials. In the bending experiments, the 0.1%v/v MWCNT-2100/PLA/DBP produced relatively higher bending responses and dielectrophoresis forces at electric field strengths below 300 V/mm. At higher electric field strengths and higher MWCNTs contents, the dipole moment interaction was screened resulting in the decreases in the electrostriction, bending response and dielectrophoresis force. Thus, it has been demonstrated here that the MWCNTs induced the negative electrostriction in the plasticized PLA, possibly through the physical screening and free volume.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The characterization and “Off–On” sensing phenomena were established through UV–Vis, fluorescence, NMR, and FTIR techniques. The PSS-Rho4 showed high selectivity and sensitivity for Au3+ over other metal ions. Upon the addition of Au3+, significant color change and “Off–On” fluorescence were observed due to a cation Au3+ induced spirolactam ring-opening process with detection limit down to micromolar values (1.2 μM). In addition, spray coating thin polymeric sensor films were produced onto the surface of material (PSS-Rho4-ITO and PSS-Rho4-filtered paper) providing a fast, portable, and easy-to-use molecular device for the detection of Au3+ in the real system.

Therefore, therapeutic approaches that target EMT have garnered increasing attention. The present study aimed to examine the in vitro effects of ephemeranthol A on cell death, migration, and EMT of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Ephemeranthol A was isolated from Dendrobium infundibulum. Non-small cell lung cancer cells H460 were treated with ephemeranthol A and apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining. Anoikis resistance was determined by soft agar assay. Wound healing assay was performed to test the migration. The regulatory proteins of apoptosis and cell motility were determined by western blot. Results: Treatment with ephemeranthol A resulted in a concentration-dependent cell apoptosis. At non-toxic concentrations, the compound could inhibit anchorage-independent growth of the cancer cells, as indicated by the decreased colony size and number. Ephemeranthol A also exhibited an inhibitory effect on migration. We further found that ephemeranthol A exerts its antimetastatic effects via inhibition of EMT, as indicated by the markedly decrease of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug. Furthermore, the compound suppressed the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (Akt) proteins, which are key regulators of cell migration. As for the anticancer activity, ephemeranthol A induced apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 followed by the activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9. Conclusion: The pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory effects of ephemeranthol A on human lung cancer cells support its use for the development of novel anticancer therapies.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

There are no data whether peripheral IL-6 and IL-4 may affect the phenome of schizophrenia above and beyond the effects of TNF-α and whether those cytokines are regulated by lowered natural IgM to malondialdehyde (MDA) and paraoxonase 1 enzyme activity. We assessed the aforementioned biomarkers in a cross-sectional study that enrolled schizophrenia patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was best predicted by a combination of increased IL-6 and PON1 status (QQ genotype and lowered CMPAase activity) and lowered IgM to MDA. Partial least squares bootstrapping shows that 41.0% of the variance in negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, psychomotor retardation, and formal thought disorders was explained by increased TNF-α and PON1 status (QQ genotype and lowered CMPAase activity), which lowered IL-4 and IgM to MDA as well as male sex and lowered education. We found that 47.9% of the variance in verbal fluency, word list memory, true recall, Mini-Mental State Examination, and executive functions was predicted by increased TNF-α and lowered IL-4, IgM to MDA, and education. In addition, both TNF-α and IL-4 levels were significantly associated with lowered IgM to MDA, while TNF-α was correlated with PON1 status. These data provide evidence that the symptomatic (both the deficit subtype and OSOS) and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are to a large extent mediated by the effects of immune-mediated neurotoxicity as well as lowered regulation by the innate immune system.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

A water electrolyzer (WE) is installed in the system to produce and store hydrogen, which is used by the HVs and fuel cell (FC). During the inaccessibility of the photovoltaic (PV) system to feed the EVs, the FC runs on hydrogen to regenerate electricity. Besides, in case the PV system and FC have power shortage to meet the demand of EVs, a diesel generator contributes to electricity production. There are uncertainties involved in the power profile of the PV system as well as the hydrogen and electric demands of the charging station. The novelty of this paper is to integrate robust optimization as a powerful nonstochastic framework into the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) of the deterministic model to deal with the uncertainties. The technical and economic results prove that the construction of the charging station by considering the highs level of robustness against the negative impacts of uncertainties leads to higher capacities of the PV system and diesel generator. Consequently, the total annualized cost increases from $ 287,256 in deterministic mode to $ 326,757 in robust mode, by 13.75%.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

We applied Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to characterize the lateral, vertical morphological and sedimentary structures of paleo-channels, floodplain and recent point bars. Both methods were interpreted together with on-sites boreholes to describe the physical properties of subsurface sediments. As a result, we concluded that four radar reflection patterns including reflection free, shingled, inclined and hummocky reflections were appropriated to apply as criteria to characterize lateral accretion, the meandering rivers with channel-filled sequence and floodplain were detected from ERT profiles. The changes in resistivity correspond well with differences in particle size and show relationship with ERT lithological classes. Clay, silt, sand, loam and bedrock were classified by the resistivity data. Geometry of paleo-channel embayment and lithological differences can be detected by ERT, whereas GPR provides detail subsurface facies for describing point bar sand deposit better than ERT.","water engineeringneering, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

The pathophysiology of these symptoms may in part, be ascribed to activated immune pathways, although it is unclear whether muscular factors play a role in their onset. The aim of the present study is to examine the role of muscle proteins in major depression in association with symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. We measured serum levels of agrin, talin-2, titin, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) as well as the FibroFatigue (FF), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores in 60 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. The results show a significant increase in agrin and talin-2 in MDD patients as compared with controls. There were highly significant correlations between agrin and HAM-D, BDI-II and FF scores. Agrin, but not talin or titin, was significantly and positively associated with all 12 items of the FF scale. We found that a large part of the variance in HAM-D (47.4%), BDI-II (43.4%) and FF (43.5%) scores was explained by the regression on agrin, smoking, female sex (positively associated) and education (inversely associated). CPK was significantly and inversely associated with the total FF score and with muscle and gastro-intestinal symptoms, fatigue, a flu-like malaise, headache and memory, autonomic and sleep disturbances. These results suggest that aberrations in neuromuscular (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions play a role in MDD and that the aberrations in NMJs coupled with lowered CPK may play a role in chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia symptoms in MDD. Moreover, the increase of agrin in MDD probably functions as part of the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS).","biochemistryistry, medical, neuroscience","Biochemistry, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Interdependent multi-task learning for simultaneous segmentation and detection,"Reginthala M., Iwahori Y., Bhuyan M.K., Hayashi Y., Achariyaviriya W., Kijsirikul B.",2020-01-01,"Independent tasks, Real-world, Semantic segmentation, Task networks, Visual perception, Deep Learning, Multi-task Learning, Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation","Lightweight, fast, and accurate deep-learning algorithms are essential for practical deployment in real-world use-cases. Semantic segmentation and object detection are the principal tasks of visual perception. A multitask network significantly reduces the number of parameters compared to two independent networks running simultaneously for each task. Generally, multi-task networks have shared encoders and multiple independent task-specific decoders. Instead, we modeled our network to exploit the features from both encoder and decoder. We propose the multi-task network that performs both segmentation and detection with only 37.9 million parameters and inference time of 74 milliseconds on a consumer-grade GPU. This network performs two tasks with much fewer parameters and in much less inference time compared to each single task network.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Efficient stoneware hand mold for slip casting in natural rubber latex glove preparation,"Tangboriboon N., Teeraroengrit S., Chawhuaymhak P., Kamonsawas J., Changkhamchom S., Sirivat A.",2020-11-01,"Adhesion properties, Elongation at break, Firing temperature, Hygienic conditions, medical gloves, Natural rubber latex, Percentage elongation, Pharmaceutical industry, Ceramic hand mold, mechanical properties, medical gloves, natural rubber latex film","Disposal medical gloves are an important product to maintain hygienic conditions, ensuring security for patients and safeguarding against infections. They are used in many fields, such as dental and medical, beauty and cuisine, food and pharmaceutical industries. Presently, aging populations and an emerging middle class in developing countries require medical gloves at a higher volume. Therefore, the demand for medical gloves increases continuously. In this work, two types of hand molds were prepared from stoneware clay and plaster to be used in the natural rubber glove preparation. The ceramic stoneware and plaster hand molds were prepared by the slip casting. The obtained stoneware hand molds were found to be superior to the commercial hand molds. Natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves were fabricated by dipping the stoneware hand mold coated with a coagulant into the NRL compound using the sulfur curing system at 120°C for 30 min. The latex solid:water weight ratio, drying and firing temperatures, and firing time used to prepare stoneware hand molds were found to affect the adsorption–adhesion properties between the mold surface and the NRL films. The obtained NRL films were further characterized for the physical properties such as appearance, film thickness, tackiness, and effusion of the phase formation by X-ray diffraction, the microstructure by scanning electron microscope, and the mechanical properties. The NRL glove films prepared by the stoneware hand mold possessed the high percentage elongation at break and the maximum load stress equal to 1343.30 ± 78.36% and 12.74 ± 2.34 MPa, respectively. On the other hand, the latex glove films prepared by the plaster hand mold with 80 consistency provided the percentage of elongation at break and the maximum load stress equal to 531.76 ± 2.54 and 21.01 ± 0.08 MPa, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
A preliminary investigation for Cu distribution in paddy soil and rice plants in contaminated paddy fields,"Damrongsiri S., Chotipong A.",2020-04-01,"Acid-soluble fractions, Agricultural practices, Anaerobic environment, Community bureau of references, Cu concentrations, Distribution, Paddy soils, Rice, Copper, Distribution, Fractionation, Paddy soil, Rice, Wastewater","The soil sample of a paddy field was found to be contaminated by copper (Cu). The application of wastewater as the nitrogen fertilizer was identified as the cause in this study. The concentration of Cu in soil and rice plants was therefore explored. The paddy soil characteristics indicated a strong anaerobic environment. The Cu concentration in topsoil was 123 ± 24 mg kg−1. The Community Bureau of Reference (BCR)’s fractionation of Cu from high to low was residual fraction (62.1%) > organically bounded and sulfide-bounded fractions (24.2%) > iron oxide and manganese oxide fraction (8.8%) > acid-soluble fractions (4.8%). The concentration of Cu in rice organs was the highest in the roots, followed by the straw, grain, and husk. The correlation of Cu in rice straws with every fractionation of Cu in soil was strong. However, the weak correlation between Cu in rice grains and soil was found. The result of Cu mass balance in the soil–rice cultivation system showed that less than 0.1% of Cu was translocated to rice plant. The average Cu intake through rice grain consumption (621 μg day−1) indicated the Cu supply to human body basic need without any potential negative health impacts to consumer. However, this level of Cu may cause toxicity to rice growth and productivity. Soil replacement may be more appropriate than soil treatment in this study. In addition, agricultural practices should be managed to prevent further contamination and promote more aerobic conditions.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Engineering, Agronomy and Crop Science, Water Science and Technology"

Biomacromolecules had varying effects on physicochemical and mechanical properties of PU foam. With 2% incorporation, starches, high molecular weight chitosan and gelatin provided stiffer and more porous foams while carboxymethylcellulose had the highest compression strength but the lowest water vapor transmission. High water absorption was from foams with carboxymethylcellulose, alginate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and low molecular weight chitosan. Increasing the concentrations up to 12% had more prominent effect. However, powdery surface was noticed with poorer tensile properties that 6% incorporation was selected. FTIR spectra and DSC thermograms suggested interaction of PU formulation with biomacromolecules. EDS analysis confirmed existence of active compounds while acceptable stability was from sterilized PUC foam with alginate. On healthy volunteers, this selected foam dressing caused no skin irritation and retained moisture comparable to commercial product. In patients with traumatic dermal wounds, healing improvement with shorter wound closure time, higher reepithelialization and less pain score were from the selected foam dressing compared to standard gauze soaked with chlorhexidine. This PU-alginate combined foam dressing adsorbed with asiaticoside and silver nanoparticles proved advantages for traumatic dermal wound management.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

The combination of drugs acting at different targets or mechanisms of action has been recognized as an alternative approach for achieving optimal analgesia. In this study, the analgesic effects of pregabalin (30, 60, 100, 200 mg/kg), curcumin (15, 30, 60, 100, 120 mg/kg), and 1:1 fixed-dose ratio of the pregabalin-curcumin combination were assessed using two acute nociceptive pain models, the acetic acid-induced writhing and tail-flick tests in mice. The pregabalin-curcumin combination produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean of writhes and an increase in the percentage of antinociception by the acetic acid-induced writhing test. In the tail-flick test, the combination also showed an improvement in antinociception indicated by the tail-flick latency, % antinociception, and area under the curve (AUC). Isobolographic analysis of interactions demonstrated a significant synergistic interaction effect between pregabalin and curcumin in both acute nociceptive pain models with the experimental ED50 below the predicted additive line and the combination index < 1.

Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation using immobilized Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 on Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) chemically pretreated with H2SO4, NaOH, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM-OAc) was compared in order to investigate the effect of the treatment on butanol production. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface area measurement analyses indicated that the alkaline-pretreated Napier grass sample had the highest crystalline level with the lowest lignin content (lignin/cellulose) and a high surface area compared with other pretreated samples, suggesting its potential as an immobilized material. The fermentation was operated in a batch system for 5 days with an initial glucose level of 60 g/L. Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 immobilized on the NaOH-treated Napier grass gave the highest butanol concentration (8.99 g/L), which corresponded to a 24.7% and 25.6% higher concentration than that when the cells were immobilized on untreated Napier grass and free cell culture, respectively. It is likely that immobilization on NaOH-treated Napier grass increased the cells’ protection from environmental stresses and prevented their washing out due to its swollen structure within an enlarged surface area.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Homology modeling followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that unique amino acid residues in the complementary subunits of the nAChR subtypes are involved in subtype-specific selectivity profiles. In the complementary β4-subunit of the α3β4 nAChR binding pocket, non-conserved AspB173 through a salt bridge was found to be the key determinant for the α3β4 selectivity of the quinuclidine-triazole chemotype, explaining the 47–327-fold affinity of the (S)-enantiomers as compared to their (R)-enantiomer counterparts. Regarding the α7 nAChR subtype, the amino acids promoting a however significantly lower preference for the (R)-enantiomers were the conserved TyrA93, TrpA149 and TrpB55 residues. The non-conserved amino acid residue in the complementary subunit of nAChR subtypes appeared to play a significant role for the nAChR subtype-selective binding, particularly at the heteropentameric subtype, whereas the conserved amino acid residues in both principal and complementary subunits are essential for ligand potency and efficacy.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The maximum detergency exceeded 90% removal using 0.1 w/v% C14-15-8PO-SO4Na/0.2 w/v% 1-octanol/4 w/v% NaCl (final optimized surfactant system) at 10 °C. The current work thus seeks to further investigate surfactant formulations capable of providing improved detergency performance. Different 50% linear anionic extended surfactant structures (LC14-15-8PO-SO4Na, LC14-15-8PO-3EO-SO4Na, and LC14-15-8PO-7EO-SO4Na) were compared with the branched C14-15-8PO-SO4Na previously studied. Detergency of coconut oil using C14-15-8PO-SO4Na at 8 w/v% NaCl (S*) still performed more effectively than these new surfactant systems. The addition of octanol as a detergency additive was further studied, and it showed that S* reduced from 8 w/v% NaCl to 4 w/v% NaCl for 1-octanol and to 2 w/v% NaCl for 2-octanol and 2-ethyl-hexanol in the C14-15-8PO-SO4Na surfactant formulation. Coconut oil removal significantly improved detergency from roughly 49% for no alcohol with 8 w/v% NaCl, to 83% for 2-ethyl-hexanol with 2 w/v% NaCl, to 95% for 1-octanol with 4 w/v% NaCl, and to 98% for 2-octanol with 2 w/v% NaCl. Further studies on octanol concentration showed that decreasing 1-octanol from 1.2% (90 mM) to 0.2% (15.3 mM) and 2-octanol from 1.2% (90 mM) to 0.5% (38.5 mM) still maintained detergency over 90% removal. In this work, cold-water detergency was found to correlate with low interfacial tension above the melting point, improved wetting of the semisolid soil, and oil solubilization in surfactant micelles.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

In addition, the minimum energy pathways (MEPs) and the saddle point configurations during Zr or Al atom migration were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB). The energetic results show that the VZr-mediated nearest neighbor (NN) jump mechanism is the feasible migration mechanism for Zr atom and dominant Al atom diffusion mechanism is the antisite assisted (AS) mechanism because of the lowest diffusion activation energy barrier. The present study lays the foundation for further investigation, including solute-diffusion in Zr3Al and quantitative calculation of diffusion coefficients, and provides theoretical guideline for further design and improvement of the crucial diffusion-mediated properties of Zr3Al.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

House dust mite (HDM) allergy is frequent around the world, the sensitization profile to individual HDM allergens varies in individual HDM-allergic patients (APs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of IgE sensitization to three major Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) allergens among patients from North Eastern Poland suffering from HDM-AR and/or AA. Patients and methods: The study was performed on 323 HDM-AR and/or AA patients and 106 controls (CG) including 30 healthy non-atopic subjects, 32 AR patients not sensitized to Dp and 44 non-atopic asthmatics. IgE levels to natural (n)Der p 1, nDer p 2, recombinant (r)Der p 2.0101 and rDer p 23 allergens were measured by ELISA. Results: The majority of HDM-APs were sensitized to nDer p 1 (72.1%), nDer p 2 (81.7%), rDer p 2.0101 (78.3%) and rDer p 23 (70.9%). The frequency of positive results to individual allergens depended on clinical manifestations and the level of IgE to the whole Dp extract. In HDM-AA patients, reactivity to nDer p 1 and rDer p 23 was detected more frequently than in HDM-AR patients. The whole Dp extract completely inhibited IgE binding to nDer p 1 and nDer p 2 but only partially to rDer p 23. Conclusions: HDM-APs from North-Eastern Poland display sensitization profile to major allergens which is similarly observed in western Europe.

Background: In Europe and the USA, nurses are moving to a 12-hr shift, and numerous studies have revealed the positive and negative effects of these. However, lesser known is the impact of 24-hr nursing shifts on care quality, and health and safety. In Cambodia, 100% of nurses are rostered for these in their shift patterns, but until this study no research had been conducted on such shifts. Design: A qualitative descriptive study. Method: Three focus group discussions were conducted with 30 registered nurses in July 2019, ten in each group, from three intensive care units of three hospitals in Cambodia. Data saturation was obtained. Data were analysed using content analysis, and the COREQ was applied for reporting this study. Findings: The ICU nurses’ perspectives revealed significant and unacceptable effects of working shifts of ~25-hr length, taking into account staff handover. Two major themes arose: It is so exhausting and Compromised hospital care. Alarmingly, participants worked on average 72 hr per week, were exhausted, and nursed between 6 and 10 critically ill patients per shift. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study on nurses working 24-hr shifts, revealing unacceptable, high risks for the health and safety of nurses and patients, with nursing activities left undone, and a lack of quality care. Relevance to clinical practice: Improving nurse and patient health and safety, and quality of care requires hospital leaders to work with government and nursing organisations to develop better shift strategies. Resources need to be provided so that: nurses can work a maximum 12-hr shifts; the ratio of nurses to patients is improved; and nurses can have decent break times.

The obtained g-C3N4 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity analyses, and ultraviolet–visible-near-infrared (UV–VIS-NIR) spectroscopy. The correlations between the calcination temperature, properties, and photocatalytic activity of prepared products were investigated. The results demonstrated that the g-C3N4 photocatalysts can be successfully synthesized at temperatures of 500–600 °C with a controlled heating rate of 5 °C/min. In contrast, the intermediate product was observed in sample calcined at 400 °C. It was demonstrated that calcination at higher temperatures possibly increased the active sites and enhanced both of the photocatalytic activity and dye adsorption ability. Herein, the dye degradation efficiency (DE%) under visible light irradiation within 10 min were presented as 2.52, 16.01, 62.37, and 92.64% which were well developed as a function of calcination temperature from 400 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, to 600 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the dye degradation rate could possibly induce decomposition pathway of rhodamine B. The photocatalytic efficiency was maintained after four times of reuse. It can be concluded that the thermal process plays an important role in controlling the properties and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

This green technique does not require catalyst and is highly environmental-friendly. With 15% H2: 85% He mixed carrier gas concentration ratio and initial 31 °C (rising to 50 °C due to plasma), after 4 h of plasma hydrogenation, iodine value (IV) was reduced from 60.89 to 48.39 and detected trans-fat was 1.44%. This represents trans-fat generation rate of only 0.07% per % decrease in IV, which is about 6.12 times lower than a conventional method relying on high temperature, high pressure and catalyst. About 8 h was required to produce margarine with texture closest to commercial margarines. Acid value (AV) reduced from 0.47 to 0.27%, or 43% reduction, after 12–20 h of treatment, significantly indicating that plasma hydrogenation can also help extend shelf life of oil or margarine. Large portion of DBD plasma hydrogenated palm oil can, thus, be mixed with palm olein and interesterified palm oil to produce margarine with overall trans-fatty acid content no higher than regulatory requirement. Continuous production scheme was presented. This novel plasma hydrogenation technique offers promising possibility for commercial utilization by edible oils industry.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, chemistry, engineering","Food Science, Chemistry (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

There are many researches explain on innovation, characteristics, typology, effect on business success and etc. All strategists in business have no doubt on innovation and try to create it in their firms. Furthermore, process of innovation has been regarded as the center of interests from many business fields to find out and leading to 2 different models: closed and open innovation, to make innovation done in business firm. After that, numerous innovations were launch to market and make “adverse event”; change value and supply chain, disrupts old version product, change business model and etc., that significantly impact business environment, but no one exactly describe the phenomena as above. This paper is the first to explain the adverse effect in the relation to theory and provide argument with some strongly evidence. Kinetic, resulting from motion, are used to be the basic approach, and five phases of Inno-Kinetic (Kinetic of Innovation) are proposed to explain the movement of innovation in this paper After innovation is launched, innovation’s movement will influence many compositions of business. The empirical evidence show that some innovation affects the business before its establishment, The Zero phase, “4As phase”, innovators must diffuse some knowledge for value chain and supply chain creation. Relative businesses within business environment will take responsibility in 4 As; adopt, adjust-adapt, advocate and avoid, that will shape innovation feature. The 1st phase; “All or None phase,” key compositions as rival and customer are dominant role to accept or reject. Acceptation of them will induce support from others to access some specific resources (on not resist to acquire). On the other hand, rejection will induce resistance to operate that some innovation that is destroyed by rejection. The 2nd phase, “Absorption phase,” after first group of potential customers accept innovation, some of them, who act as the influencer will be the key opinion leader (KOL), who will take role as the “Guru” and send messages about advantage of innovation to other change agents. The 3rd phase, “Distribution phase,” the message will be quickly distributed from the change agents both through the formal and informal communication. At this phase, personal bias is the most powerful to drive demand (or inhibit). The 4th phase, “Digestion phase,” all customers will experience innovation by themselves then make a decision whether to repeat or reject. The last phase, “3 Es phase”, response of innovation will reflect the owner to evaluate (1st E) and find solution that will make elongation (2nd E) of innovation life cycle or time to the end (3rd E). Under the hypothesis, good strategy come from suitable data, the 5 phases of Inno-Kinetic may be innovative approach for strategic management in the future.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

Some mesomeric betaine dyes had solvatochromic properties, and were sensitive to pH and solvates in the water. Certain betaine dyes had different properties in acidic and basic environments; the reversible interconversion between yellow (neutral or basic condition) and colorless (acidic condition) forms of the dye occurs by pH change. The changes in UV absorbance intensities of the dyes in the presence of cyclodextrins indicated the inclusion complex formation between cyclodextrins and dyes. The betaine dyes were partially dissolved in water due to the presence of positive and negative charges in the molecule. These betaine dyes did not exhibit cytotoxic activity, hence may be used in biological research.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

It is rich in phenolic compounds. The present study utilized water crude extract of C. formosum leaves to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) by green synthesis. The synthesized ZnO NPs with the average electronic band gap ∼3 eV were obtained and found to either have spherical shape or sheet-like structures depending on synthesis process and concentration of crude extract. Higher concentration of C. formosum extract also eliminates impurity of Zn(OH)2 during the synthesis. Results from an agar disk diffusion assay demonstrated that all synthesized ZnO samples inhibited growth of Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. Furthermore, all synthesized ZnO demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity against non-melanoma skin cancer cells (A431) and the intermediary of cancerous keratinocytes (HaCaT) without affecting normal cell lines (Vero). In addition, we observed that the ZnO nanosheet offered stronger cytotoxicity effects against A431 than spherical shaped ZnO particles. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data revealed that synthesized ZnO nanosheets altered the number of genes in pathways involved in cancer and MAPK signaling pathways in A431 cells. Several isoforms of metallothionein transcripts were upregulated including transcripts involved in inflammatory responses whereas transcripts promoted cell proliferation and apoptosis were downregulated. Therefore, these studies firstly reported potential usage of the green-synthesized ZnO nanosheets from C. formosum extract for development of antibacterial substances or anticancer drugs.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Extensive surgical release exposes deep vital structures, which subsequently requires significant skin coverage. The author presents the results of using bilateral side-finger flaps (wing flaps) and full-thickness skin graft for coverage of the defects. Methods: Seven patients (8 fingers) with chronic severe flexion contractures of fingers resulting from burn injury were included. Results: Mean flexion contracture and full flexion angles of the joints were improved from 84.4°/93.7° to 4.7°/92.5° at the last follow-up visit. No major complications were observed during the postoperative follow-up period (range, 6-16 months). Conclusions: This alternative surgical technique can be successfully applied for the treatment of chronic severe flexion contractures of fingers. The advantages of this approach are the use of local flaps from injured digit, and that it can be performed as a one-session procedure.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"
Land-Use Changes and the Effects of Oil Palm Expansion on a Peatland in Southern Thailand,"Srisunthon P., Chawchai S.",2020-11-24,"Anthropogenic disturbance, Anthropogenic impacts, Anthropogenic pressures, Increasing capacities, Indirect land-use changes, Land use and land cover, Long term monitoring, Oil palm plantations, carbon storage, land-use and cover change, palm oil, peat swamp forests, tropical peatland","Tropical peatlands are one of the largest reservoirs of terrestrial organic carbon. However, present-day tropical peat swamp forests are under threat by anthropogenic disturbances and have already been widely degraded. Anthropogenic pressures on peatland ecosystems have resulted in ecological and biogeochemical changes and the release of carbon to the atmosphere. In Southeast Asia, the conversion of peatlands to oil palm plantations has accelerated significantly during the last 2 decades. This research analyzed direct and indirect land-use changes (DLUC and ILUC) that have been associated with oil palm expansion and anthropogenic impacts in the Princess Sirindhorn Wildlife Sanctuary (PSWS), Narathiwat, southern Thailand. Our analysis is based on land-use and land-cover data of the Land Development of Thailand from two different periods: 2000–2009 and 2009–2016. For the purpose of comparison, the data were reclassified into 12 types of land use: oil palm, para rubber, paddy field, abandoned paddy field, orchard, other agriculture lands, wetlands and peatlands, mangrove, evergreen forest, water area, build-up area, and unused area. In addition, the area of net change due to DLUC and ILUC was calculated, and carbon stock changes were estimated from above- and below-ground biomass and soil organic carbon. The results show that the total oil palm plantation area has increased from 0.04% in 2000 to 6.84% in 2016, because of a Thai government policy promoting the use of biodiesel and increasing capacity of palm oil production in 2005. Paddy field, evergreen forest, wetlands, and peatlands were the main areas being replaced. The clearance of natural forest greatly increased in the period of 2000–2009. The ILUC indicates that the expansion of oil palm plantations invades other croplands (paddy field, para rubber, and orchard). The results demonstrate that the conversion of natural landscapes (evergreen forest, mangrove, wetlands, and peatlands) to oil palm plantations at Princess Sirindhorn Wildlife Sanctuary area had a negative effect, with carbon stock changes of 4 million Mg C during 2000–2016 (0.25 million Mg C/year). Given the significance of carbon stock changes arising from land-use changes, this research highlights the need for sustainable land-use management and long-term monitoring.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistryistry, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

Available evidences suggested that defective peritoneal dialysis products may predispose the patients to peritonitis. Thailand Clinical Practice Guideline for Peritoneal Dialysis 2017 recommends the patients to check peritoneal dialysis products themselves before use. In this report, we present our early experience from the Check List to Improve Patient Self-care and Product Defect Report in Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis study, a cluster randomized trial conducted in 22 peritoneal dialysis centers in Thailand. Patients from 11 randomly selected sites were asked to use the check list to report any product quality defects. The peritoneal dialysis product check list required patients to check the expiration date, glucose concentration, clarity, color, and integrity of bags of peritoneal dialysis fluid as well as the peritoneal dialysis connectors prior to each use. Among 338 patients who had received the check list from 5 centers, 28 returned the reports, detecting 8 defects out of 3960 products in total (0.2%). Although the obtained check list reports were not perfectly completed, they were comprehensible and provided important information on product defects which meant that the check list was simple enough for the patients and/or caregivers to follow. In conclusion, despite low response rate and incomplete report in this early phase analysis, the check list provides important information on product defects while an impact of these defects on peritoneal dialysis outcomes requires a further investigation.","mixing and separation, medical, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Medicine (miscellaneous), Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

Two simple methods with different gel coagulators, ethanol and sulfuric acid, were used for preparation of the aerogel. Conditions for the alkaline treatment of the raw material and the pre-freezing temperature in the lyophilization process were optimized. It was found that the water and oil sorption capacities of the aerogels were not significantly affected by alkaline treatment, while they could be adjusted by changing the pre-freezing temperature. Although the produced aerogels were initially amphiphilic, hydrophobic surfaces were obtained by vapor deposition of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and these materials possessed high sorption capacities, up to 32.24 cm3 g-1 (28.56 g g-1) for pump oil and 26.77 cm3 g-1 (39.59 g g-1) for chloroform. This was comparable to aerogels prepared from fresh cellulosic materials via the sol-gel method, as their sorption capacities varied in the range of 14-45 g g-1.","mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Materials Science","Forestry, Materials Science (all)"

Recent findings: Precision medicine is most applicable to the timing of RRT in critically ill patients. As recent randomized controlled trials have failed to provide consensus on when to initiate acute RRT, the decision to start acute RRT should be based on individual patient clinical characteristics (e.g. severity of the disease, evolution of clinical parameters) and logistic considerations (e.g. organizational issues, availability of machines and disposables). The delivery of a dynamic dialytic dose is another application of precision medicine, as patients may require different and varying dialysis doses depending on individual patient factors and clinical course. Although regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is recommended as first-line anticoagulation for continuous RRT, modifications to RCA protocols and consideration of other anticoagulants should be individualized to the patient's clinical condition. Finally, the evolution of RRT technology has improved precision in dialysis delivery through increased machine accuracy, connectivity to the electronic medical record and automated reduction of downtime. Summary: RRT has become a complex treatment for critically ill patients, which allows for the prescription to be precisely tailored to the different clinical requirements.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine
Combining biochar and zerovalent iron (BZVI) as a paddy field soil amendment for heavy cadmium (Cd) contamination decreases Cd but increases zinc and iron concentrations in rice grains: a field-scale evaluation,"Khum-in V., Suk-in J., In-ai P., Piaowan K., Phaimisap Y., Supanpaiboon W., Phenrat T.",2020-09-01,"Cd concentrations, Competitive sorption, Contaminated soils, Essential elements, Iron concentrations, Paddy field soils, Zero-valent iron, Zn accumulations, Biochar, Cadmium, Essential metals, Rice, Soil amendment, Zerovalent iron","Consuming rice grown in contaminated soil that has an elevated level of cadmium (Cd) is a health risk. This study revealed that using a combination of biochar and zerovalent iron (BZVI) reduces the concentration of Cd and enhances that of the essential elements zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) in rice. The Cd concentration in brown rice grain cultivated in an untreated paddy was 0.84 ± 0.20 mg kg−1, double the acceptable level (0.4 mg kg−1). Soil amendment with BZVI successfully decreased Cd in brown rice by 83 % compared to the untreated field presumably due to the Cd sorption on biochar (BC) and enhanced ZVI corrosion by-products while ZVI and BC alone achieved only 40 % and 74 % reduction, respectively. Moreover, while using ZVI or BC alone decreased Fe in rice grain by 8–14 %, BZVI enhanced the Fe concentrations in rice grain by 11 % because of Fe2+/Fe3+ release from BC-enhanced ZVI corrosion. Similarly, the presence of BC in BZVI enhanced Zn accumulation in rice grain by 8% due to competitive sorption of Cd2+ on BZVI, which may desorb Zn2+, promoting Zn translocation to rice. Using ZVI alone decreased Zn in rice by 19 %.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"
Chipping size reduction on ultra-thin wafers and narrow saw-streets for wafer sawing process,"Sanamthong W., Chutima P.",2020-01-01,"Narrow width, Product cost, Sawing process, Selling prices, Semiconductor products, Six sigma approaches, Size reductions, Wafer sawing, Narrow Saw-Streets, Six-Sigma approach, Ultra-Thin wafers, Wafer Sawing","Chipping is a big problem when it enters the guard ring or die active area, because the size of chipping is bigger than Defect-Free Zone (DFZ). Thus, the smaller of chipping size, the better the quality, but chipping free is the best [1]. At present, the selling price of semiconductor products (especially on the IC product) is not too expensive as before, while the size of the package is getting smaller and smaller with higher density. Many companies interested in ultra-thin wafers (i.e. very thin wafers having thicknesses less than 100µm [2]). And also interested in increasing die per wafer (DPW) to have a competitive product cost. This increases the difficulty in the wafer sawing process because increasing die per wafer causes a narrow width of the saw-street meaning that the size of DFZ will be very narrow [3]. For the factory in this case study, customers provide the new revision of ultra-thin wafers (50µm) with the width of saw-streets at 60µm. This is narrower than the width of the existing saw-streets (80µm), which means that the current condition of the sawing process might not be suitable for this narrow saw streets of ultra-thin wafers. As a result, the approach to remedy this situation is conducted under the Six Sigma approach.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

In this context, this work aims to propose an event detection system at the early stages of an event based on changes in the users’ behavior in an OSN. This system can detect an event of any subject, and thus, it can be used for different purposes. The proposed event detection system is composed of the following main modules: (1) determination of the user’s location, (2) message extraction from an OSN, (3) topic identification using natural language processing (NLP) based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN), (4) the user behavior change analyzer in the OSN, and (5) affective analysis for emotion identification based on a tree-convolutional neural network (tree-CNN). In the case of public health, the early event detection is very relevant for the population and the authorities in order to be able take corrective actions. Hence, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is used as a case study in this work. For performance validation, the modules related to the topic identification and affective analysis were compared with other similar solutions or implemented with other machine learning algorithms. In the performance assessment, the proposed event detection system achieved an accuracy higher than 0.90, while other similar methods reached accuracy values less than 0.74. Additionally, our proposed system was able to detect an event almost three days earlier than the other methods. Furthermore, the information provided by the system permits to understand the predominant characteristics of an event, such as keywords and emotion type of messages.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Materials and methods: First maxillary premolar tooth model was reconstructed from a patient’s CBCT images. The 2D serial sections were used to create the 3D model. This model was used for finite element analysis (FEA). Model validation was performed by comparing the ultimate compressive force (UF) obtained experimentally using a universal testing machine and from simulation. The simulations of three component-omitting models (silicone, cementum, and omitting both) were performed to analyze the maximum (max.) principal stress and stress distribution. Results: The simulation-based UF indicating tooth fracture was 637 N, while the average UF in the in vitro loading was 651 N. The discrepancy between the simulation-based UF and the experimental UF was 2.2%. From the simulation, the silicone-omitting models showed a significant change in max. principal stress, resulting in a UF error of 26%, whereas there was no notable change in the cementum-omitting model. Conclusion: This study, for the first time, developed a true scale multi-component 3D model from CBCT for predicting stress distribution in a human tooth. Clinical relevance: This study proposed a method to create 3D modeling from CBCT in a true scale and multi-component manner. The PDL-like component-omitting simulation led to a higher error value of UF, indicating the importance of multi-component tooth modeling in FEA.

Feline Morbillivirus Infection Associated With Tubulointerstitial Nephritis in Black Leopards (Panthera pardus),"Piewbang C., Chaiyasak S., Kongmakee P., Sanannu S., Khotapat P., Ratthanophart J., Banlunara W., Techangamsuwan S.",2020-11-01,"African Americans, Animals, Cat Diseases, Cats, Humans, Morbillivirus, Morbillivirus Infections, Nephritis, Interstitial, Panthera, Thailand, chronic kidney disease, Felidae, feline morbillivirus, leopard, Panthera pardus, Thailand, tubulointerstitial nephritis","Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is an emerging RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family that was recently discovered in domestic cats (Felis catus). To date, 2 genotypes (FeMV-1 and FeMV-2) have been detected in cats from various countries, and FeMV-1 is recognized as a pathogen associated with nephritis. However, information regarding the pathological roles and potential transmission to other felids is limited. In this article, we describe the identification of FeMV in 2 black leopards (Panthera pardus) in Thailand that showed severe azotemia and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Molecular analysis of the partial coding sequence of the L gene revealed that these leopard FeMV strains were genetically close to the FeMV-1 isolate from domestic Thai cats. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses using polyclonal IgG antibodies against the FeMV matrix (M) protein showed FeMV-M antigen in renal tubular epithelial cells. These analyses also showed infiltrating lymphocytes in the renal parenchymal lesions and in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells residing in the spleen, suggesting viral tropism and a possible pathological role. These findings are the first evidence that indicates that the black leopard could be a possible host for FeMV infection. As for other cats, the role of FeMV as a potential cause of renal disease remains to be established. The pathogenesis of FeMV infection in black leopards, or in other wild felids, through a viral transmission mechanism warrants further investigation.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)

The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs).

Polymer electrolyte membrane with magnetic nanoparticles containing benzimidazole terminals: An approach to induce proton transfer species on membrane surface,"Pokprasert A., Chirachanchai S.",2020-03-20,"Heterocycles, Magnetic field induction, Membrane surface, Polymer electrolyte membranes, Proton hopping, Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) membranes, Surface enrichment, Transfer efficiency, Heterocycle, Magnetic field induction, Magnetic nanoparticles, Polymer conductive fuel cell membrane, Polymer electrolyte membrane, Surface enrichment","Proton conductive species incorporated in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), in general, are randomly existed in the membrane, and this limits the proton transfer efficiency. The present work proposes an approach to align the proton conductive species on the PEM surface so that the first contact of proton species from anode effectively initiates proton transfer efficiently. By simply conjugating benzimidazole (Bz) with magnetic nanoparticles (MagNPs) followed by applying magnetic field, Bz can be induced and aligned on the surface of sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane and this results in 10% increment of the proton conductivity. The present work demonstrates a simple way to create a pathway on the membrane surface for proton hopping to improve the proton conductivity.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The as-deposited films were amorphous. Therefore, they were annealed at 1000 °C in ambient air. After annealing, the crystal structure, local structure, coatings morphology, and composition were investigated by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. The XRD results show the amorphous phase for as-deposited and the major phase of TiO2 with a few secondary phase. The Mg K-edge XANES spectra was examined in order to identify the local site of Mg in hydroxyapatite thin films, which is formed as MgO in as-deposited sample and as MgAl2O4 in annealed sample. The information on the locally determined structures were obtained and discussed.

To fill this gap, we undertook a systematic review of the available literature on the association between pesticide exposure and pulmonary function. Aims: To examine all available literature regarding the relationship between occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides and lung function. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases to 1 October 2017 without any date or language restrictions using a combination of MeSH terms and free text for 'pesticide exposure' and 'lung function'. We included studies that met the criteria of our research protocol registered in PROSPERO, and we assessed their quality using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Of 2356 articles retrieved, 56 articles were included in the systematic review and pooled in meta-analyses for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC), FVC and FEV1. There was tentative evidence that exposure to cholinesterase (ChE) inhibiting pesticides reduced FEV1/FVC and no evidence that paraquat exposure affected lung function in farmers. Conclusions: Respiratory surveillance should be enhanced in those exposed to ChE-inhibiting pesticides which reduced FEV1/FVC according to the meta-analysis. Our study is limited by heterogeneity between studies due to different types of exposure assessment to pesticides and potential confounders. Further studies with a more accurate exposure assessment are suggested.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Therefore, only little analytical information on objective and constraint functions is available. This paper presents an adaptive algorithm called the Surrogate-Based Constrained Global-Optimization (SCGO) method to solve black-box constrained simulation-based optimization problems involving computationally expensive objective function and inequality constraints. Firstly, Kriging surrogate is constructed over a new overall objective function (called loss function) to approximate the behavior of a true model. Then, an adaptive approach is provided to improve the optimal results sequentially while enforcing a feasible solution. The SCGO method is tested on several classical engineering design problems namely design of a tension/compression spring, design of a welded beam, design of a pressure vessel, and three-bar truss design. The results demonstrate that SCGO has advantages in solving the costly constrained problems and needs less costly function evaluations. Optimization results prove that the proposed algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Computer Science (all), Computational Mathematics"

The chemical structure, thermal transition temperature, phase separation morphology, mechanical properties, and adhesion properties were studied to elucidate the structure-properties relationship of PCD-TPUs as a function of hard segment content. The phase separation behavior was described as a shift of the glass transition temperature and the dimension size of the hard domain. It was found that the higher hard segment fraction led to a lower degree of phase separation as well as a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break. The hydrogen bonding characteristic of PCD-TPUs was investigated by FTIR. The presence of free hydrogen bonded PCD-TPUs benefits the higher peel strength since it promotes hydrogen bonding interaction with the substrate. The peel strength was obtained from PCD-TPUs/stainless steel joint. The adhesion properties of the adhesive system were strongly influenced by the soft segment. These results can establish the possibility of designing new formulations for hot melt adhesive.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

In 2018, an episode of severe mortality in juvenile barramundi was noted in a freshwater earth pond site. Fish presented with severe gill necrosis, as well as severe cutaneous hemorrhages, scale loss, and discoloration at the base of dorsal fin (saddleback lesions). Histopathology revealed extensive necrosis of skeletal muscle and gill filaments, as well as basophilic inclusion bodies and megalocytosis in muscle, gill, liver, and kidney. Scale drop disease virus (SDDV) infection was subsequently confirmed by virus-specific semi-nested PCR. Further, DNA sequences of the viral major capsid protein (MCP) and ATPase genes had a respective homology of 99.85 and 99.92% with sequences of SDDV infecting barramundi in saltwater culture. Gill necrosis and saddleback lesions are not typical lesions associated with scale drop syndrome. Their presence was explained by Flavobacterium columnare isolation from the gill, followed by positive F. columnare-specific PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SDDV-associated mortality in freshwater-farmed barramundi. Furthermore, this mortality presented as a concurrent infection with SDDV and F. columnare, with typical lesions of both infections.","diseases, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Aquatic Science"

Both software faults and user new requests are user feedbacks that can be normally obtained by interviewing, distributing questionnaires, or setting up JAD meeting. Nowadays, some user feedbacks are scattered online on App Store, Play Store, and social media and normal elicitation methods are not suitable for collecting online user feedbacks. Although some online user feedback elicitation methods are used to collect App Store's reviews and Play Store's reviews, these methods are not designed for eliciting user feedbacks from some social media. Social media contains both positive and negative user feedbacks which are important for software improvement. Positive user feedbacks are tentative new software requirements. Negative user feedbacks are suggestions for fixing existing features. Lacking adequate methods on how to elicit these requirements may eventually result to inefficient software evolution. This paper proposes an approach to extract requirements automatically from user feedbacks on social media and classify user feedbacks to requirements and non-requirements using Naïve Bayes's Machine Learning. The approach is evaluated with an example.

This article reviews the utilization of various reinforcement modifiers on the successive property enhancement of rubber composites containing different commonly used fillers like silica, nanoclay, carbon nanotube, natural fibers, and so on. The practical importance of reinforcement modifiers in rubber technology is systematically described in the light of filler dispersion, processing, and mechanical properties of filled rubber compounds. A special emphasis is given on the mechanism of interaction between reinforcement modifiers and filler surface in filled rubber composites. Filler dispersion in the rubber matrix is the key parameter that controls the ultimate performance and rubber–filler interaction of filled rubber system. The use of some fixed reinforcement modifiers is an innovative way not only to solve the dispersion problem of filler particles but also to increase the reinforcing ability of most of the fillers in filled rubber products. Thus, the concept of reinforcement modifiers has the potential to facilitate further development of filler reinforcement technology for rubber-based composite materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Although MT is beneficial for aquaculture, release of residual MT can cause adverse effects on wild organisms. The aims of this study were to identify MT-degrading bacteria and to characterize their degradation abilities under the conditions experienced in the environment. Nocardioides nitrophenolicus S303, Acinetobacter radioresistens B051, and Ochrobactrum haematophilum B052 were the most efficient MT-degrading bacterial strains, with the shortest degradation half-life of 10–70 h. The MT degradation by Acinetobacter and Ochrobactrum has not been reported before. After comparing their degradation rates and for reason of biosafety, N. nitrophenolicus S303 was selected for further study. Although this strain degraded MT and testosterones, it could not degrade estrogens (estrone, 17β-estradiol, nor 17α-ethinylestradiol). Glucose amendment did not affect the MT degradation rate. No metabolites with androgenic activity were observed after 264-h treatment with this strain under aerobic conditions. Methandrostenolone was found as the major intermediate during 39–90 h. This is the first report indicating the 1,2-dehydrogenase activity in steroid clevage in N. nitrophenolicus. Our study provides important information concerning the application of N. nitrophenolicus S303 to enhance MT degradation in the environment.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms in the environmentalronment; biodegradation of xenobiotics, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Pollution"

The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand (MoPH) has implemented a policy of recruiting students with a rural background to be dental students and return home after graduating. This study aims to examine the relationship between admission tracks during the academic years 2005-2011 on retaining dentists in Thai government service and identify the factors associated with retention and resignation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire from 287 dentists who graduated from Chulalongkorn University (CU) between 2010 and 2016. Follow-up data consisted of the admission track, number of years spent in Thai government service, and factors that influenced their decision to stay or resign from Thai government service. Chi-squared analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The overall retention rate in Thai government service was 58.2%. Dentists in the rural track had a significantly higher retention rate than the normal track (p = 0.023). Female dentists who were married and graduated less than 3 years had a significantly higher resignation rate than others (p < 0.05). The main reasons for retention were ""security in the profession,"" ""high chance to pursue specialty training in the future,"" and ""close proximity to hometown."" Dentists from the CU rural admission tracks chose ""close proximity to hometown"" as the top reason, while others selected ""security in the profession."" The main reasons influencing resignation were ""workplace far away from hometown"" and ""getting specialty training."" Conclusions: These results indicate that dentists in the rural track had a significantly higher retention rate than the normal track. The most important factor influencing both retention and resignation was workplace location, where being near to their hometown improved the retention rate of rural dentists. Therefore, the MoPH should increase student admission into the rural track to resolve the inequity in dentist distribution.","sociology, medical","Public Administration, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

However, the second dehydration shows two characteristics, and hence the deconvolution function is employed, which indicates two different water types in the crystal structure. Olivine-structured lithiophilite with nanosize is obtained from the thermal decomposition of the hureaulite precursor. The relationship between thermal and vibrational data is studied and the results are in agreement with each other. The factor-group analysis of hureaulite is also investigated by analyzing [PO3(HO)]2–, PO43−, and H2O. X-ray diffraction is applied for the sample structure determination.

Based on the ASAGAO combined map, which was created by combining ASAGAO and ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we find that 24 ZFOURGE sources have 1.2 mm counterparts with a signal-to-noise ratio >4.5 (1σ ≃ 30-70 μJy beam−1 at 1.2 mm). Their median redshift is estimated to be zmedian = 2.38 ± 0.14. They generally follow the tight relationship of the stellar mass versus star formation rate (i.e., the main sequence of star-forming galaxies). ALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources exhibit systematically larger infrared (IR) excess (IRX ≡ LIR/LUV) compared to ZFOURGE galaxies without ALMA detections even though they have similar redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates. This implies the consensus stellar-mass versus IRX relation, which is known to be tight among rest-frame-ultraviolet-selected galaxies, cannot fully predict the ALMA detectability of stellar-mass-selected galaxies. We find that ALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources are the main contributors to the cosmic IR star formation rate density at z = 2-3.","fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

Anatomical variations of the intranasal branching may result in long operative time and possible inadequate cauterization. A modification of ESPAL by cauterization at the sphenopalatine foramen (SPF), has been performed by our group. Our study assessed the clinical benefit of endoscopic sphenopalatine foramen cauterization (ESFC) and compared it to ESPAL. Method: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients who received ESFC for posterior epistaxis from 2016 to 2018 at a tertiary hospital were recruited. Middle meatal antrostomy was done. After ethmoidal crest was identified and nipped, pterygopalatine fossa was entered through the SPF. Sphenopalatine artery (SPA) and its branches within the SPF were cauterized without identification of any SPA distal branches in the nasal cavity. Patients receiving conventional ESPAL by the same surgeon were recruited and compared as control. Patients were followed-up for 3 months. Success rate, operative time, and complication were assessed. Results: Thirty-four patients were identified. Recurrent epistaxis was absent in 90.0% and 100% of patients receiving ESPAL (9/10 patients) and ESFC (24/24 patients) respectively, p = 0.294.

The Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-7 inhibits necroptosis and ameliorates acute kidney injury by targeting RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases,"Qin X., Hu L., Shi S.-N., Chen X., Zhuang C., Zhang W., Jitkaew S., Pang X., Yu J., Tan Y.-X., Wang H.-Y., Cai Z.",2020-07-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic, Cell Line, Tumor, Cells, Cultured, Cisplatin, Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl, HT29 Cells, Humans, Male, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Molecular Structure, Necroptosis, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Pyrimidinones, Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases, U937 Cells, Acute kidney injury, GNF-7, Necroptosis, RIPK1, RIPK3","Necroptosis is a form of programmed, caspase-independent cell death that is involved in various pathologic disorders such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute kidney injury and inflammatory bowel diseases. Identification of necroptosis inhibitors has great therapeutic potential for the treatment of necroptosis-associated diseases. In this study, we identified that the Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-7 was a potent inhibitor of necroptosis. GNF-7 inhibited necroptosis in both human and mouse cells, while not protecting cells from apoptosis. Drug affinity responsive target stability assay (DARTS) demonstrated that it binded with RIPK1 and RIPK3. GNF-7 inhibited RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activities and thus disrupted RIPK1-RIPK3 necrosome complex formation. In vivo, GNF-7 ameliorated both cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI. Orally administration of GNF-7 attenuated renal cell necrosis and reduced pro-inflammatory responses in mouse models of AKI. Taken together, our study shows that GNF-7 is a novel necroptosis inhibitor and has great potential for the treatment of acute renal inflammatory disorders by targeting both RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Pharmacology"

Historically, social psychologists, especially those adopting an evolutionary perspective, have devoted a great deal of research attention to sexual attraction and romantic-partner choice (mate seeking). Research on long-term familial bonds (mate retention and kin care) has been less thoroughly connected to relevant comparative and evolutionary work on other species, and in the case of kin care, these bonds have been less well researched. Examining varied sources of data from 27 societies around the world, we found that people generally view familial motives as primary in importance and mate-seeking motives as relatively low in importance. Compared with other groups, college students, single people, and men place relatively higher emphasis on mate seeking, but even those samples rated kin-care motives as more important. Furthermore, motives linked to long-term familial bonds are positively associated with psychological well-being, but mate-seeking motives are associated with anxiety and depression. We address theoretical and empirical reasons why there has been extensive research on mate seeking and why people prioritize goals related to long-term familial bonds over mating goals. Reallocating relatively greater research effort toward long-term familial relationships would likely yield many interesting new findings relevant to everyday people’s highest social priorities.",psychology,Psychology (all)

Herein, the anticancer activity of colicin N, bacteria-produced antibiotic peptide, was investigated in various human lung cancer cells. After 24 h of treatment, colicin N at 5–15 µM selectively caused cytotoxicity detected by MTT assay in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells with no noticeable cell death in human dermal papilla DPCs cells. Flow cytometry analysis of annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide indicated that colicin N primarily induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. The activation of extrinsic apoptosis evidenced with the reduction of c-FLIP and caspase-8, as well as the modulation of intrinsic apoptosis signaling proteins including Bax and Mcl-1 were observed via Western blot analysis in lung cancer cells cultured with colicin N (10–15 µM) for 12 h. Moreover, 5–15 µM of colicin N down-regulated the expression of activated Akt (p-Akt) and its upstream survival molecules, integrin β1 and αV in human lung cancer cells. Taken together, colicin N exhibits selective anticancer activity associated with suppression of integrin-modulated survival which potentiate the development of a novel therapy with high safety profile for treatment of human lung cancer.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Verification of attenuation models based on strong ground motion data in Northern Thailand,"Tanapalungkorn W., Mase L.Z., Latcharote P., Likitlersuang S.",2020-06-01,"Attenuation model, Northern Thailand, Peak ground acceleration, Spectral acceleration, Strong ground motion, Attenuation model, Northern Thailand, Peak ground acceleration, Spectral acceleration, Strong ground motion data","Within the last decade, the number of earthquake events in Northern Thailand has significantly increased. At least, two major earthquakes have occurred in this region: the 2011 Mw 6.8 Tarlay Earthquake and the 2014 Mw 6.3 Mae Lao Earthquake. The lack of understanding on appropriate attenuation models to represent a specific region becomes a major issue if strong ground motion data is not available. This paper aims to determine an appropriate attenuation model for Northern Thailand based on seven recorded earthquake events in the region. Nine attenuation models, including ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) from both NGA-West1 and NGA-West2 (Next Generation Attenuation Relationships for Western US), were employed to predict peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration (SA) during the selected earthquake events. Ground motion data during the events from twenty nearby seismic stations were collected for verifying the predictions from each attenuation model. Goodness of fit test and root mean square error (RMSE) were evaluated for each attenuation model prediction. The results show that the NGA-West2 are the most appropriate attenuation models to predict ground motion in Northern Thailand. As a consequence of verifying these attenuation models, it is hoped that further development of Thailand's seismic design standards for seismic hazard analysis of specific regions such as Northern Thailand can be based on more accurate, appropriately selected models.","engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science"

Data on clinical presentation, treatment and outcome are limited especially in older age groups. Methods: We identified 127 patients with PTCL and NKTCL, excluding cutaneous T/NK cell lymphoma, aged over 60 years old from Thailand nationwide multicenter registry. Results: Of 127 patients, median age of diagnosis was 67 years old. Patients aged older than 75 years old had similar characteristics to younger (60–74 years old) but higher comorbidity index. Seventy-nine patients (62.2%) received intensive/definite multi-agent chemotherapy, however, the proportion was significant lower in older patients (70.4% vs 34.5%, p <. 001). After a median follow up duration of 17.3 months, 2-year progression free survival and overall survival were 38.1% and 48.5%. Univariate and multivariable analysis demonstrated older age, poor performance status and absence of definite multi-agent chemotherapy were associated with inferior survival. Definite multi-agent lymphoma specific chemotherapy was an independent factor for overall survival after adjustment for age, comorbidity index, performance status and prognostic index for T cell lymphoma. Conclusion: Despite overall poor prognosis of PTCL and NKTCL in older adults, chemotherapy could result in objective response and long-term survival in selected patients of this vulnerable age group thus emphasizing the importance of comprehensive geriatric evaluation.",medical,"Oncology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

The result of this study helps fill the gap in literature about the factor affecting a house-hold’s decision to evacuate in response to the flood, as such a decision varies with the type of natural disas-ter. The result of the study confirms that more vul-nerable people are less likely to evacuate. However, they are more likely to evacuate, if at least one of their household members has reduced mobility. People in flood-prone areas exhibited moral hazards. Further-more, people with relatively secured employment sta-tuses are more likely to stay in the flood-prone area, to minimize their losses from the flood. If households with management-level employees received real-time and accurate updates about the flood, the decision to evacuate would be freely decided by such households, which can minimize their losses. Similarly, real-time and accurate data about potential damages and losses can reduce moral hazards. Thus, it is necessary for national and local governments to understand area-specific characteristics of people and linkages between societal vulnerability and economic resilience. The study’s implications highlight the importance of developing disaster management strategies in an integrated area-based approach.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

We included adult patients (age ≥18 years) with sensory exotropia who underwent unilateral lateral rectus recession with adjustable suture and medial rectus resection with at least 2-year follow-up. Preoperative and postoperative data was collected. Either Krimsky or alternate and prism cover testing was used to measure the angle of deviation depending on patients’ fixation ability. Glasses with full refractive correction were worn if they can provide better visual acuity. Exodeviation at near fixation was used in statistical analysis. A total of 38 patients (mean age at surgery 32 ± 13 years) were included. Median preoperative exotropia was 45 PD (IQR 40–55, range 25–70) and median initial postoperative deviation was esotropia 8 PD (IQR 0–11, range from exotropia 8 to esotropia 30). Mean follow-up time was 5 ± 2.5 years (range 2–10). Motor success, defined as a deviation within 10 PD of orthotropia, was found in 50% and 42% of patients at 2-year and last follow-up. Initial postoperative deviation and amount of lateral rectus recession were significantly associated with long-term outcome (p = .006 and 0.029). Patients with initial moderate and minimal overcorrection had higher success rates (67% and 62%) than patients with initial orthotropia or undercorrection (10%) (p = .002). Median overall rate of exotropic drift was 8 PD/year (IQR 6–13, range from esotropic drift 8 to exotropic drift 26). Time to failure in nonsuccess group was 24 months (IQR 21–24, range 2–24). In conclusion, unilateral recession and resection surgery with adjustable suture in adult sensory exotropia achieved 50% success at 2 years.

Lignocellulosic materials are biocompatible and possess tunable mechanical properties, and therefore promising for use in the field of 3D-printed biomaterials. This review aims to spotlight the recent progress on the application of different lignocellulosic materials (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) from various sources (wood, bacteria, and fungi) in different forms (including nanocrystals and nanofibers in 3D bioprinting). Their crystallinity, leading to water insolubility and the presence of suspended nanostructures, makes these polymers stand out among hydrogel-forming biomaterials. These unique structures give rise to favorable properties such as high ink viscosity and strength and toughness of the final hydrogel, even when used at low concentrations. In this review, the application of lignocellulosic polymers with other components in inks is reported for 3D bioprinting and identified supercritical CO2 as a potential sterilization method for 3D-printed cellulosic materials. This review also focuses on the areas of potential development by highlighting the opportunities and unmet challenges such as the need for standardization of the production, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of the cellulosic materials that underscore the direction of future research into the 3D biofabrication of cellulose-based biomaterials.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering, pharmacology","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Pharmaceutical Science"

However, the reaction needs hydrogen as a significant factor; therefore, most of the published articles reported the uses of external H2 that has flammability and high diffusivity. So, the in-situ generation and simultaneous consumption of H2 in the glycerol hydrogenolysis have been adopted in this study. The effects of zirconium and its location on glycerol hydrogenolysis for the production of 1,2-propanediol were investigated by using the Zr partially-substituted layered double oxide (Zr0.38Mg4.43AlO), and the 20% of co-fed ethanol was anticipated to provide in-situ H2 to supply 1,2-propanediol production. In comparison, a ZrO2-loaded MgAl-layered double oxide (ZrO2/Mg4.41AlO) was also tested in order to investigate the impact of Zr location on the catalyst. The results revealed that the higher ability in H2 formation of the ZrO2/Mg4.41AlO catalyst led to the higher 1,2-propanediol production, and the Zr0.38Mg4.43AlO catalyst provided a lower 1,2-propanediol selectivity because 1,2-propanediol was further converted to other products.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Our calculations show that a model 3 × 3 × 1 supercell structure of pseudobinary alloy Mo 1-x W x S 2 can be correctly performed for energy and electronic band structure calculations. DFT is combined with SQS and reveals that alteration of the W concentration supports the band edges and energy gap. The electronic structure of Mo 1-x W x S 2 clearly supports the results from the experimental observation as well as Monte Carlo simulation. Consequently, our model suggests that the generated alloy monolayer with small supercells via SQS can clearly explain the behaviour of this material, using a low computational time but achieving good agreement with the experiment.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys"

Catalytic activity of heterogeneous acid catalysts derived from corncob in the esterification of oleic acid with methanol,"Dechakhumwat S., Hongmanorom P., Thunyaratchatanon C., Smith S.M., Boonyuen S., Luengnaruemitchai A.",2020-04-01,"Acid catalyst, Carbon-based solid acid catalysts, Characterization techniques, Esterification of oleic acids, Esterification reactions, FAME, Heterogeneous acid catalysts, Ptoluenesulfonic acid, Carbon based acid catalyst, Esterification, FAME, Oleic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, Sulfonation","Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) pretreated corncob-derived residue was used as a starting material to prepare solid acid catalysts using different sulfonation chemicals (H2SO4, p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) and H2SO4/TsOH mixtures) for biodiesel production from the esterification of oleic acid with methanol. Effects of the different sulfonation agents on the properties of the derived carbon-based materials were investigated using various characterization techniques. Lignin residues were obtained after the H2SO4 pretreatment step, and high lignin-containing carbon-based catalysts of ca. 69% (w/w) lignin were derived after sulfonation with H2SO4. Employing TsOH or H2SO4/TsOH mixtures for sulfonation gave materials with a higher carbon/hydrogen (C/H) ratio, indicating a relatively effective carbonization compared to that with H2SO4 sulfonation. The catalytic activity of the sulfonated corncob in the esterification of oleic acid with methanol was influenced by the acid density, acid strength and porous structure of the sulfonated materials. High methyl oleate yields (>80% after 8 h at 60 °C) were achieved using the acid catalyst obtained from either H2SO4 or TsOH sulfonation, whereas those from H2SO4/TsOH sulfonation gave slightly lower yields. Thus, the use of the non-volatile TsOH solid as a ‘greener’ sulfonating agent for the production of carbon-based solid acid catalysts with a high catalytic activity in the esterification reaction is supported.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"
Online optimal stationary reference frame controller for inverter interfaced distributed generation in a microgrid system,"Jiang X.-Y., He C., Jermsittiparsert K.",2020-11-01,"Distributed generation units, Inverter interfaced distributed generations, MATLAB/Simulink environment, Micro grid, Non-linear controllers, Particle swarm optimization algorithm, Proportional resonant controllers, Stationary reference frames, Distributed generation, Fuzzy logic, Microgrid, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, Proportional-resonant controller","This paper presents a novel optimal real-time controller for inverter-based distributed generation units in an islanded microgrid. With respect to the fact that the microgrid has a completely nonlinear structure and its dynamics is constantly changing, the linear controllers with constant and inflexible coefficients cannot maintain proper response in a wide range of operation conditions. Hence, an optimal nonlinear controller that theirs coefficient are adjusted in a real-time manner based on fuzzy logic is presented. To improve the performance of the proposed real-time controller, its fuzzy system parameters are determined using an offline particle swarm optimization algorithm for various operation conditions. In the proposed real-time controller, proportional-resonant controllers are used due to their advantage in the stationary reference frame for controlling the voltage and current of distributed generation units in the microgrid. Capability and efficiency of the proposed real-time controller are evaluated in different operation scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results shows that changing the control coefficients online with respect to operation condition leads to achievement of an optimum answer for voltage during the occurrence of islanding condition and also in case of load variation in the islanded microgrid.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)
Validation of the HADS and PSS-10 and a cross-sectional study of psychological status in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis,"Wiriyakijja P., Porter S., Fedele S., Hodgson T., McMillan R., Shephard M., Ni Riordain R.",2020-03-01,"Adult, Anxiety, Cross-Sectional Studies, Depression, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychometrics, Reproducibility of Results, Stomatitis, Aphthous, Stress, Psychological, anxiety, depression, factor analysis, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, recurrent aphthous stomatitis","Objectives: To validate the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) for use in clinical studies of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) and to provide cross-sectional assessment of anxiety, depressive, and distress symptoms and perceived stress in patients with RAS. Methods: The validity and reliability of the HADS and PSS-10 were evaluated in 120 individuals with RAS through confirmatory factor analysis and calculation of Cronbach's alpha and omega coefficients. The prevalence of comorbid anxiety, depression, distress, and moderate-to-high perceived stress, and their association with demographics and clinical factors were assessed through cutoff scores of the HADS and PSS-10 and bivariate analyses, respectively. Results: A bi-factor model, with all items loading onto general factor with two group factors, provides the best fit to the HADS and PSS-10 data of this RAS cohort. While omega values suggested adequate reliability of total score of both scales, relatively low ranges of coefficient omega hierarchical limit utility of their subscale scores. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, distress, and moderate-to-high perceived stress was 42.5%, 18.33%, 28.33%, and 71.67%, respectively. Ethnicity, alcohol consumption, disease comorbidities, clinical type of RAS, ulcer size, pain, and RAS disease activity were found to be associated with negative psychological symptoms. Conclusion: The HADS and PSS-10 are valid and reliable as general scales of psychological distress and stress in patients with RAS. Significant mental burden among RAS patients makes the use of these validated instruments a sensible and prudent practice for psychological assessment of this patient group.","genergyal, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Cancer Research, Periodontics"

Besides the presence of TiO2 NPs, the influence of remaining chemicals such as ethanol and acid from the synthesis of the TiO2 colloids on the film formation was also investigated. The residual ethanol and acid were found to play a role in thin film formation and properties of the final membranes. The presence of TiO2 NPs, ethanol, and acid had a positive impact on membrane wettability, water flux, and salt rejection. Compared to the unmodified membrane, the TiO2-TFN membranes achieved a good separation performance with around 12% and 19% improvement in water permeability and NaCl rejection, respectively. In addition, the developed TFN membranes possessed an improved anti-fouling property with low flux decay and high flux recovery up to 94%. This simple one-pot synthesis procedure of TiO2 NPs combined with the in-situ integration during the interfacial polymerization showed great potential for economic scaling up in industrial production of high-performance TFN membranes.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

A 1D flexible framework MIL-53(Al), 3D rigid framework UiO-66(Zr) and 3D flexible framework MIL-88B(Fe) were applied as adsorbents. The breathing effect of MIL-53(Al) caused by its flexible structure can enhance intraparticle diffusion for all pharmaceuticals and perform a critical role in excellent adsorption performances. The 3D rigid BDC structure of UiO-66(Zr) caused a steric effect that reflected low or negligible adsorption. Unless concerning accessibility through the internal structure of the MOFs, the binding strengths calculated by the DFT study were in the following order: MIL-88B(Fe) > MIL-53(Al) > UiO-66(Zr). The Fe cluster in MIL-88B(Fe) seems to have the highest affinity for the carboxylic group of pharmaceuticals compared with Al and Zr; however, the lower porosity of MIL-88B(Fe) might limit the adsorption capacity. Moreover, in mixed solutions, the higher acidity of mefenamic acid can enhance competitive performance in interactions with the metal cation cluster of each MOF. Together with the breathing effect, H-bonding and π-π interaction were shown to be the alternative interactions of synergetic adsorption mechanisms.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphomas, most cases of DLBCL are designated as not otherwise specified (NOS). About 20% of cases, however, are designated as specific variants of DLBCL. These variants, 13 in total, are specified on the basis of distinctive morphological or immunophenotypic findings or distinctive biological or clinical issues associated with their diagnoses. In this review we discuss the following variants: T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma; ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma; plasmablastic lymphoma; intravascular large B-cell lymphoma; large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement; primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma; primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type; primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation; lymphomatoid granulomatosis; primary effusion lymphoma; and HHV8-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS. Two additional variants recognised in the WHO classification, EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer are discussed elsewhere in another review within this issue of Pathology. Although not recognised as a specific variant in the current WHO classification, primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma also has unique biological features and requires some modification of the standard treatment approach for patients with DLBCL. Therefore, we suggest that primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma also should be recognised as a specific variant of DLBCL in a future version of the WHO classification.",medical,Pathology and Forensic Medicine

Apart from the increase in age, neurodegenerative diseases are also partly affected by diet and lifestyle practices. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a slow onset neurodegenerative disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which affects the motor system. Although there is no prescribed treatment method to prevent and cure PD, clinical procedures help manage the disease symptoms. Green tea polyphenols are known for several health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activity. The current manuscript summarizes the possible mechanisms of neuroprotective potential of green tea with a special focus on PD. Studies have suggested that the consumption of green tea protects against free-radicals, inflammation, and neuro-damages. Several in vivo studies aid in understanding the overall mechanism of green tea. However, the same dose may not be sufficient in humans to elicit similar effects due to complex physiological, social, and cultural development. Future research focused on more clinical trials could identify an optimum dose that could impart maximum health benefits to impart neuroprotection in PD.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Prolonged exposure to glutamate will lead to oxidative damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress which could play a key detrimental role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanisms of C3G on the reduction of oxidative/ER stress-induced apoptosis by glutamate in HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Method: Cells were pre-treated with C3G in various concentrations, followed by glutamate. Cell viability and toxicity were examined using MTT and LDH assays. The apoptotic and necrotic cell death were carried out by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide co-staining assays. Generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells was measured by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA probe. Expression of antioxidant genes was evaluated by Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The possible signaling pathways and proteins involved were subsequently demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Result: The pretreatment of the HT22 cells with C3G protected cell death from oxidative toxicity induced by glutamate. We demonstrated that treatment cells with glutamate caused several radical forms of ROS formation, and they were abolished by specific ROS inhibitors. Interestingly, C3G directly scavenged radical activity and inhibited intracellular ROS generation in our cell-based system. In addition, C3G pretreatment suppressed the up-regulation of specific ER proteins namely calpain, caspase-12 and C/EBP homologous proteins (CHOP) induced by glutamate-mediated oxidative and ER stress signal by up-regulating the expressions of survival proteins, including extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, dramatically activated gene expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (i.e. superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), and phase II enzymes (glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)) was found in C3G-treated with cells. Conclusions: Our finding suggest that C3G could be a promising neuroprotectant via inhibition of glutamate-induced oxidative and ER stress signal and activation of ERK/Nrf2 antioxidant mechanism pathways.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

The aim of this work is to design low viscosity, cheap, biodegradable and hydrophobic LTTMs from natural resources. In this study, LTTMs based on DL-menthol as hydrogen bond accepter (HBA) with naturally occurring hydrogen bond donor (HBD), namely thymol, sesamol, and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid were synthesized and characterized. The formation of LTTMs was monitored by polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The functional group and purity of LTTMs were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), respectively. Density, viscosity and water content of LTTMs were determined to analyse its solvent characteristics. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was investigated to identify the thermal stability and working temperature range of LTTMs. The tuneability, the physicochemical properties of LTTMs at various temperature by changing the HBDs revealed that these LTTMs have the potential for a wide range of applications.

The distinctive feature of the proposed scheme is its effective computational ability in performing a series of successive elastic analyses by systematically adjusting elastic material properties of structures up to failure. The quadtree structural discretization within a polygon scaled boundary finite element platform enables model construction of sophisticated geometries at modest computing effort and thus the effective analysis of large-scale structures. The approach overcomes the challenges associated with stress singularity and locking phenomena under incompressibility conditions, even in the presence of high-order nonlinear yield loci. The robustness and accuracy of the proposed scheme are validated through a number of benchmarks and available practical engineering applications in 2D and 3D spaces. These illustrate the influences of some key algorithmic parameters, and the satisfaction of a lower-bound limit given by the present analysis method for a sufficiently fine discretization.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

The results indicate that LC-GFRPs are very beneficial to modify the ultimate load-carrying capacity and ductility of the confined concrete. In the end, the existing expressions, developed mainly for special purpose traditional FRPs to estimate the ultimate strength and strain of the confined concrete, were utilized to assess their application to the LC-GFRP confined concrete.

Due to the optical transparency of BNCP, a direct and rapid detection of methomyl on fruit peels using AgNP-BNCPs can be achieved, demonstrating a simple and effective ‘paste-and-read’ SERS approach. These results demonstrate potential of AgNP-BNCP composites for user-friendly in-situ SERS analysis.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
Ethylene Glycol/Ethanol Anolyte for High Capacity Alkaline Aluminum-Air Battery With Dual-Electrolyte Configuration,"Phusittananan T., Kao-Ian W., Nguyen M.T., Yonezawa T., Pornprasertsuk R., Mohamad A.A., Kheawhom S.",2020-07-31,"Anion exchange membrane, Discharge current density, Dual electrolyte systems, Electrochemical performance, High specific capacity, KOH in ethylene glycols, Polymer gel electrolytes, Specific discharge capacity, aluminum-air battery, corrosion, dual-electrolyte, ethanol, ethylene glycol, flow battery, specific capacity","Aluminum-air batteries (AABs), due to their low cost and high specific capacity, receive much attention nowadays. Nonetheless, a vital problem curbing wide application of AABs is corrosion of the aluminum (Al) anode, which is triggered by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, this work tackles the problem of anode corrosion in an alkaline Al-air flow battery (AAFB) by implementing a dual-electrolyte system. The battery configuration consists of an Al anode | anolyte | anion exchange membrane | catholyte | air cathode. The anolytes in this work are ethylene glycol/ethanol solutions (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30%) v/v containing 3 M potassium hydroxide (KOH). A polymer gel electrolyte (Carbopol® 940) is employed as the catholyte. The corrosion of an Al electrode in the anolytes is duly examined. It is significant that when the ratio of ethylene glycol exceeds 5% v/v, this negatively affects the dissolution process and suppresses Al corrosion. Furthermore, the battery using the anolyte with 5% v/v ethylene glycol, at a discharge current density of 5 mA/cm2, demonstrates peak power of 3.75 mW/cm2. The battery also exhibits the highest specific discharge capacity of 2,100 mAh/gAl (70% utilization of Al) at a discharge current density of 2.5 mA/cm2. In general, the dual-electrolyte system affirms its effectiveness in controlling anodic corrosion, quelling passivation of the Al surface in the alkaline AABs and boosting discharge capacity. KOH in ethylene glycol/ethanol solution is a promising anolyte being more environmentally friendly, less toxic and providing favorable electrochemical performance.","corrosion, energy, Economics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Economics and Econometrics"
Risk and profit-based bidding and offering strategies for pumped hydro storage in the energy market,"Tian M.-W., Yan S.-R., Tian X.-X., Nojavan S., Jermsittiparsert K.",2020-05-20,"Bidding and offering strategy, Downside risks, Installed capacity, Market participations, Risk averse, Risk neutrals, Uncertain parameters, Uncertainty parameters, Bidding and offering strategy, Downside risk constraints method, Pumped hydro storages, Risk-averse strategy, Risk-neutral strategy, Stochastic programming","Pumped hydro storages (PHS) are the most common storage in the power system, which covers 99% of the total installed capacity of energy storage facilities in the world. Therefore, optimal offering and bidding strategies of PHS are essential in the energy market. Besides, various uncertainties, especially market price uncertainty is more challenging for PHS operator due to the imposed risks. Therefore, in order to optimally market-participation of these storages, in this paper a novel risk management approach called downside risk constraints (DRC) is applied to get the optimal offering and bidding strategies of the PHS. The DRC method is used along with the stochastic programming to model the risk associated with uncertainty parameter, including electricity market price uncertainty. Hence, ten scenarios are produced using the normal distribution function to model the uncertain parameter. Illustrated examples are determined how to deal with imposed risk from uncertainty by managing financial profit. Finally, according to the obtained results, using the proposed downside risk constraints, PHS operators can experience zero-risk conditions by decreasing their profit by 33% while risk-in-profit is reduced by 100% in versus risk-neutral strategy.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The dependency of charge reduction on varied thickness was investigated. For the experiment, a rod-plane electrode arrangement was used to generate the positive corona discharge on the dielectric surface of PMMA. The measured surface potential was used to calculate the electric field by using the finite element method (FEM). The simulation model is axisymmetric having boundary conditions based on the measured potential. The surface charge density was then calculated from the normal electric field in the PMMA side and that in the air side. The comparison of estimated results and simulation results of surface charge density was made. The surface potential distribution was initially bell-shaped then decreased with time. The mechanism of electric conduction through the volume of insulation and charge neutralization by ambient gas ions influenced the surface potential decay. In the case of thicker PMMA, the reduction of surface potential distribution was fast in comparison with other cases. The estimated surface charge density was similar to the simulation results.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering","Computer Networks and Communications, Signal Processing, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Our previous study reported the inhibitory effect of Plumbagin (PLB) on human endocrine resistant breast cancer cell growth and cell invasion. Hypothesis/Purpose: Since PLB is a naphthoquinone compound, it can be reduced by the cytosolic NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme. NQO1 expression is upregulated in various types of aggressive cancer including breast cancer. This study investigated the impact of NQO1 on anti-cancer effects of PLB in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells. Study Design: This study was an in vitro study using ER-positive cell line (MCF7) and endocrine-resistant cell lines (MCF7/LCC2 and MCF7/LCC9 cells). Methods: The roles of NQO1 in anti-cancer activity of PLB were investigated by using NQO1 knockdown cells, NQO1 inhibitor and NQO1 overexpressed cells. To study the impact of NQO1 on the effects of PLB on cell viability, apoptosis, invasion and generation of ROS, the following assays were used: MTT assays, annexin V-PE/7-ADD staining flow cytometry, matrigel invasion assays and DCFHDA assays. To study the mechanism of how NQO1 mediated PLB effects in tamoxifen response and apoptosis, we assessed the levels of mRNA expression by using qRT-PCR. Results: 1. In this study, NQO1 was upregulated in endocrine-resistant cells. 2. PLB did not change the expression of NQO1 but it was able to increase NQO1 activity. 3. The inhibitory effects of PLB on cell proliferation, cell invasion and expression of tamoxifen resistant gene were attenuated in NQO1 knockdown cells or in the presence of NQO1 inhibitor. 4. The effects of PLB to induce apoptosis and generate ROS were also decreased when NQO1 activity was inhibited or when the NQO1 expression was reduced. 5. The anti-cancer effects of PLB increased when NQO1 was upregulated. Conclusion: The effects of PLB in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells is dependent on NQO1's activity.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

The release of chitinase can be used to monitor the egg-laying stage in C. elegans. The aim of this study was to develop a simple and cost-effective device to monitor the activity of chitinase in embryos of C. elegans. Colloid chitin azure (CCA), a substrate for chitinase, was preimmobilized on the detection area of paper, forming a purple region, to generate a CCA paper-based analytical device (CCA-PAD). The degradation of CCA by chitinase could be observed as the purple color became faint and the filter paper eventually became colorless. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed device quantified the chitinase enzyme in the range of 15.625-125 mU/mL within 48 h (R2 = 0.993). In this work, 10 young adult-staged wild-type C. elegans (Bristol N2) worms were analyzed on the CCA-PAD, which was supplemented with the laboratory food source E. coli OP50 on a gauze layer. The same strain treated with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine was used to prevent egg production in C. elegans. A significant difference in the color intensity was observed between these two groups at the end of the experiment (P = <0.001, independent t-test, n = 3). We successfully developed a simple and effective method for monitoring chitinase activity. The device may have potential applications in drug-screening studies as it efficiently distinguishes drugs that can impact egg laying.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, physics","Bioengineering, Instrumentation, Process Chemistry and Technology, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

Cellulose nanofiber/chitosan-graphene oxide was selected to modify the cotton thread surfaces for enhancing of enzymatic immobilization efficiency and sensor performance. The modified thread surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This sensing platform exhibits a linear range of 0.1–3 mM with a detection limit of 0.1 mM for glucose and a linear range of 30–180 mM with a detection limit of 30 mM for urea. Interestingly, this colorimetric sensor can determine the cut-off levels for both glucose (0.3 mM) and urea (65 mM) in human sweat, thus it can effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal people. Due to the thread flexibility nature, this sensor can be readily integrated with the clothes and accessories for real-time and continuous monitoring of diabetes and kidney failure from the wearer's sweat. This platform might open a new road for blood-free diagnosis in healthcare applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The Lewis acid transformation on the catalysts was investigated by in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed NH3 at 100 °C under atmospheric pressure for 130 min. According to the results of in situ DRIFTS, ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred over the WOx catalysts supported on all different supports. It is proposed that the partial reduction of WOx occurred under the hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The generated oxygen vacancies of the supported WOx catalysts were found to play an important role for activating the hydrogen spillover, leading to Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid. It was suggested that the selected support is the crucial factor for Lewis acid transformation performances. The results from our experiments showed that the weak interaction between WOx and support led to the easy reduction of W species, which promoted the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The large amount of oxygen vacancies leads to high Lewis acid transformation. Moreover, the influence of different supports was discussed and investigated by several analytical techniques such as H2-TPD, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, UV–vis, XRD, XPS, and TEM-EDS techniques.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

The film-like morphology of the retained austenite is reported to promote the wear resistance and is ensured by silicon and nickel. The effect of preheat temperature and dilution on the microstructure and resulting hardness can be concluded. Too high dilution, as a result of high current and travel speed, and the reheating during the welding of the second layer can result in martensite formation and too high hardness. Proper control of the dilution ensures satisfactorily hardness and avoids martensite formation.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Radiation, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

We assessed the impact of youth-friendly services (YFS) and a mobile phone application (app) on adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in YMSM and YTGW in Thailand. Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted in YMSM and YTGW aged 15 to 19 years. Participants were provided daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumerate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), condoms and randomized to receive either YFS or YFS plus a PrEP app (YFS + APP), whose features included self-assessment of HIV acquisition risk, point rewards and reminders for PrEP and clinic appointments. Clinic visits occurred at zero, one, three and six months and telephone contact at two, four and five months. HIV testing was performed at every clinic visit. PrEP adherence was evaluated with intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in dried blood spot (DBS) samples at months 3 and 6. The primary endpoint assessed was “PrEP adherence” defined as TFV-DP DBS concentrations ≥700 fmol/punch (equivalent to ≥4 doses of TDF/week). Results: Between March 2018 and June 2019, 489 adolescents were screened at three centres in Bangkok. Twenty-seven (6%) adolescents tested positive for HIV and 200 (41%) adolescents participated in the study. Of these, 147 were YMSM (74%) and 53 YTGW (26%). At baseline, median age was 18 years (IQR 17 to 19), 66% reported inconsistent condom use in the past month. Sexually transmitted infection prevalence was 23%. Retention at six months was 73%. In the YFS + APP arm, median app use duration was three months (IQR 1 to 5). PrEP adherence at month 3 was 51% in YFS and 54% in YFS + APP (p-value 0.64) and at month 6 was 44% in YFS and 49% in YFS + APP (p-value 0.54). No HIV seroconversions occurred during 75 person years of follow-up. Conclusions: Youth-friendly PrEP services enabled good adherence among half of adolescent PrEP users. However, the mobile phone application tested did not provide additional PrEP adherence benefit in this randomized trial.

Timely diagnosis and management of post-stroke depression facilitate motor recovery and improve independence. The original version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is recognized as a good screening tool for post-stroke depression. However, no validation studies have been undertaken for the use of the Thai PHQ-9 in screening for depression among Thai stroke patients. Methods: The objectives were to determine the criterion validity and reliability of the Thai PHQ-9 in screening for post-stroke depression by comparing its results with those of a psychiatric interview as the gold standard. First-ever stroke patients aged ≥45 years with a stroke duration 2 weeks-2 years were administered the Thai PHQ-9. The gold standard was a psychiatric interview leading to a DSM-5 diagnosis of depressive disorder and adjustment disorder with a depressed mood. The summed-scored-based diagnosis of depression with the PHQ-9 was obtained. Validity and reliability analyses, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, were performed. Results: In all, 115 stroke patients with a mean age of 64 years (SD: 10 years) were enrolled. The mean PHQ-9 score was 5.2 (SD: 4.8). Using the DSM-5 criteria, 11 patients (9.6%) were diagnosed with depressive disorder, 12 patients (10.5%) were diagnosed with adjustment disorder with a depressed mood. Both disorders were combined as a group of post-stroke depression. The Thai PHQ-9 had satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.78). The algorithm-based diagnosis of the Thai PHQ-9 had low sensitivity (0.52) but very high specificity (0.94) and positive likelihood ratio (9.6). Used as a summed-scored-based diagnosis, an optimal cut-off score of six revealed a sensitivity of 0.87, specificity of 0.75, positive predictive value of 0.46, negative predictive value of 0.95, and positive likelihood ratio of 3.5. The area under the curve was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78-0.96). Conclusions: The Thai PHQ-9 has acceptable psychometric properties for detecting a mixture of major depression and adjustment disorder in post-stroke patients, with a recommended cut-off score of ≥6 for a Thai population.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

Overall, aberrations in neurodevelopmental pathways have been more consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia compared to BD. Nevertheless, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that dysfunctional neurodevelopmental pathways may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of at least a subset of individuals with BD particularly those with an early age of illness onset and those exhibiting psychotic symptoms.

Unlike conventional ACEL displays where they have been rigidly used in flexible screens and advertising applications, here, the display is integrated with immunoassay and functioned as an optical transducer. Taking advantage of the reversed ACEL architecture, the display can be simply fabricated on an unconventional paper material without requiring the transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The sensing mechanism relies on the promoted electronic conduction from the immunocomplex formation between immobilized antibody, antigen, and nanoparticle labeled antibody. As a result, the electroluminescence could be triggered off instantaneously. To demonstrate the device effectiveness, C-reactive protein (CRP), a particular biomarker of an inflammatory process and cardiovascular disease, is chosen as a model analyte in this work. Additionally, the applicability of the proposed platform is proved efficacious in human serums, showing negligible interference from nontargeting proteins. The sensing display is also capable of performing multiple assays (up to 8) within a single device. This bio-optoelectronic device represents a straightforward yet highly sensitive approach. This ACEL transducer is believed to explore new possibilities for biosensing and exploit in point-of-care testing.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

AIM To characterize circulating BAFF receptor expression and B cell subpopulations in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. METHODS Peripheral blood samples collected from 41 patients with chronic HBV infection (25 patients without HCC and 16 patients with HCC) and 9 healthy controls were assessed for BAFF receptors [BAFF-R(B cell-activating factor receptor), transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, B-cell maturation antigen] and B cell subpopulations by multicolor flow cytometry.RESULTS The frequency of BAFF-R expressing B cells to total B cells was significantly lower in patients with HCC (3.39% ± 2.12%) compared with the non-HCC group (5.37% ± 1.90%) and healthy controls (6.23% ± 2.32%), whereas there was no difference in transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor and Bcell maturation antigen. The frequencies of CD27+IgD+ memory B cells, CD27+IgDclass-switched memory B cells and plasmablasts were significantly lower in the patients with HCC compared to patients without HCC (1.23 ± 1.17 vs 3.09 ± 1.55, P = 0.001, 0.60 ± 0.44 vs 1.69 ± 0.86, P < 0.0001 and 0.16 ± 0.12 vs 0.37 ± 0.30, P = 0.014, respectively). However, the ratio of naïve and transitional B cell did not differ significantly between the three groups. In addition, decreased BAFF-R expression on B cells was significantly correlated with large tumor size and advanced tumor stage. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrated BAFF-R expression was reduced in B cells that involved with the frequencies of B cells maturation in patients with HCC. The depletion of BAFF-R might play an important role in the development of HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection.",medical,Gastroenterology

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic destructive disorder of the joints manifested by the ongoing deterioration and loss of articular cartilage. The present study aimed to analyze circulating and synovial heat shock protein (Hsp70) values in knee osteoarthritis patients and healthy controls and to determine their relationship with the radiographic grading of the severity of knee OA. Design: Seventy-two subjects with knee OA and 30 control participants were recruited. Circulating and joint fluid Hsp70 values were quantified by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Circulating Hsp70 was markedly higher in knee OA patients compared with that of healthy volunteers (P = 0.01). Correspondingly, synovial fluid Hsp70 was 3-fold greater than paired circulating Hsp70 samples (P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that circulating and joint fluid Hsp70 values were significantly related with the radiographic severity of knee OA (r = 0.413, P < 0.001 and r = 0.658, P < 0.001, respectively). Subsequently, circulating Hsp70 value was directly associated with joint fluid Hsp70 value (r = 0.704, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Circulating and synovial Hsp70 levels were positively correlated with the radiographic severity of knee OA. Hsp70 could represent a potential biochemical marker for predicting the severity and may play a fundamental part in the pathogenic mechanism of knee OA.","medical, engineering, Health Professions","Immunology and Allergy, Biomedical Engineering, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation"
Improving the in vitro cell differentiation and in vivo osseointegration of titanium dental implant through oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation treatment,"Chen C.-S., Chang J.-H., Srimaneepong V., Wen J.-Y., Tung O.-H., Yang C.-H., Lin H.-C., Lee T.-H., Han Y., Huang H.-H.",2020-10-15,"Alkaline phosphatase activity, Bone cell differentiation, Bone-to-implant contact, Chemical compositions, Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, Oxygen plasma immersion, Titanium dental implants, Titanium dioxides (TiO2), Cell differentiation, Osseointegration, Oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation, Titanium dental implant, Titanium dioxide","Titanium (Ti) is widely used in dental implants; however, the bioinert surface has been shown to limit osseointegration, particularly in patients with poor bone quality. This study created a thin bioactive oxide film on Ti dental implants via oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation (OPIII) to improve bone cell differentiation and osseointegration. OPIII treatment was performed using low (1016 ions/cm2) and high (4 × 1017 ions/cm2) doses of oxygen ions. The Ti surfaces were characterized in terms of topography, wettability, chemical composition, and crystal structure. The differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on OPIII-treated Ti surfaces was evaluated in vitro in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (early stage marker) and von Kossa staining (late stage marker). The osseointegration of OPIII-treated screw-type Ti dental implants in the femur of rabbits was evaluated in vivo using scanning electron microscope/backscattered electron imaging and histological staining at 4 weeks after implantation. OPIII treatment could induce a Ti oxide film on Ti surface without altering the surface topography, roughness or wettability. Higher oxygen ions dose increased the thickness of the surface Ti oxide film as well as the proportion of rutile phase titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the Ti oxide film. The OPIII-treated Ti surfaces presented higher ALP expression level, stronger von Kossa staining signal, and higher bone-to-implant contact. Note that all of these effects were more pronounced on surfaces created using higher oxygen ions dose due to the higher proportion of rutile phase TiO2. Overall, our results indicate that OPIII treatment using higher oxygen ions dose can enhance the in vitro bone cell differentiation and in vivo osseointegration of Ti dental implants.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

To date, no publication has studied the various positions of the left hip in actual patients which might affect the retroperitoneal oblique corridor (ROC). The study aimed to find the relevancy of the left hip position and the size of ROC. Methods: We recruited 40 consecutive patients who needed diagnostic MRI from the out-patient clinic. MRI scan from L2 to L5 was performed in the supine, right lateral decubitus with hip flexion, and right lateral decubitus with hip in a neutral position. The retroperitoneal oblique corridor (ROC) was measured at the intervertebral disc level and compared. Results: ROC of the hip in neutral position was significantly larger than hip flexion in all levels (p < 0.05); there was no significant difference in the ROC among levels (p = 0.22). ROC seems to be largest at L2/3 followed by L3/4 and L4/5 respectively in all positions. Conclusions: The retroperitoneal oblique corridors of L2 to L5 were significantly increased when the hip is in the neutral position, while the psoas cross-sectional area and anterior thickness were minimized in this position. Surgeons might benefit from a neutral position of the left hip in the oblique lateral lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) procedure. In conclusion, the retroperitoneal oblique corridors of L2 to L5 were significantly increased when the hip is in the neutral position, while the psoas cross-sectional area and anterior thickness were minimized in this position.

Transplantation of microencapsulated human hepatocytes in alginate is an attractive option over whole liver replacement. The safety and efficacy of hepatocyte microbead transplantation have been shown in animal models. We report our experience of this therapy in children with ALF treated on a named-patient basis. Methods: Clinical grade human hepatocyte microbeads (HMBs) and empty microbeads were tested in immunocompetent healthy rats. Subsequently, 8 children with ALF, who were awaiting a suitable allograft for LT, received intraperitoneal transplantation of HMBs. We monitored complications of the procedure, assessing the host immune response and residual function of the retrieved HMBs, either after spontaneous native liver regeneration or at the time of LT. Results: Intraperitoneal transplantation of HMBs in healthy rats was safe and preserved synthetic and detoxification functions, without the need for immunosuppression. Subsequently, 8 children with ALF received HMBs (4 neonatal haemochromatosis, 2 viral infections and 2 children with unknown cause at time of infusion) at a median age of 14.5 days, range 1 day to 6 years. The procedure was well tolerated without complications. Of the 8 children, 4 avoided LT while 3 were successfully bridged to LT following the intervention. HMBs retrieved after infusions (at the time of LT) were structurally intact, free of host cell adherence and contained viable hepatocytes with preserved functions. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility and safety of an HMB infusion in children with ALF. Lay summary: Acute liver failure in children is a rare but devastating condition. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment, but it has several important limitations. Liver cell (hepatocyte) transplantation is an attractive option, as many patients only require short-term liver support while their own liver recovers. Human hepatocytes encapsulated in alginate beads can perform the functions of the liver while alginate coating protects the cells from immune attack. Herein, we demonstrated that transplantation of these beads was safe and feasible in children with acute liver failure.","genergyal, medical",Hepatology

Therefore, the library needs supporting information about usedness and demand of journals for efficient collection management. In this paper, citation network analysis is applied to analyze the articles published by university researchers and their references. The result is two overlapping lists of journals that are recommended for the library collection i.e. (a) journals that the university researchers have published in and (b) journals that the university researchers have cited. The importance of the journals is scored based on multiple centrality metrics. We used articles published by Chulalongkorn University (CU) researchers between 2016 and 2018 to analyze and compared the results with articles publishing in 2019 to validate the proposed method. The results show that top journals have not changed much over the years. The experimental results show that the ranked journal lists created from publication data of previous years closely matches the list produced from publication data in the subsequent year. The proposed model can help the university library to understand usedness and demand of journals and give suggestion of journals that should be included in the university library collection based on past publication data.

The results show that MS is characterized by lowered levels of zinc, adiponectin, TRAP, and SH groups and increased levels of AOPP. MS was best predicted by a combination of lowered levels of zinc, adiponectin, TRAP, and SH groups yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC/ROC) curve of 0.986 (±0.005). The combination of these four antioxidants with sTNFR2 showed an AUC/ROC of 0.997 and TRAP, adiponectin, and zinc are the most important biomarkers for MS diagnosis followed at a distance by sTNFR2. Support vector machine with tenfold validation performed on the four antioxidants showed a training accuracy of 92.9% and a validation accuracy of 90.6%. The results indicate that lowered levels of those four antioxidants are associated with MS and that these antioxidants are more important biomarkers of MS than TNF-α signaling and nitro-oxidative biomarkers. Adiponectin, TRAP, SH groups, zinc, and sTNFR2 play a role in the pathophysiology of MS, and a combination of these biomarkers is useful for predicting MS with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Specifically, prior to October 2006, affected patients had to pay the full cost of outpatient treatment and subsequently received reimbursement; thereafter, these payments can be sent directly to the providers, without patients having to pay anything upfront. By using nationally representative micro-data and a difference-in-difference methodology, we show that the direct disbursement policy leads to an increase in outpatient utilization among the sick. This non-price change has long-lasting impacts and particularly increases the health care utilization of sick individuals who are living in rural areas, are less educated and earn low incomes. These findings suggest that direct disbursement helps to increase liquidity constraint individuals’ health care utilization.

Methods: A pilot open-ended interview was conducted among 50 participants to estimate the mean and standard deviation of WTP prices for HIV and syphilis screening tests. A questionnaire was developed to obtain demographics, STI knowledge and screening history, as well as two contingent valuation methods (bidding and payment scale), using the mean WTP prices identified from the pilot study as a starting WTP with SD step-up/down. The survey of 200 randomly selected husbands of pregnant women was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from April to June 2018. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis. Results: During the study period, 597 pregnant women received their first ANC. Of 368 accompanying husbands, 200 were enrolled in the study. Their median age was 31 (IQR 27-36) years old and 67% had a first child. Eighty-eight percent of the participants were willing to test for the STIs. Based on the bidding method, WTP prices for HIV and syphilis screening tests were US$14.5 (IQR 12.4-14.5) and US$9.7 (IQR 10-12), respectively. The payment scale method suggested approximately three-quarters of the WTP prices from the bidding method. Conclusions: The husbands who accompanied their pregnant wives to the ANC clinic showed positive behaviors according to the propitious selection theory. They tend to cooperate well with STI testing and are willing to pay at least two times the price of the STI screening tests. The financial support to promote STI screenings should be reconsidered to cover other groups with higher sexual behavior risks and less WTP.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

These solutions commonly assume that soils are isotropic and elastic. Incorporation of anisotropy and the two-phased nature of soils (solid skeleton with pores filled with water) is important in the study of dynamic response of foundations. This paper presents the explicit analytical solutions for a transversely isotropic poroelastic soil half-space under a buried time-harmonic vertical load and a time-harmonic pore pressure discontinuity. These versatile fundamental solutions are derived by using Hankel integral transforms. They can be used to analyze a variety of dynamic problems in geomechanics. The fundamental solutions are then applied to solve the time-harmonic vertical vibration of a flexible circular foundation by using variational methods. Selected numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influence of soil anisotropy, poroelasticity, foundation flexibility, depth of embedment and frequency of excitation on the vertical dynamic response of foundation and the force transmitted to soil.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, computer science","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Computer Science Applications"

Subjects included eight patients (six females, aged 9-16 years) with hypothalamo-pituitary tumors who later developed obesity and eight controls with simple obesity matched for age, body mass index (BMI), gender and puberty. We assessed the metabolic syndrome features, fat mass, severity of hyperphagia using a standardized questionnaire, and measured glucose, insulin and GLP-1 levels during a standard 75 g OGTT. Age, gender distribution, pubertal status and BMI-Z scores were not significantly different. Subjects with HO had higher fasting triglycerides (TG) than controls (128 vs. 94 mg/dL; p=0.05). Four HO subjects and three controls met the criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Fasting and 120 min post-glucose load GLP-1 levels were significantly higher in HO patients than in controls (21.9 vs. 19.7 pg/mL; p=0.025, 22.1 vs. 17.7 pg/mL; p=0.012). Patients with HO had significantly higher hyperphagia scores than in simple obese controls (13 vs. 2.5; p=0.012). Patients with HO appear to have more metabolic complications and hyperphagia than controls with simple obesity. Impaired satiety may play an important role in HO. Fasting and glucose-induced serum GLP-1 concentrations seem to be altered in HO patients and could be a part of the pathogenesis of HO.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

The chemical structure and morphological properties of PBS/PBAT foam were examined via Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy techniques, respectively, whereas tensile and flexural properties were investigated using a universal testing machine. The results reveal that the incorporation of PBAT barely enhances the viscosity of the PBS/PBAT blend, producing only minor changes in the average cell size of PBS/PBAT foam. However, increasing the PBAT content contributes to a relatively significant improvement in the flexibility and toughness of PBS/PBAT foam, where a decrease in Young’s modulus and tensile strength of the PBS/PBAT foam is observed compared with those of the PBS foam. Similar behavior to the tensile results is noticed for the flexural properties of the neat and PBS/PBAT foams.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

The liquefied DME extraction was shown to be a rather fast process for the extraction of pigments from C. humicula at relatively high yields. The effects of the extraction solvent: sample ratio, time, and temperature in the liquefied DME extraction of C. humicola on the yields of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, chlorophyll-b, chlorophyll-a, as well as the total carotenoids and chlorophylls, were determined.

We hypothesized that infection of the ectoparasite Ich might enhance susceptibility of hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) to the facultative intracellular bacterium Fno. To prove the hypothesis, the experiment was designed as follows. Hybrid red tilapia naturally infected by Ich at 9 ± 6 theronts/fish gills and 4 ± 3 theronts/fish skin were distributed into 5 distinct groups exposed to different concentrations of Fno. In parallel, the same number of Ich-free tilapia were challenged to only Fno in the same manner. The results showed that cumulative mortality in the Fno single infection with 2.88 × 106 CFU mL−1 of water was 25 ± 7%, whereas 100% mortality was found in the coinfection treatment at dose of 1.93 × 105 CFU mL−1 of water. No mortality was observed in both control groups (Ich-infected and Ich-free fish). The coinfected fish revealed typical clinical signs and histopathological manifestations of francisellosis and ichthyophthiriasis. This study revealed synergistic effect of the Ich and Fno infection in hybrid red tilapia leading to the exacerbated mortality. Thus, farming management of fish to be free from the Ich ectoparasite might reduce risk of francisellosis and probably other bacterial diseases in farmed tilapia.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial diseases and parasites; diseases of aquatic organisms, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Infectious Diseases"

Effects of operating parameters on the FAME yield and the two-phase flow behavior were investigated. The reaction system was characterized by a high mass diffusion resistance at gas-liquid-solid interfaces due to the low solubility of methanol in triglycerides and the high viscosity of oil. Mixing palm oil with commercial grade methyl decanoate, a C10 methyl ester (C10 CME), at a 1:1 mass ratio during the start-up period promoted FAME production. The FAME yield was enhanced by increasing the operating temperature and the methanol flow rate, while operation at a high oil flow rate severely decreased the FAME yield. The concentration of C10 CME, which acted as an emulsifier, in the catalyst bed was crucial to maintain the FAME production stability.

However, stabilization of high conducting cubic phase is needed to maintain the ionic conductivity during prolonged operation. In this study, 1–2 mol% of Bi2O3 is added in the SCGZ to enhance the stability of the cubic phase. The phase characterization, sintering behavior, and electrochemical performance of the electrolyte-supported cells are studied. Bi2O3 is found to act as both phase stabilizer and sintering aid. Doping of Bi2O3 results in a partial decrease of unwanted rhombohedral phase (Sc2Zr7O17) which is a low conducting phase. Increasing Bi2O3 content also significantly increases electrolyte densification. The unwanted rhombohedral phase is found to form at high sintering temperature. Thus, the lowest sintering temperature which is able to provide sufficiently dense electrolyte is required. In the present work, adding 2 mol% of Bi2O3 in the SCGZ helps reduce sintering temperature to 1350 °C with sufficiently high relative density (>96.5%). The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is also improved with adding Bi2O3.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Although large amounts of clinical data are available, acquiring labeled image data is difficult, especially for bone scintigraphy (i.e., 2D bone imaging) images. Bone scintigraphy images are generally noisy, and ground-truth or gold standard information from surgical or pathological reports may not be available. We propose a novel neural network model that can segment abnormal hotspots and classify bone cancer metastases in the chest area in a semisupervised manner. Our proposed model, called MaligNet, is an instance segmentation model that incorporates ladder networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data. Unlike deep learning segmentation models that classify each instance independently, MaligNet utilizes global information via an additional connection from the core network. To evaluate the performance of our model, we created a dataset for bone lesion instance segmentation using labeled and unlabeled example data from 544 and 9,280 patients, respectively. Our proposed model achieved mean precision, mean sensitivity, and mean F1-score of 0.852, 0.856, and 0.848, respectively, and outperformed the baseline mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) by 3.92%. Further analysis showed that incorporating global information also helps the model classify specific instances that require information from other regions. On the metastasis classification task, our model achieves a sensitivity of 0.657 and a specificity of 0.857, demonstrating its great potential for automated diagnosis using bone scintigraphy in clinical practice.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In particular, among genes involved in daidzein and genistein biosynthesis, the isoflavone synthase and isoflavone reductase genes were significantly upregulated and the chalcone isomerase and 2,7,4′-trihydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase genes were significantly downregulated; moreover, these changes were associated with the accumulation of these two isoflavones in suspension cell cultures. Overall, the results obtained in this study both emphasize the utility of YE for enhancing the in vitro production of the two bioactive isoflavones examined for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical utilization and advance our understanding of their biosynthesis in response to YE elicitation.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Horticulture
Four novel mutations of FAM20A in amelogenesis imperfecta type IG and review of literature for its genotype and phenotype spectra,"Nitayavardhana I., Theerapanon T., Srichomthong C., Piwluang S., Wichadakul D., Porntaveetus T., Shotelersuk V.",2020-07-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Amelogenesis Imperfecta, Child, Comparative Genomic Hybridization, Dental Enamel Proteins, Exons, Female, Frameshift Mutation, Genotype, Heterozygote, Homozygote, Humans, Male, Mutation, Nephrocalcinosis, Pedigree, Phenotype, Sequence Deletion, Autosomal recessive, Biallelic, Enamel hypoplasia, Gingival fibromatosis, Nephrocalcinosis","Amelogenesis imperfecta type IG (AI1G) is caused by mutations in FAM20A. Genotypic and phenotypic features of AI1G are diverse and their full spectra remain to be characterized. The aim of this study was to identify and summarize variants in FAM20A in a broad population of patients with AI1G. We identified a Thai female (Pt-1) and a Saudi male (Pt-2) affected with AI1G. Both had hypoplastic enamel, gingival hyperplasia, and intrapulpal calcification. Pt-1 also had rapidly progressive embedding of unerupted teeth, early eruption of permanent teeth, and spontaneous dental infection. Uniquely, Pt-2 had all permanent teeth erupted which was uncommon in AI1G patients. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified that Pt-1 was heterozygous for FAM20A, c.758A > G (p.Tyr253Cys), inherited from her father. The mutation on maternal allele was not detected by WES. Pt-2 possessed compound heterozygous mutations, c.1248dupG (p.Phe417Valfs*7); c.1081C > T (p.Arg361Cys) in FAM20A. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), cDNA sequencing, and whole genome sequencing successfully identified 7531 bp deletion on Pt-1’s maternal allele. This was the largest FAM20A deletion ever found. A review of all 70 patients from 50 independent families with AI1G (including two families in this study) showed that the penetrance of hypoplastic enamel and gingival hyperplasia was complete. Unerupted permanent teeth were found in all 70 patients except Pt-2. Exons 1 and 11 were mutation-prone. Most mutations were frameshift. Certain variants showed founder effect. To conclude, this study reviews and expands phenotypic and genotypic spectra of AI1G. A large deletion missed by WES can be detected by WGS. Hypoplastic enamel, gingival hyperplasia, and unerupted permanent teeth prompt genetic testing of FAM20A. Screening of nephrocalcinosis, early removal of embedded teeth, and monitoring of dental infection are recommended.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics; gene mutations, biochemistryistry","Molecular Biology, Genetics"

The virus has currently evolved into three separated groups including US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA) groups. In Vietnam, PDCoV was first reported in 2015. Based on phylogenetic analyses of spike, membrane and nucleocapsid genes, it is suggested that Vietnam PDCoV is chimeric virus. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam and the full-length genomes of six PDCoV isolates identified in 2014–2016 were further characterized. The results demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was first detected as early as 2014. All six Vietnam PDCoV are in the SEA group and further divided into two separated subgroups including SEA-1 and SEA-2. Vietnam PDCoV in SEA-2 was closely related to Thai and Lao PDCoV. Recombination analysis demonstrated that three isolates in SEA-1 were a chimeric virus of which P12_14_VN_0814, the first Vietnam isolate, and US PDCoV isolates were major and minor parents, respectively. The recombination was further evaluated by phylogenetic construction based on 3 recombinant fragments. The first and third fragments, closely related to P12_14_VN_0814, were associated with ORF1a/1b and N genes, respectively. The second fragment, associated with S, E, and M genes, was closely related to US PDCoV isolates. High antigenic and hydrophobic variations were detected in S1 protein. Three-day-old pigs challenged with the chimeric virus displayed clinical diseases and villus atrophy. In conclusion, Vietnam PDCoV is genetically diverse influenced by an external introduction from neighbouring countries. The chimeric Vietnam PDCoV can induce a disease similar to Thai PDCoV.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

Methods and Results: TfAM was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using 2% (w/v) galactose inducer under GAL1 promoter. The enzyme was thermostable with high disproportionation and cyclization activities. The main large-ring cyclodextrin (CD) products were CD24–CD29, with CD26 as maximum at all incubation times. TfAM was used to modify cassava and pea starches, the amylose content decreased 18% and 30%, respectively, when 5% (w/v) starch was treated with 0·5 U TfAM g−1 starch. The increase in short branched chain (DP, degree of polymerization, 1–5) and the broader chain length distribution pattern which extended to the longer chain (DP40) after TfAM treatment were observed. The thermal property was changed, with an increase in retrogradation of starch as suggested by a lower enthalpy. Conclusions: TfAM was successfully expressed in S. cerevisiae and was used to make starches with new functionality. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first report on the expression of AM in the GRAS yeast and the production of a modified starch gel from pea starch to improve the versatility of starch for food use.","genergyal, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"
Designing a hierarchical nanosheet ZSM-35 zeolite to realize more efficient ethanol synthesis from dimethyl ether and syngas,"Feng X., Zhang P., Fang Y., Charusiri W., Yao J., Gao X., Wei Q., Reubroycharoen P., Vitidsant T., Yoneyama Y., Yang G., Tsubaki N.",2020-03-01,"Carbonylation reactions, Catalyst beds, Coprecipitation method, Direct hydrothermal synthesis, Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS), H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Morphology and composition, Syn-gas, DME, Dual-catalyst bed, Ethanol synthesis, Hierarchical nanosheet HZSM-35 zeolite, Syngas","In this work, a dual-catalyst bed reactor packed with the combination of hierarchical nanosheet HZSM-35 (Hi-NZ35) zeolite and CuZnAl catalyst was proposed to realize more efficient ethanol synthesis from dimethyl ether (DME) and syngas (CO+H2). The nanosheet ZSM-35 (NZ35) zeolite was prepared via a direct hydrothermal synthesis route and the CuZnAl catalyst was prepared by co-precipitation method. Moreover, a series of Hi-NZ35x zeolites were obtained from NZ35 zeolite by further treatment with varied NaOH aqueous solution using hydrothermal process (“x” means the NaOH solution concentration of 0.2-0.6 M). The catalysts properties, such as crystallinity, porosity, acidity, morphology and composition, were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that Hi-NZ350.4 zeolite was more effective to obtain hierarchical porosity with mesopore volume up to 0.131 cm3 g−1. For single DME carbonylation reaction, the NZ35 zeolite exhibited superior catalytic activity (32.2%) and stability compared with conventional ZSM-35 (CZ35) zeolite. Furthermore, improved catalytic activity (42.0%) was observed on Hi-NZ350.4 zeolite owing to its abundant mesoporous structure. This result revealed that the hierarchical porosity of zeolite could effectively promote the catalytic performance of zeolite for DME carbonylation reaction. For the ethanol synthesis using the optimized catalysts combination of Hi-NZ350.4 zeolite and CuZnAl catalyst, the DME conversion was about 47.2% with higher ethanol productivity of 840.2 mmol kg−1 h−1.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

The micro-structures of bundle-like ceria nanorods (NR) were produced by thermal treatment of the crystalline Ce(OH)CO3 precursor. The exposed crystal planes of (2 0 0) and (1 1 1), corresponding to the d-spacing of 0.27 and 0.31 nm, were confirmed by high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The fundamental characteristics of CeO2-0.135 led to the highest surface area, surface area normalized reducibility and oxidized gold species (Aun+/Au0) on the surface, relatively higher oxygen vacancies and a smaller average gold particle size (7.9 nm). The activity results show that the Au/CeO2-0.135 has the highest methanol conversion and H2 production rate for oxidative steam reforming of methanol (OSRM).

The current process had 152,871.16 DPPM (Defect Parts per Million). The main cause of this problem was the rough surface problem in the forming process. The five steps of the Six Sigma quality improvement approach were exercised in this research, i.e. define, measurement, analysis, improvement, and control phases, respectively. This research started by studying in details of the production process to find relevant factors that could cause a rough surface defect. The main factors were selected and analyzed by Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). After that, the settings of each factor were discovered by applying the Design of Experiment (DOE) approach. The results showed that the appropriate settings were the sieve size of pan mill setting to 18 Mesh and the size of sieve holes at pan mill setting to be uniformly distributed.

The separation process employs a simple microfluidic device that is composed of interdigitated electrodes and a microchannel. The discrete dielectrophoretic force is generated by adjusting the duty cycle of the applied voltage. The electrodes make a tilt angle with the microchannel to change the moving direction of the red blood cells. By adjusting the voltage magnitude and duty cycle, we investigate the deflection of red blood cells and the variation of cell velocity along electrode edge under positive dielectrophoresis. The experiments with polystyrene particles show that the enrichment of the particles is greater than 150 times. The maximum separation efficiency is 97% for particle-to-cell number ratio equal to 1:2000 in the sample having high cell concentration. Using the appropriate applied voltage magnitude and duty cycle, the discrete dielectrophoretic force can prevent the clogging of microchannel while successfully separating the particles from the cells with high enrichment and efficiency. The proposed principle can be readily applied to dielectrophoresis-based devices for biomedical sample preparation or diagnosis such as the separation of rare or infected cells from a blood sample.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, process equipment, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry"

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dental patients' reasons to visit the dentist fit the 4 OHRQoL dimensions. Methods: Dentists (N = 1580) from 32 countries participated in a web-based survey. For their patients with current oral health problems, dentists were asked whether these problems were related to teeth, mouth, and jaws' function, pain, appearance, or psychosocial impact or whether they do not fit the aforementioned 4 categories. Dentists were also asked about their patients who intended to prevent future oral health problems. For both patient groups, the proportions of oral health problems falling into the 4 OHRQoL dimensions were calculated. Results: For every 100 dental patients with current oral health problems, 96 had problems related to teeth, mouth, and jaws' function, pain, appearance, or psychosocial impact. For every 100 dental patients who wanted to prevent future oral health problems, 92 wanted to prevent problems related to these 4 OHRQoL dimensions. Both numbers increased to at least 98 of 100 patients when experts analyzed dentists' explanations of why some oral health problems would not fit the four dimension.

This paper presents two estimation formulations, one each for confirmatory and exploratory SEM, where a zero pattern of the estimated path matrix can explain a causality structure of the variables. The original nonlinear equality constraints of the model parameters were relaxed to an inequality, allowing the transformation of the original problem into a convex framework. A regularized estimation formulation was then proposed for exploratory SEM using an l1-type penalty of the path coefficient matrix. Under a condition on problem parameters, our optimal solution is low rank and provides a useful solution to the original problem. Proximal algorithms were applied to solve our convex programs in a large-scale setting. The performance of this approach was demonstrated in both simulated and real data sets, and in comparison with an existing method. When applied to two real applications (learning causality among climate variables and examining brain connectivity in autism patients using fMRI time series from ABIDE data set) the findings could explain known relationships among environmental variables and discern known and new brain connectivity differences, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Software, Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The N: or N+−H functionality of the pMPY-modified tip participates in hydrogen-bond interactions with a particular molecular orientation of each chiral isomer. The asymmetric arrangement of silver atoms at the apex of the tip induces an asymmetric electric field, which causes the tip to become a chiral center. Differences in the charge-transfer (CT) states of the metal-achiral probe system in conjunction with the asymmetric electric field produce different enhancements in the Raman signals of the two enantiomers.

Although the noble metals are good candidates for such a process, the cost and scarcity limit their uses. The non-noble metals on the other hand, with satisfactory activity and cost, are of interest except their stability against the coke formation, the main deactivation scheme during the dry reforming reaction. Therefore, the study of the enhanced stability found in the bi-metallic system of Ni catalysts via the introduction of Co was carried out in this work. The activity and coke resistance were studied on both mono and bi-metallic system of the Ni-based catalysts (10%wt) supported on γ-Al2O3-HY zeolite prepared via the sol-gel method. The activity testing was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a unity feed volume ratio under atmospheric pressure at 973 K, where the Ni–Co bi-metallic system exhibits higher activity than both mono-metallic of either pure Ni or Co due to a higher number of active sites confirmed by the CO chemisorption. On the stability testing, the high stability was found on the bi-metallic system as verified by the time-on-stream testing. In addition, the higher reduction temperature for the bi-metallic system via the analysis using H2-TPR also suggested stronger metal-support interaction which may decrease the bonding strength of the coke on the surface leading to lower deactivation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Necrosis of epithelial cells of the gastric glands and intestinal glands was also observed as early as 5 dpc. Intestinal samples showed reactive in situ hybridization signals as early as 1 dpc. No other lesions were observed in the brain or other organs. Histological changes were associated with viral dissemination and disease progression, as evidenced by increased TiLV detection in the intestine, gills, liver and spleen. Highest TiLV abundance was detected 7 dpc in gills, intestine, and liver showing an average of 6 LOG genome equivalent per ng of total RNA. Different transcript abundance was detected for the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β and interferon-induced myxovirus resistance protein gene in the mucosal sites (gills and intestine). Interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 transcript was more abundant in systemic organs (liver and spleen) while the expression in gills and intestine showed mixed expression at different time points. On the other hand, transforming growth factor β expression patterns differed amongst the tissues with a trend towards downregulation of the gene in liver and gills, and a trend towards upregulation in the spleen and intestine. Overall, these results demonstrate the intestinal routes as a main port of entry for TiLV, which subsequently spreads systematically throughout the fish body.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary virology; pathogenesis and effects on host response, environmental, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Immunology, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Fragmented QRS predicts reperfusion failure and in-hospital mortality in ST-Elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kewcharoen J., Trongtorsak A., Kittipibul V., Prasitlumkum N., Kanitsoraphan C., Putthapiban P., Mekraksakit P., Pattison R.J., Rattanawong P.",2020-07-03,"Electrocardiography, Hospital Mortality, Humans, Myocardial Reperfusion, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, Prognosis, Risk Assessment, ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Thrombolytic Therapy, Treatment Failure, Fragmented QRS, mortality, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, reperfusion failure, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy","Objective: Recent studies have shown that fragmented QRS (fQRS) is associated with unfavourable outcomes in STEMI patients. However, there is controversy amongst studies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of fQRS on reperfusion failure and in-hospital mortality among this population. Methods: We searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to October 2018. Included studies were published cohort studies of STEMI patients that underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) and thrombolysis. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects model. Results: Ten studies from January 2011 to October 2018 (2753 patients, 1075 patients with fQRS), were included. The fQRS was associated with higher risk of reperfusion failure in pPCI when defined by ST-segment resolution (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.27–7.46, p-value =.013) but not when defined by TIMI flow grade (pooled OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.83–2.54, p-value =.192). In thrombolysis, fQRS was associated with higher risk of reperfusion failure when defined by both ST-segment resolution (pooled OR = 4.35, 95% CI = 1.80–10.49, p-value =.001) and TIMI flow grade (OR = 3.70, 95% CI = 2.10–6.53, p-value <.001). The fQRS was also associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in both pPCI (pooled OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 1.60–12.16, p-value =.004) and thrombolysis (pooled OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.06–5.35, p-value =.036). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that fQRS in STEMI patients was associated with reperfusion failure as well as in-hospital mortality.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Electrochemical promotion of propane oxidation at Pt/BiCuVOx-YSZ thin-film cells: Economical use of YSZ,"Lelalertsupakul W., Assabumrungrat S., Bumroongsakulsawat P.",2020-10-01,"Catalyst-electrodes, Commercial applications, Conventional structures, Electrochemical modification, Electrochemical promotion, Electronic conductivity, Faradaic efficiencies, Precious metal catalysts, BiCuVOx, EPOC, NEMCA, Propane, Thin film, YSZ","Electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) or Non-faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA) is a phenomenon that may be exploited in catalytic converters to reduce the usage of precious metal catalysts. Nevertheless, the conventional structure of NEMCA cells employs a thick piece of relatively expensive solid electrolyte such as yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ). Minimising the amount of this costly material may bring EPOC closer to commercial application. NEMCA cells were fabricated with thin films of YSZ or BiCuVOx-YSZ as the electrolytes and sputtered Pt as the working catalyst electrodes. The catalytic activity for propane combustion was studied at 200, 300, 400, and 500°C for cells with YSZ, but only at 400°C for cells with BiCuVOx-YSZ. The effects of working electrode potentials and BiCuVOx contents were also studied. Most cells made with only YSZ could not function as electrochemical cells. Nevertheless, only one cell survived and exhibited NEMCA. On the other hand, all BiCuVOx-YSZ cells functioned properly. Electrophobic NEMCA behaviour was observed from both cell types. Addition of BiCuVOx improved sintering and resulted in films of higher conductivity. Nonetheless, diminished surface areas and suppressed faradaic efficiencies were observed. Undesirable electronic conductivity was also introduced by BiCuVOx and hence an optimum BiCuVOx content of 3.5wt % was observed to offer the highest rate enhancement ratio, ρ, and the highest faradaic efficiency, Λ, of 5.3 and 339, respectively, at 400°C.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Multiscale laboratory investigation of the mechanical and microstructural properties of dredged sediments stabilized with cement and fly ash,"Yoobanpot N., Jamsawang P., Poorahong H., Jongpradist P., Likitlersuang S.",2020-03-20,"Dredged sediments, Laboratory investigations, Micro-structural characteristics, Micro-structural properties, Resilient modulus, Seismic modulus, Splitting tensile strength, Unconfined compressive strength, Dredged sediment, Durability, Fly ash, Mechanical properties, Microstructure, Resilient modulus, Seismic modulus, Stabilization","The process of removing sediments from the bottom of dams generates large amounts of dredged sediments, which are considered waste. With stabilization, the dredged sediments can be reused as construction materials in civil engineering works. The aim of this paper is to present a multiscale laboratory investigation into the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of dredged sediments stabilized with Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) type I and fly ash (FA). The base sediment was high–plasticity silt. Mechanical tests were conducted to determine the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), splitting tensile strength (STS), wetting and drying (W–D) cycle number, free–free resonance (FFR) and resilient modulus (Mr). In addition to evaluating the mechanical properties, microstructural analyses were also conducted using X–ray diffraction XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand the behavior of the dredged sediments stabilized with OPC and FA. The overall test results indicated that OPC and FA were effective at stabilizing the dredged sediment. An FA content of 10% was the most effective at improving the mechanical properties of the stabilized samples. Six W–D cycles were sufficient, as the strength of the six W–D cycles was very low. The ratios of seismic compression (E0) and shear modulus (G0) to UCS were 24 and 9, respectively, whereas the ratio Mr to UCS was 148. The Poisson's ratio (ν) values were distributed in the range of 0.317 to 0.381. Microstructural analyses showed that the combination of OPC and 10% FA provided suitable proportions of silicon dioxide and calcium hydroxide, resulting in the creation of a large quantity of calcium silicate hydrate during the pozzolanic reactions.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of prolactin with clinical forms and accumulating disability over time in patients with MS. A longitudinal study was carried out with 101 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and 19 with progressive forms of MS (ProgMS). The disability over time, as well as prolactin and ferritin serum levels were evaluated at baseline (T0), 8-month follow-up (T8), and 16-month follow-up. The disability at T0, T8, and T16 was higher among patients with ProgMS than those with RRMS. Prolactin and ferritin levels did not differ over time between both groups. Initially, prolactin was associated with MS disability. After introducing age and sex, the effects of prolactin on disability were no longer significant. Prolactin was associated with age and sex, whereby age was positively associated with disability. In the same way, after introducing age and sex, the effects of diagnosis on prolactin levels, as well as the association between prolactin and ferritin, were no longer significant (P = 0.563 and P = 0.599, respectively). Moreover, 21.6% of the variance in the disability was predicted by age (P < 0.001), and sex (P = 0.049), while prolactin was not significant. In conclusion, the effects of prolactin on the disability and clinical forms of MS patients may be spurious results because those correlations reflect the positive associations of age with the disability and the negative association of age with prolactin.","biochemistryistry, neuroscience","Molecular Medicine, Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

Also, visual feedback during motor learning is important in facilitating efficient postural responses and balance skills. In this study, a custom-made visual feedback device was invented to provide the training modality and program based on single-leg standing combined with augmented visual feedback training. This study aimed to investigate the effects of visual feedback training using the custom-made visual feedback device on balance and functional lower-extremity strength in older adults. Methods: Thirty-four independent older adults were randomly allocated to a training group (TG) and a control group (CG). The participants in the TG received training with the custom-made visual feedback device. The training duration was three sessions per week, for four weeks. The participants in the CG continued their routine activities. Balance (static and dynamic balances, and balance confidence) and functional lower-extremity strength were assessed pre- and post-training. Results: Improvements in static balance (sway velocity and limit of balance during one-leg standing with eyes open) and dynamic balance (directional control of limits of stability in the backward direction) were found after training in the TG compared with the CG. No significant differences in balance confidence or functional lower-extremity strength were found between groups after training. Conclusion: In older adults, training with a custom-made visual feedback device could be used to improve both static and dynamic balances, but not balance confidence and functional lower-extremity strength.","Health Professions, medical","Complementary and Manual Therapy, Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

Following an early warning in 2017 that TiLV might be widespread, we executed a surveillance programme on tilapia grow-out farms and hatcheries from 10 districts of Bangladesh in 2017 and 2019. Among farms experiencing unusual mortality, eight out of 11 farms tested positive for TiLV in 2017, and two out of seven tested positive in 2019. Investigation of asymptomatic broodstock collected from 16 tilapia hatcheries revealed that six hatcheries tested positive for TiLV. Representative samples subjected to histopathology confirmed pathognomonic lesions of syncytial hepatitis. We recovered three complete genomes of TiLV from infected fish, one from 2017 and two from 2019. Phylogenetic analyses based on both the concatenated coding sequences of 10 segments and only segment 1 consistently revealed that Bangladeshi TiLV isolates formed a unique cluster within Thai clade, suggesting a close genetic relation. In summary, this study revealed the circulation of TiLV in 10 farms and six hatcheries located in eight districts of Bangladesh. We recommend continuing TiLV-targeted surveillance efforts to identify contaminated sources to minimize the countrywide spread and severity of TiLV infection.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial diseases and parasites; diseases of aquatic organisms, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

The responses of the beams, including the load-deflection relationship, crack patterns, modes of failure, and reinforcement strain, are discussed. In addition, the shear performances of different strengthening systems are analyzed by comparing the ETS cases with ordinary reinforcement techniques. The effects of different types of ETS strengthening are considered in the presence of varying numbers of steel stirrups. An investigation of the shear contribution of the strengthening bars is carried out to assess the applicability of existing models. An average strain equation for ETS-FRP bars is developed from original models. Comparisons of the results obtained from this paper with those reported in the literature demonstrate that the end anchored ETS strengthening system provides a significant improvement in the shear strengthening efficiency. Furthermore, the truss analogy combined with the developed average strain formulation is an effective method to predict the shear resisting force of anchored ETS-FRP bars in ETS-FRP strengthened beams.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Sulfonylureas (SU) and the combination of SU and metformin (SU+MET) were the most common monotherapy and combination therapies used in Thailand tertiary care hospitals. This study aimed to assess the glycaemic goal attainment rates, hypoglycaemic episodes, weight gain and treatment compliance among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET. Research design and methods A multicentre cross-sectional survey and retrospective review was conducted in five tertiary care hospitals, Thailand. Patients with T2DM aged ≥30 years were included consecutively during a 12-month period. Glycaemic control, experiences of hypoglycaemia, weight gain and compliance were evaluated. Glycaemic goal attainment was defined by HbA 1c level less than 7%. Results Out of the 659 patients (mean age (±SD)), 65.5 (10.0) years and median duration of T2DM (IQR), 10 (5-15) years), 313 (47.5%) achieved the glycaemic goal. HbA 1c levels in the patients with goal attainment was significantly lower compared with those without (6.3%±0.5% vs 8.1%±1.2%, p<0.001). Goal attainment was significantly lower among patients treated with SU+MET than those treated with SU alone (43.5% vs 63.0%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31, 0.66, p<0.001). A third of patients reported experiencing hypoglycaemia (30.7%) and weight gain (35.4%). Weight gain in the SU+MET group was lower than those receiving SU alone (33.1% vs 44.6%, p=0.015), but there was no difference in hypoglycaemic events. Major events in the previous 12 months were experienced by 68 patients, most commonly congestive heart failure and ischaemic heart disease. Approximately half of the patients (52.2%) reported not always taking their medication as prescribed. Conclusions Among patients with T2DM receiving SU or SU+MET, only about half of the patients achieved glycaemic goal and compliance with the treatment.

The expression levels of all transcripts except LvAlf were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in tolerant shrimp (Lv-AT; N = 30) that survived up to 72 h post treatment (hpt) than in susceptible shrimp (Lv-AS24 and Lv-AS72; N = 45 and 15), that died within 24 h or between 24 and 72 hpt, respectively. Subsequently, effects of non-lethal concentrations of ammonia-N (control, 10 and 20 mg/l) on the expression of LvHc in juvenile shrimp were examined. Compared to the control, expression levels of LvHc transcripts in hemocytes and the hepatopancreas of tested shrimp changed after exposure to ammonia-N. One SNP (C > T545) was found in the LvHc322 gene segment. Real-time PCR amplification of specific alleles (real-time PASA) was developed for detection of C > T545 genotypes. Juveniles in the lethal exposure test that carried a C/T545 genotype showed a greater average body weight and total length (8.46 ± 0.36 g and 10.05 ± 0.16 cm) than those with a C/C545 genotype (7.48 ± 0.31 g and 9.60 ± 0.13 cm) (P < 0.05). Similar results were found in the second generation (G2) of a growth-improved stock (3 and 4 families of BIOTEC-G2-L1 and BIOTEC-G2-L2) and in commercially farmed shrimp (2 groups).

It is also becoming apparent that glia cells are in reciprocal communication with neurons, orchestrate various neuromodulatory, homeostatic, metabolic, and immune mechanisms, and have a crucial role in neuroinflammatory mechanisms in MDD. Those cells mediate the central nervous system (CNS) response to systemic inflammation and psychological stress, but at the same time, they may be an origin of the inflammatory response in the CNS. The sources of activation of the inflammatory response in MDD are immense; however, in recent years, it is becoming increasingly evident that the gastrointestinal tract with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and increased intestinal permeability to bacterial LPS and food-derived antigens contribute to activation of low-grade inflammatory response with subsequent psychiatric manifestations. Furthermore, an excessive permeability to gut-derived antigenic material may lead to subsequent autoimmunities which are also known to be comorbid with MDD. In this review, we discuss fascinating interactions between the gastrointestinal tract, increased intestinal permeability, intestinal microbiota, and glia-neuron cross talk, and their roles in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory hypothesis of MDD. To emphasize those crucial intercommunications for the brain functions, we propose the term of microbiota-gut-immune-glia (MGIG) axis.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Reuse of Immobilized Weissella cibaria PN3 for Long-Term Production of Both Extracellular and Cell-Bound Glycolipid Biosurfactants,"Subsanguan T., Khondee N., Nawavimarn P., Rongsayamanont W., Chen C.-Y., Luepromchai E.",2020-07-03,"Anti-microbial activity, Biosurfactant production, Emulsifying activity, Glycolipid biosurfactants, Lactic acid bacteria, Long term production, Oil-displacement efficiency, Synergistic effect, biosurfactant characterization, biosurfactant production, glycolipids, immobilization, lactic acid bacteria","Lactic acid bacteria (LABs) are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and therefore, LAB biosurfactants are beneficial with negligible negative impacts. This study aims to maintain the biosurfactant producing activity of an LAB strain, Weissella cibaria PN3, by immobilizing the bacterial cells on a commercial porous carrier. For biosurfactant production, 2% soybean oil was used as the carbon source. After 72 h, immobilized cells were reused by replacing production medium. The extracellular and cell-bound biosurfactants were extracted from the resulting cell-free broth and cell pellets, respectively. SEM images of used immobilizing carriers showed increased surface roughness and clogged pores over time. Thus, the immobilizing carriers were washed in PBS buffer (pH 8.0) before reuse. To maintain biosurfactant production activity, immobilized cells were reactivated every three production cycles by incubating the washed immobilizing carriers in LB medium for 48 h. The maximum yields of purified extracellular (1.46 g/L) and cell-bound biosurfactants (1.99 g/L) were achieved in the 4th production cycle. The repeated biosurfactant production of nine cycles were completed within 1 month, while only 2 g of immobilized cells/L were applied. The extracellular and cell-bound biosurfactants had comparable surface tensions (31 – 33 mN/m); however, their CMC values were different (1.6 and 3.2 g/L, respectively). Both biosurfactants had moderate oil displacement efficiency with crude oil samples but formed emulsions well with gasoline, diesel, and lavender, lemongrass and coconut oils. The results suggested that the biosurfactants were relatively hydrophilic. In addition, the mixing of both biosurfactants showed a synergistic effect, as seen from the increased emulsifying activity with palm, soybean and crude oils. The biosurfactants at 10 – 16 mg/mL showed antimicrobial activity toward some bacteria and yeast but not filamentous fungi. The molecular structures of these biosurfactants were characterized by FTIR as different glycolipid congeners. The biosurfactant production process by immobilized Weissella cibaria PN3 cells was relatively cheap given that two types of biosurfactants were simultaneously produced and no new inoculum was required. The acquired glycolipid biosurfactants have high potential to be used separately or as mixed biosurfactants in various products, such as cleaning agents, food-grade emulsifiers and cosmetic products.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

Utilization of waste FA as a starting material for the synthesis of zeolite catalysts is a promising solution to reuse this waste. Meanwhile, de-oiled Millettia (Pongamia) pinnata seed waste (PPW) is produced in large amounts from the bio-oil extraction process. This waste is of no value due to its toxicity. However, it was previously shown that the fast pyrolysis of PPW to produce biofuels resulted in oleic acid and other oxygenated (O)-compounds as the main composition (67.2%) with smaller levels of hydrocarbons (HCs). In this work, the catalytic upgrading fast pyrolysis of PPW over the FA-derived ZSM-5 (FA-ZSM-5) and zeolite X (FA-X) catalysts to enhance the formation of HCs was performed using a pyrolyzer interfaced with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), using various biomass to catalyst (B:C) weight ratios (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10). The FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X were derived from FA by alkali hydrothermal and alkali fusion methods, respectively. The result demonstrated that the pyrolysis vapors of PPW had a high content of undesirable components, such as carboxylic acids, oleic acid and other O-compounds (67.2%), whereas the aliphatic and aromatic HC contents were markedly lower. The presence of the synthesized FA-ZSM-5 or FA-X catalysts resulted in a major improvement in the pyrolysis vapor quality. Selectivity on total HCs (aliphatic and aromatic) was significantly increased with greater catalyst contents for both FA-ZSM-5 (90.6%) and FA-X (84.9%). FA-ZSM-5 exhibited a high selectivity for aromatic HCs (82.6%) while zeolite-X showed a higher selectivity towards aliphatic HCs (71.0%). The level of O-compounds was substantially decreased to 1.12% and 21.9% with FA-ZSM-5 at a B:C ratio of 1:10 and FA-X at a B:C ratio of 1:5, respectively. In addition, FA-ZSM-5 and FA-X reduced the content of nitrogenated-compounds from 24.8% (no catalyst) to 8.3% and 0.0%, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that FA-ZSM-5 had a higher HC selectivity and was more effective in promoting deoxygenation reactions, whereas FA-X significantly enhanced the denitrogenation reaction.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"
Immune response to fungi in diabetic patients with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis,"Nyunt T.P.K., Mullol J., Snidvongs K.",2020-01-01,"Animals, Diabetes Complications, Disease Susceptibility, Endoscopy, Fungi, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Humans, Immunity, Immunocompromised Host, Leukocytes, Neutrophils, Rhinitis, Sinusitis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Diabetes mellitus, Fungi, Immune response, Neutrophils, Rhinosinusitis","This article aims to review the literature regarding the immune response to fungi in diabetic patients with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Systematic searches of Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were performed to include articles from 1988 to 2019 which assessed ‘immune response to fungi in normal host’, ‘immune deficiency in diabetes mellitus’, or ‘immune response to fungi in diabetic patients’. Fungal cell wall activated pattern recognition re-ceptors, resulting in recruitment of innate immune cells and an adaptive immune response. In diabetes mellitus, the expression of class I major histocompatibility complex was reduced. A hyperglycemic state decreased vascular dilation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. The structure of complement was altered with consequent inhi-bition of complement fixation to bacteria. The balance between complement activation and restriction was broken. Hyperglycemia activated protein kinase C which inhibited neutrophil migration, decreased production of polymor-phonuclear cells, decreased chemotaxis and decreased phagocytic activity. Germination and filamentous growth of the fungus within a diabetic host caused angioinvasion, vascular thrombosis and necrosis. Patients with diabetic ketoaci-dosis had elevated levels of serum iron which regulated endothelial cell damage. Iron and the overexpression of glu-cose-induced glucose-regulated protein 78 enhanced the susceptibility of endothelial cells to fungi and induced fungal invasion. In summary, associations among the immunopathology of diabetes, the pathophysiology of fungal infec-tions, and the therapeutic outcomes must be considered in clinical practice. In diabetic patients, both the humoral and cellular immune responses of innate and adaptive immune systems were defective. Treatments should aim for the immune function restoration.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Objective: To identify differences in PID patient care resource and training needs across Asia Pacific and propose a corresponding action plan. Methods: The Human Development Index (HDI) indicates the degree of socio-economic development in each country/region. Information related to investigations and learning issues were extracted from the abstracts and personal statements from all Schools and mapped onto resource and training needs. Correlations between HDI and country/region-specific parameters were tested by two-tailed Pearson correlation. Results: A total of 427 abstracts were received in nine Schools between 2015 and 2020, predominantly on immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity. Genetic confirmation was described in 61.8% of abstracts, and its absence negatively correlated with HDI (r = −0.696, p = 0.004). Essential immunologic and genetic tests were not available in 25.4 and 29.5% of abstracts, respectively, and their absence negatively correlated with HDI (r = −0.788, p < 0.001; r = −0.739, p = 0.002). HDI positively correlated with average testing level (r = 0.742, p = 0.002). Cases from medium-HDI countries/regions focused on learning how to investigate a patient for PIDs in cases of severe or atypical infections, whereas those from very-high-HDI countries/regions, from which most faculty members originated, listed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy, newborn screening, and research as learning issues more frequently. Conclusion: There are unique HDI-related PID resource and training needs in each country/region. APSID proposes HDI group-specific strategies to improve PID care and education in her member countries/regions. Further quantitative analysis of needs in PID care in Asia Pacific is needed for lobbying governments to increase their support for PID care and research.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Main methods: We screened and compared the gene expression profiles obtained by RNA sequencing, of CCA cells cultured in high and normal glucose. Results from the transcriptomic analysis were confirmed in additional cell lines using in vitro migration-invasion assay, Western blotting and immunocytofluorescence. Key findings: Data indicated that high glucose increased the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an upstream regulator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, through the nuclear localization of NF-κB. High glucose-induced NF-κB increased the migration and invasion of CCA cells and the expression of downstream NF-κB targeted genes associated with aggressiveness, including interleukin-6, a potent triggering signal of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Such effects were reversed by inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation which additionally reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705. Significance: These results indicate that NF-κB is activated by high glucose and they suggest that NF-κB interaction with STAT3 enhances CCA aggressiveness. Therefore, targeting multiple pathways such as STAT3 and NF-κB might improve CCA treatment outcome especially in condition such as hyperglycemia.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

However, data on the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway in EBV-associated extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) and its clinical implication are limited. Herein, we characterized PD-1/PD-L expression and its prognosis relevance in 49 ENKTL patients in Thailand. PD-L1 was expressed frequently on both lymphoma cells (61.2%) and stroma (77.5%), whereas PD-L2 expression was more common on lymphoma (63.2%) than stromal cells. PD-1 was positive in 20.5% of stroma, but undetectable on lymphoma cells. There was no association between baseline clinical characteristics and the expression PD-1/PD-Ls. The survival of patients with PD-Ls on tumor cells was poor. For PD-L1-positive versus negative cases, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) was 42.2 versus 71.8% (p = 0.03) and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 45.4 versus 78.9% (p = 0.02), respectively. Comparing between patients with PD-L2-positive and PD-L2-negative lymphoma, the 2-year EFS was 37.1 versus 82.4% (p = 0.02) and 2-year OS was 45.2 versus 82.4% (p = 0.03), respectively. Neither PD-1 nor PD-Ls expression in the stroma predicted outcomes. In conclusion, PD-Ls were frequently expressed on ENKTL cells and associated with inferior outcomes. Therefore, PD-Ls are potential prognostic biomarkers and the roles of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in ENKTL deserve further investigation.",medical,Hematology

Among the fundamental knowledge that is required for conservation breeding, a solid understanding of reproductive biology is critical for improving natural breeding and enhance genetic diversity. Additionally, it offers the opportunity to develop assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) in threatened and endangered species. Conservation breeding and reproductive biotechnologies of wild felids have advanced in the past decade. It has been clearly shown that female felids have species and individual patterns of reproductive cycles and respond differently to exogenous hormones. In males, several species still have poor semen quality often due to the loss of genetic diversity in small populations. To overcome the challenges of natural breeding (incompatibility between individuals or suboptimal environment) and mitigate inbreeding, artificial insemination, embryo production and embryo transfer have been further developed in 24 wild cat species. Major factors limiting ART success are inconsistent responses to ovarian stimulation, variable quality of gametes and embryos, and preparation of recipient females. Additional approaches including stem cell technologies have been explored for future medical applications. However, there still is a critical need for better knowledge of feline reproductive biology and improvement of ARTs efficiency to increase the genetic diversity and create sustainable populations of wild felids.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

The increase of emerging resources, as well as multi-carrier consumers in energy systems, lead to the integration of multi-carrier energy systems. The energy hub (EH) is one of the central infrastructures which smooths the combination and interdependency of various energy carriers to increase the efficiency and reliability. A novel technology, such as power-to-gas (P2G) storage, is a great option for achieving a renewable resources-based integrated energy system with high efficiency. The P2G storage is regarded as a viable energy storage approach to cover ever-increasing renewable energy resources variability in power system operations. The contribution of this paper is to present an optimal stochastic scheduling problem of EH integrated with P2G storage, combined heat and power (CHP) unit, wind power, boiler, electrical storage, and thermal storage to meet electrical, heat, and gas demands considering demand response program (DRP). The load shifting based DRP is applied on the electrical loads to reduce the operation cost of the EH. Also, the P2G storage system is used as a new resource that makes a connection between electrical and natural gas networks by converting the power to hydrogen and after that to natural gas through two processes including electrolysis and mechanization, respectively. A scenario-based stochastic approach is applied to handle the uncertainties related to the electrical loads, wind power, and electricity price. The objective of the proposed problem is to minimize the total operation cost of EH, which is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem model. The numerical results are implemented for different cases which demonstrate the effectiveness of the integration of the P2G based multi-carrier energy storage and DRPs on the operation cost of EH. The achieved results confirm the proposed approach by demonstrating the considerable reduction in operating cost of the EHS by approximately 7%.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, most of the research in this area focuses on only a single stock or an index and often formulates the problem to optimize only on the accuracy. Our paper proposed a more profit-oriented framework by formulating the problem into multiple stock returns prediction as well as introducing a relation inference for stock ranking. This setup can diversify investment and eventually enhance trading profits while maintaining the regression accuracy. Moreover, it is become more challenging to process multiple time-series features simultaneously because of the great variety of available information in the financial market. We mitigate this with the state-of-the-art model for time-series forecasting, the Dual-stage attention recurrent neural networks (DA-RNN), and train them with the shared-parameter model setting. The attention layer within DA-RNN helps the model captures the relevance insight among the features. We conducted experiments on major 64 target stocks from the SET market with RMSE, mean reciprocal rank, and annualized profit returns as evaluation metrics. The results show that our proposed model framework (DA-RANK) can predict multiple stock returns in ranking order and able to produce a desirable improvement in profitability over other baseline models.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

However, few information is available regarding the role of galectins in virus infections. Here, we conducted a systemic literature review to analyze the role of galectins in human virus infection. Methods: This study uses a systematic method to identify and select eligible articles according to the PRISMA guidelines. References were selected from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar database covering publication dated from August 1995 to December 2018. Results: Results indicate that galectins play multiple roles in regulation of virus infections. Galectin-1 (Gal-1), galectin-3 (Gal-3), galectin-8 (Gal-8), and galectin-9 (Gal-9) were found as the most predominant galectins reported to participate in virus infection. The regulatory function of galectins occurs by extracellularly binding to viral glycosylated envelope proteins, interacting with ligands or receptors on immune cells, or acting intracellularly with viral or cellular components in the cytoplasm. Several galectins express either positive or negative regulatory role, while some had dual regulatory capabilities on virus propagation based on the conditions and their localization. However, limited information about the endogenous function of galectins were found. Therefore, the endogenous effects of galectins in host-virus regulation remains valuable to investigate. Conclusions: This study offers information regarding the various roles galectins shown in viral infection and suggest that galectins can potentially be used as viral therapeutic targets or antagonists.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Therapeutic interventions targeting to lung cancer become remaining the world significant challenge. Recently, the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) was reported to play an important role in the mechanism underlying lung cancer progression, being intriguing drug target for lung cancer therapy. Hence, the top four α7-nAChR antagonists (QND7, PPRD10, PPRD11 and PPRD12) among our previously developed ligands were proceeded to the in vitro anti-cancer evaluations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (H460 and A549). In this study, we found that QND7 exhibited the highest cytotoxic effect and induced cell apoptosis in both cell lines at a level comparable to cisplatin, whereas the PPRD compounds showed much lower cytotoxicity. Low doses of QND7 and PPRD11 were able to suppress H460 and A549 cell proliferation, whereas PPRD10 and PPRD12 were considered ineffective. In an in vitro wound healing assay, QND7-treatment showed the greatest suppression of H460 and A549 cell migration. The variations in the anti-cancer activities of PPRD compounds might be, at least in part of, their non-selective antagonisms to serotonin receptor (5-HT3) and α4β2-nAChR. Further investigation revealed that QND7 was able to minimize protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) activity, in correlating to its anti-cancer effects.

Stool samples and questionnaires were obtained from 130 people in the DM group and 100 people in the non-DM group. Blastocystis infection was identified via a nested polymerase chain reaction and subtyped via sequencing of the partial small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene. Analysis of potential risk factors was conducted via binary logistic regression. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis infection was 10.8%, including rates of 9% and 12.3% in the non-DM and DM groups, respectively. The most prevalent subtype was ST3, followed by ST1, and ST4. Factors that potentially increased the risk of Blastocystis infection include patients being >65 years old, the presence of DM, a DM duration of ≥10 years, a low level of education, and animal ownership. In conclusion, this is the first study of Blastocystis infection in DM, and a high prevalence was found among this population.

Expert opinion: Dengue has become an intractable global health problem. Vector control has achieved only limited success in reducing the transmission of dengue. A dengue vaccine is needed as part of an integrated approach to dengue prevention and control since dengue poses a heavy economic cost to the health system and society. Because dengue is a unique and complex disease developing a dengue vaccine has proven equally complex. However, there is an advanced pipeline of vaccine research currently in clinical and preclinical studies including live-attenuated vaccine candidates as well as virus-vectored and virus-like particle-based vaccines.","Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

The catalysts were prepared via impregnation of Ag and Li onto TiO2 having different phases [anatase (A), rutile (R) and mixed phases (AR)]. The structure of different AgLi/TiO2 catalysts was confirmed using various techniques including XRD, N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, ICP, FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD. The results from non-oxidative dehydrogenation indicated that AgLi/TiO2-A catalyst exhibited the highest acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40 % at 300â°C, while acetaldehyde yield of ca. 66 % was obtained for AgLi/TiO2-AR catalyst at 300â°C in oxidative dehydrogenation. On the basis of experimental results, we conclude that the phases transition of TiO2 strongly affects the physicochemical properties of AgLi/TiO2 catalysts. The influence of catalyst properties such as the strength of basic sites and reduction behaviors have been a positive synergetic effect for enhancing the catalytic performance of both reactions. Reasons for these were discussed.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Potential Contribution of Solar Drying Systems to Development of Rural Communities: A Case Study in Thailand 農村コミュニティの発展における太陽熱乾燥システムの貢献可能性：タイにおけるケースタディ,"Moriizumi Y., Hondo H., Sri-Ampai P.",2020-10-20,"Climate change mitigation, Empirical findings, Environmental sustainability, Local community, Production activity, Solar drying systems, Solar thermal energy, Working environment, Community enterprise, Learning, Local sustainability, Motivation, Renewable energy, Sharing, Solar thermal energy","The purpose of this study is to examine whether the introduction of solar drying systems contribute to the development of rural community activities in Thailand. In this study, interviews are conducted with six farmer groups who use solar drying systems for their production activities, and the empirical findings from the interviews are used as data for the analysis. The case analysis reveals that the introduction of solar drying systems has the potential to create the following three values. First, its introduction has the potential to motivate community members and bring out their initiative through the improvement of the working environment. The second is the possibility that its introduction may naturally induce learning to improve members' competence, triggered by a change in drying methods. Third, its introduction has the potential to enhance the sustainability of local communities by strengthening ties within local communities and ensuring succession. More importantly, the use of renewable solar thermal energy realizes the three values mentioned above without the consumption of fossil fuels. This study suggests that the installation of solar drying systems may not only contribute to global environmental sustainability in terms of climate change mitigation, but also to the sustainable development of rural communities in developing countries.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Deferiprone is an iron chelator that shows an antiplatelet activity and thus may alleviate platelet hyperactivation in thalassemia. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of deferiprone on normal human platelets. The results illustrated that deferiprone inhibited platelet aggregation at the iron chelating concentrations (0.08–0.25 mmol/l). Deferiprone inhibited human platelet aggregation stimulated by arachidonic acid and ADP more potently than epinephrine and collagen, with the IC50 of 0.24 mmol/l and 0.25 mmol/l vs. 3.36 mmol/l and 3.73 mmol/l, respectively. Interestingly, deferiprone significantly inhibited COX-1 activity, with the IC50 of 0.33 mmol/l, and slightly increased cAMP level at the high concentration of 4 mmol/l. Moreover, the results from molecular docking showed that deferiprone interacted closely with key residues in the peroxidase active site of COX-1. These results suggested that deferiprone possessed antiplatelet activity mainly through the inhibition of COX-1 activity.",medical,Hematology

Despite its proven efficacy and safety, implementation of apomorphine infusion as a new option was not straightforward. This has prompted a range of health-care professional and patient-focused initiatives, led by the Chulalongkorn Center of Excellence for Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders in Bangkok, to help establish a more coordinated approach to PD management throughout the country and ensure patients have access to suitable treatments. Expert opinion: Overcoming the challenges of education, proficiency, resource capacity and standard of care for PD patients in developing countries requires a coordinated effort both nationally and beyond. The best practices identified in Thailand following the introduction of apomorphine infusion might be helpful for other countries when implementing similar programs.","neuroscience, medical","Neuroscience (all), Neurology (clinical), Pharmacology (medical)"

During infections, C. albicans has to cope with genotoxic stresses generated by the host immune system. DNA–protein crosslink (DPC), the covalent linkage of proteins with DNA, is one type of DNA damages that can be caused by the host immune response. DPCs are bulky lesions that interfere with the progression of replication and transcription machineries, and hence threaten genomic integrity. Accordingly, either a DPC tolerance mechanism or a DPC repair pathway is essential for C. albicans to maintain genomic stability and survive in the host. Here, we identified Wss1 (weak suppressor of Smt3) in C. albicans (CaWss1) using bioinformatics, genetic complementation, and biochemical studies. We showed that CaWss1 promotes cell survival under genotoxic stress conditions that generate DPCs and that the catalytic metalloprotease domain of CaWss1 is essential for its cellular function. Interactions of CaWss1 with Cdc48 and small ubiquitin-like modifier, although not strictly required, contribute to the function of CaWss1 in the suppression of the growth defects under DPC-inducing conditions. This report is the first investigation of the role of CaWss1 in DPC tolerance in C. albicans.","genetics and molecular biology; molecular genetics; nucleic acid structure and biophysicsics; protein-nucleic acid interactions, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Biology"

However, the SESR process is discontinuous and requires regeneration after sorbent saturation with CO2. The circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFBR) system has previously been proposed for continuous H2 production, with both reforming and sorbent regeneration occurring simultaneously. The main aim of this work was to determine the feasibility and performance of SESR with a proper design and conditions in conjunction with the CFBR system. The reforming riser and bubbling bed regenerator are studied separately but related to each other. Two-dimensional transient models using the Euler‒Euler approach and kinetic theory of granular flow were used for fluid dynamic simulations combined with the decarbonation kinetics of dolomite, to investigate a conceptual regenerator system and determine its key conditions. A mixture of the Ni-based catalyst and dolomite from the risers was injected with a flux of 200 kg/(m2 s) and a catalyst to sorbent ratio of 2.54 kg/kg. A double-stage bubbling bed regenerator system was designed with 1.2 m width, 0.8 m bed height, a gas inlet velocity of 0.2 m/s and solid preheating at 950 °C. The used dolomite was regenerated with an assumed CaO conversion of 3%; the almost fresh dolomite was then released with good mixing of the catalyst and sorbent.","process equipment, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recognized as an important gasotransmitter that can improve angiogenesis which is crucial for wound healing. In this study, a functional sodium alginate (SA) dressing with H2S-releasing property (SA/JK-1) was fabricated by incorporating JK-1 molecule, a pH-dependent H2S donor, into SA sponge. The resultant SA/JK-1 sponge provided a moist and protective healing environment and was capable of releasing H2S consistently under acidic pH condition by absorbing exudate at the wound interface. The H2S release of JK-1 donor was prolonged by the SA sponge compared with JK-1 in solution. Cell study in vitro indicated that SA/JK-1 not only exhibited good cyto-compatibility, but also improved fibroblast proliferation and migration. In addition, the effects of the SA/JK-1 dressing on wound healing was evaluated using an in vivo full thickness dermal defect model, which revealed that SA/JK-1 can significantly improve wound healing process with enhanced granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization, collagen deposition and angiogenesis, due to the H2S released from JK-1. Taken together, our results showed that SA dressing doped with H2S donor could potentially serves as an effective wound healing strategy. Statement of significance: The gasotransmitter H2S has been proven to improve the wound healing process in nanofibrous dressing due to its biological functions on angiogenesis. However, for non-healing wounds with heavy exudates, a wound dressing that can absorb wound exudates and controlled gasotransmitter release to improve the wound healing process is still in urgent need. Here we fabricated a sodium alginate (SA) sponge incorporated with H2S donor JK-1 (SA/JK-1), which showed strong water uptake capability, and released H2S under acidic condition. The SA/JK-1 sponge exhibited biocompatibility to fibroblasts and promoted cell migration in vitro, and exhibited obviously positive influence on wound healing in vivo. This H2S donor doped alginate wound dressing represents a promising strategy for treatment of non-healing wound.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Materials Science, engineering","Biotechnology, Biomaterials, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology"

ASD is classically characterized by reduced communication skills and social interactions, with limitations im-posed by repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. The pathophysiology of ASD is thought to arise from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors within the con-text of individual development. A growing body of research has raised the possibility of identifying the aetiological causes of the disorder. This review highlights the roles of immune-inflammatory pathways, nitro-oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in ASD pathogenesis and symptom severity. The role of NK-cells, T helper, T regulatory and B-cells, coupled with increased inflammatory cytokines, lowered levels of immune-regulatory cytokines, and increased autoantibodies and micro-glial activation is elucidated. It is proposed that alterations in mitochondrial activity and nitro-oxidative stress are intimately associated with activated immune-inflammatory pathways. Future research should determine as to whether the mitochondria, immune-inflammatory activity and nitro-oxidative stress changes in ASD affect the development of amygdala-frontal cortex interactions. A number of treatment implications may arise, including prevention-orientated prenatal interventions, treatment of pregnant women with vitamin D, and sodium butyrate. Treatments of ASD children and adults with probiotics, sodium butyrate and butyrate-inducing diets, antipurinergic therapy with su-ramin, melatonin, oxytocin and taurine are also discussed.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"

Up until now, a small number of farms have been vaccinated. When FMD outbreaks occur, it is interesting to determine the risk factors of FMD, especially in the area where vaccination rates are low. The questionnaire survey, using a case-control design at the household level, was carried out. From 59 villages with a total number of 434 households, 181 households who experienced FMD were assigned as case households, 146 households without FMD occurrence inside the outbreak villages as inside control households, and 107 households without FMD occurrence outside the outbreak villages as outside control households. Household owners were interviewed. The logistic regression model was used to identify the relationship between FMD occurrence (dependent variable) and the collected data (independent variables), including the social status of livestock owners, FMD prevention strategies, and farm locations. A non-parametric test was performed to determine the association of FMD and network parameters of animal movements among villages. In general, results show that a limited number of holders did vaccinate animals before the outbreaks (13.8–17.8%). The results indicated that livestock owners who had known information about FMD before the outbreaks had been less severely affected by the FMD outbreak than the owners who had not known information about FMD (P < 0.01, OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09–0.29). Before the outbreaks, higher FMD risk was observed in owners who sold the livestock through animal traders (P < 0.01, OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.68–13.50). Spatial data show that households in the community closer to the main roads had higher FMD risk (P < 0.01, OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.68–13.50). In addition, the network parameters including in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness indicated that the villages with high movements of livestock were at high risk of FMD (P < 0.05). The present study emphasized the importance of the government units to distribute the information about FMD to all livestock farmers in Xayaboury. Disease awareness and prevention strategy should be prioritized in areas close to high density communities and in the trading of livestock.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology"

Specifically, this document transformation allows us to (i) use set distance measures associated with an outlier handling mechanism, (ii) capture stylistic variations within a document, and (iii) produce multiple predictions for a query document. We create a new Thai authorship identification corpus containing 547 documents from 200 authors, which is significantly larger than the corpus used by the existing study (an increase of 32 folds in terms of the number of candidate authors). The experimental results show that our solution can overcome the limitations of the existing solution and outperforms all competitors with an accuracy level of 91.02%. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of each stylometric features category with the help of an ablation study. We found that combining all categories of the stylometric features outperforms the other combinations. Finally, we cross compare the feature spaces and classification methods of all solutions. We found that (i) our solution can scale as the number of candidate authors increases, (ii) our method outperforms all the competitors, and (iii) our feature space provides better performance than the feature space used by the existing study.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)
Natural polyphenols prevent indomethacin-induced and diclofenac-induced Caco-2 cell death by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress regardless of their direct reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity,"Boonyong C., Vardhanabhuti N., Jianmongkol S.",2020-04-01,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, bcl-2-Associated X Protein, Caco-2 Cells, Cell Death, Cell Line, Tumor, Cytoprotection, Diclofenac, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Humans, Indomethacin, Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial, Mitochondria, Oxidative Stress, Polyphenols, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, Reactive Oxygen Species, Transcription Factor CHOP, cytotoxicity, diclofenac, ER stress, indomethacin, mitochondrial dysfunction, polyphenols","Objectives: Indomethacin (INDO) and diclofenac (DIC) can induce intestinal cell death through induction of oxidative stress-mediated ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. This study investigated the cytoprotective potential of 11 polyphenols, namely caffeic acid (CAF), curcumin (CUR), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallic acid (GAL), hypophyllanthin (HYPO), naringenin (NAR), phyllanthin (PHY), piperine (PIP), quercetin (QUE), rutin (RUT) and silymarin (SLY) against these two NSAIDs in Caco-2 cells. Methods: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined with fluorescence spectroscopy using specific probes (DHE, DCFH-DA, HPF). Cell viability and mitochondrial function were assessed by MTT and TMRE assays. The mRNA levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and CHOP proteins were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction technique. Key findings: All test polyphenols reduced NSAIDs-mediated ROS production. Only EGCG, QUE and RUT protected INDO-/DIC-induced cell death. These three polyphenols suppressed Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, CHOP up-regulation and MMP disruption in NSAIDs-treated cells. CAF and NAR prevented cytotoxicity from INDO, but not DIC. The cytoprotective effect of NAR, but not CAF, involved alteration of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio or MMP disruption, but not CHOP transcription. Conclusion: The cytoprotective activity of polyphenols against NSAIDs-induced toxicity stemmed from either suppression of CHOP-related ER and mitochondria stresses or other CHOP-independent pathways, but not from the intrinsic ROS scavenging capacity.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science"
Solvent-based washing as a treatment alternative for onshore petroleum drill cuttings in Thailand,"Poyai T., Getwech C., Dhanasin P., Punyapalakul P., Painmanakul P., Chawaloesphonsiya N.",2020-05-20,"Central composite designs, Drill cuttings, Granular activated carbons, Green solvents, Liquid to solid ratio, Response surface methodology, Solvent recovery, Total petroleum hydrocarbons, Drill cuttings, Green solvents, Optimization, Solvent recovery, Total petroleum hydrocarbon","In Thailand, onshore drill cuttings (DC) contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) are currently transported off-site for incineration, causing high transportation cost and potential leakage to the environment. To address the issues, we develop solvent-based washing as a greener alternative for onshore DC remediation, focusing on solvent selection, washing process optimization, and solvent recovery. The results showed that ethyl lactate (EL) was the best green solvent for DC washing, compared to water, ethylene glycol, and ethyl acetate. Based on response surface methodology assisted with central composite design, the maximum TPH removal of 87.1% was achieved from 4 mL g−1 liquid-to-solid ratio, 14 min washing time, and 80 rpm stirring speed, and the TPH removal rate by EL fitted well with the second-order reaction (R2 = 0.9774). Furthermore, the spent EL was successfully recycled by simple and low-energy adsorption using granular activated carbon (GAC). With the sufficient GAC dosage, TPH could be completely removed from the spent EL without impairing the original EL properties. Moreover, the recycled EL exhibited its successful reuse in the subsequent DC washing process. These findings suggest that solvent washing accompanied with solvent recovery by adsorption could be a novel and greener remedial scheme for onshore DC management.","genergyal, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, petroleum engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

A review of feature extraction and performance evaluation in epileptic seizure detection using EEG,"Boonyakitanont P., Lek-uthai A., Chomtho K., Songsiri J.",2020-03-01,"Automatic seizure detections, Classification performance, Data transformation, Electro-encephalogram (EEG), Epileptic seizure detection, Machine learning approaches, Seizure detection, Wavelet coefficients, classification, EEG, Feature extraction, Seizure detection","Since the manual detection of electrographic seizures in continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is very time-consuming and requires a trained expert, attempts to develop automatic seizure detection are diverse and ongoing. Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features, data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions, making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features – variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG signal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on wavelet coefficients – were able to significantly capture the seizures. When compared with a baseline method of classifying all epochs as normal, an improvement of 4.77–13.51% in the Bayesian error was obtained.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, medical","Signal Processing, Health Informatics"

In the 1st stage, the OPS liquefaction was performed using 5 or 10% by weight (wt%) NaOH or KOH as the catalyst at 330 °C and an initial hydrogen (H2) pressure of 4 MPa. In the 2nd stage, the solid residue (SR) from 1st stage was again liquefied using 5 wt% catalyst (NaOH or KOH) at otherwise the same conditions as before. For the one-stage liquefaction, 10 wt% KOH gave the maximum yield of bio-oil and SR (61.9% and 27.3%, respectively) and the highest energy equivalent ratio (1.012). In the two-stage liquefaction using 10 wt% KOH in the 1st stage, using 5 wt% KOH in the 2nd stage gave the maximum yield of bio-oil (18.8%), which was lower than in the 1st stage liquefaction using the same catalyst type. However, the total bio-oil production in the two-stages was higher than in the one-stage liquefaction. The heating value of the obtained bio-oil was in the range of 26.2–32.5 MJ/kg, with the main components, as analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, being phenols, esters, alcohols and benzene derivatives.

Punjab, the largest province by population and contributes high gross domestic product (GDP) share in economy has reported 27% moderately and 10% severely stunted children of less than 5 years. Thus, this study aims at examining the determinants of stunting (moderate and severe) at different level of hierarchy empirically in Punjab province of Pakistan. Methodology: Data for this study is coming from Punjab Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS-2014), used two-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach. Sub-national level data covering urban and rural areas were used for this study consists of 25,067 children less than 5 year's ages, from nine administrative divisions and 36 districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. Descriptive statistics and multilevel hierarchical models were estimated. Multilevel data analyses have an advantage because it provides robust standard error estimates and helps in finding variation in the data at various levels. Results: Punjab has a stunting prevalence of about 27% moderately and 10% severely stunted children of less than 5 years. The results depict that increasing the age of the child, increasing birth order, illiterate mothers and fathers, lack of sanitation facilities and being poor are associated significantly with the likelihood of moderate and severe stunting. Surprisingly, there is a gender bias in stunting in Punjab, Pakistan and being a girl child is more likely associated with moderate and severe stunting, which shows the patriarchal nature of the society and a substantial prevalence of gender bias in household resource allocations. Conclusion: This outcome of our analysis points towards targeting not only households (focus on girls) but also their families and communities.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

This prospective observational study was conducted to examine the incidence and clinical outcomes of clinical and subclinical AKI in MDR septic patients receiving CMS. Methods: Forty-two MDR septic patients with normal sCr who required CMS were included. Clinical AKI was diagnosed by increased sCr levels according to the KDIGO2012 criteria while subclinical AKI was identified by elevated levels of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL > 150 ng/mL) or urinary liver-type fatty-acid-binding protein (uL-FABP > 10.5 ng/mL). Results: Clinical AKI was noted in 47.6% of patients on day 5 and 38.1% on day 7 after initiating CMS. By using uL-FABP, subclinical AKI was observed in 45.2% and 54.8% on day 5 and 7, respectively. At baseline prior to CMS treatment, subclinical AKI was already present in 90%. The baseline uL-FABP was superior to the baseline uNGAL in early prediction of clinical AKI on day 5. The subclinical AKI patients had comparable worse outcomes as clinical AKI patients. Conclusion: The incidence of subclinical AKI in MDR septic patients before CMS treatment was extremely high. The baseline uL-FABP provided the best predictive capacity of clinical AKI. The causes of clinical AKI might include the persistence of sepsis process, subclinical AKI and CMS nephrotoxicity. Proper management of subclinical AKI patients before CMS initiation should be concerned to prevent further renal damage and improve patient and renal outcomes.",medical,Nephrology

Some studies have reported that being overweight and having psychological symptoms contribute to pain from plantar fasciitis. However, there is a lack of information regarding the physical predictors, and more research is needed to determine the relationship between such predictors and pain intensity from plantar fasciitis in conscripts. Objective: To determine which physical and psychological variables act as predictors of pain intensity among Thai novice conscripts with plantar fasciitis. Methods: Two hundred and seventy Thai novice conscripts without musculoskeletal pain completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short version and then received baseline assessment of ankle dorsiflexion angle, ankle plantarflexor strength, and quality of lower extremity movement from a physical therapist. After 10 weeks of military training, 71 of these Thai conscripts developed pain from plantar fasciitis. Multiple linear regression analysis with the forward stepwise method was used to explore the predictors of pain intensity due to plantar fasciitis. Results: Using a forward regression analysis, anxiety (B = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.06–0.20; p < 0.01) and quality of movement score (B = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.28–1.47; p = 0.01) were significant predictors of pain intensity. The regression model with these predictors explained 25% of the variability in pain intensity from plantar fasciitis. Conclusion: Higher scores of anxiety and movement quality on the lateral step-down task were associated with pain intensity from plantar fasciitis after the completion of a 10-week military program. However, lower ankle dorsiflexion angle and ankle plantarflexor strength did not predict pain intensity.","Health Professions, medical","Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Rehabilitation"

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Brief Behavioural Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) are effective treatments for patients with persistent pain and depression, respectively. The objectives of this 12 month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) are (i) to examine the efficacy and cost-utility of adding a group-based form of ACT or BATD to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with CLBP and moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms; (ii) identify pre-post differences in levels of some physiological variables and (iii) analyse the role of polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene, psychological process measures and physiological variables as mediators or moderators of long-term clinical changes. Methods and analysis Participants will be 225 patients with CLBP and moderate to severe depression symptoms recruited at Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu (St. Boi de Llobregat, Spain) and Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: TAU vs TAU+ACT versus TAU+BATD. A comprehensive assessment to collect clinical variables and costs will be conducted pretreatment, post-treatment and at 12 months follow-up, being pain interference the primary outcome measure. The following physiological variables will be considered at pretreatment and post-treatment assessments in 50% of the sample: immune-inflammatory markers, hair cortisol and cortisone, serum cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin and vitamin D. Polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene (rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, rs9470080 and rs4713916) will be analysed at baseline assessment. Moreover, we will include mobile-technology-based ecological momentary assessment, through the Pain Monitor app, to track ongoing clinical status during ACT and BATD treatments.

TLR3 activation modulates immunomodulatory properties of human periodontal ligament cells,"Chaikeawkaew D., Everts V., Pavasant P.",2020-09-01,"Cells, Cultured, Humans, Immunomodulation, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Periodontal Ligament, Toll-Like Receptor 3, HLA-G, IDO, immunomodulation, periodontal ligament, toll-like receptor 3","Background: Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a group of receptors that play roles in the innate immune system. Human periodontal ligament cells (hPDL cells) express several TLRs, including TLR3, a nucleotide sensing receptor that recognizes double-stranded RNA from viral infection. However, its role in hPDL cells is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the responses of hPDL cells in terms of immunomodulation after TLR3 engagement. Methods: HPDL cells were treated with various doses of poly I:C, a TLR3 activator. The expression of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) was determined. Chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were used to confirm the role of TLR3. Coculture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with poly I:C-activated hPDL cells was performed. Results: Endosomal TLR3 in hPDL cells was observed by immunocytochemistry. Addition of poly I:C significantly enhanced the expression and secretion of IFNγ, IDO, and HLA-G. Knockdown of TLR3 using siRNA decreased the poly I:C-induced expression of these three molecules. Bafilomycin-A, an inhibitor of auto-phagosome and lysosome fusion, inhibited poly I:C-induced IDO and HLA-G expression, whereas cycloheximide and a TLR3-neutralizing antibody had no effect. In co-culture experiments, poly I:C-activated hPDL cells inhibited PBMCs proliferation and increased mRNA expression of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), a transcription factor which is a marker of regulatory T cells. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that TLR3 engagement of hPDL cells induced immunosuppressive properties of these cells. Because immunosuppressive properties play an important role in tissue healing and regeneration, activation of TLR3 may help to attenuate tissue destruction by limiting the inflammatory process and perhaps initiate the healing and regeneration process of the periodontium.",dentistry,Periodontics

Trihalomethanes (THMs) were used as model analytes. Three types of carbon nanosorbents (graphite, graphene, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes) were studied. The carbon sorbent incorporating membrane was used in a two-phase mode liquid-phase microextraction, with 1-octanol as the acceptor solution. Using a graphite-reinforced hollow-fiber membrane and an extraction time of 10 min, enrichment factors of 40–71 were obtained for trichloromethane, bromodichloromethane, bromoform, and chlorodibromomethane. Linear working ranges of 0.2–100 μg L−1 and limits of detection ranging from 0.01 μg L−1 (for CHCl2Br and CHClBr2) to 0.1 μg L−1 (for CHCl3) were achieved. The minimum detectable concentrations were far below the maximum concentration levels (60–200 μg L−1) set by the WHO for drinking water. The carbon-sorbent-reinforced hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction afforded higher extraction efficiency and shorter extraction time compared with conventional hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction.

Design/methodology/approach: SAC305 solder joints were prepared under different cooling conditions/rates. The performance of three different etching methods was investigated: simple chemical etching, deep etching based on the Jackson method and selective removal of β-Sn by a standard three-electrode cell method. Phase and structural analyses were conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology of etched solder was examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope. The hardness evaluations of the solder joints were conducted by a Vickers microhardness tester. Findings: The Ag3Sn network was significantly refined by the ice-quenching process. Further, the thickness of the Cu6Sn5 layer decreased with an increase in the cooling rate. The finer Ag3Sn network and the thinner Cu6Sn5 IMC layer were the results of the reduced solidification time. The ice-quenched solder joints showed the highest hardness values because of the refinement of the Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 phases. Originality/value: The reduction in the XRD peak intensities showed the influence of the cooling condition on the formation of the different phases. The micrographs prepared by electrochemical etching revealed better observations regarding the shape and texture of the IMC phases than those prepared by the conventional etching method. The lower grain orientation sensitivity of the electrochemical etching method (unlike chemical etching) significantly improved the micrographs and enabled accurate observation of IMC phases.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

These evolutionarily conserved proteins are crucial for survival and function as monitors of protein synthesis during various stresses. Here, we performed gene expression analysis of the entire set of putative serine protease genes in Halothece sp. PCC7418 under salt stress conditions. The gene-encoding HtrA2 (H3553) was highly upregulated. This gene was cloned and functionally characterized, and its sub-cellular localization was determined. The recombinant H3553 protein (rH3553) displayed a pH optimum of 8.0, remained stable at 45 °C, and its proteolytic activity was not affected by salts. H3553 completely degraded the unfolded model protein, β-casein. In contrast, the folded model substrates (lysozyme or BSA) were not degraded by rH3553. Denaturation of BSA at a high temperature significantly increased its degradation by rH3553. H3553 was detected in the soluble protein fraction as well as the plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane fractions. Interestingly, the majority of H3553 was present in the plasma membrane under salt and heat stress conditions. Thus, H3553 resides in multiple sub-cellular locations and its localization drastically changes after exposure to stresses. Taken together, H3553 underpins protein quality-control process and is involved in the response and adaptation to salinity and heat stresses.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Medicine"

A HbA1c assessment was performed at the same time of 3-h 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). GDM was diagnosed according to the National Diabetes Data Group for a 3-h 100 g OGTT. Sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c were evaluated and pregnancy outcome were recorded in aspects of gestational age at delivery, preeclampsia, primary cesarean section rate, birth weight, fetal macrosomia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Results: One hundred fourteen women were enrolled. There were 35 women with GDM using NDDG criteria. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for HbA1c detection of GDM was 0.725 (95% confidence interval 0.621–0.829). Cut-off value of HbA1c was 5.8%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 17.1, 100, 100, 73.2, and 74.6%, respectively. Pregnancy outcome in both groups in this study has no statistical significance. Conclusions: HbA1c values cannot replace OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM. However, HbA1c might be a useful tool to reduce the number of OGTT, associated costs and patient inconvenience.","clinical chemistryistry; biochemistryistryhemistry; biochemistryistryhemistry of pregnancy; metabolic effects of pregnancy, medical","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Obstetrics and Gynecology"
Direct Correlation of Nanoscale Morphology and Device Performance to Study Photocurrent Generation in Donor-Enriched Phases of Polymer Solar Cells,"Ben Dkhil S., Perkhun P., Luo C., Muller D., Alkarsifi R., Barulina E., Avalos Quiroz Y.A., Margeat O., Dubas S.T., Koganezawa T., Kuzuhara D., Yoshimoto N., Caddeo C., Mattoni A., Zimmermann B., Wurfel U., Pfannmoller M., Bals S., Ackermann J., Videlot-Ackermann C.",2020-06-24,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ), Bulk heterojunction solar cells, Energy loss electrons, Exciton diffusion length, Molecular dynamics simulations, Photocurrent generations, Thieno[3 ,4-b]thiophene, Transport measurements, additive, blend ratio, charge transport, nanoscale fullerene network, PTB7:PC71BM, solar cell","The nanoscale morphology of polymer blends is a key parameter to reach high efficiency in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Thereby, research typically focusing on optimal blend morphologies while studying nonoptimized blends may give insight into blend designs that can prove more robust against morphology defects. Here, we focus on the direct correlation of morphology and device performance of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends processed without additives in different donor/acceptor weight ratios. We show that while blends of a 1:1.5 ratio are composed of large donor-enriched and fullerene domains beyond the exciton diffusion length, reducing the ratio below 1:0.5 leads to blends composed purely of polymer-enriched domains. Importantly, the photocurrent density in such blends can reach values between 45 and 60% of those reached for fully optimized blends using additives. We provide here direct visual evidence that fullerenes in the donor-enriched domains are not distributed homogeneously but fluctuate locally. To this end, we performed compositional nanoscale morphology analysis of the blend using spectroscopic imaging of low-energy-loss electrons using a transmission electron microscope. Charge transport measurement in combination with molecular dynamics simulations shows that the fullerene substructures inside the polymer phase generate efficient electron transport in the polymer-enriched phase. Furthermore, we show that the formation of densely packed regions of fullerene inside the polymer phase is driven by the PTB7:PC71BM enthalpy of mixing. The occurrence of such a nanoscale network of fullerene clusters leads to a reduction of electron trap states and thus efficient extraction of photocurrent inside the polymer domain. Suitable tuning of the polymer-acceptor interaction can thus introduce acceptor subnetworks in polymer-enriched phases, improving the tolerance for high-efficiency BHJ toward morphological defects such as donor-enriched domains exceeding the exciton diffusion length.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

This study investigates a solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system integrated with a gas turbine (GT) for power generation. The advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system is designed to enhance the system flexibility. Simulations of the proposed power system are performed to demonstrate the amount of power that can supply to the loads during normal and peak modes of operation under steady-state conditions. The pressure ratios of the GT and AA-CAES and the additional air feed are used to design the system and analyze the system performance. The results show that a small additional air feed to the GT is certainly required for the hybrid system. The GT pressure ratio of 2 provides a maximum benefit. The AA-CAES pressure ratio of 5 is recommended to spare some air in the storage and minimize storage volume. Moreover, implementation of the GT and AA-CAES into the integrated fuel cell system allows the system to cope with the variations in power demand.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The maximum level of sugar concentration of 19.59 g/L was derived when rice straw was pretreated at 162 °C for 48 min and further hydrolyzed by enzymatic saccharification. The comparison of chemical pretreatment was performed using ionic liquid, alkaline, and acid to evaluate the effectiveness and effect structural changes of rice straw. Nevertheless, the total sugar yield from this ionic liquid pretreatment was 13% lower than alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment. All hydrolysates from chemical pretreatment were subjected for use as a culture medium for Clostridium beijerinckii TISTR 1461 in acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation. The results suggested that residue ionic liquid affects microbial growth, so a detoxification step was cautiously considered. Additionally, using hydrolysate of the rice straw pretreated by NaOH as a substrate, isobutyraldehyde was found in the fermentation broth, suggesting that C. beijerinckii TISTR 1461 can produce isobutanol in proper conditions.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

Due to the increase in fine particles in the air environment, the city population is facing acute respiratory problems. For understanding the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), sampling was done in Chiangmai and Bangkok of Thailand using Polyurethane (PUF) disk passive samplers. There were five sampling sites in Bangkok, and three in Chiang Mai. Data were collected in the dry season, i.e. from December 2018- June 2019. A total of 24 samples were extracted and further quantitatively analyzed by the standard method using GC-MS. Both PAHs and PCBs concentrations increased during the dry season. At Chiang Mai, max. PAHs were found to be 848 ng/m3, which was higher than that of Bangkok, max. PAHs concentration was found to be 455 ng/m3. On the other hand, the max PCBs found in Bangkok were 15 pg/m3 were higher than that in Chiang Mai (max. value 2.63 pg/m3, Chiang Mai sites had more dominant species PAHs than in Bangkok, particularly during forest fire episodes from February to April 2019. The potential sources of PAHs were found as the combined emission of diesel and gasoline vehicles and biomass combustion. The carcinogenic risk associated with inhalation exposure to PAHs and PCBs was estimated to be < 10-6 at all the sampling points. The analyzed PAHs and PCBs species indicated their potential sources that related to both biomass burning and traffic in Bangkok and Chiangmai. Pollutants' level also had seasonal variations. Therefore, air quality management is an essential issue that needs to be monitored in these provinces (cities) of Thailand.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Fuel Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Global and Planetary Change"

On the contrary, soluble Jagged1 fails to activate target gene expression of Notch signaling which is important for differentiation of human dental pulp cells. Hence, Jagged1 delivery system is indeed required for transportation of immobilized Jagged1 to promote odontogenic differentiation of human dental pulp cells in vivo. The present study described the preparation and characterization of Jagged1-bound fibrinogen-based microspheres. Water-in-oil emulsion technique was employed to prepare fibrinogen microspheres and thrombin cross-linked fibrinogen microspheres. The average size of fibrinogen microspheres and thrombin cross-linked fibrinogen microspheres was 213.9 ± 35.9 and 199.9 ± 41.9 µm, respectively. These microspheres did not alter the human dental pulp cells’ cell viability. Human dental pulp cells were able to attach and spread on these microspheres. Jagged1 was conjugated on microspheres using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino) propyl carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide. Binding capacity of Jagged1 on both fibrinogen microspheres and thrombin cross-linked fibrinogen microspheres ranged from 25.8 ± 6.0 to 35.6 ± 9.1%. There was no significant difference in the size of microspheres between before and after Jagged1 conjugation process. In conclusion, fibrinogen microspheres and thrombin cross-linked fibrinogen microspheres could be utilized as the alternative biomaterials for Jagged1 delivery for future biomedical application.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

However, the role of innate immunity as a prognostic biomarker in severe sepsis is still unknown. This study is to evaluate the discriminatory characteristics of these biomarkers on clinical outcome. Materials and methods: Retrospective study was conducted in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. Neutrophil function was assessed by neutrophil chemotaxis activity and CD-11b expression. Monocyte function was assessed by measurement of mHLA-DR expression and presepsin level. The primary end point was 28 day-mortality. Results: A total of 136 participants were enrolled. Patients were classified into 2 groups as survivors (n = 63, 46.3%) and non-survivors (n = 73, 53.7%). Neutrophil chemotaxis activity was significantly higher in survivors (46.7% vs. 41.2%, p = .023). There was no difference in the remaining biomarker levels between survivors and non-survivors. Only decreased neutrophil chemotaxis activity was associated with 28-day mortality. Combining neutrophil chemotaxis activity with mHLA-DR, CD-11b expression, presepsin, and SOFA score provided the highest AUC of 0.90 (0.84–0.96) in predicting 28-day mortality. Conclusion: Neutrophil chemotaxis activity appears to be a promising novel immunologic biomarker in predicting clinical outcome in patients with severe sepsis.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine

We examined anxiety, symptom awareness, trust and associated behavioural responses in the first three weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) outbreak in Thailand. We collected data on-street at randomly selected locations in Bangkok. Of 274 potential respondents, 203 (74.7%) responded. A four-item measure assessed anxiety, with open-ended questions assessing knowledge of symptoms, trusted information sources and measures taken to avoid infection. Respondents reported good awareness of the prime symptoms of the Coronovirus. Binary logistic regressions controlling for sex and age found the more anxious avoided the Chinese, people who were coughing, crowded places and public transport or flying. Younger respondents reported greater trust in foreign media and older populations information from national government. Trust in doctors online was positively associated with avoidance of coughing people and keeping fit; trust in national government with avoiding coughing people, keeping fit, and avoiding public transport. We conclude that anxiety can motivate both desirable and undesirable behaviours during pandemic outbreaks. Effective and targeted communication by trusted sources is needed to motivate preventive actions but also to limit unnecessary or disruptive behaviours.","neuroscienceoscience; integrative neuroscienceophysicsiology; neuroscienceobiology of stress, medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), a tyrosine-specific-protein kinase inhibitor, has been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory property. The aim of this study was to examine the treatment effects of genistein and its mechanisms in rats with H. pylori infection. Methods: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (6 rats per group): (1) control group (Con); (2) H. pylori infected group (HP): the rats were inoculated with H. pylori (108− 1010 CFU/mL; 1 mL/rat.) for 3 consecutive days; and (3) HP + genistein group (HP + Gen): the rats were inoculated with H. pylori as above. Then, they were gavaged with genistein (16 mg/kg BW) for 14 days. Gastric tissue was used for the determination of nuclear factor (NF)-κB expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), degree of apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction, and histopathology. Serum samples were used to measure the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1). Results: Rats in the HP group had significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, NF-κB expression and apoptotic cells when compared with the Con group, and these markers significantly decreased in HP + Gen group when compared with the HP group. The histopathology of HP group showed moderate gastric inflammation and many HP colonization. Gastric pathology in HP + Gen group demonstrated the attenuation of inflammatory cell infiltration and H. pylori colonization. Conclusion: Genistein exerted its gastroprotective effects through the reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, nuclear receptor NF-κB expression and gastric mucosal apoptosis in rats with H. pylori-induced gastropathy.",medical,Gastroenterology

The tungsten-containing rubber is a lead-free radiation-shielding material that contains as much as 90% tungsten powder by weight. Air kerma rates of scattered radiation from solid-plate phantoms, simulating a patient, were measured with a semiconductor dosimeter at the height of the operator's eye (1,600 mm from the floor), chest (1,300 mm), waist (1,000 mm), and knee (600 mm) with and without tungsten-containing rubber shielding (1-5 mm thickness). The tungsten-containing rubber and a commercial shielding material (RADPAD) were affixed onto the phantom on the operator's side, and reductions in air kerma rates were compared. Reduction rates for tungsten-containing rubber shielding with thicknesses of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm at each height level were as follows: 70.37 ± 0.40%, 72.17 ± 0.29%, 72.95 ± 0.31%, 72.58 ± 0.35%, and 73.63 ± 0.63% at eye level; 76.36 ± 0.19%, 77.13 ± 0.10%, 77.36 ± 0.14%, 77.62 ± 0.25%, and 77.66 ± 0.14% at chest level; 67.78 ± 0.31%, 68.12 ± 0.19%, 68.88 ± 0.28%, 68.97 ± 0.14%, and 68.85 ± 0.45% at waist level; and 0.14 ± 0.94%, 0.72 ± 0.56%, 1.08 ± 0.74%, 1.77 ± 0.80%, and 1.79 ± 1.82% at knee level, respectively.

Regarding the expected positioning accuracy, the novice GNSS data processing strategies have been adopted in the server-side functional model for mitigating distance-dependent errors including atmospheric effects and orbital uncertainty in order to generate high-quality virtual reference stations. In addition, the realistic stochastic model also plays an important role to take account of the unmodelled error in the rover-side processing. The results of our previous study revealed that the minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) stochastic model procedure can improve baseline component accuracy and integer ambiguity reliability, however, it requires adequate epoch length in a solution to calculate the elements of the variance-covariance matrix. As a result, it may not be suitable for urban environment where the satellite signal interruptions take place frequently, therefore, the ambiguity resolution needs to be resolved within the limited epochs. In order to address this limitation, this study proposed the stochastic model based on using the residual interpolation uncertainty (RIU) as the weighting schemes. This indicator reflects the quality of network corrections for any satellite pair at a specific rover position and can be calculated on the epoch-by-epoch basis. The comparison results with the standard stochastic model indicated that the RIU-weight model produced slightly better positioning accuracy but increased significant level of the ambiguity resolution successful rate.","fluidex; related topics, remote sensing; numerical and image analysis, Mathematics, engineering, earth sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Objectives: The study aims to develop and validate scales (direct and indirect) based on a modified Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to measure factors associated with the provision of PCare for HDS users by Thai CPs. Method: Item generation for the scales was based on the theoretical constructs of the modified TPB framework, literature review, and authors' previous qualitative study. Draft items were then subjected to content validity and face validity. Psychometric testing was carried out among CPs in Bangkok, Thailand. Refinement of the scales utilized factor analysis and validity was assessed using factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Internal consistency reliability and construct reliability were used to assess the scales’ reliability. Results: Initially, the direct and indirect scales contained 15 and 28 items, respectively and were reduced to 12 and 16 items, after experts' review. Factor analysis further reduced the number of items of the indirect scale to 13. For both scales, confirmatory factor analysis showed model-data fit. Each construct of the direct scale was significant predictors of intention. Moreover, each construct of the direct scale correlated positively and significantly with the respective construct of the indirect scale, signifying concurrent validity. No misfit item was identified in the Rasch analysis and the majority of items were invariant across gender. Internal consistency reliability and construct reliability of the scales were acceptable.

The comparison between the collected database and correlations indicated none of the existing correlations could predict the whole database satisfactorily. Therefore, the dependence of drift-flux parameters on inclination angles was comprehensively analysed, and a new drift-flux correlation was developed. The newly-developed drift-flux correlation demonstrated superior performance to existing correlations. More than 95% of the predicted void fraction were predicted within ±20% error. In summary, the newly-developed drift-flux correlation is useful to predict void fraction in various engineering fields including chemical engineering.","chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The temperature dependence of threshold current and lasing peak wavelength in C-band of QD-Laser Diode (QD-LD) were analyzed over its operating range of 15–80 °C. The chip gains of 3 device lengths (1.5, 2 and 2.4 mm) were compared under varied injected currents up to 500 mA. To avoid overheat and chip damage during measurements, the pulse current source with 1% and 10% duty cycles was used. Based on our best results of 2-mm long QD-SOA with 25 stacked QD layers, the 1% pulse is preferable because of its lower heating and additional chip gain of 11.9 dB. Hence, the highest chip gain of 35 dB was achieved at 400-mA injected current, as well as the highest 3-dB saturation output power at 20.9 dBm. According to the plot of chip gain versus wavelength, it shows 3-dB gain spectrum over 20 nm and the highest peak at 1570-nm wavelength with 500-mA injected current. In addition, the results of another QD-SOA module showed 15.4-dB Input Power Dynamic Range (IPDR), faster response time due to less pattern effect and error-free transmission of 40 Gb/s data over 20-km Single Mode Fiber (SMF) link.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

It was due to the high content of silica (SiO2) inside rice husk, burning it under the control condition provides ash with the silica content up to 97% which can be simultaneously or consequently extracted to obtain rice husk-derived silica (RHS). In order to valorize the RHS, in this study it was used as a support for zirconocene/MMAO catalyst in ethylene polymerization, compared with commercial silica (CMS). It was found that rice husk-derived silica (RHS) has a larger surface area and lower amount of impurities than CMS. After immobilizing MMAO cocatalyst onto the silicas, it was observed that both silicas exhibit good distribution of MMAO all over the particles, but RHS has a higher content of MMAO. When using both silicas in the polymerization systems, it was observed that RHS gave a higher catalytic activity to the polymerization system than CMS (202 and 150 kg pol/mol Zr h). This is due to RHS having the lower amount of impurities especially Na2O which remains only in CMS from the production of commercial silica.

Therefore, we studied the feasibility of a customized single nucleotide variant (SNV) microarray that we developed to detect disease-causing variants and copy number variation (CNV) in patients with PIDs for only 40 Euros. Methods: Probes were custom-designed to genotype 9,415 variants of 277 PID-related genes, and were added to the genome-wide Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA). Data analysis of GSA was performed using Illumina GenomeStudio 2.0, Biodiscovery Nexus 10.0, and R-3.4.4 software. Validation of genotype calling was performed by comparing the GSA with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 56 non-PID controls. DNA samples of 95 clinically diagnosed PID patients, of which 60 patients (63%) had a genetically established diagnosis (by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) PID panels or Sanger sequencing), were analyzed to test the performance of the GSA. The additional SNVs detected by GSA were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Genotype calling of the customized array had an accuracy rate of 99.7%. The sensitivity for detecting rare PID variants was high (87%). The single sample replication in two runs was high (94.9%). The customized GSA was able to generate a genetic diagnosis in 37 out of 95 patients (39%). These 37 patients included 29 patients in whom the genetic variants were confirmed by conventional methods (26 patients by SNV and 3 by CNV analysis), while in 8 patients a new genetic diagnosis was established (6 patients by SNV and 2 patients suspected for leukemia by CNV analysis). Twenty-eight patients could not be detected due to the limited coverage of the custom probes. However, the diagnostic yield can potentially be increased when newly updated variants are added. Conclusion: Our robust customized GSA seems to be a promising first-line rapid screening tool for PIDs at an affordable price, which opens opportunities for low-cost genetic testing in developing countries. The technique is scalable, allows numerous new genetic variants to be added, and offers the potential for genetic testing not only in PIDs, but also in many other genetic diseases.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Due to the increase of population, the economic growth and the urban expansion, the number of solid waste has heavily risen. However, there are still lack of an appropriated solid waste management. According to Tan Deaw soild waste survey report in 2019 (Regional Environmental Office 7 Saraburi, 2018), it revealed that Tan Deaw sub-district has been facing critical solid waste management issues. This area produced 9.41 metric tons per day, while the appropriated solid waste disposal management was less than 40 percent and residue waste remains around 2,000 MTs. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to develop learning community and public awareness towards the appropriated solid waste disposal management, including 3Rs principle, to develop the systemic solid waste management strategies with the engagement from all stakeholders, and to promote and support collaborative activities among local people in the community and the concerned stakeholders in the solid waste management. A systemic approach, through participatory action research between Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) (Checkland & Scholes, 1990; Checkland & Poulter, 2006) and Critical Systems Heuristic (CSH) (Ulrich, 1983), is a significant application for structuring the process of collecting perspective from all stakeholders, exploring the key problems of solid waste management, and finding out strategies to address the key problems in Tan-Deaw solid waste management afterwards. Root definitions and models were generated by stakeholders for two activity systems identified by them for attention: Activities promoting knowledge about solid waste sorting and a community waste bank. The findings explored the seven strategies to address Tan-Deaw solid waste management problems in two aspects. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical contributions. In terms of the theoretical contribution, the application of systemic approach conducts a significant knowledge surrounding solid waste management problem solving. Regarding the practical implication, the strategies will address the solid waste problems and barriers in the area with the cooperation of all concerned stakeholders.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

Curcumin was loaded in the liposomes and the stability of curcumin was enhanced. The gelation time of liposome-induced SF hydrogels ranged from 3 min to more than 6 h. The biological activity of liposome-SF hydrogels was evaluated in vitro using L929 fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The release of curcumin can inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Both cells cultured on the surface of the hydrogels loaded with curcumin displayed low cell survival due to the combination of low cell attachment and cytotoxicity of curcumin.

The designed framework uses the data from the Accessibility API to extract target graphical elements on application under test (AUT). The traversal technique is applied for generating the sequences of interactions on all interactable objects based on Python GUI automated scripting (SikuliX) format. In case the API is not available on some OS/Applications, the computer vision technology will then be deployed on the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) to extract the GUI elements.

A randomized trial of a pedometer-based intervention with weekly activity goals led to increased walking among dialysis patients. However, the association of participant-expressed motivations and barriers to participation and performance in such an intervention has not been determined. Methods. Thirty dialysis patients were randomized to a 12-week pedometer-based intervention with weekly step goals. Participants were asked about motivations and barriers to the increasing activity via weekly semi-scripted telephone interviews. We examined the association of these motivations and barriers with achieving weekly goals, reaching overall targets and increasing steps through multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, dialysis modality and baseline steps. Results. The most common motivations were desire to maintain/improve functional ability (30%) and activity (30%). The most common barriers were health-related (33%). Motivation to maintain/improve functional ability was associated with achieving weekly goals 17.9% more often [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7–34.2] and with a greater increase in steps (1524 steps; 95% CI 61–2989) than those lacking this motivation. Experiencing a health-related barrier was not associated with the decreased achievement of weekly goals but was associated with lower odds of reaching overall targets (odds ratio ¼ 0.06; 95% CI 0.01–0.53) and a smaller increase in steps (-1640 steps, 95% CI -3244 to -36). No patients who reported weather/environmental barriers or safety concerns reached overall targets. Conclusions. Participants who express a desire to maintain/improve functional ability may be particularly suited for activity interventions. Health-related setbacks should be met with revised goals. Reporting environmental or safety concerns may merit lowering overall targets.","genergyal, urology and nephrology, medical","Nephrology, Transplantation"

Hence, this study sought to explore the anti-adhesion activity of C. longa extract and Curcumin against Acanthamoeba triangularis trophozoites and cysts in plastic and contact lenses. Our results showed that C. longa extract and Curcumin significantly inhibited the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface, as investigated by the crystal violet assay (P < 0.05). Also, an 80–90% decrease in adhesion of trophozoites and cysts to the plastic surface was detected following the treatment with C. longa extract and Curcumin at 1/2 × MIC, compared to the control. In the contact lens model, approximately 1 log cells/mL of the trophozoites and cysts was reduced when the cells were treated with Curcumin, when compared to the control. Pre-treatment of the plastic surface with Curcumin at 1/2-MIC reduced 60% and 90% of the adhesion of trophozoites and cysts, respectively. The reduction in 1 Log cells/mL of the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites was observed when lenses were pre-treated with both the extract and Curcumin. Base on the results obtained from this study, A. triangularis trophozoites treated with C. longa extract and Curcumin have lost strong acanthopodia, thorn-like projection pseudopodia observed by scanning electron microscope. This study also revealed the therapeutic potentials of C. longa extract and Curcumin, as such, have promising anti-adhesive potential that can be used in the management/prevention of A. triangularis adhesion to contact lenses.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

The aim of this study was to produce AChE polyclonal antibody from hybrid catfish that were exposed to commercial glyphosate. The hybrid catfish was exposed to glyphosate (0.75 mL/L) for 24 h. After that, the fish brain was dissected, AChE was extracted and purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography and eluted with 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.8. This protocol gave 70% yield. Then, the brain extract was characterized using 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot probed with commercial polyclonal antibody specific to AChE (PAb-AChE). The protein, 71 kDa, was then used as an antigen to immunize mice for antibody production. The polyclonal antibody (PAb) was characterized using dot blot, Western blot and immunohistochemistry for immunolocalization of AChE in hybrid catfish exposed to glyphosate. We found that the appropriate dilution of antibody for both dot blot and Western blot was 1:3500, and 1:2500 for immunohistochemistry. Cross reactivity testing showed that PAb-AChE can be used with AChE from striped snakehead fish at the same dilution as used with AChE from hybrid catfish. It was concluded that PAb specific to hybrid catfish AChE from this work was highly specific and sensitive, and can cross-react with striped snakehead fish AChE. Thus, this polyclonal antibody may be used in monitoring glyphosate exposure in hybrid catfish and striped snakehead fish.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, pharmacology, environmental","Biochemistry, Physiology, Aquatic Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Toxicology, Cell Biology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells caused by overexpression of translation elongation factor P in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942,"Ngoennet S., Sirisattha S., Honda M., Hibino T., Kageyama H., Waditee-Sirisattha R.",2020-10-01,"Cell division process, Cellular proteins, Gene expression analysis, Molecular mechanism, Photosynthetic organisms, Protein synthesis, Synechococcus elongatus, Translation elongation, Amino Acid Motifs, Peptide Elongation Factors, Protein Biosynthesis, Synechococcus, Cyanobacteria, Elongation factor P, Hyperelongation, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942","Abstract: Translation elongation factors (EFs) are proteins that play important roles during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. In prokaryotes, at least four EFs function in repetitive reactions (EF-Tu, EF-Ts, EF-G, and EF-P). EF-P plays a vital role in the specialized translation of consecutive proline amino acid motifs. It was also recently recognized that EF-P acts throughout translation elongation. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that cell division and morphology are intimately linked to the control of EF-P in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. We constructed the overexpression of a wild-type gene product for EF-P (Synpcc7942_2565) as a tool to identify EF-P functionality. The overexpression of EF-P resulted in the morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells. During the stationary phase, EF-P overexpressors displayed cell lengths of 150 μm or longer, approximately 35 times longer than the control. Total cellular protein and amino acid content were also increased in overexpressors. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperelongation, gene expression analysis was performed. The results revealed that cell division genes, including ftn6, minD, mreB, mreC, and ftsZ, were modulated in overexpressors. Strikingly, ftn6 was severely down-regulated. Little is known regarding EF-P in prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms. Our results suggest that cyanobacterial EF-P participates in the acceleration of protein synthesis and also regulates cell division processes. These findings suggest new ways to modify translation and metabolism in cyanobacteria. Phenotypic and metabolic alterations caused by overexpressing EF-P may also be beneficial for applications such as low-cost, green molecular factories. Key points: • Cell division and cell morphology in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 are closely linked with the control of translation elongation factor P (EF-P). • Overexpression of EF-P leads to morphological plasticity in hyperelongated cells. • Cyanobacterial EF-P is involved in the acceleration of protein synthesis and the regulation of cell division processes.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; biotechnology - techniques and procedures; expression systems for foreign products; microbial, microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

TiN contents up to ~18 wt% were directly dispersed in a synthetic gel under a typical strong acidic condition. The physico-chemical characteristics and the surface properties were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), N2 adsorption-desorption, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) and CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD). The results indicated that the highly ordered mesostructured was effectively maintained with high specific surface area of 532-685 m2g-1. The basicity of the modified SBA-15 increased with rising TiN loading. These modified materials were applied as a support of Ni catalyst in dry reforming of methane (DRM). Their catalytic behavior possessed superior conversions for both CO2 and CH4 with the highest H2/CO ratio (0.83) as well as 50 % lower carbon formation, compared to bare SBA-15 support.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Transcriptomic analyses between mouse brains at 24-h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (SAE brain as evaluated by SHIRPA score) and at 120-h post-CLP (survivor) were performed to discover the SAE biomarker. Then, candidate microRNAs were validated in mouse and patient samples.As such, increased miR-370-3p in SAE mouse-brains (compared with recovery phase) was demonstrated by transcriptomic miR-profiling and was highly expressed in brain (but not other organs) of 24 h post-CLP mice. Plasma miR-370-3p also increased in CLP but was non-detectable in bilateral-nephrectomy (BiNx, a representative model of acute uremic encephalopathy) despite blood brain barrier permeability defect (determined by plasma s100β and Evan blue dye assay) in both conditions. In parallel, high plasma miR-370-3p was demonstrated in patients with SAE (but not sepsis alone or uremia) suggesting the specificity toward SAE. The association among TNF-, miR-370-3p and brain apoptosis was demonstrated by high serum TNF- and increased brain apoptosis in SAE mice, TNF- (but not other cytokines) activated miR-370-3p expression in PC-12 neuron cell, and increased cell apoptosis in miR-370-3p transfected PC-12 after incubation with TNF-.In conclusion, miR-370-3p increased in brain and plasma of SAE mice but not uremic encephalopathy. Perhaps, TNF- enhances cell susceptibility toward brain apoptosis in SAE, in part, through miR-370-3p induction in neuron. Our pilot results in patients with SAE supported the possibility that plasma miR-370-3p is an interesting SAE biomarker candidate.

Degradation of diuron in water by electrochemical advanced oxidation in a microreactor: Effects of anion contamination on degradation and toxicity,"Bumroongsakulsawat P., Khongthon W., Pavarajarn V.",2020-01-01,"Advanced oxidation, Degradation intermediates, Degradation pathways, Electrochemical advanced oxidation process, First-order rate constants, Hydroxyl radical generation, Scavenging hydroxyl radicals, Water treatment unit, Anion, Degradation, Diuron, Electrochemical advanced oxidation, Microreactor, Reaction pathway","Diuron is a toxic herbicide that has contaminated underground and surface water and caused serious problems in many countries. Diuron residues in water can be treated using electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), and microreactor EAOPs can be developed into portable water treatment units for use in contaminated areas. Up to 91 % of diuron in 10 ppm solution could be degraded within 100 s of residence time in the microreactor. Nitrates and sulfates, which are anions commonly found in natural water, retard EAOP degradation of diuron by scavenging hydroxyl radicals and suppressing hydroxyl radical generation at the anode by adsorbing to the anode surface. The apparent first-order rate constant for diuron degradation is decreased from 2.69 × 10−2 s−1 in deionized water to 1.81 × 10−2 and 1.64 × 10−2 s−1, in water containing 50 mM nitrate and 50 mM sulfate, respectively. Sulfate does not alter the diuron degradation pathway, but nitrate forms reactive species that interact with diuron and its degradation intermediates. The concentrations of intermediates increase when the EAOP is made less effective by the presence of nitrate or sulfate, but the intermediates are less toxic than diuron. At a long residence time (e.g., 100 s), EAOP treatment decreases diuron toxicity more when the water is contaminated with nitrate or sulfate than when the water is pure, under the same conditions.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Production cost analysis of plastic woven sack manufacturer,"Chunthanom T., Vilasdaechanont A.",2020-08-07,"Cost calculation, Direct labor cost, Fully integrated, Material balance, Price competition, Production process, Production structures, Unit production cost, Cost Analysis, Cost Model, Material Balance, Production Cost","The plastic woven sack industry in Thailand is increasingly growing and competitive due to a lot of operators and price competition. The accuracy of production cost is vital for decision making in management, effect to selling price and impact the organization profit. We study at a fully integrated plastic woven sack factory. The cost calculation method of the case study manufacturer currently does not reflect the actual production cost. The purpose of this study is to analyze and develop the production cost calculation method to estimate the production cost more precisely. The study begins with laying out the production structure and concepts of production cost calculation from the cost model. It consists of direct material costs, direct labor costs and production overhead costs. Direct materials costs are calculated from the material usage in the production which includes the material in product and loss of material in any of production process. The material usage along the production is analyzed and the direct material cost is calculated under the material balance concept, which is different from the traditional calculation method that does not considered the material loss in the production. The proposed calculation method for direct labor cost is set to reflect an actual labor cost of the production, while in the traditional method, labor cost is counted in the overhead cost. Production overhead costs proposed in this study are different from the traditional calculation methods by considering all of overheads in the model. The result of the study shows that the traditional method overestimates the unit production cost. The cost difference between both methods is around 10 percent. An average direct material cost of the proposed method is higher than the traditional method by 7 percent as the material loss occurred in the production process is included. Since direct labor cost is not considered separately and counted in overhead cost in the traditional method, we analyses them together. According to the analysis, we find that they are overestimated in traditional method for 27 percent.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"
Estimation of hybrid jig separation efficiency using a modified concentration criterion based on apparent densities of plastic particles with attached bubbles,"Ito M., Saito A., Murase N., Phengsaart T., Kimura S., Kitajima N., Takeuchi M., Tabelin C.B., Hiroyoshi N.",2020-11-01,"Apparent density, Crosslinked polyethylene, Measurement apparatus, Particle surface, Plastic particle, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Separation efficiency, Surface wettability, Attached-bubble volume, Hybrid jig, Jig, Plastic separation, Recycling","The hybrid jig, which combines the principles of jig separation and flotation, was recently developed to separate mixed-plastics with similar specific gravities (SG) effectively. In this type of jig, air bubbles are introduced during water pulsation to modify the apparent SG (SGapparent) of plastics by the attachment of air bubbles to the particles so that the hybrid jig can separate materials having identical SGs if their surface wettabilities are different. Because the change in SGapparent—determined by the volume of attached bubbles on the particle surface—is critical for efficient separation in hybrid jigs, a method to estimate this parameter should be developed. In this study, a laser-assisted measurement apparatus was developed to quantify the attached-bubble volume on plastics during water pulsation. Hybrid jig separation was also conducted using three mixtures containing plastics of almost identical SGs: (i) polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET), (ii) polypropylene with glass fiber (PPGF)/high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and (iii) cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE)/polyethylene (PE). Finally, to estimate the separation efficiency of hybrid jig, a new index called the apparent concentration criterion (CCapparent) is proposed. The results showed that SGapparent and CCapparent calculated using the proposed methods could be used to estimate the hybrid jig separation efficiency.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

Of these, the merozoite surface protein 3 of P. vivax (PvMSP3) is an attractive vaccine target as well as a genetic marker for epidemiological surveillance. PvMSP3 comprises a group of protein members encoded by a multigene family. Although some protein members, i.e. PvMSP3α and PvMSP3β, have been targets for molecular and immunological investigations, the most abundantly expressed protein member during late asexual erythrocytic stages, PvMSP3F2 (PVX_97710), remains unexplored. To address domain organization and evolution of this locus, the complete coding sequences of 31 P. vivax isolates from diverse malaria endemic areas of Thailand were analyzed and compared with 10 previously reported sequences. Results revealed that all PvMSP3F2 sequences differed but could be divided into 5 repeat-containing domains flanked by 6 non-repeat domains. Repeat domains II and IV at the 5′ portion and domain X at the 3′ portion exhibited extensive sequence and length variation whereas repeat domains VI and VIII located at the central region were relatively conserved. Despite a repertoire of PvMSP3F2 variants, predicted coiled-coil tertiary structure and predicted B-cell epitopes seem to be maintained. Evidence of intragenic recombination has been detected among field isolates in Thailand that could enhance sequence diversity at this locus. Non-repeat domains I and IX located at the 5′ end and at the 3′ portion, respectively, seem to have evolved under purifying selection. Evidence of positive selection was found in non-repeat domains III, V and VII where a number of predicted HLA class I epitopes were identified. Amino acid substitutions in these predicted epitopes could alter predicted peptide binding affinity or abolish peptide epitope property, suggesting that polymorphism in these epitopes conferred host immune evasion. Further studies on PvMSP3F2 are warranted, particularly on interaction with host immune system and the potential role of this PvMSP3 protein member as a vaccine target.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The AgNP was first synthesized by reacting silver nitrate with sodium citrate as a reducing agent in an aqueous solution. Then, the UV-vis spectrometry and transmission emission microscopy were used to follow the reaction forming AgNP and the optimum reaction time was found at about 20 minutes. The latex mixing of NR and CNT-AgNP hybrid filler was eventually performed. It was also found that the CNT-AgNP hybrid filler enhanced various properties of the NR composites, including torque difference, storage modulus, and initial modulus (from temperature scanning stress relaxation test) as compared to the conventional NR-CNT composite. Furthermore, higher electrical conductivity with comparatively low percolation threshold of the hybrid composites was found as compared to the NR-CNT composite. This might be due to decoration of AgNP particles on CNT surfaces or between CNT bundles caused hindering CNT agglomeration and facilitating electron tunneling. Also, CNT network formation the NR hybrid composite was stronger than in the NR-CNT composite. Furthermore, strong infinite CNT network formation increased thermal diffusion in the NR-CNT/AgNP hybrid composite.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Ceramics and Composites, Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

DTS likely share some mechanisms with nontremulous dystonia, and there may also be overlaps with essential tremor (ET). We studied 21 ET (8 females, 13 males) and 22 DTS human patients (10 females, 12 males), including 13 human patients with DT (writer’s cramp with writing tremor) and 9 human patients with tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD; cervical dystonia with hand tremor). Tremors were analyzed using accelerometry and surface EMG of the antagonist pairs of arm muscles during posture, simple kinetic movement, and writing. Cerebellar inhibition was performed to assess cerebello-thalamo-cortical involvement. DT exhibited higher variability of peak frequency and greater instability of tremor burst intervals over time (higher tremor stability index) than ET or TAWD regardless of tasks. Intermuscular coherence magnitude between the antagonist pairs increased during the writing task in DT, but not ET or TAWD. ET and TAWD exhibited different phase relationships of the temporal fluctuations of voluntary movement and tremor in the kinetic condition. A linear discriminant classifier based on these tremor parameters was able to distinguish the three groups with a classification accuracy of 95.1%. Cerebellar inhibition was significantly reduced in DT, but not in TAWD, compared with ET and healthy controls. Our study shows that the two DTS are distinct entities with DT closer to nontremorous dystonia and TAWD closer to ET.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology, medical",Medicine (all)

The prototype differs from the already existing indirect cooling systems by using a modified cutting insert that allows a larger volume of cryogenic fluid to flow under the cutting zone. For designing the prototype analytical and finite element, thermal calculations were performed; this enabled to optimize the heat evacuation of the tool from the rake face without altering the stress distribution on the insert when cutting material. Turning experiments on ASTM F-1537 CoCr alloys were performed under different cutting conditions and employing indirect cryogenic cooling and dry machining, to test the performance of the developed system. The results showed that the new system improved surface roughness by 12%, and cutting forces were also reduced by 12% when compared with the existing indirect cryogenic cooling technique.","heat exchange, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Software, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The data was serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission. Patients were diagnosed by the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI. We used AKI occurrence as the primary outcome and explored risk factors on the development and outcomes of AKI. Results: We enrolled 1480 patients from 5 ICU centers across Laos from January to December 2016. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 508 of the 1460 enrolled patients (34.8%). Overall, the rates of maximum AKI staging were 4% for stage 1, 10.3% for stage 2, and 20.5% for stage 3. Risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, oncologic diseases, and chronic kidney diseases.

VD deficiency is associated with liver fibrosis progression. Metabolic dysfunction of the liver, as an intermediate organ for VD metabolism, contributes partly to this deficiency. We hypothesized that improving hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients after eradication with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) would increase 25-hydroxyVD [25(OH)VD] levels. Methods: Eighty CHC patients (17 chronic hepatitis, and 63 cirrhosis) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, hepatitis C viral load (VL), genotypes, liver enzymes and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) were assessed at baseline. Blood samples for 25(OH)VD and the procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) were collected at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks. LSMs were re-evaluated at 48 weeks. Serum 25(OH)VD levels < 30 ng/mL were defined as VD insufficiency/deficiency. Paired t-tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: Among 80 patients, the mean age was 57.7 ± 10.5 years, and 52.5% were men. The mean VL was 6.1 ± 0.7 logIU/mL with genotype 1 predominance (55%). All patients achieved sustained virological response. The alanine aminotransferase levels decreased from 79.9 ± 53.3 U/L at baseline to 25.7 ± 17.2 and 22.3 ± 11.0 U/L at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean LSM decreased from 19.2 ± 15.3 to 11.7 ± 8.0 kPa at 48 weeks (p < 0.001). The P3NP levels decreased from 43.6 ± 22.0 ng/mL before treatment to 35.7 ± 21.1 and 29.4 ± 15.0 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). The proportions of VD insufficiency/deficiency were 72.5%, 91.3%, and 86.5% at baseline, 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. The 25(OH)VD levels decreased from 26.3 ± 10.7 ng/mL at baseline to 20.8 ± 8.1 and 20.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Curative treatment with DAA attenuated the liver stiffness and inflammation but did not improve VD levels. Over 80% of patients remained VD insufficient/deficient.

Mechanical properties of natural hydroxyapatite using low cold compaction pressure: Effect of sintering temperature,"Obada D.O., Dauda E.T., Abifarin J.K., Dodoo-Arhin D., Bansod N.D.",2020-01-01,"Animal bones, Fluorapatites, Pore shape, Powder defects, Sinterability, Animal bones, Compaction, Fluorapatite, Pore shapes, Powder defects, Sinterability","This study describes the effect of sintering temperature on the microstructural, calcium/phosphorus (Ca/P) ion ratios and mechanical properties of non-separated biowastes processed hydroxyapatite (HAp) prepared through a low cold compaction protocol. The HAp was produced by a sintering temperature of 900 °C. Furthermore, HAp sintered at 900 °C was subjected to sintering temperatures of 1000 and 1100 °C.The structural and morphological evolution of the fabricated biomaterials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) respectively. Uniaxial compaction using a pressure of 500 pa was used to produce rectangular shaped pellets to investigate the influence of sintering temperature on the mechanical properties of the produced pellets. From XRD analysis, it was found that hydroxyapatite derived from the biowastes showed good thermal stability and did not exhibit phase instability with traces of other calcium phosphates. The SEM micrographs showed microporous structure of the biomaterials and an increase in temperature reduced the porosity and enhanced the mechanical properties. It was also noticed that the trend of transformation of the average shape of pores was from strongly flattened to round at higher sintering temperatures. Electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) revealed that the atomic Ca/P ratios of the as-sintered HAp specimens ranged from 1.58 to 1.79 for sintering temperatures of 900–1100 °C. The synthesized hydroxyapatite powder showed inclusion of the fluorapatite phase at sintering temperature of 1000 °C with a reduction in the crystallite size. For both scenarios (sintering temperature and compaction pressure), a consistent trend in mechanical properties (microhardness, fracture toughness and Young's modulus) is noticed at every point of measurement except for compressive strength. The reduction in compressive strength when compaction pressure was applied could be as a result of the stress induced in the HAp powders during compaction which may have made it more susceptible to cracks. The hardness value obtained for the synthesized hydroxyapatite pellets is in the range of that of actual human femoral cortical bone.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

In 2019, the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research (ISNPR) developed the first practice guidelines for n-3 PUFA treatment of MDD. To strengthen these guidelines and enhance their clinical applicability, we synthesized the evidence and clinical experiences previously obtained through the Delphi methodology. Methods: Nineteen statements covering five major domains in MDD treatment were formulated through internal meetings. Fourteen international experts were invited to participate in the web-based Delphi process that validated the statements. Likert scales were used, and consensus level was set at 7.0/10.0, with the equivocal level set at 5.1–6.9. The items with scores < 5.0 were allocated into a second round Delphi survey with inverse questions. Results: All panelists completed the survey. Sixteen statements reached consensus, and the statement “n-3 PUFAs are one of the potential adjunctive treatments for adult MDD” reached the highest agreement. “N-3 PUFAs are one of the potential monotherapies for adult MDD” instead scored lowest. Regarding “special populations,” many items, reached high consensus despite sub-optimal supportive evidence. Limitation: The panelists had a specialized interest in n-3 PUFAs; focus was placed on clinical issues rather than on biological mechanisms.

Robust optimization approach is proposed to model the power price uncertainty and obtain the optimal bidding curves of IPL for each hour in order to submit to the power market. Using the provided optimal bidding curves, system operator can get required power to satisfy demand of the system with economical price under power price uncertainty. Optimal scheduling of each component of the system is studied in three different strategies as optimistic, deterministic, and pessimistic to consider all possible cases raised by the power price uncertainty. Each strategy has been solved in two cases as with and without demand response program (DRP). The applied DRP has reduced system operating cost through flattening the load curve. By comparing ROA results with the deterministic case, the total operating cost of the system is decreased from $1029 to $995 about 17.85% decrease while in pessimistic strategy, it is increased from $1209 to $1333 indicating about 9.85% increase. The problem has been solved using GAMS optimization software with the CPLEX solver.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Myostatin inhibition in combination with antisense oligonucleotide therapy improves outcomes in spinal muscular atrophy,"Zhou H., Meng J., Malerba A., Catapano F., Sintusek P., Jarmin S., Feng L., Lu-Nguyen N., Sun L., Mariot V., Dumonceaux J., Morgan J.E., Gissen P., Dickson G., Muntoni F.",2020-06-01,"Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Female, Humans, Mice, Mice, Transgenic, Muscular Atrophy, Spinal, Myostatin, Oligonucleotides, Antisense, Survival Analysis, Treatment Outcome, Adeno-associated virus, Antisense oligonucleotide, Combinatorial therapy, Myostatin inhibition, Myostatin propeptide, Spinal muscular atrophy, Survival of motor neuron 1 gene","Background: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by genetic defects in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that lead to SMN deficiency. Different SMN-restoring therapies substantially prolong survival and function in transgenic mice of SMA. However, these therapies do not entirely prevent muscle atrophy and restore function completely. To further improve the outcome, we explored the potential of a combinatorial therapy by modulating SMN production and muscle-enhancing approach as a novel therapeutic strategy for SMA. Methods: The experiments were performed in a mouse model of severe SMA. A previously reported 25-mer morpholino antisense oligomer PMO25 was used to restore SMN expression. The adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of myostatin propeptide was used to block the myostatin pathway. Newborn SMA mice were treated with a single subcutaneous injection of 40 μg/g (therapeutic dose) or 10 μg/g (low-dose) PMO25 on its own or together with systemic delivery of a single dose of adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of myostatin propeptide. The multiple effects of myostatin inhibition on survival, skeletal muscle phenotype, motor function, neuromuscular junction maturation, and proprioceptive afferences were evaluated. Results: We show that myostatin inhibition acts synergistically with SMN-restoring antisense therapy in SMA mice treated with the higher therapeutic dose PMO25 (40 μg/g), by increasing not only body weight (21% increase in male mice at Day 40), muscle mass (38% increase), and fibre size (35% increase in tibialis anterior muscle in 3 month female SMA mice), but also motor function and physical performance as measured in hanging wire test (two-fold increase in time score) and treadmill exercise test (two-fold increase in running distance). In SMA mice treated with low-dose PMO25 (10 μg/g), the early application of myostatin inhibition prolongs survival (40% increase), improves neuromuscular junction maturation (50% increase) and innervation (30% increase), and increases both the size of sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (60% increase) and the preservation of proprioceptive synapses in the spinal cord (30% increase). Conclusions: These data suggest that myostatin inhibition, in addition to the well-known effect on muscle mass, can also positively influence the sensory neural circuits that may enhance motor neurons function. While the availability of the antisense drug Spinraza for SMA and other SMN-enhancing therapies has provided unprecedented improvement in SMA patients, there are still unmet needs in these patients. Our study provides further rationale for considering myostatin inhibitors as a therapeutic intervention in SMA patients, in combination with SMN-restoring drugs.",medical,"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Physiology (medical)"
Double heterozygous variants in FBN1 and FBN2 in a Thai woman with Marfan and Beals syndromes,"Phokaew C., Sittiwangkul R., Suphapeetiporn K., Shotelersuk V.",2020-09-01,"Adult, Arachnodactyly, Contracture, Female, Fibrillin-1, Fibrillin-2, Heterozygote, Humans, Marfan Syndrome, Mutation, Beals syndrome, Congenital contractural arachnodactyly, Dual diagnosis, Exome sequencing, Marfan syndrome, Two mendelian diseases","A phenotype of an individual is resulted from an interaction among variants in several genes. Advanced molecular technologies allow us to identify more patients with mutations in more than one genes. Here, we studied a Thai woman with combined clinical features of Marfan (MFS) and Beals (BS) syndromes including frontal bossing, enophthalmos, myopia, the crumpled appearance to the top of the pinnae, midface hypoplasia, high arched palate, dermal stretch marks, aortic enlargement, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, aortic root dilatation, and progressive scoliosis. The aortic root enlargement was progressive to a diameter of 7.2 cm requiring an aortic root replacement at the age of 8 years. At her last visit when she was 19 years old, she had moderate aortic regurgitation. Exome sequencing revealed that she carried the c.3159C > G (p.Cys1053Trp) in exon 26 of FBN1 and c.2638G > A (p. Gly880Ser) in exon 20 of FBN2. The variant in FBN1 was de novo, while that in FBN2 was inherited from her unaffected mother. Both genes encode for fibrillins, which are essential for elastic fibers and can form the heterotypic microfibrils. Two defective fibrillins may synergistically worsen cardiovascular manifestations seen in our patient. In this study, we identified the fourth patient with both MFS and BS, carrying mutations in both FBN1 and FBN2.","genetics and molecular biology; eukaryotic genetics; medicalcal genetics; gene mutations, human genetics, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

The catalyst exhibits excellent selectivity to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, which is attributed to the tandem reactions of methanol synthesis on the Pd/SiO2 core catalyst and methanol dehydration to hydrocarbons on the H-ZSM-5 shell. The Pd/SiO2–SZ capsule catalyst has a similar mesoporous structure, narrow range of Pd particles size distribution, and consistent reduction characteristics to the Pd/SiO2 core catalyst. It maintains the physical and chemical properties of the core catalyst throughout the H-ZSM-5 shell synthesis process. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that the H-ZSM-5 zeolite shell completely encapsulates the Pd/SiO2 core catalyst. Compared with the crushed capsule catalyst (Pd/SiO2–SZP), the well-defined-structured Pd/SiO2–SZ catalyst has a much higher LPG selectivity of 33.6 %, owing to the well-matched reactions at the Pd/SiO2 core and H-ZSM-5 shell.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, Materials Science, energy","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Energy (all)"

The study evaluated 140 MS patients at admission (T0), and eight (T8) and 16 months (T16) later. The Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) and biomarkers were determined at T0, T8, and T16. A DP index (DPI) defined as an increase of ≥1 rank on the EDSS score indicated that 39.3% of the patients had significant DP. Quantification of the ordinal EDSS rank score was performed using optimal scaling methods. Categorical regression showed that the quantitative T16 EDSS score was predicted by T0 homocysteine (Hcy), T0 parathormone (PTH), T0 advanced oxidized protein products (AOPP) (all positively), low T0 vitamin D (<18.3 ng/mL) and T8 folic acid (<5 ng/mL) concentrations while higher T8 calcium concentrations (≥8.90 mg/dL) had protective effects. Linear Mixed Models showed that the change in EDSS from T0 to T16 was significantly associated with changes in IL-17 (positively) and IL-4 (inversely) independently from the significant effects of clinical MS forms, treatment modalities, smoking, age and systemic arterial hypertension. Hcy, PTH, IL-6, and IL-4 were positively associated with progressive versus relapsing-remitting MS while 25(OH)D was inversely associated. In conclusion, the ordinal EDSS scale is an adequate instrument to assess DP after category value estestimation. Aberrations in immune-inflammatory, metabolic and hormonal biomarkers are associated with DP and with the progressive form of MS.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

However, earthquakes were reported and felt by local people around 25 years ago. Using probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), this research evaluates the seismic hazard in the Northeast region of Thailand to be the database for seismic design. The seismic hazard is expressed in the term of peak ground acceleration (PGA) at base rock level. The crustal faults and earthquake events are considered as the seismic source in this evaluation. Two crustal faults are evaluated in Thakhaek fault and Phetchabun fault, which have not been considered before in PSHA. Earthquake events are classified into two types: background seismicity zones and subduction zones. The results reveal that the highest peak ground acceleration at base rock level is in Bueng Kan province and Nakhon Phanom province. The evaluated seismic hazard in the Northeast region is approximately 30% g and 12% g with a return period of 2,475 years and 475 years, respectively. Results obtained from this study are about two times higher than the Earthquake Resistant Design code 1302 of Thailand. The evaluated seismic hazard is higher than the peak ground accelerations that can cause damage to building structures (>3.9% g).","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

We hypothesized that a part of nt-cirDNA release from CD3 or CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could have clinical implications. Method: To investigate the feasibility of T-cell-derived circulating DNA (T-cirDNA) detection, real-time PCR with Taqman assay-specific rearranged TCRβ CDR3 region was conducted in plasma of 103 advanced NSCLC. CD3 and CD8-specific immunohistochemistry from biopsy specimen, was reviewed by one blinded pathologist to the T-cirDNA results. Prognostic impact including demographic characteristics was integrated into the model. Results: Circulating DNA was detectable in 100 patients with median of 4 ng ml−1, while median of plasma T-cirDNA was 1.71 pg ml−1. Median %ratio of T-cirDNA/cirDNA was 0.02%. T-cirDNA was categorized by %ratio of T-cirDNA/cirDNA as undetectable, low (≤ 1%) and high (> 1%). Paradoxical prognostic impact of T-cirDNA/cirDNA was observed. Undetectable and high T-cirDNA/cirDNA translated to independent favorable prognostic outcome, HR of 0.54 [95% CI 0.30–0.96] and 0.41 [95% CI 0.21–0.80], respectively. 43 patients were assessed for CD3/CD8 TILs and PD-L1. High intratumoral CD3/CD8 TILs but not stromal CD3 TILs was correlated with high T-cirDNA/cirDNA representing active T-lymphocyte activity to eliminate cancer cells. While the prognosis of undetectable T-cirDNA/cirDNA, represents inactivated naïve T-cell, was determined by the presence of EGFR mutation and had long durable response of EGFR inhibitors. Conclusion: T-cirDNA could be a novel biomarker representing adaptive immune resistance in NSCLC patients. Further exploration as a predictive biomarker for EGFR inhibitors in setting of EGFR mutation might be warranted.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"

Here, we describe a 2-month-old female infant with features of Cushing's syndrome without café au lait spots, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and clinical evidence of other endocrine hyperfunction. Investigations demonstrated adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome with bilateral adrenal gland enlargement. Whole-exome sequencing of leukocytes identified a de novo heterozygous novel missense mutation (c.521G>A, p.Cys174Tyr) in the GNAS gene. The patient experienced clinical improvement of Cushing's syndrome during ketoconazole treatment. Her clinical course was complicated by Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. She also had shortened activated partial thromboplastin time indicating a hypercoagulable state and resulting in pulmonary embolism. She eventually manifested gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty at the age of 13 months after ketoco-nazole was discontinued.

IMD cases are often reported throughout the region, but the disease is not notifiable in some countries, including Myanmar, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Although there remains a paucity of data from many countries, specific nations have introduced additional surveillance measures. The incidence of IMD is low and similar across the represented countries (<0.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year), with the predominant serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis being B, W and Y, although serogroups A and X are present in some areas. Resistance to ciprofloxacin is also of concern, with the close monitoring of antibiotic-resistant clonal complexes (e.g., cc4821) being a priority. Meningococcal vaccination is only included in a few National Immunization Programs, but is recommended for high-risk groups, including travellers (such as pilgrims) and people with complement deficiencies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Both polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines form part of recommendations. However, cost and misconceptions remain limiting factors in vaccine uptake, despite conjugate vaccines preventing the acquisition of carriage.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary bacteriology, medical","Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

The investigation focused on the effects of fire exposure condition and the presence of internal steel reinforcements on the effective bond length, failure mode, bond strength (maximum joint load) and interfacial fracture energy. After being air-cooled, the concrete prisms were adhesively bonded with CFRP strips of different lengths, and then quasi-static tested at the ambient condition. The pull-off test results showed that the tensile strength of concrete substrate decreased after being exposed to elevated temperatures. Such deterioration of concrete substrate caused an increase in the effective bond length. It also decreased the bond strength and interfacial fracture energy. The steel reinforcements in concrete structures are beneficial as they minimize the effect of fire exposure on bond strength and effective bond length. An application of the fracture mechanics-based model for strength prediction of bond between fire-damaged concrete and the CFRP plate is proposed. A linear relationship between interfacial fracture energy and pull-off tensile strength of concrete could be assumed for the unreinforced concrete.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

An individual who is susceptible to EV-A71 may also be infected asymptomatically, thus, a serological assay is a useful tool to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection in the community and to provide guidance for vaccination scheduling. There have been several candidate EV-A71 vaccines, of which three have been approved and licensed in China. The population target for EV-A71 vaccine is children younger than three years of age. In Thailand, there are limited data available on the seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing (NT) antibodies and the timing of seroconversion in children. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence and seroconversion rate of EV-A71 NT antibody in a cohort of Thai children. Sera were collected at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand from 100 children between 2015 and 2020. Maternal sera were collected on the day of delivery.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database to identify randomized-controlled trials which compared the effectiveness between all antidiabetic agents apart from insulin regarding all aspects of renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Random effect model was utilized to compute for hazard ratio. Results: Nineteen articles with 140,851 participants were included in this meta-analysis. When compared with placebo, SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors exhibited significantly lower hazard ratios of progression of albuminuria. SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors showed a significantly higher hazard ratio of regression of albuminuria. Only SGLT-2 inhibitors illustrated significantly lower hazard ratios of doubling of serum creatinine and incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT). A significantly lower hazard ratio of composite renal outcome was detected in both SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists. A significantly lower hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was identified in SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonist. Furthermore, a significantly lower hazard ratio of cardiovascular mortality was found in both SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists. Conclusion: Comparing across all antidiabetic agents apart from insulin, SGLT-2 inhibitors provided extensively renoprotective effects among diabetic patients as well as reduced hazard ratios of heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality.

In addition, each layer of the multi-layered half-space is governed by Biot’s theory of poroelastodynamics. The contact surface between the foundation and the layered half-space is smooth, and either fully permeable or impermeable. This dynamic interaction problem is studied by employing a discretization technique and an exact stiffness matrix scheme. Comparisons with existing solutions on rocking vibrations of rigid foundations on elastic and poroelastic media are shown to verify the accuracy of the present scheme. Selected numerical results on rocking compliances of rigid foundations of various shapes and mudmat foundations are presented. In addition, a dynamic interaction problem involving closely spaced foundations under rocking vibrations is also presented to demonstrate the applicability of the present solution scheme.","fluidex; related topics, influence of dynamic loads, earth sciences, engineering","Oceanography, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Ocean Engineering"
Evaluation of vacuum phenomenon in dogs with coxofemoral degenerative joint disease using computed tomography,"Kanthavichit K., Klaengkaew A., Srisowanna N., Chaivoravitsakul N., Horoongruang K., Thanaboonnipat C., Soontornvipart K., Choisunirachon N.",2020-08-06,"Animals, Dog Diseases, Dogs, Female, Hip Joint, Male, Retrospective Studies, Species Specificity, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, computed tomography, degenerative joint disease, dog, hip, vacuum phenomenon","Background: Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is a common orthopedic lesion in the coxofemoral joint of canine patients. Concurrent with the sign of degeneration, the vacuum phenomenon (VP), or intra-articular gas, has been observed in several locations in both human and canine patients. A cadaveric study described VP in small breed dogs without DJD but with hip laxity. However, none of the canine VP reports mentioned coxofemoral DJD. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study was to describe the distribution of coxofemoral VP revealed on computed tomography (CT) imaging in canine patients with DJD. Results: A total of 282 dogs (564 coxofemoral joints), comprising 142 small, 85 large, and 55 medium breeds, were included in the present study. DJD was found in 31.02% of all dogs. The incidence of DJD was highest in large breed dogs (50%), followed by medium (31.81%) and small (19.36%) breed dogs. In addition, VP was detected with CT using the pulmonary window in 31 joints of 25 dogs that received a diagnosis of hip degenerative disease. VP was found most frequently at the laterodorsal area of the acetabulum. The incidences of VP in large, small, and medium breed dogs were 35.94%, 17.14% and 8.33%, respectively. The presence of coxofemoral VP was significantly and positively correlated with DJD (odds ratio = 17.58, 95% CI 2.32-133.42). Conclusions: The presence of coxofemoral joint DJD and VP was more likely to be detected in large breed dogs, especially in those with established DJD. CT is an advanced diagnostic imaging modality that can be used to reveal VP lesions, most of which are reported at the laterodorsal acetabulum. Further studies, including comparisons of different patient positions, may reveal more information regarding coxofemoral VP.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

The anti-inflammatory Plai extract was chosen as both an active ingredient and an oil phase of the system. Compared with chitosan-coated nanoemulsion (NE2-CS) and uncoated nanoemulsion (NE1), the QCS coating could improve the stability of the Plai extract during 28 days. The particle size of NE1 increased from 141 nm to 202 nm after coating with QCS, whereas zeta potential changed from -22.03 mV for NE1 to 20.23 mV for NE2-QCS, confirming the presence of QCS. A clear improvement in anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and transdermal properties of Plai extract was verified for NE2-QCS, which could be due to the NEs’ fineness and the permanent positive charge of the protective layer. Therefore, we suggested that QCS-coated NEs can be used as an effective transdermal delivery system for lipophilic active components.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

However, little is known about the burden of disease, and data on infective endocarditis incidence are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of infective endocarditis in TAVR by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.MethodsWe comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to October 2019. Included studies were prospective or retrospective cohort studies that reported the event rate of infective endocarditis in patients who underwent TAVR. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects method to calculate pooled incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).ResultsA total of 30 studies consisting of 73780 patients undergoing TAVR were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled estimated incidence of infective endocarditis following TAVR was 7 in 1000 patients (95% CI: 0.5-1%). For early infective endocarditis, the pooled estimated incidence was 8 per 1000 patients (95% CI: 0.5-1.1%). For late infective endocarditis, the pooled estimated incidence was 2 in 1000 patients (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Significantly, the overall pooled infective endocarditis mortality rate was 39% (95% CI: 28.7-49.4%).ConclusionThe current study demonstrates the incidence of overall, early, and late infective endocarditis following TAVR, ranging from 2 to 8 per 1000 patients. Although it remains a rare event, infective endocarditis following TAVR is associated with high mortality.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine

Therefore they can be utilized hybrid thermal and electrical energy systems to procure their required energy. In the proposed system, in order to supply residential loads, a hybrid energy system (HES) is proposed which consists of photovoltaic/solid oxide fuel cell/thermal and electrical storages/boiler. Also, the uncertain parameters such as thermal and electrical loads, electricity market price, and solar irradiation are considered in the stochastic formulation. Uncertain parameters can be led to financial risks in the system operation. In order to measure imposed risks, in this paper, a novel risk management method called downside risk constraints method is used to model the financial risks imposed from the uncertain parameters. According to obtained results, the operator of the hybrid energy system by utilization of the downside risk constraints method has obtained a strategy that is scenario independent. In other words, the downside risk constraints method by minimizing the imposed risks introduced a zero-risk strategy which operation cost would not increase by changing the scenario. Results are shown that system operators by paying 1.3% more expected cost ($ 40.22 instead of $ 39.69), can make its operation independent of the scenario. Also, risk-based operational strategies of the proposed hybrid energy system are reported in the results as graphical results. The proposed risk-measurement operation problem of the designed hybrid energy system is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and modeled by GAMS software using CPLEX solver.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The present study delineated the neuroimmune fingerprint of MNP by analyzing plasma levels of IL-1β, sIL-1RA, TNFα, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, CCL2, and CCL11 in 120 MNP versus 54 healthy controls in association with neurocognitive scores (as assessed with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia) and PHEMN (psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative) symptoms. MNP was best predicted by a combination of CCL11, TNFα, IL-1β, and sIL-1RA which yielded a bootstrapped (n = 2000) area under the receiver operating curve of 0.985. Composite scores reflecting M1 macrophage activity and neurotoxic potential including effects of CCL11 and CCL2 were significantly increased in MNP. A large part of the variance in PHEM (38.4–52.6%) and negative (65.8–74.4%) symptoms were explained by combinations of immune markers whereby CCL11 was the most important. The same markers explained a large part of the variance in the Mini-Mental State examination, list learning, digit sequencing task, category instances, controlled word association, symbol coding, and Tower of London. Partial least squares analysis showed that 72.7% of the variance in overall severity of schizophrenia was explained by the regression on IL-1β, sIL-1RA, CCL11, TNFα, and education. It is concluded that the combination of the abovementioned markers defines MNP as a distinct neuroimmune disorder and that increased immune neurotoxicity determines memory and executive impairments and PHEMN symptoms as well.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

An operational experiment on a pilot facility in Bangkok and a simulation over a three-year GSHP operation were conducted. As a result of the operational experiment and simulation, the proposed operational condition was that the 90th percentile value of the hourly heat pump (HP) inlet temperature did not exceed 50C above that of the hourly annual ambient temperature during the third year of operation. When a GSHP designed based on this condition was utilized for a small government building, the required number of boreholes were 24, 4, and 3 for air-conditioned areas of 200, 40, and 25 m2, respectively, which achieved 40% energy savings. Thus, a small-scale GSHP in Bangkok designed based on the proposed condition can achieve high effciency within space limitations.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, process equipment, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Eight ensemble members, representing a subset of archived CORDEX-SEA simulations at 25 km spatial resolution, were examined for emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The study utilised four different indicators of rainfall extreme, i.e. the annual/seasonal rainfall total (PRCPTOT), consecutive dry days (CDD), frequency of extremely heavy rainfall (R50mm) and annual/seasonal maximum of daily rainfall (RX1day). In general, changes in extreme indices are more pronounced and covering wider area under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. The decrease in annual PRCPTOT is projected over most of SEA region, except for Myanmar and Northern Thailand, with magnitude as much as 20% (30%) under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. The most significant and robust changes were noted in CDD, which is projected to increase by as much as 30% under RCP4.5 and 60% under RCP8.5, particularly over Maritime Continent (MC). The projected decrease in PRCPTOT over MC is significant and robust during June to August (JJA) and September to November (SON). During March to May (MAM) under RCP8.5, significant and robust PRCPTOT decreases are also projected over Indochina. The CDD changes during JJA and SON over MC are even higher, more robust and significant compared to the annual changes. At the same time, a wetting tendency is also projected over Indochina.

The fibers were firstly fabricated into titania(polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP)/PAN core/sheath fibers. Upon the calcination of the as-synthesized fibers, PVP within the sheath of the fibers was removed, while titania crystalized to photoactive anatase phase. Increasing the calcination temperature resulted in decrease in the fraction of anatase phase within of the sheath fibers and a decrease in the diameter of the PAN core fibers. The optimum calcination temperature is needed to ensure complete removal of PVP, yet PAN remains as the core of the fibers. The tensile tests were applied to ensure that the calcined fibers were still flexible.

One of flu pandemic types is influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (pdm09H1N1). Oseltamivir is the antiviral drug used to treat influenza targeting at neuraminidase (NA) located on the viral surface. Influenza virus undergoes high mutation rates and leads to drug resistance, and thus the development of more efficient drugs is required. In the present study, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were applied to understand the oseltamivir resistance caused by the single E119D and double E119D/H274Y mutations on NA. The obtained results in terms of binding free energy and intermolecular interactions in the ligand–protein interface showed that the oseltamivir could not be well accommodated in the binding pocket of both NA mutants and the 150-loop moves out from oseltamivir as an “open” state. A greater number of water molecules accessible to the binding pocket could disrupt the oseltamivir binding with NA target as seen be high mobility of oseltamivir at the active site. Additionally, our finding could guide to the design and development of novel NA inhibitor drugs.

KITSUNE: A Tool for Identifying Empirically Optimal K-mer Length for Alignment-Free Phylogenomic Analysis,"Pornputtapong N., Acheampong D.A., Patumcharoenpol P., Jenjaroenpun P., Wongsurawat T., Jun S.-R., Yongkiettrakul S., Chokesajjawatee N., Nookaew I.",2020-09-23,"Optimal resolution, Phylogenetic relationships, Phylogenetic tree inference, Species identification, Species specifics, Three-step approach, Unique identifiers, Whole genome sequences, alignment-free, comparative genomics, k-mer, phylogenomics, species identification","Genomic DNA is the best “unique identifier” for organisms. Alignment-free phylogenomic analysis, simple, fast, and efficient method to compare genome sequences, relies on looking at the distribution of small DNA sequence of a particular length, referred to as k-mer. The k-mer approach has been explored as a basis for sequence analysis applications, including assembly, phylogenetic tree inference, and classification. Although this approach is not novel, selecting the appropriate k-mer length to obtain the optimal resolution is rather arbitrary. However, it is a very important parameter for achieving the appropriate resolution for genome/sequence distances to infer biologically meaningful phylogenetic relationships. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach to identify the appropriate k-mer from whole-genome sequences. We present K-mer–length Iterative Selection for UNbiased Ecophylogenomics (KITSUNE), a tool for assessing the empirically optimal k-mer length of any given set of genomes of interest for phylogenomic analysis via a three-step approach based on (1) cumulative relative entropy (CRE), (2) average number of common features (ACF), and (3) observed common features (OCF). Using KITSUNE, we demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of these measurements to obtain empirically optimal k-mer lengths of 11, 17, and ∼34 from large genome datasets of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated a feature of KITSUNE for accurate species identification for the two de novo assembled bacterial genomes derived from error-prone long-reads sequences, and for a published yeast genome. In addition, KITSUNE was used to identify the shortest species-specific k-mer accurately identifying viruses.

The antioxidative activity was significantly higher in N. commune colonies isolated from the field than in extracts from colonies cultured in the laboratory. The antioxidative compound content of extracts, including phenolic compounds and phycobiliproteins, was correlated with their antioxidative power. In addition, two mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), specifically detected in colonies isolated from the field, were purified. In addition to assessing their antioxidative properties, the antiglycative activity of these MAAs was also assessed. Their inhibitory effects on glycation-dependent protein cross-linking might contribute to the antiglycative power of the extract prepared from field colonies. Taken together, the results from this study revealed that N. commune may have beneficial properties for functional food applications, both by preventing oxidative stress and suppressing the formation of advanced glycation end-products.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; microbial metabolism and physicsiology; nitrogen transport and metabolism, medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

This paper aims to present the development of an energy harvesting floor—called Genpath—using a rotational electromagnetic (EM) technique to generate electricity from human footsteps. The dynamic models of the electro-mechanical systems were developed using MATLAB®/Simulink to predict the energy performances of Genpath and help fine-tune the design parameters. The system in Genpath comprises two main parts: the EM generator and the Power Management and Storage (PMS) circuit. For the EM generator, the conversion mechanism for linear translation to rotation was designed by using the rack-pinion and lead-screw mechanism. Based on the simulation analysis, the averaged energy of the lead-screw model is greater than that of the rack-pinion model. Thus, prototype-II of Genpath with 12-V-DC generator, lead-screw mechanism was recently built. It shows better performance when compared to the previous prototype-I of Genpath with 24-V-DC-generator, rack-pinion mechanism. Both prototypes have an allowable displacement of 15 mm. The Genpath prototype-II produces an average energy of up to 702 mJ (or average power of 520 mW) per footstep. The energy provided by Genpath prototype-II is increased by approximately 184% when compared to that of the prototype-I. The efficiency of the EM-generator system is ~26% based on the 2-W power generation from the heel strike of a human’s walk in one step. Then, the PMS circuit was developed to harvest energy into the batteries and to supply the other part to specific loads. The experiment showed that the designed PMS circuit has the overall efficiency of 74.72%. The benefit of the design system is for a lot of applications, such as a wireless sensor and Internet of Thing applications.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In this study, we propose single-stage radialization and pollicization for the radial longitudinal deficiency with thumb hypoplasia. The advantages of this technique are to reduce the number of surgical operations, the amount of anesthesia required, and to reduce the cost of multiple follow-ups for patients and family. This technique is noteworthy for the following reasons: (1) use of dorsal vertical midline incision benefit radialization proximal extension for ulnar osteotomy and has less interference with pollicization incision; (2) ulnar shortening osteotomy should be done in case of difficulty in reposition carpus over distal ulnar, overlapping bone, or wrist flexion deformity after complete soft tissue released; (3) recommended fixation technique including predrill and retrograde Kirchner insertion makes for easy osteotomy fixation; (4) exit point of Kirchner wire at the palmar site of the base index metacarpal bone was less interfered with pollicization procedure; and (5) preserved dorso-radial skin bridge between pollicization incision and radialization incision allows for adequate venous draining and prevents postoperative swelling. This technique was carried out on 2 children (4-year-old girl and 2-year-old boy) who presented with type IV radial longitudinal deficiency with unreconstructable hypoplastic thumb. This procedure was successful without any postoperative complications. At 1-year follow-up, the appearance of the wrist was corrected from 90-degree radial angulation to neutral position and from 95-degree to 15-degree radial angulation respectively. For both pollicized thumbs, adequate first web space with proper opposition thumb position was achieved. Thumb tendons started to function at 3 months after surgery.

Outbreaks of CDV in wildlife species lead to questions regarding the dispersal of the CDV origin. In the present study, we identified a fatal CDV outbreak in caged wild-caught civets in Thailand. Full-length genetic analysis revealed that CDV from the Asia-4 lineage served as the likely causative agent, which was supported by the viral localization in tissues. Evolutionary analysis based on the CDV hemagglutinin (H) gene revealed that the present civet CDV has co-evolved with CDV strains in dogs in Thailand since about 2014. The codon usage pattern of the CDV H gene revealed that the CDV genome has a selective bias of an A/U-ended codon preference. Furthermore, the codon usage pattern of the CDV Asia-4 strain from potential hosts revealed that the usage pattern was related more to the codon usage of civets than of dogs. This finding may indicate the possibility that the discovered CDV had initially adapted its virulence to infect civets. Therefore, the CDV Asia-4 strain might pose a potential risk to civets. Further epidemiological, evolutionary, and codon usage pattern analyses of other CDV-susceptible hosts are required.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

However, the molecular mechanism of these effects remains unclear. Our study aimed to systematically examine the effects of flos puerariae crude extract (FPE) as an anti-diabetic agent using in vitro assays. The cytotoxicity of FPE was evaluated using MTS assay in L6 rat myocyte and 3T3-L1 murine fibroblast cell lines. PPARγ binding activity and adipogenesis were examined using dual-luciferase and differentiation assays, respectively. For investigating the anti-diabetic activity, glucose utilization, including GLUT4 protein expression, glucose uptake assay, and GLUT4 translocation using immunofluorescence microscopy were conducted in L6 cells. Furthermore, we assessed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of FPE. Our results demonstrated the ability to augment glucose uptake in L6 cells and enhance glucose utilization activity by increasing the expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). In summary, our findings suggest that FPE may be a potential anti-diabetic substance for the treatment of diabetic patients and can prevent inflammatory or oxidation-related diseases.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Since dissolved oxygen concentration in groundwater is limited, this study aimed to investigate profenofos biodegradation and detoxification under aerobic and anoxic conditions using the profenofos-degrading Pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain PF1 (PF1). Anoxic biodegradation under the presence of nitrate was the focus. The results showed that profenofos at 10–150 mg/L was degraded under aerobic and anoxic conditions with removal efficiencies of 38–55% and 27–45%, respectively. Kinetic analysis following the Michaelis-Menten model revealed that the maximum substrate degradation rates and the Michaelis constants were 13.07 and 8.92 mg/L/d and 92.07 and 84.76 mg/L under aerobic and anoxic conditions, respectively. The culture preferred an aerobic environment resulting in better biodegradation performance. During the degradation experiment, 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol and 1,1-dimethylethylphenol were detected as profenofos biodegradation intermediate products. Microbial toxicity, phytotoxicity, and cytogenotoxicity assays showed that the toxicity of the contaminated water significantly decreased after both aerobic and anoxic biodegradation by PF1.

The incorporation of PHA production into wastewater treatment processes is a promising strategy for resource recovery. This study investigated PHA production in two-stage continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)-activated sludge (AS) systems fed with synthetic wastewater containing glycerol. The effects of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) ratios of the first and the second stages, which reflects the feast/famine ratio, at 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33 were examined. RESULTS: The PHA accumulation and PHA consumption patterns under feast/famine conditions were successfully achieved in systems operated at HRT ratios of 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33 with influent glycerol concentrations of 3000 mg COD/L. Then, the sludge from these systems was tested for PHA accumulation in fed-batch reactors. Maximum PHA contents of 21.8 wt%, 13.1 wt%, and 8.7 wt% were obtained for the sludge from the systems operated at HRT ratios of 0.04, 0.15, and 0.33, respectively. From the microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina), the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria decreased, whereas the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria increased after cultivation in the two-stage CSTR AS systems. CONCLUSION: The highest PHA accumulation was achieved at the lowest HRT ratio of the first and the second stages in the two-stage CSTR AS systems.

High amount of free amino groups (-NH2), originating from PPD, in the PPy-co-PPD structures made them suitable for chemical immobilization of urease. The PPy-co-PPD films were prepared by one-step electrodeposition of the mixture of pyrrole and PPD. It was found that the morphology and conductivity of the PPy-co-PPD films were influenced by amount of PPD in the copolymer. Increasing amount of PPD in the copolymer led to decreasing electrical conductivity. Greater particle size and less packing were observed for the copolymer with high PPD content. XPS revealed the existence of free amino groups (-NH2) on the surface of PPy-co-PPD films. The PPy-co-PPD films were further subjected for covalent immobilization of urease, selective catalytic enzyme for urea. Potentiometric responses of the PPy-co-PPD films showed the highest sensitivity of 47.3-54.2 mV/pUrea (r2 > 0.99) over the urea concentration ranging from 0.5-10.0 mM (pUrea 2.0-3.3). Detection limits and response linearity were in the normal range of urea level. Response time was approximately 10 seconds.

There are currently no data on antibody responses to the MMR vaccine since this recommendation. Material and methods: We investigated antibody responses in a cohort of children who received two doses of MMR vaccine at the ages of 9 months and 2.5 years that was originally established to evaluate antibody levels to Bordetella pertussis antigens (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Infants were born to mothers who previously received tetanus–diphtheria–acellular pertussis vaccine at 27–36 weeks of gestation. Anti-measles, -mumps, and -rubella virus IgG levels were measured at birth (cord blood) and the ages of 2 and 7 months (before the first MMR vaccination); 18 and 24 months (9 and 15 months, respectively, after the first dose); and 36 months (6 months after the second dose) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: At 7 months of age, 96.2%, 99.6%, and 98.8% of infants had no protection against measles, mumps, and rubella, respectively. Levels of antibody against all three antigens increased significantly after the first but not the second dose. At 6 months after two-dose vaccination, 97.4%, 84.8%, and 78.7% of children remained seroprotected against measles, mumps, and rubella, respectively. Conclusions: Maternally derived antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella virus disappeared by the age of 7 months in Thai children.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) followed by minimally invasive tendon lengthening allowing immediate return to ambulation. Two hundred fifty-five spastic CP patients (who received SDR procedure at an average age of 6.9±2.6 years and tendon lengthening procedure at an average age of 7.2±2.5 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped by the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) 1-3 and 4-5. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model using a requirement for additional tendon lengthening as an end point were conducted. Tendon lengthening followed SDR at an average of 4.3±10.7 months. On an average of 4.9±1.2 years after tendon lengthening, GMFCS was improved in 28 and maintained in 213 patients, respectively. There was no difference of variables and joint angles between the two GMFCS groups. A repeat tendon lengthening was required in 19 patients. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 81% success rate. Cox proportional hazard model identified age at tendon lengthening [hazards ratio (HR), 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.76] and duration between SDR and tendon lengthening of more than 6 months (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.05-8.33) associated with need for a repeat tendon lengthening procedure.

If the fiber matrix geometry is that of the quasiperiodic substructure of the glycocalyx layer adjacent to endothelial surfaces, believed to be the primary barrier for serum albumins, σv of a spheroid with aSE close to that of serum albumins is larger than σv of a sphere, and close to experimentally obtained σv of serum albumins even when the electrostatic interaction is not included, suggesting that serum albumin molecular shape contributes to its ability to prevent intravascular fluid extravasation, and, given the close correspondence between osmotic and filtration reflection coefficients, helps minimize albumin loss from microcirculation.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Processing parameters including hydrothermal temperature (150 - 200°C), residence time (20 - 60 min), and water to biomass ratio (5 - 15 mL g-1) were optimized based on the Box-Behnken design. The ANOVA results indicated that only hydrothermal carbonization temperature showed a significant effect on the ammonium adsorption capacity of rice husk hydrochar. The optimum MHTC conditions were the water to biomass ratio of 10 mL g-1under 200°C for 60 min. Hydrochar produced under the optimum condition had the ammonium adsorption capacity of 0.89 pm 0.4 mg NH4+ -N g-1. Findings from this study suggested that hydrochar derived from rice husk through MHTC has the potential to be an alternative adsorbent for preventing ammonium run off from the agricultural area.","mixing and separation, energy, environmental","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Fuel Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Global and Planetary Change"

Results from a numerical simulation suggest that investment in fencing (passive management) is preferred to invasive species removal (active management) if we are limited to selecting a single conservation tool. However, using both instruments jointly increases net present value relative to using either instrument independently in most cases tested, and the additional benefit of invasive species removal increases as water becomes scarcer. The general results are largely insensitive to variations in the invasive species uptake rate and recharge benefits of fencing, and in all cases, use of both instruments reduces the loss resulting from the imposition of a safe minimum standard for groundwater-dependent ecosystems more effectively than either instrument alone.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; environmentalronmental management, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water resources; planning, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Spent coffee ground (SCG), a residue from coffee brewing, was the tested material. Applying computational fluid dynamics (CFD), an appropriate cabinet dryer configuration could be achieved. As varying the hot air inlet/outlet position, the best drying characteristics providing uniform air flow occurred when hot air entered the chamber at the top and left the chamber at the bottom, opposite side to the inlet. A model dryer was then developed and used to validate the CFD prediction of dryer capacity which was dependent on the maximum numbers of mounted trays and the thickness of SCG layer. The computational prediction agreed well with the experimental results, showing that the dryer loading SCG at 3 cm thickness performed best with two trays in the chamber. Adding another tray would result in an obstruction of the air flow, leaving more than 20% of the moisture content in the final product. Experimental determination of drying duration for drying SCG with varying thickness indicated that each centimeter of the increase in SCG bed thickness extended the drying duration by 3 fold. Particularly at the SCG layer thickness of 4 cm, this fitted well with the simulation results at 97.2% accuracy. Mounted with 3 trays, each loaded 300 g SCG (1 cm bed thickness), the dryer could complete 6 cycles within regular operation hours of a coffee shop (12 h) and thus accounted for 5400 g of SCG as daily capacity of a dryer.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Despite the antitumor activity of these agents, a significant number of patients demonstrated immune-related adverse events that affected the functions of multiple organs, including the endocrine system. We report the first case of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced simultaneous diabetic ketoacidosis and isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency following combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Case presentation: A 70-year-old Thai man with no previous history of diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with stage IVB non-small cell lung with pleural and liver metastases. After 14 weeks of combination treatment with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, he presented with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory investigation revealed random plasma glucose 794 mg/dl, serum ketone 6.3 mmol/L, bicarbonate 13 mmol/L, and high anion gap 24 mmol/L. New-onset diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis were diagnosed. Insulin therapy was initiated a favorable outcome within 10 hours. Despite improvement of hyperglycemia, the patient had persistent nausea and hyponatremia. Further investigation revealed cortisol 0.8 μg/dl and adrenocorticotropic hormone 21.7 pg/ml. His other pituitary hormone levels were normal, except for mild elevation of gonadotropin hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary showed a normal pituitary gland. Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency was diagnosed, and corticosteroid replacement therapy was administered, resulting in an improvement of his symptoms. Conclusion: Our patient developed new-onset diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, and isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency during cancer treatment with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab.

Methods Spectral-domain OCT RNFL thickness measurements were obtained from 684 consecutive patients who were seen in the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Glaucoma Service. Of these patients, we compared RNFL thickness measurements between 101 eyes of 101 glaucoma suspects who met inclusion criteria (55 eyes with and 46 eyes without pPVD). Results Among all 684 patients, 253 (37%) had pPVD in at least one eye. Among a subset of 101 eyes of 101 glaucoma suspects, average RNFL thickness was greater in eyes with compared to eyes without pPVD (p=0.02). Measurements were significantly greater in the inferior (p=0.004) and superior quadrants (p=0.008), but not in the nasal (p=0.10) and temporal quadrants (p=0.25). The difference in average RNFL thickness remained significant (p=0.05) even when corrected for expected age-related decline in RNFL thickness. Conclusion Over a third of patients were found on peripapillary spectral-domain OCT to have a pPVD, which was associated with greater RNFL thickness measurements. Judicious clinical interpretation of this finding on spectral-domain OCT RNFL thickness scans should be factored into the assessment of glaucoma suspects.","medical, neuroscience","Ophthalmology, Sensory Systems, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The fluid is partially formed by hydrostatic pressure difference between liver and intra-abdominal cavity causing the leakage across Glisson's capsule. Moreover, the oncotic pressure difference can cause fluid shift between two spaces especially in in post-hepatectomy patients. Since the liver tissue is resected, the amount of albumin production from hepatocytes decreases, resulting in the reduction of the oncotic pressure within liver sinusoids. Insight of the ascites formation mechanism can lead to proper post-operative management which can reduce severity of the complication. In this study we present a mathematical model to predict the amount of ascites formation in several extents of hepatectomy. The fluid circulations within liver lobules are described as flow in porous media using Darcy's law. The roles of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures on ascites production were investigated by comparing amounts of the leaked fluid between the models with and without the effect of albumin. The ascites formation from the hydrostatic pressure after hepatic resection is decreased slightly due to smaller surface area of Glisson's capsule. In contrast, the fluid volume is escalated massively by the reduction of liver oncotic pressure. However, the results show that the major hepatic resections (≥ 3 lobes) does not always cause larger amount of the ascites compared to the minor resections (< 3 lobes). The operation involving posterior part of the liver (segment IV, VII, and VIII) tends to have higher risk of ascites collection. The administration of albumin or drugs such as diuretics in patients with post-operative serum albumin ≤ 3 g/dL may reduce the incidence of ascites.",computer science,"Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

A structured literature search, targeting peer-reviewed publication databases, as well as data from international and national sources in the public domain, was conducted. Our review of the nutritional landscape demonstrates that micronutrient deficiency–related conditions, especially anemia and its associated health consequences, are common among Asian women of reproductive age, yet the dietary causes are poorly studied. Inadequate or borderline dietary intake of micronutrients and low consumption of micronutrient supplements were evident, despite existing recommendations, food fortification, and supplementation strategies.

Results: CAPD was more commonly used in Thailand and Japan, while APD predominated over CAPD in A/NZ, Canada, the US, and the UK. Total prescribed PD volume normalized to the surface area was the highest in Thailand and the lowest in Japan (for both APD and CAPD) and the UK (for CAPD). PD patients from Thailand had the lowest residual urine volume and residual renal urea clearance, yet achieved the highest dialysis urea clearance. Japanese patients had the lowest dialysis urea clearances for both APD and CAPD. Despite having similar urine volumes to patients in A/NZ, Canada, Japan, and the UK, US CAPD and APD patients used 2.5% and 3.86% glucose PD solutions more frequently, whereas fewer than 25% of these patients used icodextrin. Over half of the patients in A/NZ, Canada, the UK, and Japan used icodextrin, whereas it was hardly used in Thailand.

However, the relationship between abnormal sleep BP variations and cerebral small vessel disease markers is poorly established. This study aims to assess the association between non-dipping and reverse-dipping BP patterns with markers of silent cerebral small vessel disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Databases were searched from inception through November 2019. Studies that reported the odds ratios (ORs) for cerebral small vessel disease markers in patients with non-dipping or reverse-dipping BP patterns were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using the random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Twelve observational studies composed of 3497 patients were included in this analysis. The reverse-dipping compared with normal dipping BP pattern was associated with a higher prevalence of white matter hyperintensity with a pooled adjusted OR of 2.00 (95% CI, 1.13–2.37; I2=36%). Non-dipping BP pattern compared with normal dipping BP pattern was associated with higher prevalence of white matter hyperintensity and asymptomatic lacunar infarction, with pooled ORs of 1.38 (95% CI, 0.95–2.02; I2=52%) and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.30–4.18; I2=73%), respectively.

However, rice plants are salt susceptible species in which high salinity can significantly constrain its productivity. Several physiological parameters in adaptation to salt stress have been observed, though changes in metabolic aspects remain to be elucidated. In this study, rice metabolic activities of salt-stressed flag leaf were systematically characterized. Transcriptomics and metabolomics data were combined to identify disturbed pathways, altered metabolites and metabolic hotspots within the rice metabolic network under salt stress condition. Besides, the feasible flux solutions in different context-specific metabolic networks were estimated and compared. Our findings highlighted metabolic reprogramming in primary metabolic pathways, cellular respiration, antioxidant biosynthetic pathways, and phytohormone biosynthetic pathways. Photosynthesis and hexose utilization were among the major disturbed pathways in the stressed flag leaf. Notably, the increased flux distribution of the photorespiratory pathway could contribute to cellular redox control. Predicted flux statuses in several pathways were consistent with the results from transcriptomics, end-point metabolomics, and physiological studies.

Fourteen studies (21,515 participants, age 49.12 years, 26% male) were included. The OR of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients were 11.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.41 to 23.4) when compared with acute respiratory infection (ARI) without detectable virus and 6.46 (95% CI 2.79 to 14.97) in patients with other respiratory viruses. The OR of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were 11.67 (95% CI 6.43 to 21.17) when compared with the ARI patients without detectable virus and 4.17 (95% CI 1.34 to 12.98) with other respiratory viruses. The OR of gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were 12.70 (95% CI 7.9 to 20.44) when compared with the ARI patients without detectable virus and 4.94 (95%CI 1.59 to 15.31) with other respiratory viruses. Fifty percent (95% CI 36.7 to 63.3%) of COVID-19 patients had olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions. In summary, there are associations between OGD and COVID-19 patients. Patients presenting with ARI should be assessed for olfactory and gustatory functions.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Moreover, awareness of adverse effects leads physicians to initiate moderate-intensity statins. Comparative of high versus moderate-intensive statins on LDL-C among patients who had undergone primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are less established in Thailand. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to identify pattern of statins prescribing and explored the effectiveness on lipid profiles, including LDL-C goal achievement (<70 mg/dL) in STEMI patients underwent PPCI. A total of 983 patients with STEMI who had undergone PPCI were identified during 2005-2015. At 3-month follow-up, 31.9% patients were investigated for their lipid profile. There was 26.11% of patients who received high-intensity statins. When compared to baseline, we found more LDL-C reduction (38.22% ± 26.75% vs 22.36% ± 35.05%, P <.01) in the high-intensity group. Eighty-one patients achieved the target LDL-C, the high-intensity group were able to achieve the LDL-C goal than moderate-intensity group, but did not reach statistical significance (24.1% vs 30.5%, P =.26). This study confirmed that high-intensity statins have superior for LDL-C reduction and tend to achieve LDL-C goal more than moderate-intensity statins.","Health Professions, medical","Pharmacy, Pharmacology (medical)"
Promotional role of MgO on sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol over Ni/CaO catalysts,"Sang S., Zhao Z.-J., Tian H., Sun Z., Li H., Assabumrungrat S., Muhammad T., Zeng L., Gong J.",2020-04-01,"Catalyst surfaces, Catalytic performance, Enhanced steam reforming, Ethanol conversion, Ethanol reforming, Reaction pathways, Sintering resistance, Sorption enhanced reforming, ethanol reforming, hydrogen production, sorption-enhanced reforming","This article describes the design and synthesis of MgO-modified Ni/CaO catalysts for sorption-enhanced steam reforming of ethanol. The results show that the introduction of MgO effectively increases the dispersion of CaO via forming MgCa(CO3)2 precursor. In the prepared MgO-modified Ni/CaO catalysts, metallic Ni exists around MgO supported on CaO. Both 100% ethanol conversion and >96% hydrogen purity can be stabilized in 10 cycles over the catalyst containing 20 wt% MgO. The interaction between metallic Ni and MgO enhances the sintering resistance of the catalyst. More importantly, reaction pathway studies have confirmed that the formation of CaCO3 hinders the activation of H2O on the Ni/CaO catalyst surface, and thus inhibits the conversion of the reaction intermediates including HCO* and CHx*. MgO can dissociate H2O to form hydroxyl groups which participate in the conversion of the reaction intermediates, thereby the MgO-modified Ni/CaO catalysts have better catalytic performance and carbon deposition resistance.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering (all)"

Bat contact and consumption, which persists in Asia, poses risks for the transmission of bat-borne infections. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey for risk factors associated with bat contact and consumption behaviors was conducted in ten provinces of Thailand from May 2016 to December 2017. A standardized questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews was used to collect information from 626 villagers who lived in or nearby areas of high bat density. The questionnaire contained 23 independent variables related to sociodemographic, knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceptions. Results: The respondents (n = 626) were 285 females and 341 males, mean age of respondents was 47.58 years-old and lived in rural setting. Our results showed that 36.42% of respondents (n1 = 228) in 10 provinces reported bat contact during the past 6 months. Furthermore, 15.34% of respondents (n2 = 96) in 9 out of 10 provinces reported of having consumed bat meat in the past 6 months. Risk factors for bat contact included sex (male) (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.28), educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.18), and the consideration of bats as being economically beneficial to the community (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 2.03-4.97), while agriculture-related occupation (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79), knowledge that it is safe to eat bats (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.93), practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96), and attitude of feeling safe in areas where bats live (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.86) were statistically significant protective factors against bat contact. Risk factors for bat consumption included sex (male) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.49-4.11) and educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.27-3.85), while knowledge of whether bats are safe to eat (OR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.25), knowledge of whether there are laws pertaining to hunting bats for consumption (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.71), and the practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.81) were statistically significant protective factors against bat consumption. Conclusions: This study provides a better understanding of the sociodemographic factors, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices that might influence bat contact and bat consumption behaviors. Information on risk factors can be used for the development of appropriate education and communication interventions to promote proper knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding bats and bat-borne zoonotic diseases in Thailand and other areas in the Southeast Asia region with similar environmental and cultural characteristics.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Herein we report NiCoP nanoleaves array vertically grown on Ni foam for H2 evolution and overall water splitting via simple hydrothermal treatment and phosphorization. The self-supported NiCoP nanoleaves architecture contributes to more exposed active sites, the smaller contact resistance between catalyst and substrate, faster ion diffusion and electron transfer. As a result, the optimized electrode requires only overpotentials of 98 and 173 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Besides, used as both anode and cathode simultaneously, the electrode delivers current densities of 100 and 200 mA cm−2 at cell voltages of only 1.8 and 1.87 V, respectively. Moreover, the relatively high efficiency of about 11.4% for solar-driven water splitting further illustrates the application of our catalyst to sustainable development based on green technologies.","fluidex; related topics, energy, chemistry","Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Electrochemistry"

A potential limitation of the COMDQ is the high response burden to patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop and validate a short version of the 26-item COMDQ. Methods: The COMDQ data of 520 patients with chronic oral mucosal diseases were randomly divided into two subsamples. Descriptive item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were performed using data from the first subsample for item reduction and development of the shortened COMDQ. The resulting short version was then validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other subsample. Internal consistency reliability of the short-form COMDQ was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity of this new scale was examined against its original version. Results: Based upon item analysis, 11 items were dropped. EFA results on the remaining 15 items extracted four factors consistent with the original COMDQ, and CFA results displayed acceptable goodness-of-fit indices of this factor structure on different sample. The COMDQ-15 was then created. Cronbach's alpha of four subscale scores ranged from 0.7 to 0.91, indicating good internal consistency reliability of the COMDQ-15. Correlations between total and subscale scores of the COMDQ-15 and its parent scale were high, supporting good criterion validity of this shortened scale. Conclusion: The COMDQ-15 is a brief, valid and reliable instrument that can give an overview of the patient's quality of life related to their chronic oral mucosal conditions.","genergyal, otorhinolaryngology, medical, dentistry, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Cancer Research, Periodontics"

Herein, we develop a simple fabricated sensor based on a bismuth nanoparticle-modified screen-printed graphene electrode (BiNP/SPGE) on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) for the simultaneous determination of Sn(II) and Pb(II) and combine it with a portable potentiostat. To overcome crossing interference, the use of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) can provide improved separation and enhanced sensitivity for Sn(II) and Pb(II) detection in oxalic acid as a supporting electrolyte while using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of both metals was determined to be 10–250 ng mL−1, and the calculated limit of detection (3SD/slope) was 0.26 ng mL−1 and 0.44 ng mL−1 for Sn(II) and Pb(II), respectively. This sensor was also applied to simultaneously determine Sn(II) and Pb(II) in canned food samples. The results obtained from the portable potentiostat were similar to the results obtained by a standard method. Therefore, the proposed device can be further improved for the realization of a rapid on-site detector for Sn(II) and Pb(II) detection in real samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Superficial Pd nanoparticles supported on carbonaceous SBA-15 as efficient hydrotreating catalyst for upgrading biodiesel fuel,"Chen S.-Y., Chang A., Rungsi A.N., Attanatho L., Chang C.-L., Pan J.-H., Suemanotham A., Mochizuki T., Takagi H., Yang C.-M., Luengnaruemitchai A., Chou H.-H.",2020-07-25,"Carbonaceous surface, Fatty acid methyl ester, High resolution electron microscopes, Hydrogenated molecules, Hydrophobic surfaces, Hydrotreating catalysts, Supporting material, Temperature programmed techniques, High blends for CO2 reduction, Mesoporous materials, Supported Pd catalysts, Surface characterization, Upgrading of biodiesel fuel","Facile synthesis of superficial Pd nanoparticles supported on carbonaceous SBA-15 (denoted as Pd/@SBA-15) as a new hydrotreating catalyst with enhanced activity and sulfur tolerance was accomplished for the production of partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME), a high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monosaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME) that can be used in high blends. Characterization, especially high-resolution electron microscopes and temperature-programmed techniques, indicated that the Pd nanoparticles (∼7 nm) formed spontaneously at the superficial area of carbonaceous SBA-15 with a hydrophobic surface and low acidity. In the synthesis of H-FAME using commercial palm oil-derived biodiesel fuel as a feedstock under mild conditions (<100 °C, 1 MPa), this new Pd/@SBA-15 catalyst offered high hydrotreating activity with excellent selectivity toward mono-FAME, especially the cis product, and high sulfur resistance, presumably due to fast diffusion and suitable interactions of the reactant and hydrogenated molecules through superficial Pd nanoparticles on the carbonaceous surfaces as the catalytically active sites. On the other hand, commercial Pd catalysts with Pd nanoparticles randomly impregnated inside the supporting materials showed lower activity in H-FAME synthesis and poorer selectivity toward saturated fatty acid methyl esters as undesirable products and lower sulfur tolerance level per Pd site, demonstrating the superiority of our system.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this study, the production of ethanol was performed by utilizing two different engineered Synechocystis strains consisting of pdc-adh (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase) overexpression (▲APX) and glgC-phaA (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase and PHA-specific β-ketothiolase) knockout (ΔGBK) pathways. This strategy involves destruction of glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis, both of which act as a storage polymer. The blocking of such biosynthetic pathways enabled Synechocystis to release various metabolites into the medium with an increase of chlorophyll a content and oxygen evolution due to the reduction of glycogen and PHB synthesis. In co-cultivation system, the extracellular metabolites released from knock out strain (ΔGBK) were utilized by the pdc-adh overexpressing strain (▲APX) and produced 4708 mg/L ethanol, which is comparatively higher than pdc-adh overexpressing strain containing glgC and PhaA knock out (ΔGBK-▲APX) (4103 mg/L). Although the concentration of ▲APX cells were lower in co-culture than in mono-culture, the overflow of metabolites from knock out Synechocystis and the consumption of those products by pdc-adh overexpressing Synechocystis in co-cultivation system improved the overall yield.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The radiosensitizing potential of LipoGold and similar concentrations of non-liposomal GNPs, carboplatin and oxaliplatin was evaluated in vitro with the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 in a clonogenic assay. Progression of HCT116 tumor implanted subcutaneously in NU/NU mice was monitored after an irradiation of 10 Gy combined with either LipoGold, GNPs or carboplatin injected directly into the tumor by convection-enhanced delivery. Radiosensitization by GNPs alone or carboplatin alone was observed only at high concentrations of these compounds. Furthermore, low doses of carboplatin alone or a combination of carboplatin and GNPs did not engender radiosensitization. However, the same low doses of carboplatin and GNPs administered simultaneously by encapsulation in liposomal nanocarriers (LipoGold) led to radiosensitization and efficient control of cell proliferation. Our study shows that the radiosensitizing effect of a combination of carboplatin and GNPs is remarkably more efficient when both compounds are simultaneously delivered to the tumor cells using a liposomal carrier.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Aims of the study: to compare OSTOX biomarkers and antioxidant (ANTIOX) defenses in deficit versus non-deficit schizophrenia. We examined lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), sulfhydryl (–SH) groups, paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity and PON1 Q192R genotypes, and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) as well as immune biomarkers in patients with deficit (n = 40) and non-deficit (n = 40) schizophrenia and healthy controls (n = 40). Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by significantly increased levels of AOPP and lowered –SH, and PON1 activity, while no changes in the OSTOX/ANTIOX biomarkers were found in non-deficit schizophrenia. An increased OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio was significantly associated with deficit versus non-deficit schizophrenia (odds ratio = 3.15, p ' 0.001). Partial least squares analysis showed that 47.6% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from psychosis, excitation, hostility, mannerism, negative symptoms, psychomotor retardation, formal thought disorders, and neurocognitive test scores was explained by LOOH+AOPP, PON1 genotype + activity, CCL11, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IgA responses to neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), whereas –SH groups and IgM responses to MDA showed indirect effects mediated by OSTOX and neuro-immune biomarkers. When overall severity of schizophrenia increases, multiple immune and oxidative (especially protein oxidation indicating chlorinative stress) neurotoxicities and impairments in immune-protective resilience become more prominent and shape a distinct nosological entity, namely deficit schizophrenia.

The dynamic safety distance increases in a light traffic condition where the average driving velocity is high, while decreases in a dense traffic condition in anticipation of slower traffic motion. The results show that the presence of the autonomous vehicles can enhance overall velocity and traffic current of the system, and postpone the traffic congestion. In a particular phase region, imposing a speed limit enables the system to leave the congested flow phase. The density-dependent speed limit in autonomous-free condition is obtained to achieve the optimal traffic flow.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, physics","Statistics and Probability, Condensed Matter Physics"

As its clinical and laboratory manifestations resemble many other metabolic disorders, HMGCS2D definite diagnosis presents a challenge, frequently requiring molecular tests. Only 26 patients with HMGCS2 mutations have been previously described, and this study reports the first two unrelated Thai patients, a 9-month-old male and an 8-month-old female, with HMGCS2D. During acute episodes, steatorrhea and dyslipidemia occurred, both previously unreported. Increased serum levels of triglycerides, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL), along with a decreased serum level of HDL were found. Both patients had hypophosphatemic encephalopathy, and the female had metabolic acidosis without hypoglycemia. Trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed that the male harbored two HMGCS2 mutations, a novel c.1480C>T (p.Arg494*) and a previously reported c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro), while the female was compound heterozygous for the c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro) and a previously reported mutation, c.520T>C (p.Phe174Leu). Interestingly, c.1502G>C (p.Arg501Pro) was not only found in both of our patients but also detected heterozygously in 9 out of 1081 unrelated individuals (allele frequency of 9/2162; 0.42%) in our in-house Thai exome database. Discovery of this common mutation suggests there could be about 14 babies with HMGCS2D within 800,000 newborns in Thailand annually. Therefore, awareness of HMGCS2D among medical personnel in Thailand should be raised.","biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

Results: Among the 86 participants, there was a positive correlation between the duration of lead exposure and LS (r = 0.249, p = 0.021). To avoid the confounding effect of obesity-related steatosis, only 70 individuals who had controlled attenuation parameters < 296 dB/m, BMI < 25 kg/m2 and normal waist circumference were included in the interventional analysis. After chelation, the mean LS significantly decreased from 5.4 ± 0.9 to 4.8 ± 1.4 kPa (p = 0.001). Similarly, all of the inflammatory cytokines studied significantly decreased after chelation (p < 0.001); TNF-α decreased from 371.6 ± 211.3 to 215.8 ± 142.7; the levels of IL-1β decreased from 29.8 ± 1.7 to 25.9 ± 4.3; and the levels of IL-6 decreased from 46.8 ± 10.2 to 35.0 ± 11.9. On the other hand, the mean GSH level increased significantly from 3.3 ± 3.3 to 13.1 ± 3.7 (p < 0.001) after chelation therapy. Conclusion: The duration of lead exposure was significantly correlated with the degree of liver fibrosis. Chelation treatment was associated with increased levels of GSH and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and could potentially reduce the degree of LS.

Immunohistochemical assessment of the peri-implant soft tissue around different abutment materials: A human study,"Serichetaphongse P., Chengprapakorn W., Thongmeearkom S., Pimkhaokham A.",2020-10-01,"Dental Abutments, Dental Implant-Abutment Design, Dental Implants, Dental Implants, Single-Tooth, Esthetics, Dental, Humans, Titanium, Zirconium, abutments, immunohistochemistry, inflammation, peri-implant soft tissue","Background: Soft tissue reaction to dental implant abutments influences the sustainability of restoration. Several abutment materials, such as titanium and gold alloy, have been introduced for strength and esthetic solutions. Zirconia and titanium-base abutments have also become popular in recent years due to high esthetic demands. Purpose: To investigate the immune cell infiltration into the soft tissue in response to different abutment materials. Materials and Methods: Twenty dental implants were placed in the posterior regions of 17 patients. Titanium, zirconia, gold alloy, and titanium-base were randomly selected for each patient on the day of surgery. After 8 weeks of healing, the abutments were removed along with 1 mm of peri-implant soft tissue. Immunohistochemical assessment was performed using labeled streptavidin-biotin to identify T cells, B cells, macrophages, plasma cells, and microvascular infiltration. Results: Gold alloy demonstrated an overall higher inflammatory cell infiltration and highest number of CD3+, CD20+, and CD 68+ cells (P value <.05). The number of plasma cell and new microvascular infiltrations among abutment materials was not significantly different. Conclusion: Titanium, titanium-base, and zirconia abutments showed comparable infiltration profiles; gold alloy abutments showed the highest B-cell, T cell, and macrophage infiltration. None of the abutment materials caused clinical inflammation; hence, they can be effectively used.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"
Experimental study on improvement of sign language motion classification performance using pre-trained network models,"Kawaguchi K., Wang Z., Kuniwa T., Daraseneeyakul P., Veerakiatikit P., Ohta E., Nishimura H., Tanaka H.",2020-01-01,"Automatic speech, Classification accuracy, Classification performance, Data augmentation, Ensemble learning, Extracting features, Hearing disabilities, Motion classification, Classification, Data augmentation, Ensemble learning, Pre-trained network model, Sign language motion","Sign language is a major means of communication for people with hearing disabilities. However, there are very few hearing people who have learned sign language, and this is a great barrier to communication between hearing-impaired and hearing people. While automatic speech interpretation has already been put to practical use in some fields, there remains a lot of difficulties in putting sign language interpretation into practical use. Considering the variety of sign languages, the complexity of their motions and many subtle differences, it seems that there is bound to be a limit to any method of artificially extracting feature elements from motions and inputting them to a classifier to decide sign language motions. The authors are now investigating a method for automatically extracting feature elements using a pre-trained network model that has been trained by deep learning, and for classifying each motion. The problem of using deep learning is that it requires a large amount of training data to create a trained model. The acquisition of sign language motion data in order to satisfy this requirement seems to be difficult in practice. This paper presents a method of artificially creating data by data augmentation under conditions where the number of data items that can be collected is limited, and improving classification accuracy. It is shown that the proposed method has obtained a result of about 10% improvement in classification accuracy. In addition, the application of ensemble learning, which is another techniques for improving accuracy, is also described. The author shows that classification performance after integrating the results using a plurality of trained models built on the feature elements obtained from each pre-trained network model, resulted in a significant improvement in accuracy of more than about 10%.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"
Selective-area growth and characterization of cubic GaN grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy,"Suwanyangyaun P., Sanorpim S., Onabe K.",2020-09-01,"Growth morphology, Growth parameters, Hexagonal phase, Lateral growth rates, Low growth temperature, Selective area growth, Stripe pattern, Vertical growth, Crystal growth, Crystal structure, Microstructure, Nitride materials, Semiconductors, Vapor deposition","Selective–area growth of cubic GaN (c–GaN) layers grown on stripe–patterned GaAs (100) substrates by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy was investigated. The formation of hexagonal phase was examined along with the growth morphology and the lateral-to-vertical growth ratio of the selective–area grown c–GaN stripes. It is found that the hexagonal phase formation significantly depends on growth parameters, particularly, the growth temperature, direction of the stripe pattern, and fill factor. For the [011]– and [01¯1]–stripe patterns, the volume fraction of the hexagonal phase in the c–GaN layers reduces significantly with increasing fill factor. In contrast, it gradually increases with the fill factor for the [001]–stripe pattern. GaN layers with the highest phase purity containing > 85% of the cubic phase can be obtained at low growth temperatures (~ 900°C) for the [011]–stripe pattern with the smallest fill factor of 0.35. A lower lateral growth rate is observed as compared to that at higher growth temperatures (930–960°C). Further evidence is provided by correlating the cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence to the growth facets. Transmission electron microscopy results confirm that h–GaN is easily constructed on the (111)B facet due to the formation of stacking faults. In practice, the [01¯1]–stripe pattern with a large fill factor of ~ 0.7 can be applied to obtain a selective–area grown c–GaN layer with the highest cubic-phase purity. Furthermore, the [011]–stripe pattern has also been considered for SAG of c–GaN at low growth temperature.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

"Influence of compatibilizer and multifunctional additive loadings on flame retardation, plasticization, and impact modification of polylactide and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) biodegradable blends","Phetwarotai W., Suparanon T., Phusunti N., Potiyaraj P.",2020-09-01,"Compatibilized blends, Flame retardant properties, Interfacial adhesions, Limiting Oxygen Index, Multifunctional additives, Polies (butylene adipate co terephthalate), Tricresyl phosphates, Twin screw extruders, additive, compatibilization, flame retardant, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), polylactide","The poor compatibility and flame retardation of polylactide (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends seriously limit their applications. This study focused on the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of a PLA/PBAT blend under the influence of different levels of compatibilizer and multifunctional additives (MFA). PLA and PBAT were successfully compatibilized via reactive blending in a twin-screw extruder. The flame retardation, flexibility, and impact toughness of the compatibilized blend were improved by the presence of tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and triethyl citrate (TEC). Separately and in combination, the two additives played crucial roles in flame retardant effectiveness, plasticization, and impact modification. The compatibilized blend displayed a UL-94 V-0 rating and exhibited a high limiting oxygen index (LOI). A slight reduction in thermal stability was exhibited when 20 phr TCP was incorporated into the blend. During combustion, an integrated char layer formed on the compatibilized blend surface and retarded flammability. The combination of TCP and TEC not only significantly improved dripping behavior and flame-retardant properties of the compatibilized blend but also cooperatively enhanced the elongation at break and impact strength without impacting tensile strength, Young's modulus, LOI value, and thermal stability. The failure behavior of the blend changed from brittle to ductile, as evidenced by SEM, which revealed elongated fibrils after tension. These characteristics were associated with the presence of the MFAs and the improved interfacial adhesion between PLA and PBAT. As a result, flame retardation, flexibility, and impact resistance were enhanced. These improvements permit the wider application of PLA, especially in the electronic and automotive fields. Highlights: Compatibilized PLA/PBAT blend achieved the V-0 rating and had a high LOI. Both TCP and TEC could be used as multifunctional additives (MFAs) in the compatibilized blend. Combination of MFAs synergistically enhanced elongation at break and impact strength without impacting other properties of the blends. These improvements permit the wider application of PLA, especially in the electronic and automotive fields.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Polymers and Plastics

The effectiveness of these regimens may still be an issue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare two preventive programs carried out in a Public School for kindergarten children. Methods: The data from clinical examinations were used to assess the caries risk for 121 children. Children with at least 2 carious lesions were considered as high risk for dental caries development. These children were randomized into two groups. Half (High risk basic-HRB group) were provided the basic prevention regimen (oral-hygiene instruction and hands-on brushing practice for teachers and caregivers, daytime tooth brushing supervised by teachers at least once a week, newly erupted first permanent molar sealant, provision of toothbrush, fluoride-containing dentifrice, and a guidebook), which was also given to low-risk children (Low risk basic-LRB group). The other half (High risk intensive-HRI group) were additionally given an intensified preventive regimen (F-varnish application, primary molar sealant, and silver diamine fluoride (SDF) application on carious lesions). Clinical examinations were performed semiannually to determine the dmfs caries increment of the three groups. Results: The 89 children completed the 24-month examination were 3- to 5-year-old with 19, 35, and 35 children in the LRB, HRB, and HRI group, respectively. The new caries development at 24 months of the HRB group (75%) was higher than that of the HRI group (65.7%) and the LRB group (21.1%). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated no significant differences of caries increment between the HRB and HRI groups at the end of our study (p = 0.709). Conclusions: The negligible difference in caries increment between the HRI and HRB groups implies that intensified prevention produced minimal additional benefit. Offering all children only basic prevention could have obtained virtually the same preventive effect with substantially less effort and lower cost.

Ni-based catalysts have been widely studied due to their low cost and relatively good catalytic performance. However, to reach high catalytic activity at low temperature and good stability at high temperature, the Ni-based catalysts should be improved. A special catalyst support was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis with in situ doping of Zr, namely, Zr(x)@MCM-41. A series of supported Ni-based catalysts, Ni/Zr(x)@MCM-41, was prepared by citric-acid-assisted impregnation. The structure and physicochemical properties of catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TEM, CO2-TPD and TG. The strengthened interaction between Zr and Ni favoured the spillover of H absorbed on Ni to the support, which promoted the hydrogenation of CO2 and intermediates COad on the support and increased the CO2 conversion at low temperature. Simultaneously, with the addition of Zr, the amount of strong basic sites decreased, and the amount of surface oxygen species increased, which not only inhibited the carbon deposition but also enabled the deposited carbon to be reoxidized and participate in the reaction, so the selectivity of CH4 slightly improved. However, excessive addition of Zr will reduce the reactivity of the catalysts, since the order of the pore structure decreases, and many irregular pore structures are generated. The catalyst Ni/@Zr(0.01)@MCM-41 with an appropriate Zr content reached a high CO2 conversion of 88.6 % and a CH4 selectivity of 96.5 % at 280 °C and 1 MPa.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Endoxifen, which is toxic to aquatic animals, has been detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This research investigates ultraviolet (UV) radiation (253.7 nm) application to degrade (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water and wastewater and phototransformation by-products (PBPs) and their toxicity. The effects of light intensity, pH and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen on the photodegradation rate were examined. Endoxifen in water was eliminated ≥99.1% after 35 s of irradiation (light dose of 598.5 mJ cm−2). Light intensity and initial concentrations of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen exhibited positive trends with the photodegradation rates while pH had no effect. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in water resulted in three PBPs. Toxicity assessments through modeling of the identified PBPs suggest higher toxicity than the parent compounds. Photodegradation of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen in wastewater at light doses used for disinfection in WWTPs (16, 30 and 97 mJ cm−2) resulted in reductions of (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen from 30 to 71%. Two of the three PBPs observed in the experiments with water were detected in the wastewater experiments. Therefore, toxic compounds are potentially generated at WWTPs by UV disinfection if (E)- and (Z)-endoxifen are present in treated wastewater.","genergyal, geobase; related topics, environmental, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering, Ecological Modeling, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

This review paper aims to highlight the metabolism of diclofenac at different trophic levels, its occurrence, ecological risks, and interactive effects in the water cycle and biota over the past two decades. Increased exposure to diclofenac not only raises health concerns for vultures, aquatic organisms, and higher plants but also causes serious threats to mammals. The ubiquitous nature of diclofenac in surface water (river, lake canal, estuary, and sea) is compared with drinking water, groundwater, and wastewater effluent in the environment. This comprehensive survey from previous studies suggests the fate of diclofenac in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and may predict its persistence in the environment. This review offers evidence of fragmentary available data for the water environment, soil, sediment, and biota worldwide and supports the need for further data to address the risks associated with the presence of diclofenac in the environment. Finally, we suggest that the presence of diclofenac and its metabolites in the environment may represent a high risk because of their synergistic interactions with existing contaminants, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains and the formation of newly emerging pollutants.","water engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Pathological diagnosis of ATC can be challenging as the tumor may show morphological overlap with other neoplasms with anaplastic morphology. Immunohistochemical demonstration of thyroid origin facilitates the diagnosis of ATC. Previous studies using the polyclonal anti-PAX8 antibody 10336-1-AP suggested that PAX8 was the most sensitive marker, expressed in up to 80% of ATC. According to a 2018 NordiQC report, the monoclonal anti-PAX8 antibody MRQ-50 has become the most commonly used anti-PAX8 antibody worldwide. However, validation of this antibody in ATC is lacking. In this study, we recruited 182 ATC cases from seven institutions. Pathology slides were subjected to histology review. PAX8 immunohistochemistry using the MRQ-50 antibody was performed in whole tissue slides (n = 147) or tissue microarray sections (n = 35). We found PAX8 expression in 54.4% of the cases, which was significantly lower than those reported in prior studies with the polyclonal antibody. PAX8 expression was positively correlated with the presence of an epithelial pattern (63.6% vs 37.5%, p = 0.0008) and a coexisting differentiated thyroid carcinoma component (71.6% vs 44.3%, p = 0.0004), but was not associated with age, gender, specimen type, or presence of giant cell and sarcomatoid patterns. In conclusion, we demonstrated PAX8 expression using the monoclonal antibody MRQ-50 in only half of the cases in a large ATC series. Pathologists should be aware that PAX8 expression in ATC is less than those reported in early studies to avoid misdiagnosis.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

For the properties, BFRTs had the properties as required by the industry requirements including the modulus of rupture (MOR) greater than 5 MPa, the modulus of elasticity (MOE) greater than 7000 MPa, the impact resistance greater than 1000 J/m2, and the density between 1.5−2.2 g/cm3.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)
Comparative customer economics on different financial options in support the adoption of residential rooftop photovoltaic in Thailand,"Junlakarn S., Kokchang P.",2020-04-06,"Economic feasibilities, Household applications, Internal rate of return, Levelized cost of electricities, Photovoltaic generation, Photovoltaic productions, Solar photovoltaic system, Techno-Economic analysis, Financial options, Net billing, Self-consumption, Solar photovoltaic","The Thai Government has supported the use of solar photovoltaic systems for green electricity production toward the self-consumption policy since 2016. A photovoltaic support program with an installed capacity target of 100 Megawatt was announced in December 2018 to promote self-consumption and compensate for any excess photovoltaic generation at 1.68 Thai Baht/kilowatt-hour. However, the target was not achieved as a result of high upfront investment costs that are one of the main barriers in household application. To make solar photovoltaic systems more accessible to a larger group of users, financial mechanisms are required. The economic feasibility of financial options (cash, solar power purchasing agreement, solar leasing, solar loan) was analyzed for photovoltaic systems under the current Thai household solar rooftop scheme. The System Advisor Model, an open source techno-economic analysis tool, was employed to simulate photovoltaic production and cash flows to calculate the economic feasibility including the levelized cost of electricity, net present value, internal rate of return and payback period. Results showed that investment in a 3-kilowatt photovoltaic system with debt fraction of 50% and 100% cash was profitable, while investment in a 3-kilowatt photovoltaic system through a solar power purchasing agreement and leasing was not economically viable.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"
The Role of Aberrations in the Immune-Inflammatory Response System (IRS) and the Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Different Phenotypes of Schizophrenia: the IRS-CIRS Theory of Schizophrenia,"Roomruangwong C., Noto C., Kanchanatawan B., Anderson G., Kubera M., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2020-02-01,"Humans, Immune System, Inflammation, Models, Biological, Phenotype, Reflex, Schizophrenia, CIRS, Cytokines, Immune regulatory, Immune system, Immunology, Inflammation, Psychiatry, Psychosis, Schizophrenia","Several lines of evidence indicate that aberrations in immune-inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework that was previously developed for major depression and bipolar disorder, namely, the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS), as applied to the neuro-immune pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its phenotypes, including first-episode psychosis (FEP), acute relapses, chronic and treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), comorbid depression, and deficit schizophrenia. These schizophrenia phenotypes and manifestations are accompanied by increased production of positive acute-phase proteins, including haptoglobin and α2-macroglobulin, complement factors, and macrophagic M1 (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), T helper (Th)-1 (interferon-γ and IL-2R), Th-2 (IL-4, IL-5), Th-17 (IL-17), and T regulatory (Treg; IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1) cytokines, cytokine-induced activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway, and chemokines, including CCL-11 (eotaxin), CCL-2, CCL-3, and CXCL-8. While the immune profiles in the different schizophrenia phenotypes indicate the activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), there are simultaneous signs of CIRS activation, including increased levels of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), sIL-2R and tumor necrosis factor-α receptors, Th-2 and Treg phenotypes with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, and increased levels of TRYCATs and haptoglobin, α2-macroglobulin, and other acute-phase reactants, which have immune-regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are also detected in TRS, chronic, and deficit schizophrenia, indicating that these conditions are accompanied by a new homeostatic setpoint between upregulated IRS and CIRS components. In FEP, increased baseline CIRS activity is a protective factor that may predict favorable clinical outcomes. Moreover, impairments in the CIRS are associated with deficit schizophrenia and greater impairments in semantic and episodic memory. It is concluded that CIRS plays a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by negatively regulating the primary IRS and contributing to recovery from the acute phase of illness. Therefore, components of the CIRS may offer promising therapeutic targets for schizophrenia.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The microstructure, hardness friction and wear properties of the deposits were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed uniform deposition of a nodular structure in the Ni-W-B/B composite coatings. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to qualitatively compare the amount of boron in the composite coatings prepared using bath temperatures of 50 °C and 75 °C. Incorporation of amorphous boron particles was found to enhance the hardness of the Ni-W-B coatings by as much as 11.8%. A maximal hardness value of 680.9 ± 17.7 HV0.05 was obtained from the Ni-W-B/B composite coatings with 5 g/L boron loading and prepared using the higher plating bath temperature, 75 °C. Hardness could also be further improved by approximately 16.1% through heat treatment at 500 °C. Furthermore, using a plating bath temperature of 75 °C also resulted in films with lower friction coefficients and better wear resistance.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

Currently, selective COX-2 inhibitors can provide effective pain reduction with less platelet inhibition compared with conventional NSAIDs. We aimed to compare the analgesic effect and perioperative blood loss (PBL) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between ketorolac and parecoxib administration. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study of 100 unilateral TKAs. The ketorolac group of 50 patients received an intraoperative periarticular injection (PAI) with 100 mg of bupivacaine and 30 mg of ketorolac. Afterwards, 30 mg of ketorolac was intravenously injected every 12 h until 48 h. In the parecoxib group of 50 patients, 20 mg of parecoxib was added to PAI, and the first intravenous dose was 20 mg followed by 40 mg every 12 h. The primary outcomes were visual analog scales (VASs) of postoperative pain, amount of morphine consumption, PBL, and blood transfusion rate. Results: The ketorolac group had a significantly lower VAS pain score than the parecoxib group at 6 h after TKA (2.38 ± 2.52 vs. 4.12 ± 2.86, P < 0.01). Thereafter, the VAS of both groups and total morphine consumption at 24 and 48 h were comparable. The PBLs of the ketorolac and parecoxib groups were 529.72 ± 263.02 and 402.40 ± 191.47 ml, respectively (P = 0.01). However, the blood transfusion rates between groups were not different. Conclusion: Parecoxib provides comparable analgesic effects to ketorolac. Additionally, perioperative use of parecoxib is safe and is associated with significantly less blood loss after TKA.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

A maximum CO conversion level of 94% was obtained with 1% by weight Au/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 at 50 °C, while the presence of water and carbon dioxide in the feed stream had only a slight effect on the catalytic activity. Catalyst characterizations were performed to investigate the effect of the Ce:Zr molar ratios on the redox properties and physicochemical properties of the obtained Au/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts. It was found that a certain amount of Ce in the Au/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst promoted solid solution formation and facilitated the activity of Au3+ and Au0 nanoparticles with a small crystallite size. The enhanced catalytic activity of Au/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 was attributed to the presence of more oxygen vacancies, easier reducibility, and appropriate amount of Au3+ species, as confirmed by Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy and hydrogen-temperature-programme reduction analyses, respectively. The catalytic activity showed a high stability for a long period of time (28 h).","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Chemistry (all)

Rapid pathogen identification is mandatory, but fresh tissue is not always available. A polymerase chain reaction method was designed in order to detect fungi in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. This was applied to a retrospective series of tissue biopsies from Thai patients with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis.Methods Tissue blocks from 64 cases yielded adequate DNA. Three sequential polymerase chain reaction were performed: ZP3 (housekeeping gene) and panfungal polymerase chain reactions, and a differentiating polymerase chain reaction based on the 5.8s ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer 2 regions. The polymerase chain reaction products were then sequenced.Results Polymerase chain reaction identified a fungal pathogen in 20 of 64 cases (31 per cent). Aspergillus species was the most common cause of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (nine cases). Other causes included candida (n = 4), cladosporium (n = 4), mucor (n = 1), alternaria (n = 1) and dendryphiella (n = 1) species.Conclusion Polymerase chain reaction can provide rapid identification of fungal pathogens in paraffin-embedded tissue, enabling prompt treatment of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis.",medical,Otorhinolaryngology

Only a pair in the pectoral area is spared from regression and continuously develops into normal breasts. Accessory breasts can result if the regression process is incomplete. These ectopic breasts can change physiologically and pathologically similar to normal breasts. Unsurprisingly, they are capable of turning malignant. Reported cases show the most common area for accessory breast cancer to be the axillary area. We report a rare case of accessory breast cancer over the costal ridge. Case presentation: We present the case of a 51-year-old Asian woman who complained of an enlarged mass lower to her left breast developed over the period of 3 months while on contraceptive pills. Unaware that the mass could be an accessory breast, the primary doctor had prescribed oral contraceptives. After our patient had noticed that the mass was obviously growing, she decided to consult a surgeon as the mass continued to grow. Expected to be benign, the mass was investigated by ultrasonography and then excised surgically. A pathology report identified the mass to be a carcinoma of the ectopic breast tissue. However, sentinel lymph node biopsy showed no nodal metastasis of all four lymph nodes. Following surgery, she received chemotherapy, radiation, and antihormonal treatment. After 2 years of postoperative follow up, she remained free of disease. Conclusions: This patient was diagnosed as having accessory breast cancer which presented with a subcutaneous mass. As this condition is exceptionally rare but curable by early treatments, we recommend surgeons to consider potential malignancy when patients present with a subcutaneous mass.",medical,Medicine (all)

This work aimed to explore a simple way to prepare cellulose nanofibers using water-based approach via mechanical defibrillation. Cellulose fibers were first extracted from water hyacinth towards chemical treatments and then mechanically disintegrated as a function of defibrillation cycles. The morphologies, thermal stabilities, physical properties, and rheological characteristics of the micro- and nanofibers were demonstrated. It was found that the obtained nanofibers having a diameter of 5–50 nm and were successfully prepared within 10 defibrillation cycles. Even though longer defibrillation cycles greatly provided higher water retention value and specific surface area, a gradual decrease in crystallinity index, thermal degradation temperatures, and degree of polymerization was also observed. Based on the rheological properties, the storage modulus and steady viscosity of the as-prepared nanofibers suspension increased significantly as a function of defibrillation, resulting in a gel-like structure with a shear-thinning behavior. Additionally, the rheological parameters of the obtained nanofibers estimated using a Herschel-Bulkley model were more accurate than that estimated using a Bingham-Plastic model. The obtained nanofibers could be used as a prime candidate for many potential applications.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

We employed Raman spectroscopy to investigate SLG on a Cu substrate that was compressed up to 8 GPa and 20 GPa with 2.2% and 4.6% compressive strain, respectively, followed by laser-heating. After laser-heating, G and 2D peaks exhibit a redshift, and then form a hysteresis loop during decompression. This phenomenon can be due to either of two mechanisms, or both; the formation of C–H chemical bonds in massive hydrogenated SLG, and a reduction of the frictional stress between SLG and Cu substrate causing a relaxation of SLG lattice toward its free-standing equilibrium structure. The correlation between G and 2D peaks also changes significantly after laser-heating at 8 GPa, resembling the correlation measured in hole-doping experiments. Finally, residual hydrogen remains bonded to the graphene layer after decompression to ambient pressure, and the amount of hydrogen increases as a function of pressure at which the sample was laser-heated.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all)"

To avoid negative effects of oxidation, ceramic-based materials having low thermal conductivity and high stability should be used to hot section components. In accordance with this purpose, thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are used in order to increase the lifetime of gas turbine engine components that have not reached to desired levels yet. Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been used as a conventional top coat material in TBCs. Increased the turbine inlet temperatures (TIT) promote to researchers to try higher stable material such as rare earth zirconates. In this study, CoNiCrAlY metallic powders were sprayed using a new emerging technique as called cold gas dynamic spray (CGDS) on Inconel 718 substrates.

The effect of the type and content of silane coupling agent used in the SPA dispersion synthesis on the resulting morphology and physical properties of the obtained SPA dispersion and coating films were studied. The results revealed that SPA dispersion synthesized using VTES exhibited a smaller particle size and a higher stability than those using MPTMS. Furthermore, the hydrophobic surfaces and water repellence of the coating films using VTES in the emulsion were higher than those using MPTMS, due to the smoother surface morphology.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The test cases involve five commercial buildings of five different building types, i.e., academic, research laboratory, office, school and grocery store, located at five different locations in Bangkok-Thailand, Hyderabad-India, Virginia-USA, New York-USA, and Massachusetts-USA. Load forecasting results indicate that the deep learning algorithms implemented in this paper deliver 20–45% improvement in load forecasting performance as compared to the current state-of-the-art results for both hour-ahead and 24-ahead load forecasting. With respect to sensitivity analysis, it is found that: (i) the use of hybrid deep learning algorithms can take as less as one month of data to deliver satisfactory hour-ahead load prediction, (ii) similar to the clustering technique, 15-min resolution data, if available, delivers 30% improvement in hour-ahead load forecasting, and (iii) the formulated methods are found to be robust against weather forecasting errors. Lastly, the forecasting results across all five buildings validate the robustness of the proposed deep learning framework for the short-term building-level electrical load forecasting tasks.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, energy, environmental","Building and Construction, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies of dialysis patients that compared the characteristics of HBV vaccine responders and non-responders. Mortality was also analyzed according to the vaccine immune response (defined by hepatitis B surface antibody titer > 10 mIU/mL). Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed to compute a weighted mean difference (WMD), a pooled odds ratio (OR), and a pooled risk ratio (RR) between groups. Results: We identified 61 studies with a total of 6628 dialysis patients who completed the course of HBV vaccination, 4582 responders (69%) and 2046 non-responders (31%). By meta-analysis, relative to non-responders, HBV vaccine responders had a higher dialysis adequacy as measured by Kt/V (WMD 0.08, P < 0.001), a higher serum albumin (WMD 0.12 gm/dL, P < 0.001), a higher normalized protein catabolic rate (WMD 0.12 gm/kg/day, P = 0.001), a higher hemoglobin (WMD 0.15 gm/L, P = 0.03), and a higher parathyroid hormone level (WMD 44 pg/mL, P = 0.004). HBV vaccine responders were younger (WMD − 4.68 years, P < 0.001), had been on dialysis for longer (WMD 2.60 months, P < 0.001), were less likely to have diabetes mellitus (pooled OR 0.65, P < 0.001), and were less likely to carry the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR3 (pooled OR 0.38, P = 0.01). Compared to non-responders, HBV vaccine responders had lower risk for all-cause mortality (pooled RR 0.64, P < 0.001), and lower risk for cardiovascular-related mortality (pooled RR 0.74, P = 0.02). Conclusion: In dialysis patients, the lack of immune response to the HBV vaccine is associated with older age, diabetes mellitus, HLA-DR3 status, shorter time on dialysis, lower nutritional status, lower hemoglobin, lower PTH level, and lower dialysis adequacy. Tackling some of these modifiable factors might improve the HBV vaccine immune response.",medical,Nephrology

In the electro-induced bending measurement, the highest deflection distance was obtained from the AG HyGel_2.0 %v/v due to its initial lower rigidity. Relative to other bio-based hydrogels, the present AG HyGels are first demonstrated here as electroactive materials showing comparable magnitudes in the electroactive responses, but with the simple fabrication method without toxic ingredients required. Thus, the present AG HyGels are potential material candidates for soft actuator applications.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
Mixed-integer linear program for the operational harvest scheduling problem: An application to the thai sugar industry,"Chotivanich T., Jarumaneeroj P.",2020-08-07,"Carbon emissions, Computational results, Conflicting objectives, Harvest scheduling, Mixed integer linear program, Mixed integer linear programming model, Resource selection, Supply chain actors, Mixed-Integer Programming, Resource Scheduling, Traveling Salesman Problem, Vehicle Routing Problem","Thai sugar industry is relatively unique due to the existence of local restrictions and practices, such as grower equity and sugarcane farm burning. All of which are interrelated and stipulated by different conflicting objectives of different key supply chain actors. In order to address these issues, a mixed-integer linear programming model for this so-called Operational Harvest Scheduling Problem (OHSP) is formulated and solved under four different aspects: (i) maximizing sugarcane input, (ii) maximizing grower profits, (iii) minimizing industrial yield loss, and (iv) minimizing environmental impact. Our preliminary computational results on 30 fictitious instances indicated that, regardless of the chosen objectives, the resulting sugarcane input did not differ much, with the maximal gap around 10% across four settings. Nonetheless, the other three objective values differed greatly and depended on the harvesting resource selection. More specifically, green sugarcane harvesting was the best in terms of both carbon emission and grower interests, while burnt sugarcane harvesting was the best in terms of extractable sugar amount. We also found that the number of harvesting resources largely affected the quality of the OHSP solutions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Experiments were conducted by exposing Ca2+ and CO3 2− solutions to magnetic fields. The solutions were then combined to form CaCO3 particles. Three characteristics of CaCO3 formation reaction have been investigated, namely absorbance differentiation, vibrational modes and crystal structure. Absorbances were measured using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer, while vibrational modes were measured using Flourier transform (FT) infrared and FT Raman spectroscopies. X-ray diffractometer was used to determine the crystal structure. Experimental results show that the nucleation of CaCO3 crystals was inhibited when starting solutions were exposed to magnetic fields. The effect of magnetic fields was mainly attributed to CO3 2− solution and remained for more than 144 h after starting solutions were combined. As various magnetic field strengths were applied to the solutions, aragonite was formed, and aragonite/calcite ratios were proportional to magnetic field strengths. Using the X-ray technique, the measured crystal structure indicated that the aragonite/calcite ratio increased from 10 to 82% when the magnetic field strength was increased from 60 to 460 mT for the duration of 8 min.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

The PEM primer films were coated on the glass substrate by the sequential deposition of 7 or 8 layers of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(styrene sulfonate) to improve the adhesion of AgNW and produce flexible transparent conducting electrode. AgNW, with a diameter of 20–30 nm and 10–30 µm in length, were synthesized using a modified solvothermal method using glycerol and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as reducing and capping agent. The physicochemical properties of the AgNW coated PEM were characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope. The electrical conductivity of the layer was measured by 4 points probe and a standard scotch tape peeling test was used to investigate the stability of the coated AgNW on the PEM. The PEM 7 layers (with PDADMAC as outer layer) gave the best results to immobilize AgNW with the lowest sheet resistance (14 Ω/square) while maintaining excellent transparency (85% transmission at 550 nm) even after up to 6 peeling test cycles. Finally, to demonstrate the benefit of this method, poly(ethylene terephthalate) sheet was coated with PEM primer and AgNW to produce flexible transparent conducting electrode.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Refractory hypotension is rare on admission but develops frequently in fatal cases. We assessed cardiac function and volume status in severe falciparum malaria and its prognostic significance. Methods: Patients with severe (N = 101) or acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria (N = 83) were recruited from 2 hospitals in India and Bangladesh, and healthy participants (N = 44) underwent echocardiography. Results: Patients with severe malaria had 38% shorter left ventricular (LV) filling times and 25% shorter LV ejection times than healthy participants because of tachycardia; however, stroke volume, LV internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd), and LV internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) indices were similar. A low endocardial fraction shortening (eFS) was present in 17% (9 of 52) of severe malaria patients. Adjusting for preload and afterload, eFS was similar in health and severe malaria. Fatal cases had smaller baseline LVIDd and LVIDs indices, more collapsible inferior vena cavae (IVC), and higher heart rates than survivors. The LVIDs and IVC collapsibility were independent predictors for mortality, together with base excess and Glasgow Coma Scale. Conclusions: Patients with severe malaria have rapid ejection of a normal stroke volume.

However, the knowledge regarding BRCA mutation in Thai patients is limited. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence and characteristics of somatic and germline BRCA 1 and 2 mutations in Thai patients with these cancers. Materials and Methods: The paraffin blocks of tumors with histology of high grade serous, high grade endometrioid, or clear cell carcinoma obtained between June 2016 and December 2017 were analyzedto evaluate BRCA mutation using next-generation sequencing system. Blood or normal tissue paraffin blocks of positive patients were further tested for germline BRCA mutation. Results: Tissue paraffin blocks of 178 patients were collected but only 139 were analyzed. Positive BRCA mutation was identified in 24 patients (17.3%): BRCA1 in 13 cases, BRCA2 in 10 cases, and BRCA1 and 2 in the rest one. Germline mutation study in blood or normal tissue in 23 positive patients revealed BRCA mutation in 14 cases, BRCA1 in 8 cases and BRCA 2 in 6 cases. Overall, the prevalence of somatic and germline mutation was 6.5% (9 out of 138 patients) and 8.7% (14 out of 138 patients), respectively. The most common histology associated with BRCA mutation was high grade serous cancer (27.3%). No significant difference was found between patients with or without BRCA mutation in terms of stage, outcome, platinum status, and survival outcome. Conclusion: BRCA mutation was demonstrated in less than 10% of Thai ovarian cancer patients. Higher rate of mutation was found in high grade serous cancer.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Methods: In this study, ViSafe Green (VSG), which is a nucleic acid-binding fluorescent dye, was used for assessing in vitro development of P. falciparum using flow cytometry. Results: Fluorescence intensity of VSG was found to depend on the developmental stage of parasites. Specifically, multiple-nuclei-containing schizonts were observed in the VSGhigh population, and growing trophozoites and ring-shaped forms were observed in the VSGintermediate and VSGlow populations. The efficacy of VSG-based assay was found to be comparable to the microscopic examination method, and it demonstrated an ability to detect as low as 0.001% of the parasitaemia estimated by Giemsa staining. Moreover, when applying VSG for anti-malarial drug test, it was able to observe the growth inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin, the front-line drug for malaria therapy. Conclusions: Taken together, the results of this study suggest the VSG-based flow cytometric assay to be a simple and reliable assay for assessing P. falciparum malaria development in vitro.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"
Inhibition of topoisomerase IIα and induction of DNA damage in cholangiocarcinoma cells by altholactone and its halogenated benzoate derivatives,"Kitdumrongthum S., Reabroi S., Suksen K., Tuchinda P., Munyoo B., Mahalapbutr P., Rungrotmongkol T., Ounjai P., Chairoungdua A.",2020-07-01,"Apoptosis, Benzoates, Bile Duct Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cholangiocarcinoma, DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded, DNA Damage, DNA Topoisomerases, Type II, Furans, Humans, Molecular Docking Simulation, Pyrones, Topoisomerase II Inhibitors, Altholactone, Cholangiocarcinoma, Halogenated benzoate, Topoisomerase IIα","Topoisomerase IIα enzyme (Topo IIα) plays a critical function in DNA replication process and is considered to be a promising target of anti-cancer drugs. In the present study, we reported that the altholactone derivatives modified by adding a halogenated benzoate group showed greater inhibitory activity on Topo IIα enzyme in cell-free system concomitant with cytotoxicity against the CCA cell lines (KKU-M055 and KKU-M213) than those of the parent altholactone. However, the cytotoxic activities of four halogenated benzoate altholactone derivatives including iodo-, fluoro-, chloro-, and bromobenzoate derivatives (compound 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) were of equal potency. The fluorobenzoate derivative (compound 2) was chosen for investigating the underlying mechanism in CCA cells. Compound 2 arrested CCA cell cycle at sub G1 phase and induced apoptotic cell death. It markedly inhibited Topo IIα protein expression in both KKU-M055 and KKU-M213 cells, which was accompanied by DNA double-strand breaks demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylated H2A.X protein. Interestingly, KKU-M055 cells, which express higher Topo IIα mRNA compared to KKU-M213 cells, showed greater sensitivity to the compound, indicating the selectivity of the compound to Topo IIα enzyme. By computational docking analysis, the binding affinity of altholactone (-52.5 kcal/mol) and compound 2 (-56.7 kcal/mol) were similar to that of the Topo II poison salvicine (-53.7 kcal/mol). The aromatic moiety of both altholactones embedded in a hydrophobic pocket of Topo II ATPase domain. In addition, compound 2 induced the formation of linear DNA in Topo II-mediated cleavage assay. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the addition of fluorobenzoyl group to altholactone enhances potency and selectivity to inhibit type IIα topoisomerases. Atholactone and fluorobenzoate derivative act as Topo II cleavage complexes stabilizing compounds or Topo II poisons preferentially through binding at ATPase domain of Topo IIα, leading to DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis induction. Such activity of 3-fluorobenzoate derivative of altholactone should be further explored for the development of an anti-cancer drug for CCA.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Effects of ECO mass concentrations on curing characteristics, thermal stability, dynamic mechanical properties, and shape memory properties are determined by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and shape memory tests, respectively. Storage moduli at the glassy state and glass transition temperatures (T g) of V-fa/ECO and E-fa/ECO copolymers decrease with increasing ECO mass concentrations. The bending tests performed with a universal testing machine are employed to evaluate the shape memory properties of the developed bio-based copolymers. V-fa/ECO SMPs show excellent shape fixity of 86%-94% at room temperature and high shape recovery at T g + 20 °C of 81%-96%. V-fa/ECO SMPs can undergo fold-deploy shape memory cycles without altering the shape memory performances for at least 5 cycles.

In addition, the technology related to the electric business has been developed rapidly, such as solar power development technology, energy storage, and various communication and measurement devices, etc. The development of these technologies together with the reduced cost of technologies is the main factor in the transformation of the electric business model in many countries around the world, including Thailand to the way that electricity users turn from being consumers only to be both consumers and producers of electricity or called as prosumers. Also, it drives to the new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading, where consumers and prosumers can buy or sell electricity locally. However, the concept of peer to peer energy trading is at early stage in Thailand. This study points out the benefits and barriers of peer to peer energy market based on reviewed existing peer to peer energy projects worldwide.

A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified by depositing gold nanoparticles followed by L-cysteine for obtaining a self-assembled monolayer. The SpyTagged nanobody C1, specific for the A. minutum toxic strain AL9T, was then covalently immobilized via SpyCatcher on the surface of the modified electrode and used for the selective capture of such microalgae strain. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for the quantification of A. minutum cells present in water samples by measuring the charge-transfer resistance changes of the electrode with a hexacyanoferrate probe. Each electrode modification step was accompanied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The immunosensor provided highly reproducible data, was simple to fabricate at low cost, exhibited higher sensitivity than previously described alternative diagnostic methods and showed a broad linear range between 103 and 109 cells L−1 with detection limit of 3 × 103 cells L−1 of A. minutum AL9T.

To further strengthen the algorithm, the platform of the MOEA/D was hybridized with the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm and the adaptive mechanism was also embedded, namely AMOEA/D-BBO. The performances in Pareto sense of AMOEA/D-BBO were evaluated on various problem sizes in comparison with the MOEA/D-BBO, MOEA/D and BBO algorithms. The experimental results demonstrated that AMOEA/D-BBO outperforms the other algorithms in terms of the convergence rate and spread.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Control and Systems Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Preparation and properties of graphene / poly(Ethylene terephthalate) composite fibers,"Samsaray T., Potiyaraj P.",2020-01-01,"Elongation at break, Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy, Nanocomposite fibers, Novel nanocomposites, Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), Reduced graphene oxides (RGO), Thermal and mechanical properties, Thermal degradation temperatures, Composite fibers, Graphene composite fibers, Graphene/PET composite fibers, PET composite fibers, Poly(ethylene terephthalate)","A novel nanocomposite fibers were prepared from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via melt spinning and their thermal and mechanical properties were investigated. Graphite oxide and rGO were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). FT-IR spectrum of GO and rGO showed the same peak of O-H stretching of the hydroxyl and C=C stretching of aromatic rings as well as C-O stretching. The thermal stability of pristine PET and rGO/PET composite masterbatch was characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermal degradation temperature of PET and rGO/PET nanocomposite masterbatch was found at 413.9 °C and 418.1 °C, respectively. The mechanical properties of rGO/PET nanocomposite fibers were investigated and it was found that the mechanical properties were improved in all aspects comparing with neat PET fiber, including tensile strength, young's modulus and elongation at break.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Solenoidal magnets, Transverse momentum jets, Calorimeters, Performance of High Energy Physics Detectors","Methods are presented for calibrating the hadron calorimeter system of the CMS detector at the LHC. The hadron calorimeters of the CMS experiment are sampling calorimeters of brass and scintillator, and are in the form of one central detector and two endcaps. These calorimeters cover pseudorapidities |η| < 3 and are positioned inside the solenoidal magnet. An outer calorimeter, outside the magnet coil, covers |η| < 1.26, and a steel and quartz-fiber Cherenkov forward calorimeter extends the coverage to |η| < 5.19. The initial calibration of the calorimeters was based on results from test beams, augmented with the use of radioactive sources and lasers. The calibration was improved substantially using proton-proton collision data collected at s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV, as well as cosmic ray muon data collected during the periods when the LHC beams were not present. The present calibration is performed using the 13 TeV data collected during 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The intercalibration of channels exploits the approximate uniformity of energy collection over the azimuthal angle. The absolute energy scale of the central and endcap calorimeters is set using isolated charged hadrons. The energy scale for the electromagnetic portion of the forward calorimeters is set using Z→ ee data. The energy scale of the outer calorimeters has been determined with test beam data and is confirmed through data with high transverse momentum jets. In this paper, we present the details of the calibration methods and accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

Recent data indicate a role for the endogenous opioidergic system in MDD. This article reviews the roles and physiological interactions of the endogenous opioidergic system in the pathophysiology and heterogeneity of MDD. Methods: Articles on the pathophysiology of MDD, as well as on the endogenous opioidergic system and mito-chondrial function, form the basis of this review article. Results: The endogenous opioidergic system is intimately linked to wider MDD pathophysiology, including alterations in the gut microbiome, gut permeability, circadian rhythm, amygdala-prefrontal cortex interactions, and mitochondrial function. A decrease in the µ-/κ-opioid receptor ratio is an important mediator of the changes in mood in MDD, with effects not only on neurons, but also on glia and immune cells. Conclusion: The endogenous opioidergic system is intimately interwoven with MDD pathophysiology and pro-vides a relevant target for novel treatment development, as well as providing a focus for the integration of wider MDD pathophysiology.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Recent evidence suggested that common genetic variations may underlie BrS in a complex inheritance model. Objective: The purpose of this study was to find common and rare/low-frequency genetic variants predisposing to BrS in persons in Thailand. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the association of common variants in 154 Thai BrS cases and 432 controls. We sequenced SCN5A in 131 cases and 205 controls. Variants were classified according to current guidelines, and case-control association testing was performed for rare and low-frequency variants. Results: Two loci were significantly associated with BrS. The first was near SCN5A/SCN10A (lead marker rs10428132; odds ratio [OR] 2.4; P = 3 × 10–10). Conditional analysis identified a novel independent signal in the same locus (rs6767797; OR 2.3; P = 2.7 × 10–10). The second locus was near HEY2 (lead marker rs3734634; OR 2.5; P = 7 × 10–9). Rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.0001) coding variants in SCN5A were found in 8 of the 131 cases (6.1% in cases vs 2.0% in controls; P = .046; OR 3.3; 95% confident interval [CI] 1.0–11.1), but an enrichment of low-frequency (MAF<0.001 and >0.0001) variants also was observed in cases, with 1 variant (SCN5A: p.Arg965Cys) detected in 4.6% of Thai BrS patients vs 0.5% in controls (P = 0.015; OR 9.8; 95% CI 1.2–82.3). Conclusion: The genetic basis of BrS in Thailand includes a wide spectrum of variant frequencies and effect sizes. As previously shown in European and Japanese populations, common variants near SCN5A and HEY2 are associated with BrS in the Thai population, confirming the transethnic transferability of these 2 major BrS loci.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"
Plumbagin inhibited AKT signaling pathway in HER-2 overexpressed-endocrine resistant breast cancer cells,"Sakunrangsit N., Ketchart W.",2020-02-05,"Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal, Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic, Breast Neoplasms, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Female, Humans, MCF-7 Cells, Naphthoquinones, Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Receptor, ErbB-2, Receptors, Estrogen, Signal Transduction, AKT, Endocrine-resistance, HER-2, PLB","The important mechanism of endocrine resistance is the crosstalk between estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 signaling pathways. Aside from ER downregulation, there was an increase in HER2 expression and increased activation of the downstream AKT/ERK pathways in endocrine-resistant cells (MCF-7/LCC2 and MCF-7/LCC9) which is similar to HER2-overexpressed (SKBR3) cells. However, nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3), the important ER-coactivator, that upregulated in endocrine-resistant cells did not express in HER2-overexpressed (SKBR3) cells. NCOA3 was able to activate AKT/ERK signalling pathway. Our previous study reported that plumbagin (PLB), a naphthoquinone compound, had a potent cytotoxic activity against endocrine-resistant cells. This study aimed to further investigate the mechanism of anti-cancer effects of PLB on ER and HER-2 signaling. PLB can inhibit estradiol (E2)-induced cell proliferation in MCF-7 wild-type cells but had no effect in the resistant cells. It also inhibited HER2 expression in both endocrine-resistant and HER-2 overexpressed cells. Therefore, the mechanism of PLB may be regulated through HER-2 signaling. PLB inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT) and pERK1/2 and induced apoptosis and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and pro-caspase 3 and Cleaved Caspase 3 protein in both endocrine-resistant and HER-2 overexpressed cells. However, the inhibitory effect of PLB was more obvious when pre-treated the cells with AKT inhibitor only in HER-2 overexpressed cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of PLB on pAKT was attenuated when NCOA3 was downregulated. Our finding suggested that the inhibitory effect of PLB on AKT signaling pathways regulated through NCOA3 in HER2-overexpressed endocrine-resistant cells.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

He was suspected of having gnathostomiasis and treated with albendazole and prednisolone for 3 weeks. Nine months later, he was treated with high-dose oral prednisolone for the preliminary and differential diagnoses with thy-roid-associated orbitopathy and lymphoma. He had been administered prednisolone intermittently over a few years. Then he developed a painless movable mass at the left upper eyelid and recurrent pseudotumor oculi was suspected. The sur-gical removal of the mass was performed. A white pseudosegmented worm revealed a definite diagnosis of ocular spar-ganosis by a plerocercoid larva. Molecular diagnosis of the causative species was made based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene. Proper technique of extraction and amplification of short fragments DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue successfully identified parasite species.

However, previous cutoff values have shown a positive predictive value (PPV) of only 50% or less. This study aimed to define more specific indicators to reduce the need for DNA tests. Methods: Patients with Hb E trait, as diagnosed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and/or isoelectric focusing (IEF) techniques, were tested for α0-thalassemia and α+-thalassemia deletions using multiplex gap polymerase chain reaction. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were excluded using a red cell distribution width (RDW) of more than 14.5%. Results: From 390 specimens, suitable cutoff values showing a 100% sensitivity for detection of heterozygous α0-thalassemia were an Hb E level of less than 22% by HPLC, a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of less than 72 fL, and a mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) level of less than 22.5 pg. Comparable results were obtained in the validation cohort (N = 179). Using a combination of Hb E with either MCV or MCH cutoff points gave a PPV of 76.2% and 77.4%, respectively. Discussion: IDA was reported to interfere with Hb E level. In this study, we excluded IDA using RDW of more than 14.5% to enhance the test specificity. Conclusion: Lower cutoff screening values can be used to exclude α0-thalassemia in the Hb E trait yielding a higher specificity in a normal RDW condition. This can save the cost and labor of DNA testing.",medical,Hematology

However, infiltration of irrigation water in excess of available root zone storage from agricultural lands with poorer water quality may carry both agricultural chemicals and naturally recharge to groundwater, rivers, and lakes. In recent years water security concerns have centered on groundwater depletion by withdrawals for irrigated agriculture and groundwater quality degradation both from natural and anthropogenic origin, and only limited attention has been paid to the more insidious (and more chronic) problems of progressive aquifer contamination of groundwater recharge by irrigation return flows, which is occurring in major intensive agricultural practices. Environmental vulnerability and risk assessment is a step towards identification, analysis, and classification of vulnerable and risk factors as well as its long-term implications, and thus reduction of the possibility of adverse consequences from irrigation, are the primary objective of this present study. A novel approach for environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability assessment is initiated and applied by combining a novel aquifer vulnerability DRASTIC map with pollution severity and prioritization based in probability of occurrence of pollution using TOPSIS ranking method. 9% of the total study area is categorized as high risk level which needs intensive groundwater samples from domestic and monitoring wells at various depths (100 samples from <30 m deep, and 60 samples from >60 m deep) are collected and analyzed for nitrate (as NO3-), K. sulphate (as SO42-) and other water quality parameters. NO3- level in groundwater ranged from 0.18 to 151 mg/L. Consistent K and NO3- trends from municipal wells in the study area indicate that nitrate source is likely agricultural origin. Detection of high nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater suggests the direct association of major nitrate concentration in groundwater aquifer with potential surficial source on the ground.","water engineeringneering, environmental","Ecology, Environmental Engineering"

Firstly, the water hyacinth (WH) was subjected to a series of a two-step chemical treatment, NaOH/urea pretreatment, and mechanical defibrillation at different defibrillation times. After that, raw water hyacinth fiber (RWF), bleached water hyacinth fiber (BWF), NaOH/urea pretreated water hyacinth fiber (PWF), and the resulting NFC were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) as well as rheological measurements. It was found that RWF and BWF exhibited cellulose I crystal structure, whereas PWF and the obtained NFC possessed cellulose II crystal structure. FTIR analysis confirmed the evidence that no other chemical reactions preferentially occurred during both NaOH/urea pretreatment and mechanical defibrillation. As evidenced by rheological properties analysis, the NFC aqueous suspension with a gel-like structure demonstrated a shear-thinning behavior. The obtained NFC could potentially be utilized as a reinforcement for polymeric composites.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Methods: The dataset of 1156 outpatients with chronic diseases from 3 public university hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand, were applied. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measure of Pharmaceutical Therapy for Quality of Life (PROMPT-QoL) was utilized to assess PTRQoL. HU measures included EQ-5D-5L and EuroQoL-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS). Multiple linear regressions using a stepwise approach were applied to evaluate the relationships between the PROMPT-QoL and the HU scores. Results: The results found that the EQ-5D-5L was mostly correlated with the impacts of medicines and side-effects followed by the medicine effectiveness, psychologic impacts of medication use, and availability and accessibility domains of the PROMPT-QoL, respectively (actual R2 about 18%). The EQ-VAS was mostly associated with the impacts of medicines and side-effects, followed by the medicine effectiveness and overall quality of life domains, respectively (actual R2 about 14%). Conclusions: The PROMPT-QoL had medium correlations with the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS scores. Their relationships depended on HU approaches used. More research is needed to examine the relationships between the PROMPT-QoL or other PTRQoL instruments and other HU scores in other settings and populations.","Economics, pharmacology, medical","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous), Health Policy"

The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a widely used instrument that has become the standard for assessment of tardive dyskinesia (TDD), the most common form of TDS. However, the AIMS has a number of clinimetric limitations and was designed primarily to assess the anatomic distribution and severity of involuntary movements without regard to phenomenology. To build on recent advances in understanding and treatment of TDS, re-evaluation and revision of the AIMS that could aid both clinical practice and research may be worthwhile. Challenges, such as retaining the efficiency of the current AIMS, incorporating evaluation of impairment in daily activities, and re-training clinicians for a revised examination procedure and rating instrument, are very likely surmountable.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

Digital Twin for Metasurface Reflector Management in 6G Terahertz Communications,"Pengnoo M., Barros M.T., Wuttisittikulkij L., Butler B., Davy A., Balasubramaniam S.",2020-01-01,"Data-intensive application, Image processing system, Material compositions, Multimedia streaming, Sender and receivers, Terahertz communication, Tunable metamaterials, Wireless communication links, 6G communications, digital twin, metasurface, Terahertz","The performance demands from data-intensive applications, such as multimedia streaming, as well as the growing number of devices connecting to the Internet, will increase the need for higher capacity wireless communication links. The research community has recently explored regions of the spectrum, including the Terahertz band (0.1 THz to 10 THz), that are underutilised for communications. THz frequencies come with a plethora of special challenges, one of which is the very narrow effective beam, thereby requiring a Line of Sight (LoS) between sender and receiver. Researchers have explored the use of reflectors that can redirect beams around blockages. In this paper, we propose a THz signal guidance system where a Digital Twin is used to model, predict and control the signal propagation characteristics of an indoor space. Our approach finds the best THz signal path from the base station to the mobile target via the tunable metamaterial walls, avoiding obstacles as needed, using geometric (ray tracing), path loss and Terahertz Potential Field (THzPF) models. With this knowledge, the digital twin guides the selection of antenna strips at a base station and the reflectors along the signal path. A top-view camera, with advanced image processing, provides context updates (obstacle and mobile target locations) to the digital twin. The image processing system also senses factors like water vapour concentration, and the material composition and surface roughness of obstacles. Such factors affect propagation strength, and the digital twin modifies the beam paths to adapt. Simulation results have shown the efficiency of our control system to maintain a reliable signal connection while minimising the use of antenna and reflector strips. Our system is the first proposal that maximises THz signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through such a dynamic and robust control system, which integrates image processing of a room with base station configuration.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"
Natural rubber nanocomposites based on hybrid filler of zinc nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes: Electrical conductivity and other related properties,"Thongkong N., Wisunthorn S., Pichaiyut S., Nakason C., Kiatkamjornwong S.",2020-12-01,"Electrical conductivity, High electrical conductivity, Hybrid composites, Mechanical and electrical properties, Morphological properties, Rubber nanocomposites, Stress relaxation tests, Zinc nanoparticles, Carbon nanotube, Hybrid filler, Nanocomposites, Natural rubber, Zinc oxide nanoparticles","Hybrid filler of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were prepared and then mixed with natural rubber (NR). The ZnO nanoparticles were first synthesized by the sol–gel method. The NR-CNT/ZnO nanocomposites were prepared by latex mixing. Various proportions of ZnO in the CNT/ZnO hybrid filler were tested by mixing with NR to eventually form NR-CNT/ZnO nanocomposites. It was found that the optimum ZnO content in CNT/ZnO hybrid filler was about 3 phr. These ZnO contents provided the NR hybrid composite with superior mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength and modulus, together with good electrical conductivity and dielectric properties. In addition, stress relaxation tests revealed stronger filler network formation after incorporation of CNT-ZnO hybrid filler into the NR matrix. It might be due to electrostatic interactions between CNT and ZnO, also contributing to high electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of the NR-CNT/ZnO composites, when compared to a solely CNT filled NR composite. Furthermore, the Payne effect and morphological properties were qualitatively analyzed, indicating that CNT dispersion was finer in the NR-CNT/ZnO composites having about 1 to 3 phr ZnO content in CNT/ZnO. Higher contents of ZnO in CNT/ZnO hybrid filler caused large filler aggregates degrading mechanical and electrical properties.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

It can improve the implant surface-blood interaction resulting in improved implant osseointegration. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of fluoride on the hydrophilicity of the anodised films. The anodised films were performed by two-step anodisation at low current density in mixing solution of 1M H3PO4 (20 ml) + 80% v/v C2H5OH (20 ml) with different NaF concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 wt % (20 ml). The two-step anodisation using 2 mA/cm2 in 1M H3PO4 + 80% v/v C2H5OH + 4 wt % NaF could enhance hydrophilicity to the anodised films due to hydroxyl groups, surface roughness and the F−ions incorporated into the anodised films. Therefore, a high content of F−ions (4 wt % NaF) was shown to promote hydrophilicity of the anodised films.","physicsical properties of gases, liquids and solids, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst was synthesized by co-condensation with different molar ratios of tetraethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropyl(methyl)di-methoxy silane. The etherification reaction was systematically examined to determine the optimal reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading, and glycerol to n-butanol ratio under autogenous pressure. The maximum glycerol conversion and di-glyceryl n-butyl ether (di-GNBE) selectivity were 59.09 and 51.50%, respectively, when the SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst with the highest acidity was applied. Interestingly, the presence of a methyl group on the catalyst surface prevented glycerol adsorption during the reaction process, leading to the inhibition of undesired product formation. The SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst could be reused up to three times, with only a 13% decrease in glycerol conversion being found. Moreover, the superior performance of the SO3H-KIT-6 catalyst for di-GNBE production was also demonstrated compared with conventional solid acid catalysts including HZSM-5, H-beta zeolite, Amberlyst-35, and Amberlyst-36.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Fuel Technology, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology, Catalysis"

Spatial variation of heavy metals contamination in soil at the e-waste dismantling site in Daeng Yai subdistrict, Ban Mai Chaiphot district, Buriram province, was then investigated in April 2019. The surface soil was taken from e-waste and non-e-waste dismantling houses, open dumping and burning site, and reference site located 5 km away from the e-waste dismantling site. The heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the samples were extracted using acid digestion and analyzed by ICP-OES. The mean values of all heavy metals, except As, were highest in the burning site where the open-burning of wires and dumping of unwanted electronic materials are carried out, followed by those in e-waste and non-e-waste dismantling houses. The concentration of all heavy metals in the burning site was significantly higher than that found in the reference area (p &lt; 0.05). The concentration of all heavy metals were still compliance with Thai standard for residential and agricultural soils; however, Cu concentration (1,117.87 ± 2.09 mg/kg soil) at the burning site exceeded the Intervention Values of Netherlands (190 mg/kg soil). The results suggest that informal e-waste dismantling activities could lead to the contamination of heavy metals in soil. Therefore, a good manner of the environmental management system should be recommended for protecting the soil pollution from e-waste dismantling activities in the long run.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"

This paper presents a set of algorithms for controlling HVACs of a group of residential houses that a demand response aggregator can use to sell regulation service in the wholesale market. The focus is on the regulation market offered by the PJM RTO. Real-world regulation signals from PJM are used to simulate the performance and range of regulation services in a realistic scenario. After presenting the empirical counter example for why a universal optimal control strategy cannot exist for regulation, a set of heuristic algorithms is presented, which performs well in a range of test cases. The control mechanism involves a central controller communicating with smart thermostats of multiple residential houses to gather indoor temperature data, prioritizing them according to certain heuristics and sending on/off signals back to the thermostats to control the HVAC. The case studies indicate that the proposed heuristic algorithms can deliver the required regulation services, while adequately handling communication delays, different types of regulation signals and household's thermal comfort requirements.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)

We conducted a phase Ib/II trial to examine the efficacy, safety, and toxicity of gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combined with topotecan in women with recurrent ovarian cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor positivity. Methods Patients with measurable recurrent or persistent cancer after treatment with a platinum containing regimen with positive epidermal growth factor receptor expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry, were eligible for the study. Initial treatment was 250 mg/day gefitinib (oral) and 2.0 mg/m 2 topotecan (intravenous) on days 1, 8, and 15, on a 28 day cycle. Dose escalations were planned for topotecan (dose levels 1-3: 2, 3, and 4 mg/m 2) until the maximum tolerated dose was reached. Results 19 patients received a total of 61 cycles. Median age was 59.8 years (range 42-76 years). Histologic types in treated patients included 74% serous (n=14), 11% mixed (n=2), 11% transitional (n=2), and 5% clear cell (n=1). For phase Ib, three patients were treated at dose level 1, three at dose level 2, and three at dose level 3 for topotecan. The maximum tolerated dose was 4.0 mg/m 2 (days 1, 8, and 15) for topotecan and 250 mg (daily) for gefitinib. Therefore, dose level 3 was used for phase II. Among the 19 patients, 63.2% (n=12) had progressive disease, 15.8% (n=3) had stable disease, 10.5% (n=2) had a partial response, and 10.5% (n=2) were not evaluable. The most serious adverse events of any grade attributed to the therapy were anemia (89.4%), neutropenia (68.4%), abdominal pain (84%), constipation (78.9%), and diarrhea (78.9%). Conclusion Although the drug combination was relatively well tolerated, this prospective phase Ib/II clinical trial did not show sufficient clinical activity of topotecan combined with gefitinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor positive recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers.","cancer research; treatment; chemistryotherapy, medical","Oncology, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

This study was carried out to analyze the watershed characteristic (WC) variables and prioritize the risks of land-use patterns in KLs, Khon Kaen Province, using a watershed delineation approach. As a result of this study, of the 11 sub-watersheds in the Kaeng Lawa watershed, only KL03 and KL04 were deemed medium priority within their drainage and storage capacity systems. KL01, in the upstream sub-watershed, displayed very low priority. The pattern of land-use that appeared most in KL01 sub-watershed was deforestation, where the upper forest area appeared to show a 63% decrease from 2002 to 2017. The decreased forest area was replaced with agricultural area, for crops such as sugarcane and para-rubber, and fruit farms. Moreover, increases in urban area expansion were found in the downstream area in the north of KLs. The findings of this study reveal that severe flooding in this area was caused not only by tropical storm Podul, but also by the low prioritization of watershed characteristics and patterns of land-use that resulted in decreasing forested area in this watershed area. Consequently, these factors have influenced watershed storage and caused an accumulation of water volume, which regularly results in floods. Thus, flood mitigation should be implemented urgently, in the very low priority areas of the study area first.","water engineeringneering, runoff, streamflow and basins, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

Most existing studies investigate this task for educational applications such as second language acquisition and require the learner corpora. This article performs NLI in a challenging context of the user-generated-content (UGC) where authors are fluent and advanced non-native speakers of a second language. Existing NLI studies with UGC (i) rely on the content-specific/social-network features and may not be generalizable to other domains and datasets, (ii) are unable to capture the variations of the language-usage-patterns within a text sample, and (iii) are not associated with any outlier handling mechanism. Moreover, since there is a sizable number of people who have acquired non-English second languages due to the economic and immigration policies, there is a need to gauge the applicability of NLI with UGC to other languages. Unlike existing solutions, we define a topic-independent feature space, which makes our solution generalizable to other domains and datasets. Based on our feature space, we present a solution that mitigates the effect of outliers in the data and helps capture the variations of the language-usage-patterns within a text sample. Specifically, we represent each text sample as a point set and identify the top-k stylistically similar text samples (SSTs) from the corpus. We then apply the probabilistic k nearest neighbors' classifier on the identified top-k SSTs to predict the native languages of the authors. To conduct experiments, we create three new corpora where each corpus is written in a different language, namely, English, French, and German. Our experimental studies show that our solution outperforms competitive methods and reports more than 80% accuracy across languages.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)

Among the fifteen indigenous potential probiotics, the cell free supernatant of Lactobacillus gastricus BTM7 possessed highest antimicrobial action and biofilm inhibition against C. sakazakii. The competitive exclusion assays revealed that preconditioning with probiotics resulted in increased mean life span of the nematode to 12–13 days as compared to 5–6 days when the pathogen was administered alone. Enhanced expression of the marker genes (pmk-1, daf-16 and skn-1) was observed during the administration of probiotic cultures. The highest expression of pmk-1 (2.5 folds) was observed with administration of L. gastricus BTM7. The principal component analysis on selected variables revealed that L. gastricus BTM7 has the potential to limit the infection of C. sakazakii in C. elegans and enhance the expression of key genes involved in extending life span of the worm.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; probiotics, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Molecular Biology"
The causal connection of natural resources and globalization with energy consumption in top Asian countries: evidence from a nonparametric causality-in-quantile approach,"Hussain H.I., Haseeb M., Tvaronaviciene M., Mihardjo L.W.W., Jermsittiparsert K.",2020-05-01,"'current, Asian countries, Energy, Energy-consumption, Environmental sustainability, Globalisation, Non-linear relationships, Nonparametric causality in quantile, Nonparametric methods, Nonparametrics, Energy, Globalization, Natural resources, Nonparametric causality in quantiles","Given the significance of energy conservation as a prime objective of environmental sustainability, countries all around the world are keen to identify significant factors that lead to the augmentation of energy utilization. Considering the rising emphasis of economies in utilizing natural resources to attain higher levels of globalization, the current research was aimed at investigating how the returns of natural resources and globalization affect energy consumption in top Asian economies. In doing so, the study emphasized the nonlinear relationship among the variables and applied the novel nonparametric method of causality in quantile to identify the quantile-based causal connection of natural resources and globalization on the returns and volatility of energy utilization in selected Asian countries. Moreover, the presence of nonlinearity in the variables was tested by the Brock- Dechert-Scheinkman test (BDS test), which confirmed that all variables showed nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, the findings of quantile cointegration confirmed a nonlinear long-run relationship of natural resources and globalization with energy utilization. The prime findings of causality in quantile revealed that the returns of natural resources and globalization had a significant causal effect on the returns of energy consumption in all countries. On the other hand, the volatility in energy consumption concluded no causal association with the returns of natural resources and globalization in any of the studied Asian countries. The findings are beneficial for the policymakers to formulate policies that will help to reduce the level of energy consumption.","energygy utilization, fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Comparison of exercise training and estrogen supplementation on mast cellmediated doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity,"Phungphong S., Kijtawornrat A., Kampaengsri T., Wattanapermpool J., Bupha-Intr T.",2020-05-01,"Animals, Calcium Signaling, Cardiotoxicity, Cell Degranulation, Disease Models, Animal, Doxorubicin, Estradiol, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, Exercise Therapy, Female, Inflammation Mediators, Mast Cells, Myocardial Contraction, Myocardium, Ovariectomy, Oxidative Stress, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Ventricular Dysfunction, Left, Ventricular Function, Left, Cardiomyocyte, Mast cell stabilizer, Ovariectomy","Cardiac inflammation has been proposed as one of the primary mechanisms of anthracycline-induced acute cardiotoxicity. A reduction in cardiac inflammation might also reduce cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of estrogen therapy and regular exercise on attenuating cardiac inflammation in the context of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Ovariectomized rats were randomly allocated into estrogen supplementation, exercise training, and mast cell stabilizer treatment groups. Eight weeks after ovariectomy, rats received six cumulative doses of doxorubicin for two weeks. Echocardiography demonstrated a progressive decrease in ejection fraction in doxorubicin-treated rats without hypertrophic effect. This systolic defect was completely prevented by either estrogen supplementation or mast cell stabilizer treatment but not by regular exercise. As a heart disease indicator, increased β-myosin heavy chain expression induced by doxorubicin could only be prevented by estrogen supplementation. Decrease in shortening and intracellular Ca2+ transients of cardiomyocytes were due to absence of female sex hormones without further effects of doxorubicin. Again, estrogen supplementation and mast cell stabilizer treatment prevented these changes but exercise training did not. Histological analysis indicated that the hyperactivation of cardiac mast cells in ovariectomized rats was augmented by doxorubicin. Estrogen supplementation and mast cell stabilizer treatment completely prevented both increases in mast cell density and degranulation, whereas exercise training partially attenuated the hyperactivation. Our results, therefore, suggest that estrogen supplementation acts similarly to mast cell stabilizers in attenuating the effects of doxorubicin. Ineffectiveness of regular exercise in preventing the acute cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin might be due to a lesser effect on preventing cardiac inflammation.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Physiology (medical)"

Under aerobic condition the encapsulated hybrid system produced hydrogen (2.4 mmol H2/ mmol glucose) 3-fold higher than the unencapsulated hybrid system (0.8 mmol H2/ mmol glucose), suggesting that encapsulation is essential to protect oxygen sensitive hydrogenase under aerobic condition. The encapsulated hybrid system was also feasible under direct sunlight for hydrogen production. Overall, this study could serve as a new strategy for biological hydrogen production under aerobic condition.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

In this work, a simple and facile strategy was developed to synthesize Mo doped graphic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a two-step thermal treatment process. As obtained product exhibits sheet-like morphology with porous structure, and the formation mechanism could be ascribed to the exfoliation effect in thermal environment. Photocatalytic property investigation reveals that Mo doped g-C3N4 nanosheets present greatly improved hydrogen evolution rate of 1.6 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light, which is about 9.4 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The improved performance could be well attributed to its enhanced visible light absorption, well suppressed carrier recombination and greatly increased specific surface area. Accordingly, our work provides a promising and straight forward way to develop advanced photocatalyst with high efficiency for renewable energy generation.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

There is no report on the use of BG for ethnomedicine or cosmetics. Objective: To investigate collagen biosynthesis stimulation and anti-melanogenesis of the BG extracts. Materials and methods: The hulls (H) and seeds (S) of BG were collected from Trang province, Thailand and extracted by Soxhlet (S) and maceration (M) using ethanol, and boiled with distilled-water (B). Total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid (TFC) contents were quantified. The three antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities were determined by DPPH, FIC and FTC; and the modified dopachrome methods, respectively. The collagen biosynthesis and the anti-melanogenesis activities were investigated by Sirius-Red and the melanin content assay. Results: The yields of BG extracts ranged from 1.72% to 9.06%. The BG-SS extract gave the highest TPC and TFC. The BG-HM extract showed the highest antioxidant activities (SC50 of 0.87 ± 0.02 mg/mL, MC50 of 1.83 ± 0.09 mg/mL and LC50 of 0.70 ± 0.06 mg/mL), tyrosinase inhibition activity (IC50 of 0.45 ± 0.23 mg/mL), and anti-melanogenesis activities (72.9 ± 0.08%), whereas the BG-SB extract exhibited the highest stimulation of collagen biosynthesis (18.04 ± 0.03%). All BG extracts at 0.1 mg/mL showed no cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts. Discussion: The biological activities of BG extracts might be from their phytochemicals, especially phenolic and flavonoid contents.

Materials and Methods: FokI genotyping and bacterial quantification were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Periodontitis severity was determined using mean clinical attachment level (CAL). Regression analyses examined the associations between the FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) and bacterial proportions or periodontitis severity. Effect modification by smoking or drinking was assessed. Results: The study population comprised 1,460 individuals, aged 39–66 years. After multivariable adjustment, the FokI risk genotypes (CC + CT) were associated with elevated Porphyromonas gingivalis proportions (regression coefficient (β) =0.294 ± 0.139; p =.034) and increased mean CAL (β = 0.130 ± 0.048; p =.007). The effect of the FokI polymorphism on P. gingivalis proportions was greater in smokers (β = 0.897 ± 0.328; p =.006) compared to non-smokers (β = 0.164 ± 0.153; p =.282) and in drinkers (β = 0.668 ± 0.242; p =.006) compared to non-drinkers (β = 0.114 ± 0.169; p =.500). The genotype*smoking interaction for P. gingivalis proportions was significant (p =.043), whereas the genotype*drinking interaction was not (p =.061). Similar results were found for the effect of the genotype*smoking/drinking interaction on mean CAL. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the interplay between the host genotype and smoking is important in determining the subgingival microbial composition and periodontitis severity.",dentistry,Periodontics

We found 29% of postmenopausal women had at least one radiographic vertebral fracture. The prevalence was significantly higher among women with osteoporosis at the total hip (TH) region which implies that TH bone mineral density is a determinant of vertebral fracture risk. Introduction: Radiographic vertebral fracture is associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture and mortality in postmenopausal women. We designed a study to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral fractures in postmenopausal Thai women. Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional investigation at five university hospitals so as to achieve representation of the four main regions of Thailand. Radiographs were taken from 1062 postmenopausal women averaging 60 years of age. The presence of vertebral fracture was assessed by the Genant’s semiquantitative method with three independent radiologists. Respective bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH). Results: Among the 1062 women, 311 were found to have at least one radiographic vertebral fracture—yielding a prevalence of 29% (95% CI 23.6–32.0%)—and 90 (8.5%, 95% CI 6.8–10.2%) had at least two fractures. The prevalence of vertebral fracture increased with advancing age. Most fractures occurred at one vertebra (71%) and only 29% at multiple vertebrae. The prevalence of vertebral fracture was significantly higher among women with osteoporosis compared with non-osteoporosis at the TH region. There was no significant difference in the prevalence among women with or without osteoporosis at the LS or FN. Conclusions: Radiographic vertebral fractures were common among Thai postmenopausal women (~ 29%). These findings suggest that approximately one in three postmenopausal women has undiagnosed vertebral fracture. Radiographic diagnosis should therefore be an essential investigation for identifying and confirming the presence of vertebral fractures.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

The simultaneous assessment of multiple IMO&NS biomarkers may be useful to predict IS and its prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify the IMO&NS biomarkers, which predict short-term IS outcome. The study included 176 IS patients and 176 healthy controls. Modified Rankin scale (mRS) was applied within 8 h after IS (baseline) and 3 months later (endpoint). Blood samples were obtained within 24 h after hospital admission. IS was associated with increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL-6), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), homocysteine, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), glucose, insulin, and lowered iron, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. We found that 89.4% of the IS patients may be correctly classified using the cumulative effects of male sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose, NOx, LOOH, 25(OH)D, IL-6, and WBC with sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 93.0%. Moreover, increased baseline disability (mRS ≥ 3) was associated with increased ferritin, IL-6, hsCRP, WBC, ESR, and glucose. We found that 25.0% of the variance in the 3-month endpoint (mRS) was explained by the regression on glucose, ESR, age (all positively), and HDL-cholesterol, and 25(OH)D (both negatively). These results show that the cumulative effects of IMO&NS biomarkers are associated with IS and predict a poor outcome at 3-month follow-up.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

The modified composite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical behavior of rapamycin at the modified SPCE was investigated by cyclic and square wave voltammetry in 60:40 EtOH: 0.1 M LiClO4 at pH 5.0. A high reproducible and well-defined peak with a high peak current were obtained for rapamycin detection at a position potential of + 0.98 V versus Ag/AgCl. Under the optimized conditions, the rapamycin concentration in the range 0.1 to 100 μM (R2 = 0.9986) had a good linear relation with the peak current. The detection limit of this method was 0.03 μM (3SD/slope). The proposed device can selectively detect rapamycin in the presence of commonly interfering compounds. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine rapamycin in urine and blood samples with excellent recoveries. These devices are disposable and cost-effective and might be used as an alternative tool for detecting rapamycin in biological samples and other biological compounds.

Methods: A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the phylogeny of detected ZIKVs. Paired sera from dengue patients were collected for the determination of dengue and Zika infection. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the titers of neutralizing antibodies and viruses, respectively. An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay was used to evaluate the effect of anti-dengue antibodies on ZIKV infection. Results: Epidemiological data indicated the continuous importation of ZIKV infection from neighboring Zika epidemic countries into Taiwan. A total of 78 dengue patients were enrolled and 21 paired serum samples were obtained. PRNT90 results for the 21 samples identified eight cases of primary dengue infection and 13 cases of secondary dengue infection; two samples were positive for ZIKV (MR766). Results from the ADE assay indicated that convalescent sera from primary and secondary dengue infection patients displayed significant ADE of the ZIKV infection when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that pre-existing dengue immunity facilitates ZIKV infection and that the continuous importation of ZIKV infection may pose a threat to indigenous Zika emergence in Southern Taiwan.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

To tackle this problem, the authors developed the hybrid jig, a technique that combines the concepts of surface wettability from flotation and gravity separation using jigs to separate plastics with similar SGs. Mixed-plastic wastes are composed of particles having a wide variety of shapes and sizes (i.e., particle geometry), and both of which will likely have strong effects on the separation efficiency of hybrid jig separation similar to our previous observations on conventional jig separation. In this study, the volume of bubbles attached to plastic particles with different SGs (polyethylene terephthalate (PET; SG of 1.31) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC; SG of 1.38)), sizes (2-8 mm), and shapes (disk-like to sphere-like) were measured during water pulsation.","fluidex; related topics, environmental",Environmental Science (all)

The effects of copper on the characteristics of catalyst were obtained using several characterization techniques. We found that only copper (I) oxide (CuO) species were obtained on the surface after calcination in air by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). However, the basicity of the base decreases slightly, while the density of the base increases due to the decrease in Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. We carried out the catalytic activity of the Cu/Mg-Al catalyst in the continuous flow reactor through oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol. We obtained that the copper enhances the catalytic activity in this reaction, and the ethanol conversion increases with increase in temperature, while the acetaldehyde selectivity decreases because of the decomposition of acetaldehyde to carbon dioxide. The highest acetaldehyde yield of 41.8% was at 350 °C. Moreover, we studied the effects of the ethanol concentration by varying the ethanol feed concentrations (99.9%, 75%, and 50%). The ethanol conversion decreases with a decrease in the ethanol concentration due to the high adsorption of water molecules on the catalyst surface. Thus, the negative effect decreases at higher reaction temperature (350–400 °C). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the reduction condition of catalyst by varying the reduction temperature (300 and 400 °C). The reduction process affects the catalytic activity. The Cu/Mg-Al was comparatively stable for 10 h upon time-on-stream test. It is used as a promising catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol without any reduction step.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Engineering (all)

Yet, evidence examining managerial competence of FLNMs among public hospitals in Indonesia is sparse. To fill this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study aimed to identify managerial competence of FLNMs according to hospital type and ownership. This study was conducted from January to May 2018 and included a convenience sample of 233 FLNMs selected from 13 public hospitals. We used the Indonesian-First-Line Nurse Managers Managerial Competence Scale (I-FLNMMCS) to measure managerial competence. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal–Wallis, and Dunn’s Pairwise were used for data analysis. Findings showed a significant difference in managerial competence according to the hospital type (p <.05). The FLNMs with a Diploma III, those relatively older, in their position for 7 or more years, and with managerial training in Type A hospitals (larger hospitals) had the highest managerial competence. The FLNMs with a bachelor’s degree, those relatively younger, with less training, and those in their position for 3 to 4 years in Type B and C hospitals (smaller hospitals) had less managerial competence. A significant difference was also found in managerial competence according to hospital ownership (p <.05).

In this study, we showed that application of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) on DAS yielded better estimates of ACR. Specifically, the time activity curves were extracted from the DAS data of 18 healthy volunteers and subjected to FT and HHT analyses. Comparison of the mean, standard deviation (SD), and root mean square error (RMSE) of ACR estimated by both methods showed that the proposed HHT method yielded significantly smaller SD (p<0.00001), smaller relative SD (13.3% versus 53.7%) and RMSE (0.72 cpm versus 1.59 cpm). Moreover, the HHT method also achieved lower relative SD of the frequency values from the intrinsic mode functions. Overall results indicated that the HHT method outperformed the conventional FT method in estimating the ACR from DAS. We anticipate that our approach will lead to development of effective noninvasive diagnoses of gastrointestinal tract diseases using DAS.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, computer science, medical","Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics"
Absorption kinetics of CO2 in novel formulated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and N-methyl-4-piperidinol solvent,"Sema T., Ranong P.N., Kiattinirachara T., Posoknistakul P., Jiraratananon R., Tontiwachwuthikul P.",2020-11-01,"2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, Absorption kinetics, Alternative solvents, CO2 absorption, Pressure methods, Stirred tank reactors, Triethanolamines, Absorption, Amine, CO2 capture, Kinetics","In the present study, kinetics of CO2 absorption in novel formulated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and N-methyl-4-piperidinol (MPDL) solvent was investigated in a stirred tank reactor over ranges of temperature (303–333 K) and concentration (5% wt. AMP-25% wt. MPDL, 10% wt. AMP-20% wt. MPDL, and 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL). A drop of pressure method was used to determine the kinetics of CO2 absorption in terms of overall reaction kinetics constant (kov) through a slope of the drop of pressure plot. It was found that the kov increased as temperature increased and increased as concentration of AMP in AMP-MPDL solvent increased over ranges of studied temperature and concentration. The results also showed that 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL possessed the highest CO2 absorption kinetics among the three concentrations. More importantly, the novel formulated 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. MPDL solvent was found to have considerable faster CO2 absorption than the conventional 15% wt. AMP-15% wt. triethanolamine (TEA) and 30% wt. TEA solvents, respectively. Based on these observations, it can be summarized that an addition of AMP into MPDL solvent can enhance the overall CO2 absorption performance of the formulated AMP-MPDL solvent. Additionally, it can be suggested that the novel formulated AMP-MPDL has a great potential to be used as an alternative solvent for capturing CO2 in terms of reaction kinetics; especially, in substitution of conventional AMP-TEA and TEA solvents.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

The main objective of this research is to propose a new optimal hybrid solar/diesel/battery system to cover the demand load of a rural part in the Gobi Desert in China. The main objectives for optimization are the loss of load probability, CO2 emissions value, and the annualized cost of the system. Here, the ε-constraint method is adopted to simplify the multi-objective problem into a single objective problem. The optimization of the problem is performed by a developed version of the elephant herd optimization algorithm and the system sensitivity analysis has been analyzed on the parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide a reliable supplement for the load demand such that the PV penetration has a prominent impact by 97.9% of the costs. The results also present that the emitted CO2 gas by the proposed cEHO algorithm by 1735 kg/year is the minimum value compared with the PSO-based optimal system and HOMER software results.

The FEM was utilized to tackle both the patches and adhesive layers, whereas the BIEM was employed to efficiently handle the elastic cracked medium. To enhance the approximation, an asymptotic structure of the near-tip field is properly integrated in the discretization of the jump in the crack-face displacement in the vicinity of the crack boundary. This, in addition, offered a direct means to post-process for the stress intensity factors (SIFs) in terms of the solved data along the crack front. Extensive results are then reported to demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the implemented BIEM-FEM coupling and the effect of the relative stiffness of the patches and adhesive layers on the reduction of the SIFs along the crack front.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering, Mathematics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

The AuNPs formation in WSCTS and CTS-HOAc were investigated through physical appearance, numerical color, surface plasmon resonance, particle morphologies and sizes, AuNPs-polymer interaction and crystal structure. Within the irradiation doses range of 0–50 kGy, the particle sizes of the spherical AuNPs formulated in the WSCTS and CTS-HOAc solutions were in the range of 5–25 nm and 5–80 nm, respectively. The particle size and amount of AuNPs can be controlled by balancing synthetic parameters.

In this article, new insights into the roles of the solvolysis step as well as the operation of the transition metal catalyst are given. By separating the solvolysis and transition metal catalyzed hydrogen transfer reactions in space and time by applying a flow-through set-up, we have been able to study the solvolysis and transition metal catalyzed reactions separately. Interestingly, the solvolysis generates a high amount of monophenolic compounds by pealing off the end groups from the lignin polymer and the main role of the transition metal catalyst is to stabilize these monomers by transfer hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reactions.

Exploring the gelation mechanisms and cytocompatibility of gold (III)-mediated regenerated and thiolated silk fibroin hydrogels,"Laomeephol C., Ferreira H., Yodmuang S., Reis R.L., Damrongsakkul S., Neves N.M.",2020-03-01,"Animals, Cell Line, Fibroins, Gold, Hydrogels, Materials Testing, Metal Nanoparticles, Mice, Cytocompatibility, Gold, Hydrogel, Silk fibroin, Thiolated silk fibroin","Accelerating the gelation of silk fibroin (SF) solution from several days or weeks to minutes or few hours is critical for several applications (e.g., cell encapsulation, bio-ink for 3D printing, and injectable controlled release). In this study, the rapid gelation of SF induced by a gold salt (Au3+) as well as the cytocompatibility of Au3+-mediated SF hydrogels are reported. The gelation behaviors and mechanisms of regenerated SF and thiolated SF (tSF) were compared. Hydrogels can be obtained immediately after mixing or within three days depending on the types of silk proteins used and amount of Au3+. Au3+-mediated SF and tSF hydrogels showed different color appearances. The color of Au-SF hydrogels was purple-red, whereas the Au-tSF hydrogels maintained their initial solution color, indicating different gelation mechanisms. The reduction of Au3+ by amino groups and further reduction to Au by tyrosine present in SF, resulting in a dityrosine bonding and Au nanoparticles (NPs) production, are proposed as underlying mechanisms of Au-SF gel formation. Thiol groups of the tSF reduced Au3+ to Au+ and formed a disulfide bond, before a formation of Au+-S bonds. Protons generated during the reactions between Au3+ and SF or tSF led to a decrease of the local pH, which affected the chain aggregation of the SF, and induced the conformational transition of SF protein to beta sheet. The cytocompatibility of the Au-SF and tSF hydrogels was demonstrated by culturing with a L929 cell line, indicating that the developed hydrogels can be promising 3D matrices for different biomedical applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

To read out the information inside, we can use a specific near infrared CCD camera read out non-destructively. Because of the vary factors in embedding conditions and the lighting conditions in photography in practical use, the accuracy of decoding by only using brightness is inefficient.

However, transcriptomic data, which can reveal valuable genetic data for disease control and prevention, are extremely limited for this species. In this study, whole-body transcriptome sequencing of juvenile betta fish generated 4.457 GB of clean data and a total of 71,775 unigenes using the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. These unigenes were functionally classified using 7 functional databases, yielding 45,316 NR (63.14%), 47,287 NT (65.88%), 39,105 Swiss-Prot (54.48%), 16,492 COG (22.98%), 37,694 KEGG (52.52%), 4,506 GO (6.28%), and 35,374 Interpro (49.28%) annotated unigenes. Furthermore, we also detected 13,834 SSRs distributed on 10,636 unigenes and 49,589 predicted CDSs. Based on KEGG analysis, five innate immune pathways (997 unigenes) were reported, including the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Moreover, four antimicrobial peptide (AMP) families (hepcidin, piscidin, LEAP-2, and defensins) from the betta fish transcriptome were also identified. Additionally, cDNA and genomic DNA of two β-defensins was successfully isolated from four betta fish species. RT-PCR analysis showed that BsBD1 transcripts were most abundant in the muscle and kidney and BsBD2 transcripts were most abundant in the gill. The genomic organization showed that the BD1 and BD2 genes consisted of three exons and two introns according to the GT-AG rule. Most importantly, this is the first report of the betta fish whole-body transcriptome obtained by high-throughput sequencing. Our transcriptomic data and the discovery of betta fish AMPs should promote a better understanding of molecular immunology for disease prevention for further ornamental fish aquaculture.","environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science"

The results demonstrated that CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs prepared under the optimal condition were almost spherical in shape with a smooth surface, a diameter of 130 nm, zeta potential of 30.6 mV, loading efficiency of 83.3%, and loading capacity of 8.3%. The vibrating sample magnetometer results of the optimized CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs showed a superparamagnetic behavior. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses indicated that the CG physically interacted with PEG-CSO-SPIONs. In addition, the CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs could be stored dry for up to 12 weeks or in aqueous solution for up to 4 days at either 4 °C or 25 °C with no loss of stability. The CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs exhibited a sustained release profile up to 72 h under simulated physiological (pH 7.4) and tumor extracellular (pH 5.5) environments. Furthermore, the CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs showed little non-specific protein binding in the simulated physiological environment. The CG-PEG-CSO-SPIONs enhanced the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of CG against human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells compared to free CG, and more CG was delivered to the cells after applying an external magnetic field.

Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content, total monomeric anthocyanin content, and antioxidant activities, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the unrefined extracts, were analyzed. The extraction with 70% acetone and 70% methanol and the S:L ratio of 1:30 seemed to be more appropriate and gave significantly (P < 0.05) higher values of the previously mentioned properties. Whole ground fruits were then incorporated into the blended chicken patties to compare their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). During refrigeration storage of 20 days, the highest level (1,000 mg TPC/kg meat) could retard lipid oxidation relatively comparable to the efficiency of BHA (200 ppm). However, when microbiological aspect was considered together, a limited storage of 12 days was consequently suggested. Practical Application: Mamao fruit is a splendid source of phenolic compounds. The antioxidant properties have been demonstrated using DPPH and FRAP assay. The suitable type of solvent and S:L ratio were provided for the extraction. Our findings have shown that addition of mamao, a source of natural antioxidants, especially at the highest level increased oxidative stability of chicken patties. The research outcomes identify the potential bioactive compound and provide beneficial information related to the feasibility of incorporation of mamao phenolics as antioxidant agents in suitable food matrices. However, further investigation is still required for successful application in meat and meat products.","genergyal, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was used as solid sorbent particles. The results were validated with the released outlet CO2 mass fraction and the differential pressure based on a laboratory scale circulating fluidized bed. Three different reaction models including homogeneous model, deactivation model and equilibrium model were examined in order to validate the simulated CO2 adsorption performance. The results showed that the simulated data obtained from equilibrium model was found to be well correspondence with the experimental results. Thus, the equilibrium model was then applied in the CO2 desorption processes. To determine the significance of main operating parameter factors on a considered response, the central composite design (CCD) approach was used. The four factors of gas inlet velocity, solid circulation rate, temperature and water vapor content were selected as the independent factors for CO2 adsorption. The results showed that solid circulation rate and temperature were the two significant operating factors affecting the CO2 removal performance. Additionally, three factors, which were temperature, gas inlet velocity and solid circulation rate, were selected as independent factors on the desorbed CO2 mass fraction in the downer reactor. The simulated results showed that the most significant operating factors on the CO2 desorbed was gas inlet velocity. Consequently, the suitable operating conditions were proposed through the response surface method for both the CO2 adsorption and solid sorbent regeneration.",engineering,Engineering (all)

However, the genetic networks are described by dynamical systems with nonlinear uncertainties and usually affected by stochastic internal fluctuations, and stochastic external disturbances. The design addressed in this paper is concerned with robust state estimator of stochastic genetic networks in the presence of nonlinear uncertainties. The objective is to estimate the true concentrations of mRNAs and proteins of the noisy nonlinear genetic networks. Based on the notion of Lyapunov functions, we improve the design condition for the robust estimator to ensure that the estimation error satisfies H∞ performance criterion. The sufficient condition is derived in terms of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities, which are convex constraints, and can be efficiently solved via the sum-of-squares technique. We provide two numerical examples of real genetic networks to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, computer science","Chemical Engineering (all), Computer Science Applications"

Synthesised iron oxide nanoparticles were characterised using UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The analyses confirmed that the formed particles were nano sized and the crystallite size was found to be 6.16 nm through XRD studies. The formed nanoparticles were observed from SEM analysis to be spinel shaped with an average particle size of 65 nm. Biscuits were fortified with iron oxide nanoparticles which were later studied for physical and proximate analyses. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy studies revealed that the iron content was higher in fortified biscuits than that in control. Microbial analysis for 30 days indicated that the fortified biscuits could have a longer shelf life. In brief, the first report on use of iron oxide nanoparticles successfully suggested that their use as fortificants in food and could be prescribed for malnourished, iron deficit or anaemic patients.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, environmental, engineering, physics, earth sciences","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Environmental Science (all), Engineering (all), Physics and Astronomy (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

Solar absorber, one of the most important layers in a multilayer solar selective coating, is used to convert solar energy into heat due to its selective properties. Recently, Ni nanoparticle solar absorbers have attracted considerable attention because they offer maximized absorption and minimized thermal radiation loss. However, only few detailed investigations on the effects of morphology and structure of Ni nanoparticle on the selective absorber properties have been reported. Therefore, in this work we synthesized Ni nanoparticles via a chemical reduction method. The rapid convective deposition was used to fabricate Ni nanoparticle-Al2O3 cermet thin film as the solar selective absorber. The various ratios of [NaOH]/[NiCl2] ranging from 4-20 was investigated in order to study the effects on the morphology of Ni nanoparticles. Characterization of the morphology and structure of Ni nanoparticles and cermet thin film was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Emissometer was used to measure the thermal emittance, and UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the reflectance of the film. It was found that the formation of chain-like nanostructure of Ni appeared when the molar ratio of [NaOH]/[NiCl2] was 4. Increasing molar ratios resulted in longer chain formation. However, when the molar ratio reached 20, spherical-like Ni nanoparticles were observed. Moreover, at this ratio, Ni nanoparticle-Al2O3 cermet film demonstrated a solar absorptance of 0.64 and a thermal emittance of 0.53, resulting in a solar selectivity of 1.20 which is suitable as solar selective absorbing coating applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

However, each metric provides a specific insight while neglecting others. This paper attempts to overcome this pitfall through a methodology based on ranking aggregation. Specifically, we consider several numerical topological descriptors of the nodes’ importance (e.g., degree, betweenness, closeness, etc.) and we convert such descriptors into ratio matrices; then, we extend the Analytic Hierarchy Process problem to the case of multiple ratio matrices and we resort to a Logarithmic Least Squares formulation to identify an aggregated metric that represents a good tradeoff among the different topological descriptors. The procedure is validated considering the Central London Tube network as a case study.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

Objective: Herein, we aimed to investigate the anti-influenza NA activity of caffeic acid and its hydroxycinnamate analogues, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid A, in comparison to a known NA inhibitor, oseltamivir. Methods: In vitro MUNANA-based NA inhibitory assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the three interested hydroxycinnamic compounds towards the influenza NA enzyme. Subsequently, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations were employed to elucidate the structural insights into the protein-ligand complexations. Results: Rosmarinic acid showed the highest inhibitory activity against NA with the IC50 of 0.40 µM compared to caffeic acid (IC50 of 0.81 µM) and salvianolic acid A (IC50 of >1 µM). From 100-ns MD simulations, the binding affinity, hot-spot residues, and H-bond formations of rosmarinic acid/NA complex were higher than those of caffeic acid/NA model, in which their molecular complexations was driven mainly by electrostatic attractions and H-bond formations from several charged residues (R118, E119, D151, R152, E227, E277, and R371). Notably, the two hydroxyl groups on both phenyl and phenylacetic rings of rosmarinic acid play a crucial role in stabilizing NA through a strongly formed H-bond(s).

Dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed that the incorporation of filler can facilitate the cold crystallization of PLA, as confirmed by lowered cold crystallization temperature. By fitting DSC data with Avrami model, the highest isothermal cold crystallization rate constant k and the shortest crystallization half time t1/2 were obtained for the PLA/talc composites under isothermal temperature of 100 °C, implying that talc was the most effective nucleating agent for PLA in this study. The average Avrami index n of neat PLA and its composites lay within the same range of 3.0–3.6, which reflected the three-dimensional spherulitic growth of PLA with the mixture of instantaneous nuclei and sporadic nuclei. In comparison with the composite cast films, the thermoformed films had higher degree of crystallinity as well as higher tensile strength and Young’s modulus owing to the chain orientation upon annealing. Furthermore, the addition of silane-treated talc, especially APTES-treated talc, fastened cold crystallization rate and enhanced tensile properties because of the improved interfacial interaction between talc particles and PLA matrix.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

The FE analysis results revealed no significant differences between the straight- and curved-cut groups in terms of maximum stress forces on the superior, middle, or inferior portions of the hinge sites. In the experimental study, the curved-cut group withstood higher loads to failure at the hinge site than the straight-cut group. The ability of the curved-cut laminoplasty hinges to withstand higher compressive loading to failure than straight-cut hinges suggests the potential of the proposed technique to reduce the risk of hinge fracture and displacement.","genergyal, medical, neuroscience","Surgery, Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Physiology (medical)"
Proteomic analysis of adult Schistosoma mekongi somatic and excretory-secretory proteins,"Reamtong O., Simanona N., Thiangtrongjit T., Limpanont Y., Chusongsang P., Chusongsang Y., Anuntakarun S., Payungporn S., Phuphisut O., Adisakwattana P.",2020-02-01,"Animals, Antigens, Helminth, Computational Biology, Drug Development, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Female, Gender Identity, Gene Ontology, Genome, Helminth, Helminth Proteins, Host-Parasite Interactions, Male, Mass Spectrometry, Mice, Proteomics, Schistosoma, Schistosomiasis, Secretory Pathway, Transcriptome, Excretory-secretory protein, Proteomics, Schistosoma mekongi","Schistosoma mekongi is a causative agent of human schistosomiasis. There is limited knowledge of the molecular biology of S. mekongi and very few studies have examined drug targets, vaccine candidates and diagnostic biomarkers for S. mekongi. To explore the biology of S. mekongi, computational as well as experimental approaches were performed on S. mekongi males and females to identify excretory-secretory (ES) proteins and proteins that are differentially expressed between genders. According to bioinformatic prediction, the S. mekongi ES product was approximately 4.7% of total annotated transcriptome sequences. The classical secretory pathway was the main process to secrete proteins. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of male and female adult S. mekongi proteins was performed. We identified 174 and 156 differential expression of proteins in male and female worms, respectively. The dominant male-biased proteins were involved in actin filament-based processes, microtubule-based processes, biosynthetic processes and homeostatic processes. The major female-biased proteins were related to biosynthetic processes, organelle organization and signal transduction. An experimental approach identified 88 proteins in the S. mekongi secretome. The S. mekongi ES proteins mainly contributed to nutrient uptake, essential substance supply and host immune evasion. This research identifies proteins in the S. mekongi secretome and provides information on ES proteins that are differentially expressed between S. mekongi genders. These findings will contribute to S. mekongi drug and vaccine development. In addition, the study enhances our understanding of basic S. mekongi biology.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"
Generating Test Scripts for Web-Based Applications,"Sriwichainan P., Suwannasart T.",2020-10-09,"Automation testing, Boundary-value testing, Novice testers, Regression tests, Software development process, Software manual, Testing process, Web-based applications, Automation Testing, Robot Framework, Selenium Boundary Value Testing, Software Testing, Test Automation Framework, Test Script","Testing process is an essential part of the software development process as it reveals faults of the system which leads to software reliability improvement. Manual software manual testing is a process which testers discover software's faults by hands. Therefore, any change on the software requires tremendous effort and time to execute test cases such as regression tests. Even though we can utilize automation testing tools to speed up the execution of test cases, experienced testers, who are equipped with automation testing knowledge, are inevitably required. Since novice testers usually consume a significant amount of time to develop test scripts, this paper aims to establish an approach to simplify test scripts generation for web-based applications using URL and XSD as inputs. Our approach elicits input elements from a web page using a provided URL and then analyzes their values using XSD to create test data using boundary value testing technique. This produces test scripts that run under Robot framework.","computer scienceuter applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Calorimeters, Large detector-systems performance","With increasing instantaneous luminosity at the LHC come additional reconstruction challenges. At high luminosity, many collisions occur simultaneously within one proton-proton bunch crossing. The isolation of an interesting collision from the additional ""pileup""collisions is needed for effective physics performance. In the CMS Collaboration, several techniques capable of mitigating the impact of these pileup collisions have been developed. Such methods include charged-hadron subtraction, pileup jet identification, isospin-based neutral particle ""δβ""correction, and, most recently, pileup per particle identification. This paper surveys the performance of these techniques for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction, as well as muon isolation. The analysis makes use of data corresponding to 35.9 fb-1 collected with the CMS experiment in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The performance of each algorithm is discussed for up to 70 simultaneous collisions per bunch crossing. Significant improvements are found in the identification of pileup jets, the jet energy, mass, and angular resolution, missing transverse momentum resolution, and muon isolation when using pileup per particle identification.","extraterrestrial physicsics and stellar phenomena, fluidex; related topics, physics, Mathematics","Instrumentation, Mathematical Physics"

In this study, overall microbial communities present in anaerobic bioreactors from seven industrial wastewater treatment plants (including food, pulp and paper industries) were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina). The dominant methanogens identified in the anaerobic bioreactors treating industrial wastewater were Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta; Methanospirillum was a predominant methanogen in the anaerobic sludge digester. Hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens were detected at similar relative abundances in the anaerobic covered lagoons treating starch wastewater, whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the predominant methanogens present in the sludge digester. SRB communities were further investigated using dsrB gene clone libraries. The results indicated the presence of SRB, such as uncultured Desulfobulbus sp., Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, Syntrophorhabdus sp. PtaB.Bin027, and Desulfovibrio fructosivarans JJ. Incomplete-oxidizing SRB were the predominant SRB in all of the anaerobic bioreactors treating wastewater. In contrast, similar relative abundances of complete and incomplete-oxidizing SRB were observed in the sludge digester. The results of this study can further facilitate the development of SRB-controlling strategies to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment.",environmental,Environmental Engineering
On-farm lambing outcomes after transfer of vitrified and slow frozen embryos,"Khunmanee S., Tharasanit T., Suwimonteerabutr J., Panyaboriban S., Techakumphu M., Swangchan-Uthai T.",2020-05-01,"Animals, Cryopreservation, Embryo Transfer, Embryo, Mammalian, Embryonic Development, Freezing, Parturition, Sheep, Tissue and Organ Harvesting, Tissue Preservation, Vitrification, Cryopreservation method, Embryonic stage, Sheep","The aim of the present study was to determine the most suitable embryonic stage and embryo freezing technique for commercial implementation of frozen embryo trading by small-scale sheep producers. There was a 2 × 2 factorial design utilized for conducting the study consisting of two embryo stages (2−8 cells or morula/blastocyst) and two cryopreservation protocols (vitrification or slow-freezing). For the in vivo produced embryos, there were treatments of crossbred donor ewes to induce superovulation. Embryos were recovered surgically on either Day 2 or 5.5 after estrous onset. The embryos were cryopreserved using either a vitrification or slow-freezing method before there was transfer to recipients. Ovarian response, embryo survival and lambing outcomes were analyzed. There were no differences in number of recovered and fertilized embryos at the two embryonic developmental stages. There were no effects of embryonic stages and cryopreservation methods on pregnancy rate, twinning rate, fetal birth weights and lamb weight at 1 month of age. When there was use of vitrified embryos for transfers, there was a greater lamb weight at 2 months of age (8.38 ± 0.20 compared with 7.78 ± 0.21 kg; P = 0.044) than when there was transfer of embryos cryopreserved using slow freezing procedures. Considering economic and practical benefits to small-scale sheep farms, morula/blastocyst stage-embryo collection and transfer into the uterus is more efficacious than transferring 2−8 cells embryos into the oviduct. Results of this study may contribute to the genetic improvement in the flocks of small-scale sheep producers.","genergyal, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Endocrinology"
Near-room-temperature superconductivity of Mg/Ca substituted metal hexahydride under pressure,"Sukmas W., Tsuppayakorn-aek P., Pinsook U., Bovornratanaraks T.",2020-12-30,"Electronic band structure, Fermi surface topology, High-critical-temperature superconductivity, Near room temperature, Phonon dispersions, Phonon frequencies, Room-temperature superconductors, Theoretical research, Alloys, High pressure, Metal hydride compounds, Mg/Ca, Near-room-temperature critical temperature, Superconductivity","A quest for room-temperature superconductors is undergoing rapid innovation due to the continuing proliferation of experimental and theoretical researches on high-pressure physics. Hydrogen-caged metal compounds have been proposed to promote high critical temperature superconductivity at pressures, providing a decent opportunity to investigate related phenomena at experimentally attainable pressures. This breakthrough is attributable to the uplifting key parameters, such as electron-phonon interaction and maximum phonon frequency, once thought to be limited, by utilising high pressures. A large class of metal polyhydrides has been theoretically proposed and experimentally realised to promote near-room-temperature superconductivity under high pressures. In this work, we theoretically reported the near-room-temperature superconductivity in a symmetrically Mg/Ca substituted hexahydride, i.e. Mg0.5Ca0.5H6. We showed that this ternary Mg0.5Ca0.5H6 compound adopts an Im3¯m structure, wherein a metal atom is embedded in a H24 cage, is thermodynamically and dynamically stable at pressures ranging from 200 to 400 GPa. The analyses of the electronic band structure, Fermi surface topologies, phonon dispersion, and spectral function manifest strong support for superconductivity. We obtained λ=2.53 and ωlog=1,400K for our Mg/Ca substituted hexahydride at 200 GPa, exhibiting a near-room-temperature Tc of 288 K, which completely exceeds the calculated Tc of its parent compounds, i.e. MgH6 and CaH6.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"
Novel bacterial cellulose nanocrystals/polyether block amide microporous membranes as separators for lithium-ion batteries,"Ajkidkarn P., Manuspiya H.",2020-12-01,"Amides, Bacteria, Cellulose, Electric Conductivity, Electric Power Supplies, Ions, Lithium, Nanoparticles, Polyenes, Polyesters, Porosity, Sulfuric Acids, Temperature, Bacterial cellulose, Ionic conductivity, Lithium-ion battery, Nanocrystals, Nylon-based polymer, Polyether block amide, Separator membranes","Bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNCs) were extracted from nata de coco waste and underwent sulphuric acid (H2SO4) hydrolysis for use as a reinforcement giving thermal and dimensional stability to polyether block amide (PEBAX) as a polymer matrix for the fabrication of BCNCs/PEBAX microporous membranes. The H2SO4-hydrolysis of BCNCs yielded rod-like/needle-like BCNCs and negatively charged surfaces, resulting from the generated surface sulfate groups on the bacterial cellulose (BC), which may be competent for numerous applications. The non-solvent induced phase separating (NIPS) and subsequent film casting methods were used to prepare the BCNCs/PEBAX microporous membranes. The obtained films were characterized with regards to their structure in terms of the content of crystalline phases, as well as their ionic transport and performance at elevated temperatures. The presence of the BCNCs fillers resulted in a good thermal and dimensional stability up to 150 °C and correlated with no membrane shrinkage. For NIPS membranes, the formation of a rigid cellulosic network within the matrix was emphasized and attributed to the thermal stabilization at temperatures above the melting temperature. In addition, the wettability, ionic conductivity, and thermal stability were investigated in BCNCs/PEBAX membranes filled with different amounts of BCNCs. Thus, the BCNCs/PEBAX membranes derived via NIPS had a remarkably good ionic conductivity, within the range of 10−2–10−3 S/cm, with up to 56.8% porosity. Such porous membranes are considered as an important and interesting candidate for the replacement of the commercial polyolefin-based microporous separator in lithium-ion batteries due to their superior electrochemical performances and the observed reinforcement effect.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"
Effects of different cooking methods and palm oil addition on the bioaccessibility of beta-carotene of sweet leaf (Sauropus androgynous),"Arumsari I., Makynen K., Adisakwattana S., Ngamukote S.",2020-01-01,"beta Carotene, Biological Availability, Cooking, Digestion, Palm Oil, Plant Leaves, Beta-carotene, Bioaccessibility, Cooking methods, Palm oil, Sauropus androgynous","Beta-carotene is one of phytochemicals which play role as natural antioxidant related to the reduction of oxidative stress that is linked to Non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Sweet leaf (Sauropus androgynous), one of the indigineous plants in Asia, contains high contents of beta-carotene. However, the bioaccessibility of beta-carotene in sweet leaf might be altered among the different cooking methods. Therefore, the effects of different cooking methods (raw, boiling, and microwave cooking) and addition of palm oil on the bio-accessibility of beta-carotene of sweet leaf were investigated before and during in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. We found that the boiling and microwave cooking methods caused the lower beta-carotene contents in cooked sweet leaf compared to raw leaf. However, the addition of 10% (v/w) palm oil during cooking helped increasing the bioac-cessible beta-carotene contents after digestion in all cooking methods, compared to those without palm oil addition (p<0.05). In addition, the bioaccessibility of beta-carotenes was found to increase about 20% when the palm oil was added into the microwaved sweet leaf. The findings of this study suggested that the addition of 10% (v/w) palm oil during cooking could improve the bioaccessible beta-carotene contents in the sweet leaf, especially when the sweet leaf was cooked by microwave.","genergyal, gastroenterology, medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics"

Methods: Generally healthy 9-to 18-month-old children who had been exclusively breastfed were recruited. Information on children’s oral hygiene practices and breastfeeding behaviors was collected through parental interviews using a questionnaire. Children’s oral health status was assessed following the WHO caries diagnostic criteria, modified to record the noncavitated lesions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was adopted to investigate its association with feeding and oral hygiene practices. Results: In total, 513 mother and child dyads (47% boys) were recruited. The prevalence of ECC was 42.5%. The mean (SD) d1mft and d1mfs scores (d1 included noncavitated and cavitated carious teeth/tooth surfaces) were 1.1 (1.4) and 1.3 (2.0), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older children with higher plaque scores (OR = 75.60; 95% CI: 40.19–142.20) who were breastfed to sleep (OR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.48–5.49) and never had their teeth cleaned (OR = 8.51; 95% CI: 1.53–47.14), had a significantly higher chance of having ECC (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Prevalence of ECC is high among exclusively breastfed children aged 9–18 months in Thailand. ECC prevalence is significantly associated with the age of children, the level of dental plaque, breastfeeding to sleep, and oral cleaning. Among all factors, the level of dental plaque is the most significant factor associated with ECC among breastfed children.","genergyal, Health Professionsth, Health Professionsth systems and services, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Smell dysfunction has been reported in other viral infections (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, SARS, and others), but the incidence is much lower than SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathophysiology of post-infectious olfactory loss was hypothesized that viruses may produce an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa or damage the olfactory neuroepithelium directly. However, loss of smell could be presented in COVID-19 patients without other rhinologic symptoms or significant nasal inflammation. This review aims to provide a brief overview of recent evidence for epidemiology, pathological mechanisms for the smell, and taste dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Furthermore, prognosis and treatments are reviewed with scanty evidence. We also discuss the possibility of using “smell and taste loss” as a screening tool for COVID-19 and treatment options in the post-SARS-CoV-2 infectious olfactory loss.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

However, with the advances of circuit and sensor technologies, it is now possible to apply the concept of digital phenotyping to PD, providing a moment-by-moment quantification of individual patient phenotypes using personal digital devices, such as smartphones. Such technology holds considerable potential if a patient-centered multidisciplinary team is able to select digital outcomes that are not only clinically relevant, but also provide measurement-based care results that support individual patient clinical decision making. However, it is likely to be a long road, requiring large collaborative efforts to undertake a number of essential steps before full integration and synchronization of these outcomes into patient management platforms that can deliver individualized data to patients, caregivers, and treating neurologists. In the meantime, both neurologists and patients can empower themselves with digital technologies, working as a team to define the ways that new technologies can be most powerfully employed in PD management. Once digital phenotyping becomes feasible and widely adopted in PD communities, it is likely to expand our understanding of individual PD patients' lives and priorities, leading to targeted treatments and better outcomes for PD patients and their families.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

We examined whether benzoxazine dimer analogue N,N-bis(5-ethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl) methylamine (HM) has anti-metastatic effects. Materials and Methods: Cell viability was examined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl- 2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Wound healing and phalloidin-rhodamine assays were performed to evaluate the migration and filopodia formation, respectively. Anoikis resistance was studied by anchorage-independent growth assay. The expression of proteins regulating migration were examined by western blot. Results: HM treatment significantly inhibited growth and survival of detached lung cancer cells as indicated by the reduced colony number and size of anchorage-independent growth analysis. HM inhibited cell migration and suppressed filopodia formation. Protein analysis indicated that the compound dramatically decreased integrin β3 and its related downstream proteins including active focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and active protein kinase B (AKT); however, integrin β1 and α5 were found to be unaltered. Conclusion: HM shows a potential in targeting integrin β3 and could be a good candidate for further developed as an anti-metastatic therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"
Clinical impacts of dna-based typing and provision of antigen-matched red blood cell units for chronically transfused patients with thalassemia,"Watanaboonyongcharoen P., Onspun S., Rojnuckarin P.",2020-01-01,"Blood Grouping and Crossmatching, Blood Transfusion, DNA, Erythrocytes, Humans, Isoantibodies, Thalassemia, Antigen-matched transfusion, Chronic transfusion, DNA-based typing, Red blood cell alloantibody, Thalassemia","Blood transfusion, the main therapy for patients with severe thalassemia, is challenged by alloantibodies that can lead to hemolytic transfusion reactions. The use of prophylactic antigen-matched units is recommended, but serologic typing, before the first transfusion, is rarely performed and is not reliable after chronic transfusion. Patient DNA-based typing is a promising strategy, but clinical outcome data are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the benefits of antigen-matched transfusion guided by DNA-based typing in terms of new alloantibody formation and increases in mean pre-Transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) levels. We performed DNA-based typing on samples from 24 transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia who had no serologic phenotyping performed before the first transfusion. These patients were then transfused with antigen-matched donor RBC units that were typed serologically. New alloantibody formation and mean pre-Transfusion Hb levels were evaluated after implementing this extended common antigen-matching transfusion protocol. Sixty-Three percent of the patients in this study were diagnosed as having beta-Thalassemia Hb E. Alloantibodies were already present in 87.5 percent (21/24) of these patients, and most of these antibodies were multiple and/or unidentified. After the enrollment, there were 717 transfusion episodes comprising 1209 RBC units. The number of RBC units transfused to each patient ranged from 22 to 119 units. At the median duration of 25.5 months (range 10 34 months), no new alloantibodies were detected since the beginning of the protocol. Seventy-four transfusion episodes in six patients were cross-match-positive due to autoantibodies (patients 2, 4, 8, 9, and 14) or anti-Chido (patient 18) that had been identified before the study. There were no hemolytic transfusion reactions in this study. Five patients (patients 1, 2, 12, 15, and 20) showed increased mean pre-Transfusion Hb levels (≥1 g/dL) and one patient (patient 16) had longer intervals between transfusions (compared with those before the protocol), suggesting longer RBC survival, although there was no statistical difference in the whole group. Our study highlights the benefits of DNA-based typing in chronically transfused patients with thalassemia who had no phenotyping data before the first transfusion. Patient DNA-based typing for antigen-matched transfusion is safe in thalassemia and allows us to obtain better-matched blood units for complicated patients.

In this article, we introduce an adversarial evaluation scheme for the Thai language by creating adversarial examples based on known spelling errors. Furthermore, we propose novel methods including UNK masking, condition initialization with affixation embeddings, and untied-directional self-attention mechanism to enhance robustness and interpretability of the neural networks.

Traditionally, a composite manganese oxide (MnO2) and a conductive carbon having a polymeric binder are used as a positive electrode. In general, a binder is employed to bond all materials together and to prevent detachment and dissolution of the active materials. Herein, the synthesis of α-MnO2 nanowires on carbon cloth via a simple one-step hydrothermal process and its electrochemical performance, as a binder-free cathode in aqueous and nonaqueous-based ZIBs, is duly reported. Morphological and elemental analyses reveal a single crystal α-MnO2 having homogeneous nanowire morphology with preferential growth along {001}. It is significant that analysis of the electrochemical performance of the α-MnO2 nanowires demonstrates more stable capacity and superior cyclability in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte ZIB than in an aqueous electrolyte system. This is because DMSO can prevent irreversible proton insertion as well as unfavorable dendritic zinc deposition. The application of the binder-free α-MnO2 nanowires cathode in DMSO can promote follow-up research on the high cyclability of ZIBs.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

However, when a new MCHH edition is released, those with the previous editions do not have access to the updated information. A mobile app is an appealing platform to fill this gap. We developed a mobile app called “KhunLook” as an interactive electronic MCHH intended to assist parents in child health supervision. Objective: This study describes the user requirements and development of the KhunLook mobile app, validity of parents' growth assessments, and parents' evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the app. Methods: Phase 1 was a qualitative study using individual interviews. The interview data were used to revise the prototype. In phase 2, parents were randomly assigned to assess their children's growth with the app or the MCHH. The outcomes were compared to those of the physician's assessment, and congruence was determined. In phase 3, parents evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the app in comparison to the MCHH through a web-based survey. Results: Four health care providers and 8 parents participated in phase 1. Two themes were identified: (1) the mobile app potentially counters parents' infrequent use of the MCHH with accuracy, attractiveness, convenience, and simplicity, and (2) health supervision needs to be standard, up-to-date, and understandable. KhunLook was publicly launched with a family page and 7 key features: growth and nutrition, development, immunizations, oral health, reminders for the next appointment, memories, and health advice. In phase 2, 56 parents participated in the growth parameter assessments; 34 were in the App group and 22 in the MCHH group. The outcomes of the growth parameter assessments between parents and physicians in both the App and MCHH groups were not significantly different. The congruence proportions were higher in the App group for weight and head circumference, but the differences were not statistically significant. In phase 3, 356 parents from all over Thailand participated in a web-based survey. Parents rated the app feasibility as “very easy to easy” to use at higher proportions than the MCHH in all health assessment domains (growth, development, and immunizations) and ease-of-use domains with statistical significance (P<.001). The KhunLook app received a significantly higher mean score (8.59/10) than the MCHH (7.6/10) (P<.001). Most parents (317/356, 89.0%) preferred the app over MCHH. Further, 93.5% (333/356) of the parents stated that they would continue to use the app and 96.9% (345/356) would recommend others to use it. Conclusions: KhunLook, a Thai mobile app for child health supervision, was developed, validated for growth assessments, and was well accepted for ease-of-use by parents. Further studies should be conducted with a large scale of users, and the impact of this app on health behaviors and health outcomes must be evaluated.",medical,Health Informatics

The study compares land use land coverage change (LULCC), rainfall-runoff pattern, and sediment load in the main river course from 1980s to 1990s and to 2014. A land use map updated from different periods (Land Development Department, Thailand) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imageries have been carried out as inputs for land use change coverage analysis. Double mass curve with trend curve analysis is employed to evaluate the effects of LULCC on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment yield relationships. The results indicate that from 1990 to 2014, many forests in Yom river basin have been significantly transformed into farmland and irrigation area, especially in high-slope locations relatively further away from the main river course. This change of land use pattern has consecutively altered the rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships, and lead to more pronounced slope of trend curve (STC) of annual rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment mass curves in 1990s compared to 2000s, implying that more soil and water loss yield in 2000s. One can logically suggest that the runoff-sediment load obtained during 1990s is higher than 2000s with similar rainfall/runoff, which can further be explained by the historic landuse dynamics. With the new water allocation scheme for flood risk reduction in the lower Chaophraya river basin, agricultural practices have spatio-temporally changed and parts of Yom river basin have been used for flood retention areas, significant alteration in rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment patterns has been observed (i.e., in Bangrakam and Kongkrailart Districts). Continuous reduction of forest fraction results in soil loss, landslide, river bank erosion, and flood occurrence results in a more degrading river water quality and potential decrease in river capacity for flood protection, all involved stakeholder such as local authorities, communities, farmers, and policy makers should pay attention to apply appropriate land use and watershed management and flood risk reduction practices.","water engineeringneering, environmental","Ecology, Environmental Engineering"

Methods In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 72 patients were assigned to receive either LIA with CACB (LIA+CACB group) or iPACK block with LIA and CACB (iPACK+LIA+CACB group). The primary outcome was cumulative postoperative intravenous morphine consumption within 24 hours. The secondary outcomes included numerical rating scale pain scores, incidence of posterior knee pain, performance test results, patient satisfaction, length of stay, and adverse events. Results Morphine consumption within 24 hours postoperatively showed no significant intergroup difference (LIA+CACB; 1.31±1.85 mg vs iPACK+LIA+CACB; 0.61±1.25 mg, p=0.08). There were no clinically significant differences in the overall pain scores between the groups. The lower Timed Up and Go test scores on postoperative days 1 and 2, along with a shorter duration of hospitalization, were found in the iPACK+LIA+CACB group (p<0.05). Conclusion The addition of an iPACK block to the LIA and CACB does not reduce the postoperative opioid consumption nor improve analgesia. However, it may improve immediate functional performance and reduce the length of hospitalization after TKA.",medical,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine

Identification of bacterial pathogens in cultured fish with a custom peptide database constructed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS),"Piamsomboon P., Jaresitthikunchai J., Hung T.Q., Roytrakul S., Wongtavatchai J.",2020-02-11,"Animals, Aquaculture, Bacterial Infections, Bacterial Proteins, Cluster Analysis, Databases, Protein, Fish Diseases, Fishes, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Biotyper, Fish disease, Mass spectrometry, Proteomic","Background: The majority of infectious diseases of cultured fish is caused by bacteria. Rapid identification of bacterial pathogens is necessary for immediate management. The present study developed a custom Main Spectra Profile (MSP) database and validate the method using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for rapid identification of fish bacterial pathogens. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus iniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii, and Edwardsiella tarda obtained from diseased fish were used as representative bacterial pathogens in this study. Bacterial peptides were extracted to create a Main Spectra Profile (MSP), and the MSPs of each bacterial species was added into the MALDI Biotyper database. Fifteen additional isolates of each bacterial species were tested to validate the utilized technique. Results: The MSPs of all field isolates were clearly distinguishable, and the MSPs of the same species were clustered together. The identification methodology was validated with 75 bacterial isolates. The reliability and specificity of the method were determined with MALDI Biotyper log score values and matching results with 16 s rDNA sequencing. The species identification using the public MALDI Biotyper library (Bruker MALDI Biotyper) showed unreliable results (log score < 2.000) with 42.67% matching result with the reference method. In contrast, accurate identification was obtained when using the custom-made database, giving log score > 2.115, and a 100% matching result. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an effective identification of fish bacterial pathogens when a complete custom-made MSP database is applied. Further applications require a broad, well-established database to accommodate prudent identification of many fish bacterial pathogens by MALDI-TOF MS.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)
Can endolysosomal deacidification and inhibition of autophagy prevent severe COVID-19?,"Morris G., Athan E., Walder K., Bortolasci C.C., O'Neil A., Marx W., Berk M., Carvalho A.F., Maes M., Puri B.K.",2020-12-01,"Antiviral Agents, Autophagy, Azithromycin, COVID-19, Endosomes, Humans, Hydroxychloroquine, Lysosomes, Pandemics, SARS-CoV-2, Antiviral treatment, COVID-19, Immunomodulation, Macrolide, SARS-CoV-2","The possibility is examined that immunomodulatory pharmacotherapy may be clinically useful in managing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), known to result from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis. It is therefore also suggested that further pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might encourage the apoptotic clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The 477 dairy farmers in the central part of Thailand were interviewed using questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression (MLR). It was found that the intention to adopt UV-C can accurately predict the factors affecting the intention to use the technology based on the intention levels to create diffusion and promote acceptance. To increase the diffusion and acceptance of UV-C, the perceived usefulness to increase the milk price was the major influenced factor to promote technology acceptance. Providing facilities for maintenance, the use of this innovation and reporting news about the benefits of new technology to create positive attitudes and confidence lead to the spread of technology driven by early adopters.

However, less attention has been paid to whether or not this way of thinking and methodological processes can be fully applied to specific settings like medical startups. Some challenges such as implementation, resource allocation, working procedures, and organizational transformation could be different in shapes and forms and in intensity vis-à-vis medical startups. The study aims to cope with this deficiency by, firstly, reviewing previous empirical studies that presented process models, challenges, and positive effects of the agile manifesto and the agile-stage-gate model on well-established firms. Secondly, to investigate the agile application in startup settings, the researchers conducted a longitudinal case study by drawing on a successful medical product startup in Thailand that has engaged in the actual implementation of the agile manifesto and agile-stage-gate model in its product development. Thirdly, the study compared the results of implementing the agile in large firms and the medical startup case in this study to investigate similarities and differences in terms of challenges and effects. The study showed both correlations in the same and contrasting directions of the previous studies and the case study's results. The findings of this study can be created and categorized into four aspects of applying the agile-stage-gate in a startup, including balance transformation, work process, person-job fit, and team collaboration. Additionally, the study revealed the relationship among these four aspects, which together form an agile model for medical startups that balance between the long-term objectives and short-term goals, the adaptability and predictability, and the flexibility and rigidity of the set objectives.","product development; concurrent engineeringneering, fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, medical, sociology","Management of Technology and Innovation, Marketing, Strategy and Management, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Health Informatics, Safety Research"

In this study, we made an equation using simple linear regression to predict the percentage of error against the time that the sensor was used while reading temperature data. In the initial steps we designed a simple embedded system using the Arduino and the LM35 temperature sensor. Furthermore, measurements are made for a certain interval every five minutes. From the measurement data, the constant and regression coefficient are calculated by determining time as the dependent variable (Causal Factor Variable) and the percentage of error as the independent variable (Predictors). The results obtained a constant value of 5.56 and a regression coefficient of -0.014.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering, Mathematics, medical","Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Signal Processing, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Control and Optimization, Health Informatics"

The results showed that the colors of silver colloids ranging from blue to yellow depended on amount of NaBH4 added. Due to Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) properties, different shapes and sizes of silver nanoparticles resulting in different colors. It was found that the pH value also affected color development of silver colloids. By adjusting the pH value, the colors of silver colloids changed to different colors or shades, which were clarified by the changes in the center as well as intensity of the absorption spectra. Moreover, the silver colloid in an acidic condition led to aggregation of nanoparticles.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

To overcome this problem, acquiring more and larger data storage is the simplest solution. But this solution is rather costly and may produce poisonous electronic garbage. A new fast and memory-efficient algorithm for learning and classifying these data without increasing the space and time complexities more than those of current learning and classifying algorithms is desirable. Although many one-pass online or incremental learning algorithms based on hyperellipsoidal functions for streaming data without retaining any learned data in fixed storage have been successfully developed for training streaming data, achieving high accuracy of any testing dataset is unstable and uncontrollable, depending on the experimental datasets. This paper proposes an improvement to these one-pass and fixed-storage learning algorithms so that the high accuracy of testing data can be significantly improved and stabilized, regardless of the experimental datasets. The concept is based on animal recoil behavior, which occurs when an animal moves away suddenly from something it dislikes. The behavior is mathematically modeled in forms of shrinking and shifting the hyperellipsoidal function during the training period to improve testing accuracy. The experimental results on 15 datasets improved the accuracy up to 8.16 % and also provided the highest or near-highest accuracy results in 10 datasets when compared to other algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Methods: Total genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs of 25 depressed and 60 healthy subjects before, immediately after, and 3 h after the exposure to H2O2. Evaluation of mtDNA copy number was performed using real-time PCR and 2-ΔCt methods. Semi-long run real-time PCR was used to estimate the number of mtDNA lesions. Results: Baseline mtDNA copy number did not differ in cells of healthy and depressed subjects; however, it was negatively correlated with the severity of the episode. After a 10-min challenge with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), depressed patients’ PBMCs exhibited slower changes of the copy number, indicating a lower efficiency of mtDNA degradation compared to controls. Moreover, a significantly higher number of mtDNA lesions was found in depressed patients at the baseline as well as at other experimental time points. mtDNA lesions were also elevated in depressed patient cells immediately after H2O2 exposure. Induction of oxidative stress had no significant influence on the cells of controls. Conclusions: We are the first to show that impairment in repair and degradation of mtDNA may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

The improper prescription of antibiotics is one factor that promotes antibiotic resistance. Access to antimicrobial surveillance data is essential when assessing the pattern and appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions in hospitals and for the establishment of an antimicrobial stewardship program. This study aimed to describe the rate of antimicrobial use and the pattern of prescriptions in a tertiary care pediatric unit in Thailand. Methods: A point prevalence survey on antimicrobial use was conducted monthly between January and June 2016, using standardized tools. The survey included all inpatient pediatric beds and identified all children receiving antimicrobial treatment on the day of the survey. Results: The study included 644 children, 43.3% of whom received antimicrobial treatment during hospitalization. In general wards, the rate of antimicrobial prescriptions was 37.2%; in oncology wards it was 47.0%; in intensive care units it was 38.7%, and in surgical wards it was 67.7%. Meropenem was the most prescribed antimicrobial in the general wards (24.5%) and intensive care units (28.6%), whereas antipseudomonas was the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial in the oncology ward (26.6%). For the surgical ward, the most prescribed antimicrobial was third-generation cephalosporin for both prophylaxis and treatment (39.0%). The most common reason for antimicrobial use was the treatment of infections. Conclusions: Nearly half of hospitalized children received at least one antimicrobial. This was comparable with other pediatric tertiary care centers, although the high use of meropenem was different. This study provides important baseline information on antimicrobial use in a large tertiary-care pediatric unit and could lead to a nationwide survey in the future.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

To date, neither a specific antiviral drug nor a clinically effective vaccine is available. Among the 15 viral non-structural proteins (nsps), nsp16 methyltransferase has been considered as a potential target due to its crucial role in RNA cap 2′-O-methylation process, preventing the virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms. In the present study, molecular recognition between the two natural nucleoside analogs (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and sinefungin (SFG)) and the SARS-CoV-2 nsp16/nsp10/m7GpppAC5 was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations based on MM/GBSA and WaterSwap approaches. The binding affinity and the number of hot-spot residues, atomic contacts, and H-bond formations of SFG/nsp16 complex were distinctly higher than those of SAH/nsp16 system, consistent with the lower water accessibility at the enzyme active site. Notably, only SFG could electrostatically interact with the 2′-OH and N3 of RNA's adenosine moiety, mimicking the methyl transfer reaction of S-adenosyl-L-methionine substrate. The atomistic binding mechanism obtained from this work paves the way for further optimizations and designs of more specific SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 inhibitors in the fight against COVID-19.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, computer science","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Computer Science Applications"

These changes can directly affect protein expression and structure. In humans, the most common RNA editing is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I editing) but in next-generation sequencing inosine is read as guanine (A-to-G) and mostly found in Alu regions. With this information, several algorithms and software tools have been developed for identifying RNA editing sites. In this paper, we present TAE-ML, a random forest model for detecting RNA editing sites from SNVs in a VCF file called from an RNA-Seq experiment. TAE-ML was integrated with multiple filters to remove artificial variants and incorporated the surrounding sequence of SNVs to accurately identify RNA editing sites. The YH dataset from previous research was used for training the model. The Hela, CH24T, and CH62T datasets were used for testing. Compared with RED-ML and RDDpred with the same candidate sites, TAE-ML got a higher accuracy and F1 score than both tools. These results suggested that our model is capable of predicting true RNA editing sites. We designed TAE-ML to be a simple python script to make it easy to run on various operating systems that support python.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Software, Information Systems and Management, Modeling and Simulation"

Compared with physicians, nurses were most likely to report patient intolerance to net ultrafiltration (73.4% vs 81.3%; p = 0.002), frequent interruptions (40.4% vs 54.5%; p < 0.001), and unavailability of trained staff (11.9% vs 15.6%; p = 0.04), whereas physicians reported unavailability of dialysis machines (14.3% vs 6.1%; p < 0.001) and costs associated with treatment as barriers (12.1% vs 3.0%; p < 0.001) with significant regional variation. Conclusions: Our study provides new knowledge about the presence and extent of international practice variation in net ultrafiltration. We also identified barriers and specific targets for quality improvement initiatives. Our data reflect the need for evidence-based practice guidelines for net ultrafiltration.",medical,Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine
"Bilateral ureteral obstruction is rapidly accompanied by ER stress and activation of autophagic degradation of IMCD proteins, including AQP2","Somparn P., Boonkrai C., Charngkaew K., Chomanee N., Hodge K.G., Fenton R.A., Pisitkun T., Khositseth S.",2020-01-01,"Animals, Aquaporin 2, Autophagy, Chromatography, Liquid, Disease Models, Animal, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress, Kidney, Kidney Tubules, Collecting, Male, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Ureteral Obstruction, Aquaporin 2, Autophagy, Bilateral ureteral obstruction, Endoplasmic reticulum, Inner medullary collecting duct, Proteomics","After the release of bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO), postobstructive diuresis from an impaired urine concentration mechanism is associated with reduced aquaporin 2 (AQP2) abundance in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this AQP2 reduction is incompletely understood. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we studied molecular changes in IMCDs isolated from rats with 4-h BUO or sham operation at the early onset of AQP2 downregulation using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Two-hundred fifteen proteins had significant changes in abundances, with 65% of them downregulated in the IMCD of 4-h BUO rats compared with sham rats. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that significantly changed proteins were associated with functional Gene Ontology terms, including “cell-cell adhesion,” “cell-cell adherens junction,” “mitochondrial inner membrane,” “endoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex,” and the KEGG pathway of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or immunoblot analysis confirmed the changes in 19 proteins representative of each predominant cluster, including AQP2. Electron microscopy demonstrated disrupted tight junctions, disorganized adherens junctions, swollen mitochondria, enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and numerous autophagosomes/lysosomes in the IMCD of rats with 4-h BUO. AQP2 and seven proteins chosen as representative of the significantly altered clusters had a significant increase in immunofluorescence-based colocalization with autophagosomes/lysosomes. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed colocalization of AQP2 with the autophagosome marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/ 1B-light chain 3 and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D in IMCD cells of rats with 4-h BUO. We conclude that enhanced autophagic degradation of AQP2 and other critical proteins, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress in the IMCD, are initiated shortly after BUO.","biochemistryistry, medical","Physiology, Urology"

In the production of rechargeable ZIBs, the cathode plays an important role. Manganese oxide (MnO2) is considered the most promising and widely investigated intercalation cathode material. Nonetheless, MnO2 cathodes are subjected to challenging issues viz. limited capacity, low rate capability and poor cycling stability. It is seen that the MnO2 heterostructure can enable long-term cycling stability in different types of energy devices. Herein, a versatile chemical method for the preparation of MnO2 heterostructure on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MNH-CNT) is reported. Besides, the synthesized MNH-CNT is composed of δ- MnO2 and γ-MnO2. A ZIB using the MNH-CNT cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 236 mAh g−1 at 400 mA g−1, 108 mAh g−1 at 1600 mA g−1 and excellent cycling stability. A pseudocapacitive behavior investigation demonstrates fast zinc ion diffusion via a diffusion-controlled process with low capacitive contribution. Overall, the MNH-CNT cathode is seen to exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

Laboratory investigation of the properties of cement fly ash gravel for use as a column-supported embankment,"Yoobanpot N., Jamsawang P., Krairan K., Jongpradist P., Likitlersuang S.",2020-10-10,"Calcium silicate hydrate, Column-supported embankment, Consolidation process, Consolidation settlement, Engineering properties, Experimental investigations, Laboratory investigations, Ordinary Portland cement, Cement fly ash gravel, Deep mixing, Permeability, Porous concrete, Soft clay, Soil improvement, Stone column","Deep cement mixing (DCM) columns are used to support embankments built on soft clay, but these columns have limitations in terms of their engineering properties such as low column strength and low column permeability. Therefore, the use of cement fly ash gravel (CFG) instead of DCM columns has been introduced. The objective of this paper is to present an experimental investigation of the properties of CFG. Gravels with sizes of 4.76 to 12.70 mm were mixed with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) Type 1 and fly ash (FA) to create CFG materials. OPC was partially replaced by FA at levels of 0 to 25% by weight of OPC. The engineering properties of the CFG materials were studied through the porosity, compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, and permeability coefficient after curing for 28, 50, and 90 days. The microstructures of the OPC-FA pastes were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Finally, preliminary guidelines for selecting a suitable porosity of CFG columns were proposed. Test results show that the porosity of the CFG materials ranged from 25.8 to 31.1% and affected the strength and permeability. The strength of CFG was 6 to 13 times greater than that of a DCM column, and the permeability of CFG was 9 to 17 mm/s, which was much higher than that of a DCM column, indicating that the use of a CFG column-supported embankment built on soft clay was more effective than the use of a DCM column in terms of the column bearing capacity and acceleration of consolidation settlement. The replacement of 15% of the OPC with FA exhibited the highest strength and smallest porosity because it provided the greatest amount of calcium silicate hydrate. Preliminary guidelines show that small-sized gravel with medium porosity is proper for generating column-supported embankments on soft clay to carry medium loads and to accelerate the consolidation process.","water engineeringneering, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"
Ten-year estimation of net primary productivity in a mangrove forest under a tropical monsoon climate in Eastern Thailand: Significance of the temperature environment in the dry season,"Poungparn S., Komiyama A., Umnouysin S., Rodtassana C., Sangtiean T., Maknual C., Pravinvongvuthi T., Suchewaboripont V., Kato S.",2020-09-01,"Coastal ecosystems, Fast-growing species, Linear regression models, Net primary productivity, Plant composition, Temperature environments, Total tree biomass, Tropical monsoon, Carbon dynamics, Net primary productivity, Tree growth, Tropical monsoon mangrove","Mangrove forests play crucial roles in the coastal ecosystems of the tropics. Few studies have addressed long-term changes in the net primary productivity (NPP) of mangroves in relation to the tropical monsoon climate. We conducted a tree census from 2008 to 2018 in a permanent plot at a secondary mangrove forest under the tropical monsoon climate of Eastern Thailand. During this period, the mortality of fast-growing species and the increasing number of newly recruited trees revealed a temporal change in the plant composition and distribution. Total tree biomass linearly increased from 283.64 to 381.72 t·ha-1 during the study period. The NPP was calculated by using the summation method, which included fine root production. The NPP ranged from 21.19 to 29.04 ·-1·yr-1. The fluctuation in NPP and its components were analyzed in relation to climatic factors by the linear regression model. The NPP did not relate with the annual climatic factors, such as the mean temperature and annual rainfall. However, both increments in the basal area and living tree biomass, which is a major component of NPP, were negatively related with the maximum and mean monthly temperatures in the dry season. The annual mortality rate related positively with annual rainfall and the maximum monthly temperature in the dry season. Linear regression analyses showed that some major components of NPP were chiefly affected by the temperature environment in the dry season. These results indicated that the weather in the dry season was largely restricting the mangrove NPP due to effects on the saline water dynamics of the soils under the tropical monsoon climate, which were revealed by our recent study. It implies that the hot-dry season may lead to high mortality, long-term reduction in the increment of living-trees biomass, and thus lowered the ability to maintain high NPP of mangrove forests over the long-term.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Forestry

However, the process usually requires costly H2 supply. Without H2 feeding, the effects of Cu on Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDO catalysts were investigated on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol with and without bio-ethanol co-feeding. As a result, the reduced catalyst dramatically increased the glycerol conversion and gave an apparently-high selectivity of chemicals such as 1,2-propandiol, ethyl lactate, and lactic acid. Apparently, besides as a hydrogen donor, ethanol also acted as a reactant that produced ethyl lactate via the esterification with lactic acid. In summary, Cu2+ and Cu+ sites promoted glycerol dehydration, the oxidation to lactic acid, and the esterification with ethanol to ethyl lactate whereas Cu0 was believed to promote the in-situ hydrogen formation from glycerol reforming. The integrated reaction pathways were also proposed and discussed.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The RE generation consists of solar and wind generation while the conventional generation, which is considered as the dispatchable generation, consists of natural gas combined-cycle and coal thermal generation. In the analysis, a unit commitment is executed based on the operating costs, i.e. variable costs and load following costs of the dispatchable generation. Moreover, the proposed method is aimed to accommodate the electricity demand with the consideration of generation characteristics such as minimum generation, ramp rate, minimum uptime and minimum downtime. The result shows that the optimal renewable energy integration is at 40% of the total electricity demand. Beyond the optimal level, the dispatchable generation operating costs tend to be higher because of the RE compensation operation.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Hardware and Architecture, Software, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

A thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) comprising of PbS QDs-doped TNTs was applied as an electron transport layer (ETL) in order to improve the planar perovskite solar cell efficiency. The role of incorporating a high surface area of one-dimensional nanotube structure of TiO2 in the conventional TiO2 layer provided a special unidirectional charge transport and a high charge collection. Moreover, doping PbS QDs onto the surface of TNTs modified the electronic and optical properties of the ETL by downshifting the conduction band of TiO2 from -4.22 to -4.58 eV, therefore promoting the driving force of an electron injection to the transparent conductive electrode. By varying the concentration of PbS QDs-doped TNTs dispersed in 2-butanol from 0.1 to 0.9 mg/mL, a concentration of 0.3 mg/mL PbS QDs-doped TNTs was the optimum concentration to be mixed with TiO2 solution for the ETL deposition.

A weakly singular boundary integral equation method together with the near-front approximation is adopted to accurately determine the intensity factors. Obtained results indicate that the non-flat crack surface, the electric field, and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap play a crucial role on the behavior of intensity factors. The mode-I stress intensity factors (KI) for two representative non-planar cracks under different crack-face conditions are found significantly different and they possess both upper and lower bounds. In addition, KI for impermeable and semi-permeable non-planar cracks treated depends strongly on the electric field whereas those of impermeable, permeable, and semi-permeable penny-shaped cracks are identical and independent of the electric field. The stress/electric intensity factors predicted by permeable and energetically consistent models are, respectively, independent of and dependent on the electric field for the penny-shaped crack and the two representative non-planar cracks. Also, the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap strongly affects the intensity factors for all crack configurations considered except for KI of the semi-permeable penny-shaped crack.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture"

This study aims to investigate the effects of surfactant mixtures, composed of nonionic, anionic, and cationic surfactants, on the removal efficiency of Cd and Zn by mixture design (MD). Central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was integrated to optimize the conditions of contaminated soil washing. However, as representatives of each type of surfactant, a single surfactant with the most effective Cd removal was selected for each type before MD and CCRD studies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) were the most effective anionic surfactants, while dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) were chosen to represent cationic surfactants and nonionic surfactants, respectively. Two systems of SDS-DTAB-Tween 80 and SLES-DTAB-Tween 80 were studied to examine their roles in Cd and Zn removal by MD. The results indicate insignificant enhancement in mixed surfactant systems for Cd and Zn removal. DTAB was identified as an ineffective surfactant, but at present, the presence of Tween 80 in both systems compensated for the use of SDS and SLES. The system containing SLES was selected to study CCRD because of its low cost and biodegradation.

Soil samples were collected from five e-waste separating and five non-separating houses in each of two neighboring communities and from six reference houses located approximately 4 km away from the e-waste community. At each selected house, the surface (0–15-cm depth) and the subsurface (15–30-cm depths) soils were taken to be digested by a microwave digester and then analyzed for the heavy metal contents by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The As, Pb, and Cd levels in the e-waste separating sites ranged from < 0.012 to 1.380, 0.110 to 15.283, and < 0.014 to 0.284 mg/kg, respectively, which were not in excess of the Thai standard level for residential soil (As = 3.9, Pb = 400, and Cd = 37 mg/kg), while Cu ranged from 1.180 to 380.413 mg/kg and exceeded the intervention value (190 mg/kg) of contaminated soil at three sites from a total of ten sampling sites. The physical e-waste dismantling activity enhanced the As, Cd, and Cu contamination levels in the surface soils. Ecological risk assessment revealed that the risk posed by the heavy metals in soils was higher at the e-waste separating houses than those at the non-separating sites and was mainly attributed to the levels of Cu > As > Cd > Pb for the surface soils and Cd > Cu > As > Pb for the subsurface soil. The association of the heavy metal soil levels with e-waste activity showed that if the e-waste activities were continuously operated, the As and Cu levels in the surface soil were more likely to exceed those levels in the reference houses. A good procedure for e-waste dismantling is necessary to be developed and implemented to prevent soil contamination and other related environmental problems.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; terrestrial pollution, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The Demand Response Resources (DRRs) can be considered as one of the most important demand side options which have been developed as an aftermath of DRPs implementation. In this paper, based on benefit function concept of customers and flexible demand elasticity, a dynamic economic model of DRPs as a combination of EDRP and TOU programs is developed. Different alternatives of DRPs are developed in which the independent system operator can choose the optimal DRP which reflects its perspectives. To do so, the Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) is employed as an effective method. In addition, entropy methods and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are utilized to prioritize various developed DRPs. To cover all operating conditions, the numerical studies are provided on a standard IEEE ten-unit test system taking from both “load profile characteristics” and “economical” points of view into account and considering different indices as peak to valley distance, peak reduction, etc. Based on obtained results, the developed model can be utilized to improve satisfaction of customers and the load profile characteristics.","management, fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering, energy","Geography, Planning and Development, Civil and Structural Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Transportation"
Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia symptoms are key components of deficit schizophrenia and are strongly associated with activated immune-inflammatory pathways,"Almulla A.F., Al-Hakeim H.K., Abed M.S., Carvalho A.F., Maes M.",2020-08-01,"Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic, Fibromyalgia, Humans, Psychotic Disorders, Reproducibility of Results, Schizophrenia, Chronic fatigue syndrome, Cytokines, Fibromyalgia, Inflammation, Myalgic encephalomyelitis, Neuroimmunomodulation","There is now evidence that schizophrenia and especially deficit schizophrenia (DefSCZ) (a phenotype characterized by negative symptoms) is accompanied by activated immune-inflammatory pathways. A subset of patients with schizophrenia and DefSCZ experience physiosomatic symptoms reminiscent of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. However, there are no data whether, in DefSCZ, physiosomatic symptoms are associated with increased levels of cytokines/chemokines. This study examined the associations between physiosomatic symptoms, as assessed with the FibroFatigue (FF) scale, and symptoms of DefSCZ as well as interleukin IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and CCL11 (eotaxin) in 120 DefSCZ patients (as defined by the Schedule for Deficit Schizophrenia) and 54 healthy controls. In DefSCZ, there were robust associations between FF and negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, psychomotor retardation and formal thought disorders. A latent vector extracted from those DefSCZ symptom domains also loaded highly on the total FF score and showed adequate convergent validity, internal consistency reliability and predictive relevance. The FF score was significantly associated with impairments in semantic and episodic memory and executive functions. Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy showed that the FF items discriminated DefSCZ from controls with an 100% accuracy. Interleukin IL-1β, IL-1RA, TNF-α and CCL11 explained 59.4% of the variance in the LV extracted from the FF and DefSCZ symptoms. In conclusion, these data show that physiosomatic symptoms are a core component of DefSCZ phenomenology and are strongly associated with activated immune pathways, which have neurotoxic effects.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

The bioengineering method using vegetation is an environmentally friendly alternative for slope stabilisation. This paper presents the effect of root reinforcement on the stability of vegetated slope under rainfall condition. A transient seepage and slope stability analysis was conducted based on the finite-element and limit equilibrium methods. Field monitoring on a residual soil slope in Thailand was numerically modelled. In transient seepage analysis, the soil-water characteristic curve and the saturated permeability measured from laboratory and in situ tests were used, and the results were comparable with the monitored values from the site. For slope stability analysis, the effective shear strength parameters from direct shear tests were used to model the well-compacted and non-compacted soil slopes. The additional shear strength of soil from the root cohesion was modelled for vegetated soil slope. The results show that the contribution of root cohesion to slope stability was more significant for the non-compacted soil condition than for the well-compacted one. Both modelled and monitored pore-water pressure reached the highest values about 1-d after the daily rainfall had reached its peak. This finding has a significant implication for landslide warning based on rainfall.","water engineeringneering, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Waste Management and Disposal, Geochemistry and Petrology, Nature and Landscape Conservation, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

In Bangladesh, the practice of EBF among adolescent mothers remains unexplored. The aim of our study was to understand the EBF practices among adolescent mothers and their determinants in both the Health and Demographic Surveillance (HDSS) system areas of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) service area (ISA) and government service area (GSA) in rural Matlab, Bangladesh. For the purpose of our study, we collected relevant information from the database of the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) of icddr,b and performed analysis to understand the trends and identify the determinants of EBF and identify the determinants of EBF among adolescent mothers living in two areas between 2007 and 2015. In total, 2947 children born to adolescent mothers were included in our final analysis. We used the Kaplan–Meier and the Cox-proportional hazards models to determine the differences in EBF practices in the two areas. We noted a lower trends of EBF in the ISA compared to the GSA in bivariate analysis. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, EBF status was 15% lower in the GSA than the ISA (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72–0.99). The father’s education was significantly different among the two populations. In both study areas, the coverage of EBF among adolescent mothers was lower than the national average (42% vs. 65%). Ensuring that adolescent mothers receive optimal care may improve EBF behavior.","genergyal, public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, geobase; related topics, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

FT-IR spectroscopy was used to confirm of each reaction in the multistep synthesis, including the transesterification, epoxidation, and reaction with ethylene glycol, ultimately producing palm olein-based polyol (POBP) and POBP-containing polyurethane foam. The morphological properties of the prepared foams were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The foam cells were uniform in size and shape, and a coarse cell structure was observed. While the pristine polyurethane foam contained closed cells, the pore structure became more interconnected with the introduction of POBP. The thermal properties were studied by DSC and TGA. In the presence of POBP, the sample was found to be less thermally stable. Mechanical testing revealed that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus were decreased, while the elongation at break was increased, suggesting that POBP improved the flexibility of the polyurethane foam. This was in agreement with the observed microstructure. Introducing POBP into the polyurethane foam also decreased the water contact angle from 120° to 80°. However, the oil sorption properties were improved due to interconnected pores along the polyurethane foam structure. Its sorption properties for synthetic dyes (methyl orange and rhodamine B) were also evaluated, and superior sorption properties were found for methyl orange. In short, the polyurethane synthesized from POBP exhibited attractive properties as a sorbent material. The labels in figures (1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) are not readable.

Thus, electron spin resonance (ESR) technique was performed to monitor the change in Ti3+ depending on the catalyst activation by a single and combination of cocatalyst. It re-vealed that the amount of Ti3+ played a crucial role on both ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization. For ethylene polymerization, the activation with TEA apparently resulted in the highest catalytic activity. The activation with TEA+TnOA combination exhibited a moderate activi-ty, whereas TnOA activation gave the lowest activity. In case of ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the presence of 1-hexene decreased activity. The effect of different cocatalysts tended to be similar to the one in the absence of 1-hexene. The decrease of temperature from 80 to 70 °C in eth-ylene/1-hexene copolymerization tended to lower catalytic activity for TnOA and TEA+TnOA, whereas only slight effect was observed for TEA system. The effect of different cocatalyst activation on the change of Ti3+ state of catalyst was elucidated by ESR measurement. It appeared that the activation of catalyst with TEA+TnOA combination essentially inhibited the reduction of Ti3+ to Ti2+ leading to lower activity. Furthermore, the polymer properties such as morphology and crystallinity can be altered by different cocatalysts.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology"

Therefore, Ni current collectors have a unique architecture and outstanding electrochemical properties. This study reports the effect of electrochemical characterizations on the electrochemical behavior and physical properties of Ni mesh and Ni foam. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) are used to examine the electrochemical properties and life span of the Ni mesh and Ni foam as a current collector in a supercapacitor application. Structural and microstructural characterizations are performed to verify the formation of an oxide layer after 1000 cycles of CV analysis. Results show that Ni foam can increase the yield electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. Ni foam present better efficiency (35 F g−1) compared to the Ni mesh (12 F g−1) at 10 mV s−1 scan rate by using 2 mg imaginary mass of active material. This result shows that Ni foam has good electrochemical performance and reversibility, higher pseudocapacitance, weaker polarization, and enhance rotating performance as to Ni mesh. The porous structure of Ni foam is in control for improving of the electrochemical properties, therefore, the electrochemical region was increased and shortened ion diffusion. Structural analysis shows that Ni mesh and Ni foam are oxidized after the electrochemical analysis and transformed to nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH). Higher specific surface area between the electrode and electrolyte leads to excellent electrochemical and pseudocapacitive performance of the Ni foam compared to the Ni mesh, even if the materials of current collectors are the same. Hence, the physical structure of the current collectors have a critical part in improving the energy density of the supercapacitor.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Four equivalent circuit models are applied to fit the experimentally obtained current-voltage characteristics of the investigated samples. The relevant circuit parameters are photocurrent, reverse saturation current, diode ideality factor, series resistance, and shunt resistance. The best fitted model of all samples contains both series and shunt resistances. According to the fitting result, the diode ideality factor of 2, which indicates the dominant recombination current, is always obtained. Comparing the extracted parameters from two single-pair hybrid QD solar cells, the effects of structural stacking sequence can be discussed in term of light absorption and carrier storage properties. We have found that an increase of stacking number from one pair to three pairs deteriorates the solar cell performance. This might be caused by an excessive total QD layer thickness or a presence of dislocation defects in that sample.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

A part of E-waste composition, random access memory (RAM) contained in printed circuit boards (PCBs) has been collected for recovering of these precious metals. In the gold extraction process, the cyanide has been widely used as a leaching agent because of its lower cost. However, cyanide-contaminated wastewater has highly toxic and poses a severe threat to human health and surroundings when treated improperly. Aqua regia, an alternative gold leaching agent, has been proposed because it is less toxic than cyanide. This study, the aqua regia leaching method was conducted to recover the gold from discarded RAM. The effects of pulp density (solid to liquid ratio) between RAM and aqua regia, leaching time, and temperature on the gold recovery were investigated. The results show that the highest extraction yield of gold was 746.8 ppm at the solid to liquid ratio of 1 g RAM to 6 mL aqua regia, at 75 ºC, and 4 hours. The findings from this study provide the understanding for selecting the parameter affecting the gold extraction efficiency, leading to the improvement of recycling technologies and environment-friendly processes for further precious metal recovery.","mixing and separation, environmental",Environmental Science (all)

This difficulty can be present from the very early stages of dementia, and may be a preclinical feature of Alzheimer's disease. Purpose This study investigates whether people with dementia perform worse on the dichotic digit test (DDT), an experimental probe of speech processing in the presence of competing speech, and whether test performance may predict dementia onset. Research Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Collection and Analysis A literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Psycinfo. We included (1) studies that included people with a diagnosis of dementia and a healthy control group with no cognitive impairment; (2) studies that reported results from a DDT in a free-recall response task; and (3) studies that had the dichotic digit mean correct percentage score or right-ear advantage, as outcome measurements. Results People with dementia had a lower DDT total score, with a pooled mean difference of 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.2-15.9). Patients with dementia had an increased right-ear advantage relative to controls with a pooled difference of 24.4% (95% CI: 21.8-27.0). Conclusion The DDT total scores are lower and the right-ear advantage increased in cognitively impaired versus normal control participants. The findings also suggest that the reduction of dichotic digit total score and increase of right-ear advantage progress as cognitive impairment increases. Whether abnormalities in dichotic digit scores could predict subsequent dementia onset should be examined in further longitudinal studies.",Health Professions,Speech and Hearing

In this study, various solvent fractions of I. obliquus were preliminarily screened for their antioxidant, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition properties. To improve the drug delivery, the active fraction (ethyl acetate fraction) of I. obliquus was synthesized into fungisome (ethyl acetate phophotidyl choline complex, EAPC) and its physical parameters were assessed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), and ς potential analysis. Then normal human hepatic L02 cells was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of EAPC. The results showed that EA fraction possesses significant free radical scavenging, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition properties. FTIR, SEM, and HPLC analysis confirmed the fungisome formation. The particle size of EAPC was 102.80 ± 0.42 nm and the ς potential was −54.30 ± 0.61 mV. The percentage of drug entrapment efficiency was 97.13% and the drug release rates of EAPC in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid were 75.04 ± 0.29% and 93.03 ± 0.36%, respectively.

To facilitate better management of Southeast Asia's transboundary Sesan, Sekong and Srepok (3S) River basin, we used the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) to diagnose the basin's current and likely future level of freshwater health. We used the conditions for December 2016 as a baseline, where Ecosystem Vitality and Ecosystem Services scored 66 and 80, respectively, out of a possible 100, whilst Governance & Stakeholders scored 43. Thus, the 3S provided a range of desired ecosystem services, but there were signs of environmental stress as well as undeveloped water governance systems and limited stakeholder engagement. We also modelled four hydropower development scenarios and found that increasing development reduced the scores of a subset of indicators. This compromised the future ability of the 3S basin's ecosystem to provide its current range of services.

Optical networks that are over-dimensioned and purposely preplanned for full protection against any single-link failure may not survive well in an event of a double-link failure. It is therefore important to understand how much impact a subsequent second link failure may have upon traffic recovery of both failed links. This paper primarily aims to investigate traffic recoverability when a double-link failure occurs. We propose several methods for improving traffic recovery without using additional backup capacities other than the existing backup resources available for single-link failure recovery. In each proposed method, integer linear programming formulation is derived to optimize the backup resource allocation. Numerical results on various network configurations have shed some light on how network operators can choose one of five alternative methods to better handle a double-link failure. From numerical results, Method 1 offers some improvement on the traffic recoverability of the second failed link without disturbing the recovered traffic of the first failed link. Method 2 reveals that the traffic recoverability of the first failed link can be improved if the backup routes of the unrecovered traffic of the first failed link can be reassigned. Method 3 is useful for maximizing the traffic recoverability of the first failed link.

Flowcharts for Easy Periodontal Diagnosis Based on the 2018 New Periodontal Classification,"Sutthiboonyapan P., Wang H.-L., Charatkulangkun O.",2020-09-01,"Consensus, Gingivitis, Humans, Periodontal Diseases, Periodontitis, Software Design, Classification, gingivitis, periodontal diseases, periodontitis","FOCUSED CLINICAL QUESTION: How can a clinician simply and quickly perform a periodontal screening and make a proper periodontal diagnosis using the 2018 proposed new periodontal classification? SUMMARY: The 2018 periodontal classification has been released, however, it is challenging for clinicians especially for the dental students to apply the published information in practice. A diagnostic flowchart was created for three of the most common periodontal conditions: health, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Additionally, flowcharts were proposed for the diagnosis of periodontitis severity and risk of progression by staging and grading. Probing depth was the first clinical parameter to categorize the type of diseases. Subsequently, bleeding on probing, radiographic bone loss/clinical attachment loss, and history of periodontal treatment were further added for making a proper diagnosis. Three clinical cases were given to demonstrate the use of the simplified proposed flowcharts. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed diagnostic flowcharts are the user-friendly tool to assist clinicians to perform an initial screening and diagnosis based on the 2018 newly proposed periodontal disease classification.",medical,Medicine (all)
Optimal operational strategy for a vanadium redox flow battery,"Jirabovornwisut T., Kheawhom S., Chen Y.-S., Arpornwichanop A.",2020-05-08,"Dynamic optimization, Electrolyte flow rates, Electrolyte imbalance, System efficiency, Vanadium redox flow batteries, Dynamic optimization, Electrolyte flow rate, Electrolyte imbalance, System efficiency, Vanadium redox flow battery","The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is regarded as a potential technology for large-scale and stationary electricity storage. Efficient operation of the VRFB to maximize the system efficiency and realize safe operation is necessary. In this work, an optimal operational strategy for improving the system efficiency is proposed. The optimization problem by minimizing the charging energy and maximizing the discharge energy under operational constraints during VRFB operation is formulated. In the proposed strategy, the electrolyte flow rate is determined and adjusted according to the variation in the active vanadium species during the charge–discharge process to ensure high system efficiency. Because operation of the VRFB under an electrolyte imbalance is considered, this new control strategy can extend the operating window in which VRFBs can operate with high discharge capacity and system efficiency.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, computer science","Chemical Engineering (all), Computer Science Applications"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival of Salmonella in feces from cattle and various wild animals (feral pigs, waterfowl, deer, and raccoons) in California, Delaware, Florida, and Ohio. Feces were inoculated with rifampin-resistant Salmonella enterica cocktails that included six serotypes: Typhimurium, Montevideo, Anatum, Javiana, Braenderup, and Newport (104 to 106 CFU/g). Fecal samples were stored at ambient temperature. Populations were enumerated for up to 1 year (364 days) by spread plating onto tryptic soy agar supplemented with rifampin. When no colonies were detected, samples were enriched. Colonies were banked on various sampling days based on availability of serotyping in each state. During the 364-day storage period, Salmonella populations decreased to ≤2.0 log CFU/g by day 84 in pig, waterfowl, and raccoon feces from all states. Salmonella populations in cattle and deer feces were 3.3 to 6.1 log CFU/g on day 336 or 364; however, in Ohio Salmonella was not detected after 120 days. Salmonella serotypes Anatum, Braenderup, and Javiana were the predominant serotypes throughout the storage period in all animal feces and states. Determination of appropriate risk mitigation strategies following animal intrusions can improve our understanding of pathogen survival in animal feces.","applied microbiology and biotechnology; micro-organisms affecting human and animal Health Professionsth; food microbiology; spoilage and contamination, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology","Food Science, Microbiology"

Five salicylate donors were studied. The chelate mode is the preferred adsorption mode. The linear relationship (R2 = 0.96) between calculated adsorption energies (Eads) of five SIDs and the experimental PP activities was observed. Thus, the SID with the strongest adsorption energy will provide the highest activity in agreement with our previous studies. Compared with diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), which is the industrial electron donor, SID has stronger Eads. The insertion step, which involves the π-complex formation (DE) and the insertion activation or intrinsic activation energy (Ea) for PP polymerization was also examined. The relation between ln(activity) and apparent activation energy (Ea(app), which is ΔEπ + Ea for the primary(1,2)-re insertion with R2 = 0.99, was observed. The salicylate donor also has a lower Ea(app) than that of DIBP. This explains the better catalytic performance of SID. Our results also demonstrated that the size and the type of hydrocarbon substituents play a key role in controlling stereoselectivity and activity. In addition, we found a good relationship between Eads and both intrinsic (Ea) and apparent (Ea(app) activation energies of five salicylate donors with R2 of 0.90 and 0.97, respectively.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Three full-scale bridge piers were tested under lateral cyclic loading. A control bridge pier was tested in the as-built condition and the other two bridge piers were experimentally tested after strengthening them with LC-GFRP jacketing. The LC-GFRP strengthening was performed using two different configurations. The control bridge pier showed poor seismic response with the progress of significant cracks at very low drift levels. Test results indicated the efficiency of the tested strengthening configurations to improve the performance of the strengthened bridge piers including crack pattern, yield, and ultimate cyclic load capacities, ductility ratio, dissipated energy capacity, initial stiffness degradation, and fracture mode.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics, engineering","Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Engineering (all), Computer Networks and Communications, Artificial Intelligence"

Compared with the original RP, ultrasound treated RP (URP) significantly changed the chemical composition. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results suggested that the conformation of RP was filiform, smooth and slim and a large number of spherical pectins were produced by ultrasonic modification. Both RP and URP exhibited the potential antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Moreover, RP and URP effectively attenuated the oxidative damage induced by H2O2 and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in human hepatic L02 cells and URP showed higher activity than RP. These results suggested that the unripe fruit pomace of Rubus chingii Hu could be used as a potential resource to obtain the antioxidant pectin and the ultrasound-assisted modification could significantly change the physical structure of pectin and effectively improve its antioxidant activities.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

With an increasing demand of higher living standards and a rapidly growing population, the resource shortage is even more pressing. It has long been understood that the stage of a country's development has important implications for its use of metal raw materials. This paper collects the related data to identify the flow of copper including the primary sources from mining and the secondary recycling sources within the region. Electrical appliances and electronic waste (e-waste) are the principle sources of secondary copper from recycling. However, e-waste recycling has always posed significant challenges, including the implementation of reverse logistics mechanisms, the illegal exporting of e-waste and challenging in effective material separation especially in the developing countries in Asia. The traditional development models rooted in “take, make and waste”, need to be replaced by alternative models of growth to ensure long-term sustainability through the circular economy. In a circular economy, the use of scarce resources through disruptive technology and business models based on longevity, renewability, reuse, repair, upgrade, refurbishment, capacity sharing, and dematerialization. This paper identifies the policy responses of the developing countries in order to reduce the impact from informal e-waste recycling.","fluidex; related topics, environmental",Environmental Science (all)

However, the exact impact of this drug treatment on learning and memory has not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effect of APAP treatment on the alteration of synapses and oxidative stress in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. APAP at a dose of 200 mg/kg bw was fed to adult male Wistar rats through either acute (n = 10), 15-day (n = 10), or 30-day (n = 10) treatment regimens. The synaptic ultrastructure and proteins, synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), were monitored. The amount of protein carbonyl oxidation (PCO) and glutathione (GSH) levels were examined. Our results demonstrated that acute treatment with APAP had no effect on synapses and oxidative stress. However, the synapses obtained from rats with 15-day APAP treatment showed a marked shortening of active zones and widening of the synaptic cleft. Decrement of SYP and PSD-95 proteins were demonstrated in these rats as well. With 30-day APAP treatment, the alteration of the synaptic ultrastructure and proteins was more evident. Moreover, the depletion of GSH and the elevation of PCO levels were demonstrated in the rats treated with APAP for 30 days. These results suggest that long-term APAP treatment can induce synaptic degeneration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The increase in oxidative stress in these brain areas may be due to the deleterious effect of this drug.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

This work reports a novel approach for competitive paper-based colorimetric immunoassay (PCI) using the Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite as label for sensitive and specific determination of SAL in flesh of swine and urine. The Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite was synthesized by a one-step chemical bath method, which could instantly oxidize a chromogenic substrate for the color development under acidic conditions without the participation of H2O2. This approach provides high affinity between the Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite and the substrate (with the Michaelis–Menten constant of 0.44 mM). In addition, the fabrication process of the PCI was simple and cost-effective. Particularly, the novel PCI also exhibits simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the fabrication process through a simple wax screen-printing, which requires inexpensive equipment and material including a screen, wax, a squeegee, and a hair dryer. Under optimal conditions, the competitive PCI exhibited a linearity range of 0.025 to 1.00 µg/L. The developed approach offers advantages over the conventional ELISA for the purpose of routine use because it requires a shorter incubation time (<1 hr), significantly small volumes of reagents and samples (<100 µL each), and an inexpensive consumer-grade digital camera coupled with a simple gray-scale transformation of the RGB (Red Green Blue) color image for the purpose of quantification of the detection. Practical Application: Salbutamol (SAL) can cause potential hazards to human health and the use of which as growth promoter in meat-producing animals is illegal. This work introduces a novel approach for competitive immunoassay on paper-based colorimetric immunoassay using the Ag3PO4/Ag nanocomposite as the label (instead of using natural enzyme) for low-cost, sensitive, and specific determination of SAL residues at low level in flesh of swine and urine samples.

The SPPA is a model that the potential investors supply and sell the PV output power to customers with the discount rates, directly. If the excess energy supplied to the grid is allowable, the investors will get additional revenue from the reverse power. The proposed rates from the investors are practically formulated in term of the SPPA discount rates on utility's retail rate. Therefore, to convince the customers while retaining revenue of the investors, attractive and feasible SPPA discount rates should be investigated thoroughly. The proposed methodology in this paper to determine the SPPA discount rates for rooftop PVs under the SPPA and BTMS is presented. The cost optimization was developed and proposed to minimize the SPPA electricity charges while maintaining an acceptable internal rate of return (IRR). The benefit of the customers is the lower electricity charges, while the benefit of the investors is the sold power from rooftop PVs. Furthermore, with the proposed methodology, the large general service load in Thailand to assess the effect of the rate of excess energy and size of rooftop PVs.

Standardising definitions for the pre-eclampsia core outcome set: A consensus development study,"Duffy J.M.N., Cairns A.E., Magee L.A., von Dadelszen P., van 't Hooft J., Gale C., Brown M., Chappell L.C., Grobman W.A., Fitzpatrick R., Karumanchi S.A., Lucas D.N., Mol B., Stark M., Thangaratinam S., Wilson M.J., Williamson P.R., Ziebland S., McManus R.J., Abalos E.J., Adamson C.C.D., Akadri A.A., Akturk Z., Allegaert K., Angel-Muller E., Antretter J., Ashdown H.F., Audibert F., Auger N., Aygun C., Babic I., Bagga R., Baker J.M., Beebeejaun Y., Bhakta P., Bhandari V., Bhattacharya S., Blanker M.H., Bloomfield F.H., Bof A., Brennan S.M., Broekhuijsen K., Broughton Pipkin F., Browne J.L., Browning R.M., Bull J.W., Butt A., Button D., Campbell J.P., Campbell D.M., Carbillon L., Carthy S., Casely E., Cave J.A., Cecatti J.G., Chamillard M.E., Chassard D., Checheir N.C., Chulkov V.S., Cluver C.A., Crawford C.F., Daly M.C., Darmochwal-Kolarz D.A., Davies R.E., Davies M.W., Dawson J.S., Dobson N., Dodd C.N., Donald F., Duley L., Epstein-Mares J., Erez O., Evans E., Farlie R.N., Ferris A.V., Frankland E.M., Freeman D.J., Gainder S., Ganzevoort W., Gbinigie O.A., Gerval M.-O., Ghosh S.K., Gingel L.J., Glogowska M., Goodlife A., Gough K.L., Green J.R., Gul F., Haggerty L., Hall D.R., Hallman M., Hamilton L.M., Hammond S.J., Harlow S.D., Hays K.E., Hickey S.C., Higgins M., Hinton L., Hobson S.R., Hogg M.J., Hollands H.J., Homer C.S.E., Hoodbhoy Z., Howell P., Huppertz B., Husain S., Jacoby S.D., Jacqz-Aigrain E., Jenkins G., Jewel D., Johnson M.J., Johnston C.L., Jones P.M., Kantrowitz-Gordon I., Khan R.-U., Kirby L.J., Kirk C., Knight M., Korey M.T., Lee G.J., Lee V.W., Levene L.S., Londero A.P., Lust K.M., MacKenzie V., Malha L., Mattone M., McCartney D.E., McFadden A., McKinstry B.H., Middleton P.F., Mills D.J., Mistry H.D., Mitchell C.A., Mockler J.C., Molsher S.-A., Monast E.S., Moodley J., Mooij R., Moore E.L., Morgan L., Moulson A., Mughal F., Mundle S.R., Munoz M.A., Murray E., Nagata C., Nair A.S., Nakimuli A., Nath G., Newport R.S., Oakeshott P., Ochoa-Ferraro M.R., Odendaal H., Ohkuchi A., Oliveira L., Ortiz-Panozo E., Oudijk M.A., Oygucu S.E., Paech M.J., Painter R.C., Parry C.L., Payne B.A., Pearson E.L., Phupong V., Pickett N., Pickles K.A., Plumb L.K., Prefumo F., Preston R., Ray J.G., Rayment J., Regan L.V., Rey E., Robson E.J., Rubin A.N., Rubio-Romero J.A., Rull K., Sass N., Sauve N., Savory N.A., Scott J.R., Seaton S.E., Seed P.T., Shakespeare J.M., Shand A.W., Sharma S., Shaw T.Y., Smedley K.L., Smith D., Smith Conk A., Soward D., Stepan H., Stroumpoulis K., Surendran A., Takeda S., Tan L., Theriot B.S., Thomas H.F., Thompson K., Thompson P.I., Thompson M.J., Toms L., Torney K.L.H.T., Treadwell J.S., Tucker K.L., Turrentine M.A., Van Hecke O., Van Oostwaard M.F., Vasquez D.N., Vaughan D.J.A., Vinturache A., Walker J., Wardle S.P., Wasim T., Waters J.H., Whitehead C.L., Wolfson A., Yeo S., Zermansky A.G.",2020-07-01,"Adult, Consensus, Delphi Technique, Female, Humans, Pre-Eclampsia, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Pregnancy Outcome, Reference Standards, Treatment Outcome, Consensus development study, Core outcome set, Hypertension in pregnancy, Outcome measure, Pre-eclampsia, Randomised controlled trials","Objectives: To develop consensus definitions for the core outcome set for pre-eclampsia. Study design: Potential definitions for individual core outcomes were identified across four formal definition development initiatives, nine national and international guidelines, 12 Cochrane systematic reviews, and 79 randomised trials. Eighty-six definitions were entered into the consensus development meeting. Ten healthcare professionals and three researchers, including six participants who had experience of conducting research in low- and middle-income countries, participated in the consensus development process. The final core outcome set was approved by an international steering group. Results: Consensus definitions were developed for all core outcomes. When considering stroke, pulmonary oedema, acute kidney injury, raised liver enzymes, low platelets, birth weight, and neonatal seizures, consensus definitions were developed specifically for low- and middle-income countries because of the limited availability of diagnostic interventions including computerised tomography, chest x-ray, laboratory tests, equipment, and electroencephalogram monitoring. Conclusions: Consensus on measurements for the pre-eclampsia core outcome set will help to ensure consistency across future randomised trials and systematic reviews. Such standardization should make research evidence more accessible and facilitate the translation of research into clinical practice.

Allele frequencies are correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting that the alleles have temperature-dependent fitness benefits. We determined the enzyme activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro. The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allozyme is more flexible than the S and F allozymes at 50°C, suggesting a plausible explanation for its loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15°C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from 2 h of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes. Combined, these results explain clinal variation in malate dehydrogenase allele frequencies in the honeybee at the molecular level.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Physiology, Aquatic Science, Animal Science and Zoology, Molecular Biology, Insect Science"

The purpose of this study was to investigate mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNACN) and inflammatory cytokines in primary knee OA patients and healthy volunteers. A total of 204 knee OA patients and 169 age-matched healthy volunteers were recruited. Their relative blood leukocyte mtDNACN was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and ten inflammatory cytokines in their plasma were detected by multiplex immunoassay. Blood leukocyte mtDNACN in the OA group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Leukocyte mtDNACN in the control group was negatively correlated with their age (r=−0.380, P<0.0001), whereas mtDNACN in the OA group was positively correlated with their age (r=0.198, P<0.001). Plasma interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 were significantly higher in the knee OA group than in the control group. The plasma IL-6 level was positively correlated with blood leukocyte mtDNACN in the OA group (r=0.547, P=0.0014). IL-5 showed as a major factor (coefficient 0.69) in the second dimension of principle components analysis (PCA)-transformed data and was significantly higher in the OA group (P<0.001) as well as negatively correlated with mtDNACN (r=−0.577, P<0.001). These findings suggest that elevation of plasma IL-4 and IL-6 and a relative reduction in mtDNACN might be effective biomarkers for knee OA.

Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are a potential source of stem cells; however, the mechanisms controlling cell differentiation remain largely unknown. Utilizing rat DPSCs, we examined the effect of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on osteoblast differentiation and characterized its mechanism of action using real-time Ca 2+ imaging analysis. Our results revealed that ATP enhanced osteogenesis as indicated by Ca 2+ deposition in the extracellular matrix via Alizarin Red S staining. This was consistent with upregulation of osteoblast genes BMP2, Mmp13, Col3a1, Ctsk, Flt1, and Bgn. Stimulation of DPSCs with ATP (1–300 µM) increased intracellular Ca 2+ signals in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas histamine, acetylcholine, arginine vasopressin, carbachol, and stromal-cell-derived factor-1α failed to do so. Depletion of intracellular Ca 2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum by thapsigargin abolished the ATP responses which, nevertheless, remained detectable under extracellular Ca 2+ free condition. Furthermore, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 and the inositol triphosphate (IP 3) receptor inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate inhibited the Ca 2+ signals. Our findings provide a better understanding of how ATP controls osteogenesis in DPSCs, which involves a Ca 2+-dependent mechanism via the PLC-IP 3 pathway. This knowledge could help improve osteogenic differentiation protocols for tissue regeneration of bone structures.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Physiology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"

We use a Microsoft Excel–based spreadsheet to calculate the accumulated cases of preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer and the budget impact of each screening program. The model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of 3 screening strategies: pooled HPV test with reflex liquid-based cytology triage, HPV genotyping with reflex p16/ki67 dual stain cytology, and pooled HPV test with dual stain. The main outcomes were the total cost, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategy entailing primary HPV genotyping and reflex dual stain cytology is the least costly strategy (total cost US$37 893 407) and provides the similar QALY gained compared to pooled high-risk HPV testing with reflex dual stain (Average QALY 24.03). Pooled HPV test with reflex dual staining is more costly compared to strategy without reflex dual staining. The ICER was US$353.40 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the model is sensitive to the cost of dual stain and the cost of cancer treatment. Decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer case and increasing the QALYs can be successful by using dual stain cytology as the triage test for pooled HPV test or HPV genotyping. The result of our analysis favors the use of HPV genotyping with the reflex dual stain as it offers the most QALY at the lowest cost.",medical,"Hematology, Oncology"

The objective of this study was to study the effect of enzymatic deamidation by protein-glutaminase (PG) on the flavor-binding potential of coconut protein (CP) using a vanillin flavor model. Vanillin was allowed to interact with either 3 g/100 mL of untreated or deamidated CP (DCP) suspended in 0.05 mol/L phosphate buffer. The results showed that deamidation by PG decreased overall flavor-binding affinity of vanillin to the protein from 586 to 985 ( × 104) L/mol to 435–803 ( × 104) L/mol. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the vanillin-protein interactions were spontaneous and the interactions were driven by enthalpy. Beside Schiff-base formation, van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonding were suggested to be involved in the binding mechanism. The lower binding affinity for vanillin for DCP than for CP was confirmed by a sensory threshold study, which showed that vanillin had about a 2 fold lower odor detection threshold in DCP solution than in CP solution.","protein biochemistryistryhemistry; structural studies; molecular recognition; protein-protein interaction, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

Until recently, little research has existed on how these technologies can be specifically applied to the monitoring of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform, we applied the recently developed phenology-based threshold classification method (PBTC) for detecting and mapping forest cover and carbon stock changes in Siem Reap province, Cambodia, between 1990 and 2018. The obtained PBTC maps were validated using Google Earth high resolution historical imagery and reference land cover maps by creating 3771 systematic 5 × 5 km spatial accuracy points. The overall cumulative accuracy of this study was 92.1% and its cumulative Kappa was 0.9, which are sufficiently high to apply the PBTC method to detect forest land cover change. Accordingly, we estimated the carbon stock changes over a 28-year period in accordance with the Good Practice Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We found that 322,694 ha of forest cover was lost in Siem Reap, representing an annual deforestation rate of 1.3% between 1990 and 2018. This loss of forest cover was responsible for carbon emissions of 143,729,440 MgCO2 over the same period. If REDD+ activities are implemented during the implementation period of the Paris Climate Agreement between 2020 and 2030, about 8,256,746 MgCO2 of carbon emissions could be reduced, equivalent to about USD 6-115 million annually depending on chosen carbon prices. Our case study demonstrates that the GEE and PBTC method can be used to detect and monitor forest cover change and carbon stock changes in the tropics with high accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

For point-of-care testing, a simple, rapid, and disposable sensor is required. In this work, a pop-up DNA device as an alternative 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) platform was firstly proposed for label-free HBV DNA detection. The pop-up design was created to allow control of the fluidic path, incubation time, and electrical connectivity by simple folding. The proposed platform enabled a multi-step operation to be performed within a single device. Moreover, this architecture allows facile sample introduction, avoiding contamination and minimizing the exposure of biofluids. A pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid, acpcPNA, which exhibits high affinity and selectivity, was covalently immobilized onto the modified cellulose on a working electrode for capturing the target DNA. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed with a signal-off system. The presence of HBV DNA resulted in a decrease of the electrochemical signal of hexacyanoferrate (III)/(II) in a concentration-dependent fashion. Under optimal conditions, a linear range of 50 pM-100 nM with the detection limit of 1.45 pM was achieved. Moreover, good selectivity of proposed device was demonstrated. The pop-up DNA sensor was successfully applied for the detection of HBV DNA extracted from plasmid constructs.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

There are differences between MDD and BD type 1 (BP1) and 2 (BP2) in nitro-oxidative stress biomarkers associated with leaky gut. This study examines serum IgM/IgA responses directed to LPS of 6 Gram-negative bacteria as well as IgG responses to oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in 29 BP1, 37 BP2, 44 MDD, and 30 healthy individuals. Increased IgM/IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly discriminated patients with affective disorders (MDD plus BD) from controls. BP1 patients showed higher IgM responses to Morganella morganii as compared with MDD and BP2 patients. Patients with melancholia showed higher IgA responses to Citrobacter koseri as compared to controls and non-melancholic depression. The total score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was significantly associated with IgA responses to C. koseri. IgG to oxLDL was significantly associated with increased bacterial translocation. In conclusion, MDD, BP1, and BP2 are accompanied by an immune response due to the increased load of LPS while these aberrations in the gut-brain axis are most pronounced in BP1 and melancholia. Activated oxidative stress pathways and autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes in mood disorders may be driven by a breakdown in gut paracellular, transcellular, and/or vascular pathways. If replicated, drugs that protect the integrity of the gut barrier may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for BP1 and MDD.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

The resulting layout of the processor is validated against the design at RTL to prove its correctness. The total area of the layout is about 285 μm by 285 μm, which is equivalent to about 7800 gates. For performance, the proposed processor can operate at a maximum clock frequency of 32 MHz, with an average current consumption of 189 μA in normal mode and 11.1 μA in standby state for a supply of 1.8V, or about 5.68 μW/MHz. In comparison with previous work, our proposed processor consumes much less power significantly.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"
Molecular detection and genetic characterization of Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma platys-like (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) in water buffalo from eight provinces of Thailand,"Nguyen A.H.L., Tiawsirisup S., Kaewthamasorn M.",2020-10-08,"Anaplasma, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasmataceae, Anaplasmosis, Animals, Buffaloes, Female, Male, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Sex Factors, Thailand, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma platys, Detection, Genetic characterization, Thailand, Water buffalo","Background: Anaplasmosis, an animal disease caused by rickettsial bacteria in the genus Anaplasma, is of considerable economic importance in livestock animals in many countries worldwide. The objectives of this study were to determine the identity, prevalence, and geographic distribution of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma in naturally infected water buffalo in Thailand using PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and heat shock protein groEL genes. A total of 456 buffalo blood samples from Thailand were investigated. Species identification and genetic differentiation of intra-population and inter-population with the global isolates were conducted based on nucleotide sequences. Interplay between the infection and host factors was also assessed. Results: Overall, 41% of water buffalo were found to be infected with rickettsial organisms in the family Anaplasmataceae, but Ehrlichia spp., Neorickettsia spp., and Wolbachia spp. were not found in any of the sequenced samples in this study. Female buffalo were more frequently infected with bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae than males [71 out of 176 females (40.3%) versus 11 out of 47 males (23.4%)]. The Odds Ratio value indicated that the risk of infection for female buffalo was 2.2-fold higher than that for males (p < 0.05). We detected three haplotypes of A. marginale 16S rRNA gene and they were placed in a clade that was closely related to the A. marginale in buffalo in China; and cattle in Thailand, Uganda, and China. Homology searching of groEL sequences against the GenBank™ database using the BLASTn algorithm revealed that the obtained sequences had a high percentage similarity (98.36-99.62%) to A. platys sequences. The groEL sequences of three A. platys-like isolates were clustered in the same clade as the A. platys from the tick Rhipicephalus microplus in China. Conclusions: Our data showed that the apparently healthy buffalo were naturally infected by bacteria in the family Anaplasmataceae at a relatively high prevalence. We also report the finding of A. platys-like infections in water buffalo in Thailand for the first time. Water buffalo serving as the reservoir host of anaplasmosis is of concern for managing the disease control and prevention in ruminants.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Surgical procedures approaching the lateral side of the orbit are at risk of CG injury which results in transient mydriasis and tonic pupil. This study aims to focus on the morphometric study of the CG which is pertinent to intraoperative procedure. Materials and methods: Forty embalmed cadaveric globes were dissected to observe the location, shape and size of CG, characteristics and number of roots reaching CG, number of short ciliary nerve in the orbit. Distances from CG to posterior end of globe, optic nerve, lateral rectus muscle and its scleral insertion were measured. Results: Ciliary ganglion was located between optic nerve and lateral rectus in every case. Its shape could be oval, round and irregular. Mean width of CG was 2.24 mm and mean length was 3.50 mm. Concerning the roots, all 3 roots were present in 29 (72.5%) cases. Absence of motor root was found in 7 (17.5%) cases. Absence of sympathetic root was found in 4 (5%) cases. The number of motor root could be 1, 2 and also 3 roots. Three motor roots were found in 1 case which originated from nerve to inferior oblique muscle. Only one sensory root was found in every specimen. One sympathetic root could be observed in most of the specimens and 6-14 short ciliary nerves were found. Mean distances from CG to posterior end of globe, optic nerve, lateral rectus muscle and its scleral insertion were 16.04 mm, 1.47 mm, 2.88 mm, and 31.53 mm, respectively. Conclusions: This study described the characteristic of CG, number of its nerve root and some measurements relevant to intraorbital procedures in Asian population. Moreover, a new parameter was the distance between CG and scleral insertion of the lateral rectus muscle. This parameter should be considered when performing operation involved the lateral rectus muscle and BTX-A injection to lateral rectus muscle to reduce CG injury.","genergyal, medical","Anatomy, Histology"

This study compared the peroneal nerve motor-sparing effects of iPACK block and tibial nerve block (TNB) when combined with local infiltration analgesia (LIA) and continuous adductor canal block (CACB). Methods In this study, 105 patients scheduled for elective TKA were randomized to receive proximal iPACK block (iPACK1), distal iPACK block (iPACK2), or TNB, along with spinal anesthesia, modified LIA, and CACB. The primary outcome was the incidence of common peroneal nerve (CPN) motor blockade. Secondary outcomes included CPN sensory function, tibial sensorimotor function, posterior knee pain, pain score, intravenous morphine requirement, timed up-and-go test, quadriceps muscle strength, range of motion, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. Results The incidence of CPN motor blockade was significantly higher in the TNB group than in the iPACK1 (p=0.001) and iPACK2 (p=0.001) groups, but was not significant between the iPACK1 and iPACK2 groups (p=0.76). Tibial nerve motor function was more preserved in the iPACK1 and iPACK2 groups than in the TNB group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Complete CPN and tibial sensorimotor blockade were not observed in the iPACK2 group. Posterior knee pain score was significantly higher in the iPACK1 group than in other groups during the 24-hour postoperative period (p=0.001). Conclusions Compared with TNB, iPACK1 and iPACK2 preserved CPN and tibial nerve motor function to a greater extent. However, iPACK2 did not demonstrate complete CPN and tibial nerve motor blockade while maintaining effective posterior knee pain relief.

Inactivation of PTEN has been reported in various types of cancers. PTEN promoter methylation possibly underlies PTEN inactivation, which results in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PTEN promoter methylation contributes to PTEN inactivation in ameloblastoma and its associated protein expression. Material and Methods: In total, 20 fresh-frozen ameloblastoma samples were evaluated for PTEN promoter meth-ylation using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR). A subset of 10 paraffin-embedded am-eloblastoma samples was examined for PTEN expression through immunohistochemistry. Four primary cultured ameloblastoma cells were investigated for PTEN promoter methylation and PTEN transcriptional expression via reverse transcription PCR. Results: PTEN promoter methylation was detected in 65% (13/20) of the ameloblastoma samples. Of 10 amelo-blastoma samples, 4 exhibited reduced PTEN expression. Of 5 samples with methylated PTEN, 3 (60%) were associated with loss of PTEN expression. However, PTEN expression was detected in 4 (80%) of 5 samples with unmethylated PTEN. In addition, 3 (75%) of 4 primary ameloblastoma cell cultures exhibited an inverse correlation between PTEN promoter methylation and PTEN transcription level. Conclusions: PTEN promoter methylation is found in a number of ameloblastomas but not significantly correlated with loss of PTEN expression. Genetic or epigenetic mechanisms other than PTEN promoter methylation may contribute to PTEN inactivation in ameloblastoma tumor cells.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

Since AF is associated with an increased risk for stroke, regular AF monitoring is recommended for the elderly as well as the patients to reduce the incidence of stroke. In this study, the subsequent two methods of AF detection have been. The first one is a low complexity algorithm with rhythm-based for embedding into portable ECG devices. The second one is morphology-based method using a transferred deep learning with fine-tuning. The performances of the low complexity algorithm are 100% of sensitivity and 86.67% of specificity, respectively while the performances of the deep learning algorithm are 96.97% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity, respectively. From these results, the combination between rhythm-based and morphology-based algorithm can offer the highest sensitivity for screening of AF and highest specificity for separating Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) from AF. These developed methods will be useful for improving the performance of AF detection utilized in healthcare system.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"

Trust and PV were broken down into various dimensions. This study investigated the two-component base trusts, namely, economic and service, and also PV as an antecedent. Design/methodology/approach: This study involved 402 respondents selected through the interception and online survey approach and had five hypotheses. The structural equation model was used to test the hypothesis of this study. Findings: The findings showed that the PV was related to the customer’s intention to use MMA services and economy-based trust. Trust in service providers and economic-based trust were positively related to customer intentions to use MMA services. Research limitations/implications: Although the concept of MMA has been explored in several literatures, the role of trust and PV in the use of MMA has not been of much concern among researchers. In addition, this study described PV as a construction with five supporting dimensions. The current literature showed that the integration of PV with construct trust was still lacking in attention from researchers especially the study of MMA. Practical implications: For practitioners, these findings confirmed that MMA service providers need to convince customers of protection to money and personal information. Also, providers need to ensure that the use of MMA provides cost and time effectiveness. Besides, it is important to ensure the services provided to customers are the fastest way to carry out financial transactions, in this case, including payment and retail purchases. This finding also showed that PV related to MMA services needs to be studied from a customer perspective, focusing on four aspects of ethics, playfulness, customer return of investment and excellent service. Therefore, handling PV in these services requires specific strategies to deal with these various aspects. Originality/value: This study integrated two dimensions of trust, thus economic trust and service trust, the authors also integrated dimension of PV as the antecedent of two dimensions of trust, to understand the dimension of intention use MMA.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Information Systems, Computer Networks and Communications"

They can cause adverse health impacts. This study aimed to obtain efficient 2-MBT-degrading bacteria for wastewater application. The bacterial consortia were enriched by incubating rubber wastewater sludge in a medium containing 2-MBT for 28 days. Stepwise acclimatization was conducted with increasing 2-MBT concentrations from 50 to 200 mg L−1 in nitrogen-containing medium for 76 days. The process significantly increased the bacterial number and changed the dominant populations. Among these consortia, the EN consortium from benzothiazole-containing sludge had the highest specific 2-MBT biodegradation rate of 5.2 ± 0.5 mg L−1 day−1 mg protein-1 and could degrade up to 300 mg L−1 2-MBT. From 16S rRNA gene analysis, Pseudomonas was the dominant genus at approximately 70 % of the total population. Stenotrophomonas was the second most abundant populations and have never been reported for 2-MBT biodegradation. The EN consortium removed 65–79 % and 90–93 % of 112 mg L−1 2-MBT and ∼4000 mg L−1 COD in rubber wastewater, respectively, which were significantly higher than the values of natural attenuation. Therefore, the EN consortium could be an ideal inoculum for the post-treatment of benzothiazoles in rubber industrial wastewater.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

A laboratory-scale hollow fiber aMBR was operated for 150 days, at inlet methanol concentrations varying between 2 and 30 g m−3 and at empty bed residence times (EBRT) of 30, 10 and 5 s. Under steady-state conditions, a maximum methanol removal efficiency (RE) of 98% was obtained at an EBRT of 30 s and a decrease in RE of methanol was observed at lower EBRTs. On increasing the inlet loading rate, some portion of gas-phase MeOH was stripped into the liquid phase due to its solubility in water. Under transient conditions, the MeOH removal efficiency dropped from an average value of 95%–90% after 5 h of 10-fold shock load and dropped from an average value of 95%–88% under 5-fold increase in shock load. During transient-state tests, the aMBR performed well under different upset loading conditions and a drop in RE of ∼ 5–10% was observed. However, the aMBR performance was restored within 1–2 days when pre-shock conditions were restored.

Therefore, this study interested in the adsorption of potassium carbonate solid sorbents on gamma-alumina to adsorb carbon dioxide. The added basic solution was used instead of the de-ionized water by assuming that it would give higher support surface area. The various preparation parameters were explored by impregnation method as follows: the different base types (NaOH, Ca(OH)2, and Na2CO3), the basicity of the solution (8, 10 and 12) and the duration of shaking (12, 18 and 24 h). From the results, all parameters affected on the carbon dioxide capture capacity. The sodium hydroxide gave the highest carbon dioxide capture capacity. An increasing in basicity of the solution resulted in higher carbon dioxide capture capacities, since the reactant was acidic. For the effect of the time spent on shaking the adsorbent, the ability to capture carbon dioxide increased with preparation time. The highest adsorption capacity of 4.34 mmol CO2 / g sorbent was obtained from potassium carbonate adsorbent, prepared by using sodium hydroxide with a pH value of 12 and a duration of 24 h while, in normal preparation condition, potassium carbonate adsorbent had a capacity of 2.27 mmol CO2 / g sorbent.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Collectively known as the satellitome, this genomic component offers exciting evolutionary insights into aspects of primate genome biology that raise new questions and challenge existing paradigms. A complete human reference genome was recently reported with telomere-to-telomere human X chromosome assembly that resolved hundreds of dark regions, encompassing a 3.1 Mb centromeric satellite array that had not been identified previously. With the recent exponential increase in the availability of primate genomes, and the development of modern genomic and bioinformatics tools, extensive growth in our knowledge concerning the structure, function, and evolution of satellite elements is expected. The current state of knowledge on this topic is summarized, highlighting various types of primate-specific satellite repeats to compare their proportions across diverse lineages. Inter- and intraspecific variation of satellite repeats in the primate genome are reviewed. The functional significance of these sequences is discussed by describing how the transcriptional activity of satellite repeats can affect gene expression during different cellular processes. Sex-linked satellites are outlined, together with their respective genomic organization. Mechanisms are proposed whereby satellite repeats might have emerged as novel sequences during different evolutionary phases. Finally, the main challenges that hinder the detection of satellite DNA are outlined and an overview of the latest methodologies to address technological limitations is presented.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

The AISD task is concerned with identifying the original author of an anonymous document from a group of candidate authors. However, AISD techniques are not applicable to the authorship identification of multi-author documents (AIMD). Unlike AISD, where each document is written by one single author, AIMD focuses on handling multi-author documents. Due to the combinatoric nature of documents, AIMD lacks the ground truth information - that is, information on writing and non-writing authors in a multi-author document - which makes this problem more challenging to solve. Previous AIMD solutions have a number of limitations: (i) the best stylometry-based AIMD solution has a low accuracy, less than 30%; (ii) increasing the number of co-authors of papers adversely affects the performance of AIMD solutions; and (iii) AIMD solutions were not designed to handle the non-writing authors (NWAs). However, NWAs exist in real-world cases - that is, there are papers for which not every co-author listed has contributed as a writer. This paper proposes an AIMD framework called the Co-Authorship Graph that can be used to (i) capture the stylistic information of each author in a corpus of multi-author documents and (ii) make a multi-label prediction for a multi-author query document. We conducted extensive experimental studies on one synthetic and three real-world corpora. Experimental results show that our proposed framework (i) significantly outperformed competitive techniques; (ii) can effectively handle a larger number of co-authors in comparison with competitive techniques; and (iii) can effectively handle NWAs in multi-author documents.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The effect of modifier type on the CO2 adsorption capacity of the NR/silica foam composites was investigated under ambient temperature and pressure. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the NR/silica foam composite material increased from 1.81 to 6.71 mg/g after filling with silica particles modified by 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. The NR/silica foam composite material filled with silica particles modified with a short chain structure (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane) showed a higher CO2 adsorption capacity than those with a longer modifying chain structure (N-[(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine or N-[(3-trimethoxysilyl)propyl]diethylenetriamine). The increasing of adsorption temperature caused the chains of the long-chain modifier on the silica particle surface to become more flexible, resulting in a high selectivity for capturing CO2. The NR/silica foam composite filled with unmodified or modified silica particles showed a high reusability compared to NR foam.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Various analytical conditions were investigated to enhance the best performance of the proposed method. Under optimal conditions, a good linear relationship was obtained between the anodic current and the concentration of vitamins within the range from 0.02 μg mL−1 to 1 μg mL−1. The limits of detection were found to be 0.0086, 0.0063, 0.0075 and 0.0071 μg mL−1 for vitamin A, D, E and K, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed sensor has been validated with the standard AOAC guideline. The reproducibility has also been demonstrated by repeating the experiments between sensor-to-sensor.

The experimental design methodology was employed to study the influence of PLA, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), DDA, and LTB on the physical properties of the PLA-based NPs. The size of selected cationic PLA NPs comprising 5% PLA, 5% PVA, and 0.6% DDA with or without LTB absorption was range from 367 to 390 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.26, a zeta potential of + 26.00 to + 30.55 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 41.43%. Electron micrographs revealed NPs with spherical shape. The release kinetic of BSA from the NPs followed the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics. The cationic PLA NPs with LTB surface absorption showed 3-fold increase in BSA-FITC transported across M cells compared with the NPs without LTB absorption. The uptake studies demonstrated 2-fold increase in BSA-FITC intensity in 3D4/2 cells with cationic NPs as compared with anionic NPs. Overall, the results suggested that LTB decreased the retention time of BSA-FITC loaded in the cationic PLA NPs within the M cells, thus promoting the transport of BSA-FITC across the M cells, and cationic NPs composed of DDA help facilitate the uptake of BSA-FITC in the 3D4/2 cells.

The application requires users to perform two arm movements to evaluate arm weakness and pronation: Curl-up and Raise-up. For the purpose of the study, 68 subjects, consisting of 36 stroke patients with symptoms of arm weakness and 32 healthy subjects, consented to participate. A total of 78 handcrafted features were proposed, 26 of which were extracted from Curl-up and Raise-up for each arm. Then, the differences between corresponding features for each arm were calculated. These features were then tested on 63 combinations of three classical feature selection methods, three feature sets (i.e., Curl-up-only features, Raise-up-only features, and both-exercises combined features) and seven well-known classification methods. The results from ten runs of 10-fold cross-validation showed that Curl-up-only features achieved an average sensitivity of 83.3%, significantly higher than those of the Raise-up-only features or both-exercises features. From all possible combinations, the random forest classification based on information gain feature selection from Curl-up-only features achieved the most efficient results for arm-weakness-stroke screening. It achieved an average sensitivity of 94.8%, an average specificity of 75.2%, an average accuracy of 84.1%, and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 85.0%. Our work proposes a novel accessible method to screen symptoms of arm weakness that may indicate the onset of a stroke using a single mobile device.

We present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) study for investigating an effect of temperature on the structural organization of DPPC-nanodisc and POPC-nanodisc. A non-monotonic response of physical quantities (i.e. the lipid order parameter, nanodisc flatness, structural change, solvation property, radius of gyration) with increase in temperature (T = 200–350 K) is found to be associated with the gel-ripple-liquid crystalline phase change within nanodiscs. The reorganization of lipids upon temperature variation induced conformational changes of MSP to minimize hydrophobic exposure of the lipid membrane to an aqueous environment. Structural response to temperature is different to a certain extent between the saturated DPPC and unsaturated POPC.","genergyal, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Methods: Five simulated nodules with a CT number of approximately 100 HU with size diameter of 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 mm were inserted into an anthropomorphic chest phantom (N1 Lungman model), and then scanned by DTS system (Definium 8000) with varying tube voltage, copper filter thickness, and dose ratio. Three radiophotoluminescent (RPL) glass dosimeters, type GD-352 M with a dimension of 1.5 × 12 mm, were used to measure the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) in each protocol. The effective dose (ED) was calculated using the recorded total dose-area-product (DAP). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was determined for qualitative image quality evaluation. The image criteria and nodule detection capability were scored by two experienced radiologists. The selected low-dose protocol was further applied in a clinical study with 30 pulmonary nodule follow-up patients. Results: The average ESAK obtained from the standard default protocol was 1.68 ± 0.15 mGy, while an ESAK of 0.47 ± 0.02 mGy was found for a low-dose protocol. The EDs for the default and low-dose protocols were 313.98 ± 0.72 µSv and 100.55 ± 0.28 µSv, respectively. There were small non-significant differences in the image criteria and nodule detection scoring between the low-dose and default protocols interpreted by two radiologists. The effective dose of 98.87 ± 0.08 µSv was obtained in clinical study after applying the low-dose protocol. Conclusions: The low-dose protocol obtained in this study can substantially reduce radiation dose while preserving an acceptable image quality compared to the standard protocol.","biochemistryistry, medical, physics","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Physics and Astronomy (all)"

In this study, the effect of Notch signaling on PPARγ in IL-4-stimulated human macrophages (M(IL-4)) was investigated using THP-1-derived macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages as models. Human M(IL-4) increased the expression of JAGGED1 and activated Notch signaling. Overexpression of Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC1) increased PPARγ expression, while inhibiting Notch signaling decreased PPARγ levels in M(IL-4). NIC1 overexpression in THP-1-derived macrophages increased PPARγ protein stability by delaying its proteasome-mediated degradation, but did not affect its mRNA. Phosphorylation of AKT was enhanced in NIC1-overexpressing cells, and a specific AKT inhibitor reduced the level of PPARγ. NIC1-overexpressing THP-1 cells exhibited increased CD36 levels via activation of PPARγ, resulting in enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation.

In this process, the biomass feedstock was wood residue, and steam, calcium oxide (CaO), and nickel oxide (NiO) were used as a gasifying agent, CO2 sorbent, and oxygen carrier, respectively. First, the influences of key operational parameters (i.e., steam to carbon (S/C) molar ratio, gasifying temperature, and NiO to carbon (NiO/C) molar ratio) on product gas yields and net energy consumption of the process were studied. According to the first and second laws of thermodynamics, performance indicators of the SECLG process demonstrated that increases in energy and exergy efficiencies occurred with increases in S/C molar ratio and/or gasifying temperature. Then, mathematical models indicative of correlations between energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and major operating parameters (e.g., S/C molar ratio and gasifying temperature) were developed through the design of experiment (DOE) method and used for process optimization. The optimal conditions offering maximum energy (70%) and exergy (56%) efficiencies were a S/C molar ratio of 4.5 and gasifying temperature of 700 °C, under which all reactors operated at thermal self-sufficient conditions.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The degree of membrane wetting was estimated as a function of wastewater velocity and included in the determination of the overall mass transfer coefficient based on the resistance-in-series model. A modified Henry's law constant was employed to take into account the effect of pH on the mass transfer. The calculated overall mass transfer coefficients based on the proposed model fitted well with experimental results in various ranges of wastewater inlet pH and velocities. The contribution analysis of resistance in each phase to the overall mass transfer resistances showed that the wastewater phase was still the dominant phase, although the partial wetting was included in the consideration. Comparing with the carbon dioxide and methane desorption, the membrane phase resistance of the ammonia desorption was much more significant to the mass transfer. The determination of the membrane area required to remove the dissolved ammonia revealed that the area was greatly influenced by the wastewater inlet pH. The KOV along the length of membrane module was gradually decreased due to the NH3 desorption. Thus, the membrane area could be significantly much lower when the wastewater pH was adjusted to the initial value in between the membrane modules connected in the series.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

While none of them are listed in the deepest H-band based CANDELS catalog in the GOODS-South field down to H = 28.16 AB, we were able to de-blend two of them from their bright neighbor and measure an H-band flux for them. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of five of the six sources with ALMA band 4. All are detected in the 2 mm continuum with signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in AGS4 (νobs = 151.44 GHz with an S/N = 8.58) and AGS17 (νobs = 154.78 GHz with an S/N = 10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the CO(6-5) line at zspecAGS4 = 3.556 and zspecAGS17 = 3.467, respectively. These redshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts derived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these redshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70% (4/6 of galaxies) of the optically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at z ∼3.5. overdensity The most massive one, AGS24 (Mâ † = 1011.32-0.19+0.02 MâŠ™ ), is the most massive galaxy without an active galactic nucleus at z > 3 in the GOODS-ALMA field.

It tends to be more economical than secondary tar reduction in post-gas-cleaning processes. This study used a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to analyze the performance of an Imbert downdraft biomass gasifier. The spatial distribution of producer gas compositions in the gasifier was explored. The CFD model was validated, using the same conditions and design, by published experimental data. The effects of the key design parameter, i.e., throat diameter, represented by the ratio of throat to gasifier diameters and the height of air nozzle from the throat, on the gasifier performance were predicted. The tar concentration and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were computed. Although the modeling results indicated that decreasing the throat diameter can decrease the tar content up to 0.005 g Nm−3, the CGE decreased by approximately 7% compared with the scenario with no throat. Decreasing the nozzle-to-throat lengths abated tar and hydrogen composition, but the CGE exhibited fluctuation. Therefore, a compromise between tar reduction and the CGE is required to improve the design of the Imbert downdraft gasifier.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer non-ionic drug, was released from the CMC hydrogels under applied electrical field. The diffusion coefficient and the release mechanism of the drug of the CMC hydrogels were investigated by the modified Franz-diffusion cell with the PBS buffer solution at the pH value of 7.4 and at 37 °C for the duration of 24 h. The effects of mesh size, electric potential, and electrode polarity were systematically investigated. The swelling test illustrated an increase in the mesh size with decreasing crosslinking agent. In addition, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing crosslinker: repeated group mole ratio. The diffusion coefficient depended critically on the applied electric potential and the electrode polarity. The non-ionic drug release mechanisms were identified as the matrix deswelling and electroosmosis, in addition to the pure diffusion without electric field. Thus, CMC has been shown a potential bio-based matrix for electrically controlled non-ionic drug delivery.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"
Microwave-assisted chemical recycling of polylactide (PLA) by alcoholysis with various diols,"Nim B., Opaprakasit M., Petchsuk A., Opaprakasit P.",2020-11-01,"Alcoholysis reactions, Brittle polymers, Chemical recycling, Mechanical and thermal properties, Microwave assisted, Single components, Specialty products, Structures and properties, Alcoholysis, Chemical recycling, Microwave, Polylactide, Polyurethane","A process for the chemical recycling of degradable polylactide (PLA) has been developed, to convert its disposable wastes into small-sized products for further use as value-added starting materials for specialty products. A microwave-assisted alcoholysis reaction, using diols and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBT) catalyst, was employed. The effects of the types of diols and PLA/diol feeding ratios on the structures and properties of the resulting alcoholized products were examined by using ethylene glycol (EG), propane-1,3-diol (PDO), and butane-1,4-diol (BDO). The PLA/diol ratios were varied from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt. The products were characterized by ATR-FTIR, 1H NMR, and 2D-NMR HMQC and HMBC spectroscopy. The products compost to diol-capped lactate sequences with different lengths, i.e., lactate, lactyllactate, and poly-lactate. The yield of the shortest lactate was about 65% for the LBDOT11 system, and 90% for the LEGT11 and LPDOT11 systems, when a feeding ratio of 1:1 wt/wt was employed. The yield decreased with an increase in the ratios, from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt. In contrast, the yields of longer lactyllactate and poly-lactate increased with an increase in the ratios. In terms of OH-endcapping efficiency, the products have two structures: (A) LA-O-(CH2)x-OH and (B) LA-O-(CH2)x-O-LA. The contents depend on diol types and the PLA/diol feeding ratio. The alcoholized products were then used as starting polyols in the preparation of lactide-based polyurethanes (PUs) by reacting with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI) and BDO chain extender. The resulting PUs exhibit promising mechanical and thermal properties. These PUs are suitable for use as either single-component materials, e.g., 3D-printing filaments and degradable adhesives, or as toughness-enhancing agents for brittle polymers, especially PLA.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

We aimed to 1) compare the characteristics of elderly (i.e. age ≥ 60) vs. non-elderly patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); 2) identify predictors of advanced fibrosis in elderly patients with NAFLD; and 3) assess the performance of non-invasive fibrosis scores in the prediction of advance fibrosis in the elderly population. Methods: We abstracted the data of 1008 patients with NAFLD from nine centers across eight countries. Characteristics of elderly and non-elderly patients with NAFLD were compared using 1:3 sex-matched analysis. Results: Of the 1008 patients, 175 were elderly [age 64 (62-67) years], who were matched with 525 non-elderly patients [46 (36-54) years]. Elderly patients were more likely to have advanced fibrosis (35.4% vs. 13.3%; p < 0.001). By multivariable analysis, factors associated with advanced fibrosis in elderly patients included female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-7.54] and hypertension (OR 3.68; 95%CI 1.11-12.23). The area under receiver-operating characteristics curve (95% CI) of aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 index for predicting advanced fibrosis in elderly patients were 0.62 (0.52-0.72), 0.65 (0.55-0.75) and 0.64 (0.54-0.74) respectively. Conclusions: Elderly patients with NAFLD had a higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis than non-elderly patients. Female and hypertension were predicting factors for advanced fibrosis in the elderly. Non-invasive fibrosis scores had a lower specificity in elderly.",medical,Gastroenterology

The 5D World Map (5DWM) System [4,6,8] has introduced the concept of “SPA (Sensing, Processing and Analytical Actuation Functions)” for global environmental system integrations [1-4], as a global environmental knowledge sharing, analysis and integration system. Environmental knowledge base creation with 5D World Map is realized for sharing, analyzing and visualizing various information resources to the map which can facilitate global phenomena-observations and knowledge discoveries with multi-dimensional axis control mechanisms.

DsRNA-mediated RNAi has been used to control these viruses, and the best target genes for efficient inhibition of YHV and WSSV are the protease and ribonuleotide reductase small subunit (rr2), respectively. However, one dsRNA can suppress only one virus, and therefore the production of multi-target dsRNA to effectively inhibit both YHV and WSSV is needed. In this study, plasmids pETpro-rr2_one stem and pETpro-rr2_two stems were constructed to produce two different forms of multi-target dsRNA in E. coli, which were designed specifically to both YHV protease and WSSV rr2 genes. The potency of each dsRNA in inhibiting YHV and WSSV and reducing shrimp death were investigated in L. vannamei. Shrimp were injected with the dsRNAs into the hemolymph before challenge with YHV or WSSV. The results showed that both dsRNAs could inhibit the viruses, however the one stem construct was more effective than the two stems construct when shrimp were infected with WSSV. This study establishes a potential strategy for dual inhibition of YHV and WSSV for further application in shrimp aquaculture.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Methodology: The percentage of apoptotic cells and lymphocyte counts were measured in the first cohort using PBMCs obtained from 23 OC patients and 6 HC. In the second cohort, (OC, 33; HC, 13), the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Bax and Bcl-2 in CD19+ B, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and CD16+56+ natural killer (NK) cells was determined via flow cytometry. Results: The percentage of apoptotic cells was higher in the PBMCs of OC patients than in HC patients, particularly in patients with stage IV cancer (p<0.05). However, lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in stage IV patients (p<0.05). NK CD19+ B and CD16+56+ cell counts were significantly lower in OC patients compared with HC patients (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively), but CD4+ T cells were interestingly significantly higher in OC patients (p<0.001). While Bax MFI was slightly higher, Bcl-2 MFI was significantly lower for all four lymphocyte subsets in OC samples, particularly in stage IV patients, when compared with HC. Consequently, Bax/Bcl-2 ratios showed an upward trend from HC to OC patients, particularly those in stage IV. We found similar trends in Bax and Bcl-2 MFI for tumor stage, tumor size, and lymph node involvement. Conclusions: The increased lymphocyte apoptosis in stage IV OC patients may be related to higher Bax levels and lower Bcl-2 levels. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in lymphocytes may be useful to determine the prognosis of OC patients, and could be considered a mean for supportive treatment in the future.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
"Major Depression in Children with Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Is Strongly Associated with the Combined Effects of Blood Transfusion Rate, Iron Overload, and Increased Pro-inflammatory Cytokines","Al-Hakeim H.K., Najm A.H., Al-Dujaili A.H., Maes M.",2020-06-01,"beta-Thalassemia, Biomarkers, Child, Cytokines, Depressive Disorder, Major, Female, Humans, Inflammation Mediators, Iron, Iron Overload, Male, Transfusion Reaction, Biomarkers, Inflammation, Major depression, Neuroimmunomodulation, Oxidative stress, Psychoneuroimmunology","Beta-thalassemia major patients are treated with repeated blood transfusions, which may cause iron overload, which in turn may induce immune aberrations, and show an increased risk of depression. The aim of the present study is to examine whether repeated blood transfusions, iron overload, and immune-inflammatory responses are associated with depression in children (6–12 years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI), iron status (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, TS%), and serum levels of CCL11, IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α were measured in TDT with (n = 54) and without (n = 57) a major depression-like episode (MDLE) and in healthy children (n = 55). The results show that MDLE due to TDT is associated with a greater number of blood transfusions and increased iron overload and IL-1β levels. Partial least squares path analysis shows that 68.8% of the variance in the CDI score is explained by the number of blood transfusions, iron overload, and increased levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. The latter two cytokines partly mediate the effects of iron overload on the CDI score, while the effects of blood transfusions on the CDI score are partly mediated by iron overload and the path from iron overload to immune activation. Iron overload is also associated with increased IL-10 and lower CCL11 levels, but these alterations are not significantly associated with depression. In conclusion, blood transfusions may be causally related to MDLE in TDT children and their effects are in part mediated by increased iron overload and the consequent immune-inflammatory response. The results suggest that effects of iron overload and its consequences including inflammation and oxidative stress toxicity may cause MDLE. Current treatment modalities with folic acid and vitamin C are insufficient to attenuate iron overload and immune-inflammatory responses and to prevent MDLE in children with TDT.","neuroscienceoscience; neuroscienceopathology; depression, neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Toxicology"

In this study, a meta-analysis framework was developed based on a heterogeneous network model for integrating human-malaria protein similarities, a human protein interaction network, and a Plasmodium vivax protein interaction network. An iterative network propagation was performed on the heterogeneous network until we obtained stabilized weights. The association scores were calculated for qualifying a novel potential human-malaria protein association. This method provided a better performance compared to random experiments. After that, the stabilized network was clustered into association modules. The potential association candidates were then thoroughly analyzed by statistical enrichment analysis with protein complexes and known drug targets. The most promising target proteins were the succinate dehydrogenase protein complex in the human citrate (TCA) cycle pathway and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the human central nervous system. Promising associations and potential drug targets were also provided for further studies and designs in therapeutic approaches for malaria at a systematic level. In conclusion, this method is efficient to identify new human-malaria protein associations and can be generalized to infer other types of association studies to further advance biomedical science.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Moreover; the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma has also been increasing in the endemic area of liver fluke infections. Only a few reports have been published concerning the fish-borne trematodes infections in the central region of Myanmar. However; there is still a lack of information regarding the status of trematodes infections in second intermediate hosts in the Mekong region of Myanmar. Therefore, we conducted surveillance on the distribution of trematode metacercariae in small cyprinoid fishes collected from the Mekong region of Myanmar. A total of 689 fishes (12 different species of cyprinoid fishes) have been collected and examined by pepsin digestion methods. We discovered four species of fish-borne trematode metacercariae infections, i.e., carcinogenic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini; minute intestinal flukes, Haplorchis taichui; Haplorchis pumilio and Haplorchoides sp. in Tachileik, the Mekong Region of Myanmar. The outcome of this study could be a useful index for the fish-borne zoonotic trematode epidemiology in the Mekong area. Besides, the results of our study contribute to filling the gap of information necessary for the control and prevention of fish-borne trematode zoonotic infections in the Mekong region.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologynity to infection; medicalcal and Veterinary Sciencerinary parasitology; diagnosis, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Many companies and factories have started implementing online training platforms under the concept of ""Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)"" in their workplace to foster employee performance. Previously, the mobile application called ""HSC MOOC"" which is provided by the Halal Science Center, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand functioned as a solution that encourages self-learning on online platforms at companies in Thailand. However, the main barrier or risk that occurs when implementing an online platform is the user's motivation, since the dropout rate is considered as a serious issue regarding MOOCs. Thus, incentive and reward were added to online training programs which aimed to motivate employees. Many types of rewards were provided for employees who had met their own company's expectations. Recently, psychology research papers have illustrated that non-monetary rewards seem to provide greater results on the side of employee's motivation. However, not all types of non-monetary rewards provide positive impact on employee's motivation. Therefore, the aim of this research is to present the effect of different nonmonetary rewards on employee performance. Ninety volunteer employees from a food manufacturing company in Chiang Mai, Thailand participated in this research. The experiment was divided into two sections. The first section aimed to measure the motivation of employees which based on different non-monetary rewards. The questionnaire for measuring Valence, Instrumentality, and Expectancy variables (VIE theory) was deployed to test employee motivation in 3 different groups; ""Tangible Non-Monetary Rewards"", ""Social Non-Monetary Rewards"" and ""Job Related Non-Monetary Rewards"". The test consisted of 10 items using a 5-point Likert scale. The second experiment aimed to reveal which type of non-monetary reward is the most suitable for motivating employees in participating and completing the course in MOOCs. Participants in different groups were assigned to learn via MOOCs on their mobile device within a period of 30 days. Different types of non-monetary rewards were provided only for participants who had completed certain conditions in MOOCs. The overall results showed that the group of tangible non-monetary rewards reached the significant highest score on the VIE questionnaire and over 60% of participants exposed to tangible non-monetary rewards completed the course's conditions in MOOCs.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering","Education, Engineering (all)"

PVDF membranes were coated with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2-NP) and silver (AgNP) at different concentrations and coating times and characterized for their porosity, morphology, chemical functional groups and composition changes. The results showed the successfully modified PVDF membranes containing TiO2-NP and AgNP on their surfaces. When the coating time was increased from 8 to 24 h, the compositions of Ti and Ag of the modified membranes were increased from 1.39 ± 0.13 to 4.29 ± 0.16 and from 1.03 ± 0.07 to 3.62 ± 0.08, respectively. The water contact angle of the membranes was decreased with increasing the coating time and TiO2-NP/AgNP ratio. The surface roughness and permeate fluxes of coated membranes were increased due to increased hydrophilicity. Antimicrobial and antifouling properties were investigated by the reduction of Escherichia coli cells and the inhibition of biofilm formation on the membrane surface, respectively. Compared with that of the original PVDF membrane, the modified membranes exhibited antibacterial efficiency up to 94% against E. coli cells and inhibition up to 65% of the biofilm mass reduction. The findings showed hydrophilic improvement and an antimicrobial property for possible wastewater treatment without facing the eminent problem of biofouling.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

Here, we established the integrative induction protocol by merging genetic manipulation technique with our previous published 3-step induction protocol aiming to enhance the pancreatic progenitor commitment and production yield. We found that the overexpression of PDX1 following with 3-step induction protocol were able to generate the 3-dimensional (3D) colony structure of pancreatic progenitors (PPs) with the beneficial trends of pancreatic endoderm commitment and production yield, while other protocols using the prolong maintenance of PDX1-overexpressed hDPSCs and the PDX1 overexpression after definitive endoderm induction were unable to generate and sustain the 3D structure of the colonies. Further Notch signaling manipulation by DAPT treatment showed lesser degree of positive effects on progenitor commitment and production yield. Although the generated PPs from the integrative protocol expressed pancreatic mRNA markers along with pro-insulin and insulin proteins, they still contained the defective glucose-responsive C-peptide secretion. Only basal secreted C-peptide level was observed. In summary, the integrative induction protocol potentially enhanced the PP generation with high colony production yield and could serve as an efficient platform for further hDPSC-derived IPC production and maturation.","cell and developmental biology; cell growth and division; cell growth; stem cells, clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

This increase in the internal temperature can cause unusual disturbances and damage to high voltage electrical equipment. Therefore, early prevention measures of thermal anomalies in equipment are necessary to prevent high voltage equipment failure that might shut down the whole grid system. In this article, we propose a novel non-destructive approach to defect analysis in high voltage equipment by taking advantage of the infrared thermography and the deep learning (DL) approach from the machine learning paradigm. The infrared images of the components were captured using the FLIR T630 without disturbing the operations of the power grid. In the first stage, rich features maps from the convolutional layers of the AlexNet pretrained model were extracted. After feature extraction, the random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) were trained for learning of the defective and non-defective high voltage electrical equipment. In an experimental analysis, the RF optimally learned the separation between defective and non-defective equipment with greater than 96% accuracy, outperforming all the other comparative approaches for deep and nondeep features. The proposed approach based on the RF is reliable and shows its efficacy for fault detection in high voltage electrical equipment.","fluidex; related topics, energy, Mathematics, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

These results were confirmed by bioaccumulation factors, which indicated that RL enhanced soil Cd uptake by corn plants to the highest extent. However, Cd concentration in corn kernels from RL-assisted phytoextraction exceeded the standards for animal feed. On the other hand, although Cd uptake by corn plants in the presence of SP was lower, Cd content in the resulting corn kernels were within the allowable standard limit for animal feedstock. Moreover, compared to RL and control treatments, SP treatment resulted in higher Cd levels in the shoot than in the root, as confirmed by translocation factors. Meanwhile, SP could significantly promote soil Cd removal efficiency; Cd removal efficiencies on day 80 were in the order of SP (18.80%) > RL (11.33%) > control (4.59%). In addition, Cd leaching after addition of RL and SP was investigated. The two surfactants caused much lower Cd leaching from soil than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The results of this study indicate that SP-assisted Cd phytoextraction using corn is applicable for the remediation of Cd-contaminated areas in Mae Sot District.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, contamination and remedicalation, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

High and low volume air samplers were used to collect PM10 and PM2.5 in the ambient air, respectively, at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, open dumpsite, and reference area. The sampling was performed during summer and rainy seasons of 2019 for 24 h and seven consecutive days. The average concentrations of PM10 were 49.64 ± 17.71, 55.36 ± 17.46 and 57.61 ± 17.55 µg/m3 at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, and open dump area, respectively. For PM2.5, the average concentrations at e-waste dismantling, non-e-waste dismantling, and open dump area were 29.71 ± 14.28, 33.81 ± 18.85, 30.68 ± 13.53 µg/m3, respectively. PM10 levels at open dumpsite were 1.2 and 1.1 times higher than those of e-waste dismantling area and non-e-waste dismantling area. Meanwhile, ANOVA analysis showed no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) of PM10 concentration between non- and e-waste dismantling, and open dumpsite. The level of PM2.5 at the e-waste dismantling area was only higher than the reference area but lower than non-e-waste dismantling and open dump area. Besides, there was no statistically significant difference between all sampling sites for PM2.5 concentration. PM10 at non-e-waste dismantling area and open dumpsite were exceeded guidelines of WHO (50 µg/m3), and also PM2.5 (25 µg/m3) of all sampling areas. In this e-waste community, there is no zoning provided for e-waste dismantling activities. Consequently, e-waste dismantling houses were randomly distributed in the community. Consequently, it can be indicated that e-waste dismantling activities led to more PM10 contribution than PM2.5.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, computer science","Environmental Engineering, Information Systems"
Locomotion generation for a mobile manipulator by global minimization of the weighted generalized momentum,Pitakwatchara P.,2020-07-01,"Calculus of variations, Closed loop dynamic, Global minimization, Locomotion generation, Optimal trajectories, System of ordinary differential equations, Tracking controller, Two point boundary value problems, dynamics, Motion planning, optimization, redundant robots","This article presents a method for generating the locomotion of a mobile manipulator that globally minimizes the weighted generalized momentum. The method utilizes the calculus of variation setting to address the problem for which the optimal trajectory may be computed by solving the initial value problem of the system of ordinary differential equations rather than the two-point boundary value problem. Online optimal trajectory may then be input to a suitable tracking controller for controlling the robot in real time. Effectively, the robot closed-loop dynamics is shaped to the optimal system such that the locomotion minimizes the difference of the weighted generalized momentum and the assigned potential energy under the constraints imposed on by the tracking task, joint angle, and actuator torque limits. Desired locomotion behaviors may be achieved by properly adjusting the weighting, spring, and damping matrices. Exploiting the induced dynamical force from the cooperative motion of the constituent linkages through the momentum minimization basis, the robot is able to outperform conventional locomotion pattern actuated by the platform solely.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Computer Science Applications, Artificial Intelligence"

Nevertheless, the associations between OSTOX/ANTIOX and psychiatric comorbidities in TLE are largely unknown. Thus, this study examines plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), and sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in depression due to TLE (n = 25); anxiety disorders due to TLE (n = 27); psychotic disorder due to TLE (n = 25); “pure TLE” (n = 27); and healthy controls (n = 40). TLE and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) were characterized by significant increases in OSTOX (MDA, AOPP, LOOH) and lowered ANTIOX (-SH groups, TRAP). The discrimination of pure TLE from controls yielded a significant area under the ROC curve for MDA (0.999), AOPP (0.851), -SH groups (0.899), and the OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio (0.996). Seizure frequency is significantly associated with increased MDA and lowered LOOH and NOx levels. Increased MDA was associated with the severity of depressive and physiosomatic symptoms, while increased AOPP levels predicted suicidal ideation. Depression and anxiety disorders co-occurring with TLE showed significantly lower MDA levels than TLE without any comorbidities. The psychotic and negative symptoms of TLE are associated with increased MDA levels and excitation with increased LOOH and lowered TRAP levels. These results indicate that oxidative stress toxicity especially protein oxidation and aldehyde formation coupled with lowered -SH groups plays a key role in the pathophysiology of TLE/MTS. Increased aldehyde formation also impacts psychopathology and psychosis, as well as negative and depressive symptoms.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"

The pore formation of biocomposite membranes was prepared by the phase inversion method, and the obtained biocomposite membranes showed a tunable microstructure formed in the membranes that was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscope. Due to the high porosity and hydrophilic properties of MCC, the biocomposite membranes demonstrated excellent electrolyte wettability, large electrolyte uptake (up to 138%), and smaller interfacial resistance leading to enhancement of the ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the effects of MCC on the thermal properties of biocomposite membranes were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and the thermal shrinkage test. The addition of 5 wt% MCC showed the outstanding thermal stability of the biocomposite membranes. After thermal treatment at 135 °C for 1 h, this biocomposite membrane exhibited shrinkage of only 32% from the original shape while the PLA/PBS membrane showed shrinkage of 81%, which verifies that the introduction of MCC improves the thermal stabilities of biocomposite membranes. Promisingly, the biocomposite membranes represent candidate alternatives for future battery applications.

The design of MHS microgrid is motivated by the fact that MHS is a remote area in Thailand where it has been facing with power system's service interruption several times a year, due to natural disasters. Nonetheless, there are renewable energy resources such as mini-hydro and solar power plants inside the area that can sufficiently supply the local electricity demand most of the times throughout a year. Here, Community Energy Management System (CEMS) which minimizes the combined total economic and emission costs during grid-connected mode, while distinctly ensures smooth transition to a reliable microgrid during islanding mode, by properly utilizing battery energy storage system (BESS) and water reserve, has been developed. The proposed formulation of the day-ahead schedulings of mini-hydro generation and BESS is solved using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The simulated test results for one week, both during dry and rainy seasons, confirm that CEMS can significantly improve reliability of MHS microgrid with the designed feature of smooth transition to islanding mode.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"

Threshold agreement was set to ≥80%. Third round was a face-to-face meeting aimed to facilitate the development of approach algorithms for ISE and MSE. Fourth round was a final review asking participants to rate the algorithms post completion. Results: The panel consisted of 8 board-certified epileptologists along with 6 neurologists from main regional hospitals across Thailand. Thirty-seven statements for ISE and 68 statements for MSE were used for the Round I survey, 17/37 (45.9%) and 49/68 (72.1%) reached threshold agreement (≥80%). The average absolute-agreement intraclass correlation coefficients for ISE and MSE were 0.82 (95% CI 0.71, 0.89) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.73, 0.87), respectively; indicating good extent of consensus among participants. Upon Round II, further 10/18 (55.6%) for ISE and 10/19 (52.6%) for MSE reached agreement. In Round III, face-to-face point-by-point discussion was performed to generate approach algorithms.

Design/methodology/approach: The prior maintenance strategy was reviewed, and then the strategy was adjusted to focus on PaM. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was a tool for analyzing the severity and occurrence of the failure modes and effects. Then, the Why‒Why analysis was used for investigating the root causes of failures. The countermeasures were drawn, and the preventive maintenance (PM) plan was revised and carried out. The total maintenance, the PaM and reactive maintenance workload, was obtained, and then the improvements were determined. The values of availability were also obtained. Findings: Previously, the appeared maintenance strategy was not clearly defined. It seemed to have reactive maintenance coupled with PM; it was checked once a year, and corrective actions were made when something wrong was found. Then the management team observed an increase in the reactive maintenance workload, whereas the values of availability were not consistent and tended to drop. After implementing the new maintenance strategy, PaM, the total maintenance workload decreased 14 percent in one year. The average availability of the solar power plant improved from 0.9943 to 0.9969, and the values of availability had better consistency. Practical implications: The PaM can be applied to solar power plant without limiting the prior maintenance strategy and the complexity of production or machinery. The solar power plant is a quite simple production, and most machines consist of electrical equipment and electrical circuits. The PaM supports to analyze the failure modes, the consequence of the failure events and failure effects, and to decide what should be done. Importantly, PaM can reduce total maintenance workload while the value of availability is higher and consistent. Originality/value: This paper states how to successfully implement the PaM for the solar power plant. Previously, the plant did not have a clearly defined maintenance strategy; it was checked once a year, and it was corrected when abnormalities were detected. The PaM strategy provides tools and processes for failures and effects analysis. Although there was a more workload of PM, the total maintenance workload decreased, even in the first year.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Business","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Nevertheless, the preparation of ACP has not been trivial owing to the facile transformation of the meta-stable state of ACP into the crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite (Hap). Herein we report a new preparation, by which ACP can be synthesized at ease through a one-pot synthesis. The utility of citric acid, together with, preformed Fe3O4 renders the formation of ACP/Fe3O4 magnetic composites, hampering the aggregation of calcium phosphates and hence hindering the transformation of ACP into undesired Hap. The well-controlled syntheses are illustrated and proved to be pH-dependent. The cadmium adsorption of the ACP/Fe3O4 composite is well-fitted with Langmuir isotherm giving a maximum capacity of 454.5mg g- 1 and shows a pseudo-second order kinetic behavior. The superior cadmium adsorption capacity of the composite is top ranked among previously reported adsorbents. The thorough investigation underpins the adsorption mechanism, whereby the specific replacement of Ca2+ ions in ACP network by Cd2+ is highly selective over other M(II) ions such as Co2+ and Ni2+. Furthermore, the superparamagnetic nature of the composites allows a convenient separation of the materials after use.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

PP was melt-blended with MWCNTs-Ag, but the ensuing problem was the poor interfacial interaction of fillers with the polymer matrix, especially at high filler content. Nonetheless, a small quantity of fillers resulted in the following improvement in nanocomposite properties, relative to neat PP: better antibacterial ability, lower water vapor permeation flux, lower oxygen barrier performance, higher thermostability, faster crystallization rate and higher tensile strength.

The higher As concentrations were measured in the area close to the mine. However, the Cd distribution in the soil showed a different pattern from As. Enrichment factor and Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo) indicated that As in the soil is derived from the mining activities, while Cd could have other geogenic or anthropogenic sources. The ranges of As and Cd concentration in polished rice grains in the Nui Phao mine area exceeded the CODEX criteria (0.2 mg/kg), which indicated extreme contamination. The arsenic concentration between soil and plant samples was determined to be a positive correlation, while the Cd concentration showed a negative correlation, implying that As and Cd have different geochemical behavior based on their sources.","contamination and remedicalation, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

The purpose of this article is to investigate and compare the difference between the outcome of using the BESS with the virtual droop and the virtual inertia to provide frequency regulation. The results show that the BESS with both control approaches can reduce the frequency deviation in the microgrid. The small virtual droop constant can decrease more frequency deviation. On the other hand, the large virtual inertia constant can decrease more frequency deviation. Furthermore, the characteristics of the power discharged from the BESS with two control methods are different. The BESS controlled by the virtual droop only discharges power, while the BESS controlled by the virtual inertia discharges power first, and then recharges power until the frequency goes back to the nominal value.","electric batteries, fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Materials Science, physics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation"

When vector time series are collected from several subjects belonging to a homogeneous group, a relationship structure of variables can be assumed to share the same topology, while the model parameters of individual subjects could be varied. The formulation is a regularized least-squares estimation of multiple vector autoregressive (VAR) models with a non-convex ℓ2,1/2-norm penalty. The common sparsity pattern of VAR coefficients from all models can reveal a consistent network in a group level. Simulation results show that the proposed formulation achieves better accuracy of learning Granger networks than the convex group lasso formulation. Preliminary results of discovering brain connectivities from ABIDE fMRI data sets showed that sparse common networks among subjects from normal and autism groups are distinctive in some brain regions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Software, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Raltegravir use and outcomes among children and adolescents living with HIV in the IeDEA global consortium,"Patten G., Puthanakit T., McGowan C.C., Wools-Kaloustian K., Hazra R., Pinto J.A., Machado D., Succi R., Sohn A.H., Rabie H., Musick B., Davies M.-A.",2020-07-01,"Adolescent, Africa, Southern, Asia, CD4 Lymphocyte Count, Child, Female, HIV Infections, HIV Integrase Inhibitors, Humans, Male, Poverty, Raltegravir Potassium, South America, Treatment Outcome, Viral Load, adolescents, antiretroviral therapy, children, HIV, integrase inhibitors, raltegravir, third-line","Introduction: As integrase inhibitors become available in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), they offer the potential to expand extremely limited treatment options available to children and adolescents. In LMICs, only small numbers have used raltegravir, primarily as part of third-line regimens. Using data from the IeDEA global consortium, we aimed to describe the characteristics of children on raltegravir-containing regimens and their outcomes. Methods: We included data from 1994 to 2017 from children (age <18 years), from East and Southern Africa, Asia and South America, who received cART regimens containing raltegravir for ≥90 days. We describe their characteristics at raltegravir start, and their immunological and virological outcomes. Results and discussion: In total, 62 children were included, with median age at raltegravir initiation of 14.3 years (IQR 11.2 to 15.8) and median CD4 count of 276 cells/µL (IQR 68 to 494). Among 40 (65%) with drug resistance testing prior to raltegravir, 71% were resistant to at least one protease inhibitor (PI), and 32% had high-level resistance to at least one drug class. Most (n = 50; 81%) received raltegravir as part of third-line cART following PI-based regimens, and were on regimens containing four or more drugs (n = 47, 76%). By database closure, median duration on raltegravir was 2.0 years (IQR 0.8 to 3.0), 1 (1.6%) patient had died, 6 (9.7%) were lost to follow-up and 21 (34%) had discontinued raltegravir. Among 15 patients reporting reasons for stopping raltegravir, six discontinued because it was no longer available. Within one year of starting raltegravir, among 53 patients with VL measures, 40 (75%) had VL < 1000 copies/mL, and among 54 with a reported CD4 count, 45 (83%) and 36 (67%) were ≥350 and ≥500 cells/µL, respectively, with median CD4 count increasing to 517.5 cells/µL (IQR 288 to 810). Conclusions: Among children in LMICs, the initial use of raltegravir has been primarily for post PI-based cART. We found good virological and immunological outcomes despite frequent prior triple-class failure and high levels of drug resistance. Both access to raltegravir and long-term adherence to regimens with large pill-burdens remain challenging. Policies which promote earlier access to new drugs and simplify daily regimens for children and adolescents in LMICs are needed.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"
Cyclic flexural performance of fire-damaged reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer plates,"Lenwari A., Thongchom C., Aboutaha R.S.",2020-11-01,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer, Exposure temperature, Flexural performance, Load-deflection relationships, Reinforced concrete beams, Strength and stiffness, Strength enhancement, Strengthened RC beams, Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers, Cyclic loading test, Fire damage, Flexural strengthening, Nondestructive testing, Reinforced concrete beams, Sustained loading","This paper presents the cyclic flexural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams after being exposed to a fire for 3 hours, air-cooled, and then strengthened with partial-length, adhesive-bonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates. A total of 15 T-beams were tested under static four-point bending with periodic unloading and reloading at regular intervals until failure. Test variables included the level of exposure temperature (700 or 900°C [1292 or 1652°F]), sustained service loading (in addition to the beam self-weight) at the elevated temperature, and the CFRP plate length. The investigated flexural responses included the cyclic load-deflection relationship, CFRP strain-deflection relationship, and failure mode. No repair was conducted on beams exposed to 700°C (1292°F) before installation of the externally bonded CFRP plates. However, repair was necessary for beams exposed to 900°C (1652°F) due to excessive spalling of the concrete. For these beams, the concrete substrate was removed to a depth of 60 mm and replaced with the repair mortar before FRP strengthening. The externally bonded CFRP plates were found to reinstate the fire-damaged beams in terms of their flexural strength and stiffness at load levels beyond the cracking load of an undamaged beam. The level of strength enhancement was higher for the fire-damaged beams subjected to the simulated service loading than the counterpart beams exposed to fire with no load and the undamaged beams. Using mechanical end anchorages, the level of strength enhancement increased when the CFRP plate was extended closer to the supports. However, the addition of CFRP plates decreased the ductility of most strengthened beams. All CFRP-strengthened RC beams exhibited an intermediate crack-induced debonding failure. A comparison between the effective strain limits predicted with the ACI 440.2R-17 equation and the measured tensile strains in CFRP plates showed that the equation could be unconservative for the CFRP-strengthened RC beams under cyclic loading.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction"

The study found that mild glaucoma had greater success rate and lower number of medications compared with moderate and severe glaucoma.Purpose:To evaluate the effectiveness of iStent implantation in combination with cataract surgery in moderate to severe glaucoma compared with mild glaucoma.Methods:Medical charts of primary open-angle glaucoma subjects undergoing 1 iStent implantation were retrospectively reviewed. Glaucoma was classified on the basis of mean deviation (MD) of the preoperative standard automated perimetry into mild (MD>-6 dB), moderate (MD -6 to -12 dB), and severe (MD<-12 dB). Mixed effect regression models were performed to determine the effect of iStent at 1 year. The outcomes included as follows: (1) intraocular pressure (IOP) and the number of medications, (2) eyes with IOP = severity-based target (18 mm Hg for mild, 15 mm Hg for moderate, 12 mm Hg for severe) (2A) without medication, and (2B) with medication reduction.Results:In total, 104 eyes from 89 subjects were analyzed. Cataract combined with iStent surgery significantly lowered the number of medications in all groups and significantly decreased IOP in moderate and severe glaucoma (P<0.05). There was significantly higher number of medications in moderate (ß: 0.58, P=0.002) and severe (ß: 1.20, P<0.001) compared with mild glaucoma. Eyes with moderate glaucoma had significantly lower rate of success (criterion 2A) compared with mild glaucoma [odds ratio (OR): 0.008, P=0.047]. Eyes with moderate and severe glaucoma had significantly lower rates of success (criterion 2B) (moderate vs. mild OR: 0.002, P=0.028; severe vs. mild OR: 0.026, P=0.026).Conclusions:Combined phacoemulsification with iStent seems to have a better IOP-lowering and medication-lowering effect in mild glaucoma cases versus those with moderate and severe glaucoma. This difference was found in real-world data over one-year follow-up period. Long-term studies with defined IOP goals and medication removal protocols are warranted.","ophthalmology, medical",Ophthalmology

Oral spironolactone (SPL), 100–200 mg/day, is currently used off-label to treat AFA. However, high-dose SPL results in clinically significant side-effects which prevent widespread use in clinical practice. The efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in AFA is unknown. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose (25–50 mg/day) oral SPL in Thai women with moderate AFA. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. Moderate AFA patients aged between 25 and 45 years received a combination of daily topical benzoyl peroxide (BP) 2.5% plus either SPL 25 mg (SPL25 group), SPL 50 mg (SPL50 group) or placebo. We performed total acne counts and Adult Female Acne Scoring Tool (AFAST) grading at 4-week intervals. The success rate, defined as the proportion of participants achieving a “clear/almost clear” AFAST grade by the end of week 12, was considered as the main outcome. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were recorded. We enrolled 63 participants in the study. The total acne counts decreased significantly in all three groups (P < 0.05) as compared with baseline. Participants in the SPL50 group had a significantly higher success rate than those in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Serum potassium and creatinine levels showed no significant changes with treatment or between groups. A small number of participants in SPL25 and SPL50 reported mild and temporary TRAE, such as menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness and dizziness. The combination of SPL 50 mg/day and topical BP proved effective in improving moderate AFA in Thai women, with an acceptable side-effect profile. We propose this regimen as an option for treating moderate AFA.",medical,Dermatology

As its nature is an aqueous soluble gas that can diffuse through cells and tissues, NO can affect cell signaling, the phenotype of cancer and modify surrounding cells. The variety of effects of NO on cancer cell biology has convinced researchers to determine the defined mechanisms of these effects and how to control this mediator for a better understanding as well as for therapeutic gain. Materials and Methods: We used bioinformatics and pharmacological experiments to elucidate the potential regulation and underlying mechanisms of NO in non-small a lung cancer cell model. Results: Using microarrays, we identified a total of 151 NO-regulated genes (80 upregulated genes, 71 down-regulated genes) with a strong statistically significant difference compared to untreated controls. Among these, the genes activated by a factor of more than five times were: DCBLD2, MGC24975, RAB40AL, PER3, RCN1, MRPL51, PTTG1, KLF5, NFIX. On the other hand, the expression of RBMS2, PDP2, RBAK, ORMDL2, GRPEL2, ZNF514, MTHFD2, POLR2D, RCBTB1, JOSD1, RPS27, GPR4 genes were significantly decreased by a factor of more than five times. Bioinformatics further revealed that NO exposure of lung cancer cells resulted in a change in transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modifications (histone modification and miRNA). Interestingly, NO treatment was shown to potentiate cancer stem cell-related genes and transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, and Myc. Conclusion: Through this comprehensive approach, the present study illustrated the scheme of how NO affects molecular events in lung cancer cells.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Cancer Research"

It is a tool for displaying, describing, and interpreting 3D anatomy and morphological features of organs, thus providing intuitive, stereoscopic, and accurate methods for clinical decision-making. It has played an increasingly significant role in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases. Over the last decade, it has been proven safe and effective to use 3D simulation software for pre-hepatectomy assessment, virtual hepatectomy, and measurement of liver volumes in blood flow areas of the portal vein; meanwhile, the use of 3D models in combination with hydrodynamic analysis has become a novel non-invasive method for diagnosis and detection of portal hypertension. We herein describe the progress of research on 3D visualization, its workflow, current situation, challenges, opportunities, and its capacity to improve clinical decision-making, emphasizing its utility for patients with liver diseases. Current advances in modern imaging technologies have promised a further increase in diagnostic efficacy of liver diseases. For example, complex internal anatomy of the liver and detailed morphological features of liver lesions can be reflected from CT-based 3D models. A meta-analysis reported that the application of 3D visualization technology in the diagnosis and management of primary hepatocellular carcinoma has significant or extremely significant differences over the control group in terms of intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, recovery of postoperative liver function, operation time, hospitalization time, and tumor recurrence on short-term follow-up. However, the acquisition of high-quality CT images and the use of these images for 3D visualization processing lack a unified standard, quality control system, and homogeneity, which might hinder the evaluation of application efficacy in different clinical centers, causing enormous inconvenience to clinical practice and scientific research. Therefore, rigorous operating guidelines and quality control systems need to be established for 3D visualization of liver to develop it to become a mature technology.

The beamforming matrix consists of analog radio frequency (RF) precoder and it is implemented by using phase shifters and baseband digital precoder. Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technology that allows bandwidth expansion to improve data capacity by combining two or more carriers in the same or different frequency bands. The digital baseband precoder is the main challenge and can be adapted to the channel of each carrier in the frequency domain while the same analog RF precoder must be applied to all carriers simultaneously in the time domain. The main goal of our research is to combine CA technology with hybrid digital and analog beamforming architecture to provide an improved system performance with less penalty. This paper proposes a hybrid precoding algorithm to support two carriers aggregated that are based on this scenario.

Mechanical stimuli are able to activate cellular responses by inducing the activation of several signaling pathways including cytoskeletal changes and inflammation. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic network and plays many important roles in intracellular events. Here, we aimed to investigate the involvement of a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and actin polymerization in vibration-induced upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 expression in hPDL cells. hPDL cells were pretreated with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 or cytochalasin D, respectively, before exposure to vibration. IL-6 and IL-8 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. Subcellular localization of the NF-κB p65 subunit was visualized by immunofluorescent staining. We found an increase in NF-κB nuclear translocation in vibrated cells compared with control cells. Pretreatment with BAY 11-7082 significantly inhibited vibration-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein expression in hPDL cells. Moreover, pretreatment with cytochalasin D inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation and attenuated upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein in vibrated cells. Therefore, modulation of actin cytoskeletal polymerization in response to vibration may activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and subsequently upregulate IL-6 and IL-8 expression in hPDL cells.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; humoral medicalators of Immunologyne response; interleukin, biochemistryistry",Cell Biology

Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiolog-ical illustration of correlation between national BCG immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the vaccine should be informed to individual, who request BCG immunization.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The main source of CO2 emission is from the flue gas from combustion process. The K2CO3 solid sorbent in circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFB) is nominated as an efficient method for capturing CO2 in flue gas. The CFB reactor consists of two reactors including circulating fluidized bed riser (CFBR) and circulating fluidized bed downer (CFBD). The study focused on the CFBR as it was used in adsorption process. However, CO2 capture capacity is limited due to the equilibrium at the specific system temperature. This study developed the computational fluid dynamics model of the nonisothermal circulating fluidized bed riser which included effect of the cooling water tube. The simulation procedure found the suitable grid number and simulation time of 420,000 cells and 100 s, respectively. The effect of cooling water temperature on the system hydrodynamics and temperature profiles was investigated. The results showed that the CO2 capture capacity increases with the decreasing temperature of cooling water temperature.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)

Materials and methods: 127 cases of hydatidiform mole who had morphologic examination and p57Kip2immunohistochemical staining were evaluated. Six discrepant cases between morphologic examination and p57Kip2 staining were recruited. DNA was extracted from chorionic villi and paired maternal decidual tissue in Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections. The STR DNA genotyping was performed by Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer. Genetic data analysis was performed by Gene mapper ID-X software. Three concordant cases were used as control. Results were compared to histopathology, p57Kip2 stain and development of post-molar GTN. Results: All controlled cases were confirmed PHM. Two cases of histologic CHM with positive p57Kip2and 2 cases of PHM with negative p57Kip2 were reported as PHM from microsatellite. Other 2 cases of histologic diagnosis PHM with negative p57Kip2 reported as CHM from microsatellite test and both of them developed post-molar GTN. Conclusion: Microsatellite genotyping is a high accuracy method for differential diagnosis from complete and partial hydatidiform moles. However, cost of microsatellite genotyping is still too high to use routinely. Therefore, selected use in discrepancy cases may be suitable.",medical,Obstetrics and Gynecology

However, very limited research attention has been paid to how intergenerational attachment, relating to an individual’s perception of his/her own and that of his/her parents’ attachment, can affect marital dynamics within different cultural contexts. The current study examined associations between married heterosexual couples’ romantic attachment, perception of parental attachment, and marital satisfaction in 100 Thai couples (M age = 45.59 years, SD = 10.86) and 73 Taiwanese couples (M age = 39.55 years, SD = 9.13). Results revealed that romantic attachment anxiety was negatively associated with marital satisfaction in the Taiwanese couples; in the Thai couples, neither romantic attachment anxiety nor avoidance was associated with marital satisfaction. Husbands reported higher romantic attachment anxiety than their wives in Taiwan, but this was not observed in the Thai couples. Taiwanese wives reported higher scores on their perceived parental attachment avoidance than did their husbands; whereas the reverse trend was observed in the Thai couples. These findings highlight the need to consider intergenerational aspects of attachment in cultural contexts, and they have important implications for practitioners working with couples from Asian cultural backgrounds.","genergyal, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The mesocellular foam silica (MCF-Si) was used as the template of material following by converting the surfactant residue (Pluronic P123) into carbon layers using H2SO4 and NaOH etching. The obtained MCF-C exhibited the highest surface area of 995 m2/g among these materials, and mesoporous size of 4.2 nm with spherical shape and interconnected pore. Furthermore, total acidity of MCF-C also increased from 427.07 (MCF-Si) to 682.64 μmole. In the part of catalytic test, the MCF-C was used in gas-phase ethanol dehydrogenation at 200-400 °C. It revealed that the MCF-C exhibited the highest ethanol conversion (ca. 17.5 %) at 400 °C due to its high acidity without significant deactivation of catalyst within 12 h. Besides, its high ethanol conversion, it is worth noting that the acetaldehyde selectivity (ca. 80.3 %) was also high, especially at 400 °C. This can be attributed to the proper mesoporous size that can facilitate the diffusion of acetaldehyde without further decomposing at high temperature.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The blunting effect of pertussis immunization during pregnancy on infant antibody responses induced by whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccination is not well-defined. Methods. This randomized controlled trial (NCT02408926) followed term infants born to mothers vaccinated with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy in Thailand. Infants received either acellular pertussis (aP)- or wP-containing vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A comparison group comprised wP-vaccinated children born to mothers not vaccinated during pregnancy. Antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (PRN) were evaluated using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Functionality of antibodies against Bordetella pertussis was measured using Bordetella pertussis growth inhibition assay. Results. After maternal Tdap vaccination, 158 infants vaccinated with aP-containing vaccines possessed higher antibody levels (P <.001) against all tested B. pertussis antigens postpriming compared to 157 infants receiving wP-containing vaccines. At 1 month postbooster, only anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies were still significantly higher (P <.001) in the aP group. Significantly higher anti-PT and anti-FHA (P <.001), but not anti-PRN immunoglobulin G, were observed among 69 wP-vaccinated infants born to control mothers compared with wP-vaccinated infants of Tdap-vaccinated mothers after primary and booster vaccination. The antibody functionality was higher in all wP-vaccinated infants at all times. Conclusions. Maternal Tdap vaccination inhibited more pertussis-specific responses in wP-vaccinated infants compared to aP-vaccinated infants, and the control group of unvaccinated women had highest PT-specific responses, persisting until after the booster dose.

Programs are developed by program languages implementing functions of models. One of the efficient methods to construct a model is to construct it by semantic computation models. Using semantic computation models, we can construct a model in a semantic space. In this paper, we present a mechanism to execute models presented by the semantic spaces. We have presented a mechanism to implement combinational and sequential logic computations based on the semantic space model. The combinational and sequential logic computations are the basic functions in computer systems. However, we still need a control mechanism like that in computers. In this paper, we present a control mechanism based on the semantic space model and some of execution examples. The most important contribution of this paper is that we first present a concept for control and program based on the semantic space model. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism, we performed a demonstration experiment. In the experiment, an agent is constructed for unmanned ground vehicle control with the control mechanism. A video camera is used to determine the position of the vehicle and obstacles on the road. The control signals, including “turn left,” “turn right,” “go ahead” and “stop” outputted from the agent are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the mechanism.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Artificial Intelligence

Methods 28 experts from 11 countries reviewed the evidence and modified the statements using the Delphi method, with consensus level predefined as ≥80% of agreement on each statement. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was followed. Results Consensus was reached in 26 statements. At an individual level, eradication of H. pylori reduces the risk of GC in asymptomatic subjects and is recommended unless there are competing considerations. In cohorts of vulnerable subjects (eg, first-degree relatives of patients with GC), a screen-and-treat strategy is also beneficial. H. pylori eradication in patients with early GC after curative endoscopic resection reduces the risk of metachronous cancer and calls for a re-examination on the hypothesis of a € the point of no return'. At the general population level, the strategy of screen-and-treat for H. pylori infection is most cost-effective in young adults in regions with a high incidence of GC and is recommended preferably before the development of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. However, such a strategy may still be effective in people aged over 50, and may be integrated or included into national healthcare priorities, such as colorectal cancer screening programmes, to optimise the resources. Reliable locally effective regimens based on the principles of antibiotic stewardship are recommended. Subjects at higher risk of GC, such as those with advanced gastric atrophy or intestinal metaplasia, should receive surveillance endoscopy after eradication of H. pylori. Conclusion Evidence supports the proposal that eradication therapy should be offered to all individuals infected with H. pylori. Vulnerable subjects should be tested, and treated if the test is positive. Mass screening and eradication of H. pylori should be considered in populations at higher risk of GC.",medical,Gastroenterology

Shortage of epilepsy specialists, especially in developing countries, is a major limiting factor in implementing cEEG in general practice. Delivery of care with tele-continous EEG (tele-cEEG) may be a potential solution as this allows specialists from a central facility to remotely assist local neurologists from distant areas in interpreting EEG findings and suggest proper treatment. No tele-cEEG programme has been implemented to help improve quality of care. Therefore, this study is conducted to assess the efficacy and cost utility of implementing tele-cEEG in critical care. Methods and analysis The Tele-cRCT study is a 3-year prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel, multicentre, superiority trial comparing delivery of care through € Tele-cEEG' intervention with € Tele-routine EEG (Tele-rEEG)' in patients with clinical suspicion of NCS/NCSE. A group of EEG specialists and a tele-EEG system were set up to remotely interpret EEG findings in six regional government hospitals across Thailand. The primary outcomes are functional neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS), mortality rate and incidence of seizures. The secondary outcomes are cost utility, length of stay, emergency visit/readmission, impact on changing medical decisions and health professionals' perceptions about tele-cEEG implementation. Functional outcome (mRS) will be assessed at 3 and 7 days after recruitment, and again at time of hospital discharge, and at 90 days, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year.

It triggers many responses by inducing changes in plant morphology and physiology. KDML105 rice is a key rice variety in Thailand and is normally grown in the northeastern part of the country. The chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) were developed by transferring putative drought tolerance loci (QTLs) on chromosome 1, 3, 4, 8, or 9 into the KDML105 rice genome. CSSL104 is a drought-tolerant line with higher net photosynthesis and leaf water potential than KDML105 rice. The analysis of CSSL104 gene regulation identified the loci associated with these traits via gene co-expression network analysis. Most of the predicted genes are involved in the photosynthesis process. These genes are also conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seven genes encoding chloroplast proteins were selected for further analysis through characterization of Arabidopsis tagged mutants. The response of these mutants to drought stress was analyzed daily for seven days after treatment by scoring green tissue areas via the PlantScreenTM XYZ system. Mutation of these genes affected green areas of the plant and stability index under drought stress, suggesting their involvement in drought tolerance.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, medical","Genetics, Genetics (clinical)"

Cellulose regenerated from the bagasse sugarcane was used for this study. Although cellulose and NR have a considerably low mutual affinity, composite hydrogels with various cellulose and NR contents were prepared using a wet-phase inversion method. The maximum amount of NR that can be loaded into the cellulose hydrogel was about 30% vol. Once NR is introduced into the cellulose hydrogels, the obtained hydrogel became translucent and eventually opaque with increasing NR loading. Measurements of water absorption, the water contact angle, and evaluation of fourier-transform infrared spectroscopoy (FTIR) spectra revealed that the presence of NR decreases the water affinity of the hydrogels. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the composite hydrogels had higher tensile strength and better elastic properties than the pristine hydrogel. The results showed that the obtained composite hydrogels can be elongated several times to their original length. The enhancement of both properties was proportional to the amount of NR included. Results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed NR present inside the hollow of the cellulose hydrogel, forming interconnected domains. One can infer that the increase of mechanical and elastic properties is attributable to the presence of these interconnected structures.","mixing and separation, Materials Science","Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

In Taiwan, cellulosic waste has been used in anaerobic digestion for bioethanol production. This process produces a large amount of biomass-associated sludge that may become a serious environmental issue. Therefore, in this study, the anaerobic digestion sludge was recycled for the production of activated carbon via pyrolysis and activation by KOH. Surface characterization showed increased surface area and development of microporous structure upon activation. The FTIR image showed that high temperature activation eliminated most functional groups in the activated carbon, except for C[dbnd]O and C–O groups. The results showed that the activated carbon could be used for pollutant adsorbents such as molecular dyes (methylene blue: 217 mg g−1) and metal ions (copper: 169 mg g−1) from aqueous solution. In addition, the as-synthesized activated carbon can be used for CO2 capture and capacitor. Instead of focusing on one single application, we proposed that centralized production of activated carbon could be used in various applications, while further modification could be adopted depending on the need of its specific application.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; energygy, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

The boundaries of the CTF and the needle pathway of CTF injection were identified in the first cadaver. The CTF and ESP injections were performed on either the left or right sides of the T4 vertebral level in cadavers 2 to 6. Fifteen milliliters of 0.2% methylene blue was injected in each block, and the spread of dye was assessed by anatomic dissection. We also report 2 case studies of CTF and ESP blocks. Results: Cadaver studies of CTF injection demonstrate that with injection to the inferior aspect of the base of the transverse process, the dye mainly passes anteriorly through the CTF into the paravertebral space, with minimal track-back to the deep back muscles. Consistent sensory blockade was achieved in 2 case studies. With the ESP injection, the spread of dye was observed cephalocaudad to the fascia of the erector spinae muscle, with no dye spreading within the paravertebral space in all cadavers. Limitations: Prospective case series. Conclusions: CTF block was consistently associated with a mainly anterior spread of injectate into the paravertebral space that involved the thoracic spinal nerves, and minimal posterior spread of injectate to the deep back muscles.",medical,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine
Diagnostic utility of CT for suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor enterocolitis,"Durbin S.M., Mooradian M.J., Fintelmann F.J., Zubiri L., Chute D.F., Kambadakone A., Pisuchpen N., Reynolds K.L., Dougan M.",2020-10-01,"Aged, Enterocolitis, Female, Humans, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, autoimmunity, immunotherapy, inflammation","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) enterocolitis is a common immune-related adverse event and can be fatal, especially when not diagnosed and treated promptly. The current gold standard for diagnosis is endoscopy with biopsy, but CT scan is a possible alternative. The primary objective of this study is to identify the diagnostic performance of CT in the evaluation of ICI enterocolitis. METHODS: With institutional review board approval, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who received ICI therapy between 2015 and 2019 across a healthcare system. Patients were included if they underwent both abdominal CT and endoscopy with biopsy within 3 days. The radiological and pathological diagnoses, as well as clinical characteristics, were extracted from the electronic medical record. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CT for diagnosing ICI enterocolitis when compared with tissue diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 4474 patients screened, 138 met inclusion criteria. Most common tumor types were melanoma (37%) and lung cancer (19%). Seventy-four per cent were treated with antiprogrammed cell death (PD-1)/PD-L1 therapy. Thirty-nine per cent had signs of enterocolitis on CT scan and 58% had biopsy-proven ICI enterocolitis. Sensitivity and specificity of CT were 50% and 74%, respectively. PPV was 73% and NPV was 52%. Of those with confirmed ICI enterocolitis, 70% had grade 3 or higher symptoms, 91% received steroids and 40% received infliximab. CONCLUSION: The performance of CT scan for diagnosis of ICI enterocolitis is moderate to poor and does not replace endoscopy with biopsy.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Oncology, Pharmacology, Cancer Research"

The antibacterial result of all extract against E.coli showed no inhibition zone, while ethanolic extracts significantly affected to S.aureus inhibition that increasing concentration of ethanol provided an increasing in inhibition zone and decreasing MIC value from 5 to 1.25 mg/ml. Low-temperature extraction (40oC) was indicated as the optimum temperature which led to high antibacterial activity. The effect of extraction time was directly related to the inhibition zone. The highest inhibition zone and MIC value were obtained from extract which was extracted by using 70%MeoH, 40OC and 3 h. TPC result revealed a significant relationship with antibacterial activity, meaning that higher TPC led to higher antibacterial inhibition.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Evidences have shown that weight loss can result in reduction in blood pressure and RAS. This study was aim to investigate changes of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) after bariatric surgery. Methods: A prospective study was done in 14 morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients who were taking medications that can interfere with PAC and renin levels were excluded. Collection of blood samples were done at baseline and at 3 and 6-month post-bariatric surgery. Results: Four out of 14 patients had hypertension at baseline. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 56.7 ± 13.5 kg/m2. PAC were significantly decreased at 3-and 6-month post-bariatric surgery from 14.3 ± 8.0 to 7.5 ± 5.5 [reduction of 36% from baseline (P < 0.01)] and 8.0 ± 6.6 ng/dl [reduction of 32% from baseline (P < 0.05)] respectively. The reduction of PAC at 3-month post-surgery was correlated with the reduction of body weight (r = 0.46, P < 0.05), waist circumference (r = 0.73, P < 0.05) and percent of body fat (r = 0.58, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Maximal reduction of PAC in obese patients underwent bariatric surgery occurred during the first 3 months after bariatric surgery.

Modifications to the structure and properties of WPI films via heat-denaturation and plasticizers were determined. The structure-function relationship of the films was elucidated based on FTIR analysis. The developed water-soluble native WPI (NWPI) films had similar visual and barrier properties (oxygen permeability 4.74 × 10−4 to 12.26 × 10−4 cm3 μm/m2∙s∙kPa and water vapor permeability 0.0113–0.0148 g mm/m2∙s∙kPa) but lower mechanical properties (tensile strength 1.04–3.16 MPa, % elongation 7.45–15.31%, and elastic modulus 18.88–105.34 MPa) than the water-insoluble heat-denatured WPI films. The solution-sealed NWPI pouches of dry food models showed ready solubility. Heat denaturation strengthened the cohesion of the WPI films via the enhanced formation of the intermolecular β-sheet. Glycerol and atmospheric moisture showed plasticizing effects on both the barrier and tensile properties, which correlated well with the films’ moisture sorption isotherms. Solution-sealed NWPI pouches can be potentially used as leave-in packaging for portioned dry foods. The comprehensive understanding of the properties of glycerol-plasticized WPI films gained from this study is valuable in designing WPI-based packaging for commercial packaged food systems.","genergyal, mixing and separation, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

In this study, a model of carbon dioxide capture adsorption in a fluidized bed reactor was developed based on experimental data using commercial CFD program called ANSYS FLUENT. Then the model was employed to observe the hydrodynamics behavior and the dynamic responses of CO2 capture inside the adsorber when the operating variables were changed. The effects of operating variables on carbon dioxide capture were evaluated. From the simulation results, both the inlet gas velocity and the inlet solid circulation rate affected the carbon dioxide capture. The relationships between inlet gas velocity and inlet solid circulation rate to the percentage of carbon dioxide capture were investigated and analyzed by using system identification toolbox in MATLAB. After that, these relationships were used to design a control system. For the considered control system, the inlet solid circulation rate was selected to be a manipulated variable, while the inlet gas velocity, composition and temperature were designated as system disturbances. The controlled variable was carbon dioxide content remaining in the flue gas at the outlet. It was found that the control system could maintain the concentration of carbon dioxide in the flue gas at a specified value.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)
The wake of a three-dimensional underwater obstacle: Effect of bottom boundary conditions,"Puthan P., Jalali M., Ortiz-Tarin J.L., Chongsiripinyo K., Pawlak G., Sarkar S.",2020-05-01,"Bottom boundary conditions, Internal waves, Recirculation regions, Slip boundary conditions, Threedimensional (3-d), Turbulent kinetic energy, Turbulent wake, Vorticity generation, Boundary conditions, Internal waves, Lee vortices, Turbulent wakes, Vorticity generation","Three-dimensional (3D) obstacles on the bottom are common sites for the generation of vortices, internal waves and turbulence by ocean currents. Turbulence-resolving simulations are conducted for stratified flow past a conical hill, a canonical example of 3D obstacles. Motivated by the use of slip boundary condition (BC) and drag-law (effectively partial slip) BC in the literature on geophysical wakes, we examine the sensitivity of the flow to BCs on the obstacle surface and the flat bottom. Four BC types are examined for a non-rotating wake created by a steady current impinging on a conical obstacle, with a detailed comparison being performed between two cases, namely NOSL (no-slip BC used at all solid boundaries) and SL (slip BC used at all solid boundaries). The other two cases are as follows: Hybrid, undertaken with slip at the flat bottom and no-slip at the obstacle boundaries, and case DL wherein a quadratic drag-law BC is adopted on all solid boundaries. The no-slip BC allows the formation of a boundary layer which separates and sheds vorticity into the wake. Significant changes occur in the structure of the lee vortices and wake when the BC is changed. For instance, bottom wall friction in the no-slip case suppresses unsteadiness of flow separation leading to a steady attached lee vortex. In contrast, when the bottom wall has a slip BC (the SL and Hybrid cases) or has partial slip (DL case), unsteady separation leads to a vortex street in the near wake and the enhancement of turbulence. The recirculation region is shorter and the wake recovery is substantially faster in the case of slip or partial-slip BC. In the lee of the obstacle, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for case NOSL is concentrated in a shear layer between the recirculating wake and the free stream, while TKE is bottom-intensified in the other three cases. DL is the appropriate BC for high-Re wakes where the boundary layer cannot be resolved. The sources of lee vorticity are also examined in this study for each choice of BC. The sloping sides lead to horizontal gradients of density at the obstacle, which create vorticity through baroclinic torque. Independent of the type of BC, the baroclinic torque dominates. Vortex stretch and tilt are also substantial. An additional unstratified free-slip case (SL-UN) is simulated and the wake is found to be thin without large wake vortices. Thus, stratification is necessary for the formation of coherent lee vortices of the type seen in geophysical wakes.","fluid mechanics, computer science, earth sciences","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Oceanography, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Atmospheric Science"

The Thalassemia Unit, Najaf province, Iraq, keeps all medical records of all patients with HHD from the Najaf province. Objectives: We aimed to conduct an epidemiological study to obtain a comprehensive epidemiological picture concerning sex distribution, and effects of blood groups and consanguinity. Patients and methods: All registered HHD patients (until May 2019) in the Thalassemia Unit (1033 patients, aged 0.5–65 years old) were included in the study. Results: The prevalence of HHD in Najaf city is 69.60 per 100,000 population. There are significantly more male than female HHD patients (Male = 53.437%, Female = 46.563%, p = 0.019). The top 3 prevalent HHD are transfusion-dependent thalassemia (36.012%), non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (34.656%), and sickle-β thalassemia disorder (13.746%). The highest percentage of patients were in the centre of Najaf (56.42%), followed by Kufa, Mishkhab, Haidariah, Manathera, and Abbasiya. The distribution of blood groups and Rh factors of HHD patients in the Najaf population was not significantly different from that in the normal population. The consanguinity rate observed in our patients’ parents (78.67%) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) as compared with the consanguinity rate in the population (45.8%). Conclusions: During the last few years, there was an increase in HHD cases in Najaf city and, therefore, there is an urgent need to increase awareness about the effects of consanguinity marriages on HHD in order to limit the incidence of HHD.","medical, biochemistryistry","Hematology, Clinical Biochemistry, Biochemistry (medical)"

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature related to preoperative parenteral nutrition (PN) and to provide current evidence based guidance. A systemic online search of PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Databases from January 1990 to February 2020 was done. Sixteen studies were included in this narrative review, including four meta-analyses and twelve clinical trials. The majority of studies have demonstrated benefits of preoperative PN on postoperative outcomes, including reduced postoperative complications (8/10 studies) and postoperative length of stay (3/4 studies). Preoperative PN is indicated in malnourished surgical patients who cannot achieve adequate nutrient intake by oral or enteral nutrition. It can be seen that most studies showing benefits of preoperative PN often included patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (10/12 studies), which gastrointestinal problems are commonly seen and enteral nutrition may be not feasible. When preoperative PN is indicated, adequate energy and protein should be provided, and patients should receive at least seven days of PN prior to surgery. The goal of preoperative PN is not weight regain, but rather repletion of energy, protein, micronutrients, and glycogen stores. Complications associated with preoperative PN are rarely seen in previous studies. In order to prevent and mitigate the potential complications such as refeeding syndrome, optimal monitoring and early management of micronutrient deficiencies is required.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

This work proposes a fast and accurate automated method to classify firearm brands from bullet markings. Specifically, a panoramic image of a bullet collected from a crime scene was captured using a developed mobile phone application and custom-built portable hardware. The top three state-of-the-art CNNs pretrained on ImageNet - DenseNet121, ResNet50, and Xception - were further trained on the same training set, which was composed of 718 bullets collected from eight different firearm brands - Beretta, Browning, CZ, Glock, Norinco, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Smith Wesson - using a five-fold cross validation technique. DenseNet121 provided the highest AUC of 0.99 for CZ classification (the most common registered firearm brand in Thailand) and the highest average AUC for the eight firearm brands (0.9780 ± 0.0130 SD), which was significantly higher than those of ResNet50 and Xception. In addition, there were no interaction effects between the CNN model and firearm brand on AUC. DenseNet121, which had the highest AUC, was evaluated on the test set (72 bullets), and the results showed that the Beretta and CZ classifications had the lowest accuracy (91.18%), followed by the Browning and Norinco classifications (96.88%), whereas the Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Smith Wesson classifications had the highest accuracy (98.41%). These results suggest that the developed mobile phone application based on a deep learning algorithm and the custom-built portable hardware have promising potential for use at crime scenes to classify firearms from bullet markings. By narrowing down the list of suspects, this convenient approach can potentially accelerate bullet identification processes for many forensic science examiners.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This postulate aims at solving existing problems in higher dimensions, where one must re-think the scope of a given problem domain beyond the one-dimension Turing machine to dictate all subsequent problem representation, problem transformation, and algorithmic derivation. Two oversimplified well-known problems, namely, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Tower of Hanoi problem are presented to demonstrate the point. Both synthetic problems are effectively adapted to solve a real world project. To realize the postulate in a viable architectural construct, data flow and molecular computers are investigated since they show potential computation power. Unfortunately, they are still confined to working in one-dimension domain. A biological-like architecture for software systems is proposed in three design aspects: structure, function, and behavior. Contributions of this work are to revamp traditional Turing computation paradigm to N-dimension computing machine, yet it is simple, straightforward, and implementable by state-of-the-practice hardware and software technologies.

Specifically, these treatments involve the identification of MHC-bound peptides that are unique to a patient’s cancer (neoantigens), followed by immunization with peptides, RNA, or DNA that encodes these neoantigens via various delivery systems, thus amplifying the immune system’s response to the particular cancer. Such approaches have shown dramatic results in animal studies. Not surprisingly, then, the field of neoantigen-based immunotherapy has advanced at a spectacular rate, necessitating that interested individuals stay apprised of recent developments. Following an introduction to the subject, we thus focus on aspects that are particularly fast-moving; the cellular sources of neoantigens, which are surprisingly diverse, the tools that are used for their identification, and the status of the numerous clinical trials that are now being conducted.",medical,Medicine (all)

TPV is typically produced by using the dynamic vulcanization (DV) method in which rubber is crosslinked simultaneously with thermoplastics. Peroxide-crosslinked TPV can increase the compatibility between rubber and thermoplastics but loses its reprocessability due to excess crosslinking in the latter. In this work, we overcome this obstacle by using a two-step mixing method to prepare fully crosslinked elastomers of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and natural rubber (NR). Each sample formulation was prepared with three different mixing methods for comparison: NR-DV, Split-DV, and All-DV. For NR-DV, NR was crosslinked prior to the addition of EVA together with the thermal stabilizer (TS). For Split-DV, a small amount of EVA and NR was crosslinked prior to the addition of EVA and TS. In the All-DV method, EVA and NR were crosslinked, and then TS was added. The appearance and processability of the samples were affected by the degree of crosslinking. NR-DV showed a non-homogeneous texture. Although the samples of the All-DV method appeared homogeneous, their mechanical and rheological properties were inferior to those of the Split-DV method. The mechanical properties of the Split-DV samples were not significantly changed after reprocessing 10 times. Therefore, Split-DV is the preferred method for TPV production.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Materials and methods: The dataset consisted of 53 benign lesions and 202 malignant lesions including B-mode, and color Doppler mode. Convolutional Neuron Networks (CNNs) was applied to automatically extract the features from breast ultrasound images. Then, MI-CCA was performed to fuse with maximized correlation. Finally, the classification model was built via the support vector machine technique to distinguish breast tumors. Diagnosis performances of single modes, combination modes, and other fusion strategies were compared. Results: The single B-mode obtained 90.92% accuracy, while the color Doppler mode obtained 97.16% accuracy. The MI-CCA fusion reveals a significant improvement with 98.80% accuracy. The results indicated that the fusion of two modes tended to offer a more accurate diagnosis than the single mode. In addition, the unsupervised-PCA was high (AUC 0.91, 95% CI [0.90, 0.91]) and no significant difference was observed with the unsupervised-CCA (AUC 0.90, 95% CI [0.84, 0.90]). The supervised-PCA was the lowest (AUC 0.93, 95% CI [0.91, 0.93] and no significant difference was observed with the supervised-CCA (AUC 0.95, 95% CI [0.91, 0.94]). The proposed MI-CCA was the highest performance (AUC 0.99, 95% CI [0.93, 0.99]). These results indicated that the supervised strategies tended to give a more accurate diagnosis than unsupervised strategies. Conclusion: By using the combination of ultrasound modes, this approach achieves high performance compared with the single mode and other fusion strategies. Our methodology may be a beneficial tool for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.","Health Professions, medical, physics","Radiological and Ultrasound Technology, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics"
Air traffic control capacity planning under demand and capacity provision uncertainty,"Starita S., Strauss A.K., Fei X., Jovanovic R., Ivanov N., Pavlovic G., Fichert F.",2020-08-01,"Air traffic controller, Air Traffic Management, Business aviation, Capacity decisions, Capacity planning, Decomposition approach, Spatiotemporal distributions, Staff scheduling, Air transportation, Capacity ordering policies, Decomposition methods, Integer programming applications","In air traffic management, a fundamental decision with large cost implications is the planning of future capacity provision. Here, capacity refers to the available man-hours of air traffic controllers to monitor traffic. Airspace can be partitioned in various ways into a collection of sectors, and each sector has a fixed maximum number of flights that may enter within a given time period. Each sector also requires a fixed number of man-hours to be operated; we refer to them as sector-hours. Capacity planning usually takes place a long time ahead of the day of operation to ensure that sufficiently many air traffic controllers are available to manage the flow of aircrafts. However, at the time of planning, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the number and spatiotemporal distribution of nonscheduled flights and capacity provision, the former mainly due to business aviation, and the latter usually stemming from the impact of weather, military use of airspaces, etc. Once the capacity decision has been made (in terms of committing to a budget of sector-hours per airspace to represent long-term staff scheduling), on the day of operation, we can influence traffic by enforcing rerouting and tactical delays. Furthermore, we can modify which sectors to open at a given time (the so-called sector-opening scheme) subject to the fixed capacity budgets in each airspace. The fundamental trade-off is between reducing the capacity provision cost at the expense of potentially increasing displacement cost arising from rerouting or delays. To tackle this, we propose a scalable decomposition approach that exploits the structure of the problem and can take traffic and capacity provision uncertainty into account by working with a large number of traffic scenarios. We propose several decision policies based on the resulting pool of solutions and test them numerically using real-world data.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology","Civil and Structural Engineering, Transportation"

Bioremediation is proposed as an eco-friendly, cost-effective alternative to traditional physicochemical remediation techniques. In the present study, fungal strains were isolated from marine invertebrates and tested for their ability to biotransform 2,4-DCP at a concentration of 1 mM. The most competent strains were studied further for the expression of catechol dioxygenase activities and the produced metabolites. One strain, identified as Tritirachium sp., expressed high levels of extracellular catechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity. The same strain also produced a dechlorinated cleavage product of the starting compound, indicating the assimilation of the xenobiotic by the fungus. This work also enriches the knowledge about the mechanisms employed by marine-derived fungi in order to defend themselves against chlorinated xenobiotics.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This research study investigated additional factors to common parameters that are used in fundamental computations, especially factors related to tropical climates. Moreover, pollution problems, such as Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is currently becoming critical across these regions. Therefore, we also investigated the influence of PM2.5, ambient temperature and other factors towards the efficiency of electricity-generation from photovoltaic systems in a tropical climate zone. The parameters were collected using a data logger and the data was analyzed. The direct and indirect influences on the electricity produced from the photovoltaic system was described using the R2-value obtained from structural equation modeling. The results showed that ambient temperature and PM2.5 factors resulted in a direct negative effect on the electrical production in the tropical climate area. The equation could explain 59.0% of the factors affecting energy production; therefore can be applied to improve the development of system designs in tropical climate regions.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

The mix proportions of raw materials in the samples were designed using Taguchi method coupled with Grey relational analysis. L16 orthogonal array with three factors including spent coffee ground (SCG), zinc oxide (ZnO) and oregano essential oil/palm oil ratio (OEO/PO) at four-levels was chosen for determining an optimum mixture. Based on the signal-to-noise ratio and the analysis of variance of the results, additions of OEO/PO and SCG in the samples were the main factors in inhibition of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, it was found that the increase of SCG, ZnO and PO in ratio of OEO/PO in the samples resulted in enhancement of flexural strength of bioactive foam composites. It appears that ZnO and OEO/PO were the major factors to improve water resistance of the samples.

Using the ultraviolet-to-radio deep multiwavelength coverage of the GOODS-South field, we fit the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies to derive their key physical properties. The galaxies detected by ALMA are among the most massive at z = 2-4 (Mmed = 8.5 × 1010 M·) and they are either starburst or located in the upper part of the galaxy star-forming main sequence. A significant portion of our galaxy population (∼40%), located at z ∼ 2.5 - 3, exhibits abnormally low gas fractions. The sizes of these galaxies, measured with ALMA, are compatible with the trend between the rest-frame 5000 Å size and stellar mass observed for z ∼ 2 elliptical galaxies, suggesting that they are building compact bulges. We show that there is a strong link between star formation surface density (at 1.1 mm) and gas depletion time: The more compact a galaxy's star-forming region is, the shorter its lifetime will be (without gas replenishment). The identified compact sources associated with relatively short depletion timescales (∼100 Myr) are the ideal candidates to be the progenitors of compact elliptical galaxies at z ∼2.","extraterrestrial physicsics and stellar phenomena, fluidex; related topics, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"

The main cause of water contaminations are industrial dyes and toxic chemicals. Hence many technologies are being developed to de-contaminate the toxic materials. The photocatalytic de-contamination of dyes is an effective and simple technology to purify water. Among various photocatalysts, the transition metal based oxides (TiO2, NiO and ZnO) being the state-of art photocatalytic material. But, the metal oxides have large band gap and suffers from the fact that it predominantly absorbs the Ultra Violet region of irradiation. But, any viable photocatalytic technology demands absorption in the visible light region, so as to utilize the cost-free sun light. Herein, we tune and utilize the metal oxides through the integration of Ag metal nanoparticles. The synthesized materials were completely analyzed by PXRD, HRTEM, UV, XPS and BET instruments. All TiO2/Ag, NiO/Ag and ZnO/Ag nanocomposites were subjected to photocatalytic degradation using visible light. The nanocomposites acted as photocatalyst and degrade the colorful methyl orange and colorless toxic 4-chlorophenol. Among the aforementioned three samples, TiO2/Ag exhibited best performance than ZnO/Ag and NiO/Ag. We attributed the enhancement of photocatalytic activity due to Plasmons assistance and nanoscale regime of photocatalyst. In summary, we tuned the metal oxide photocatalytic performance using the Ag nanoparticle surface Plasmon resonance.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Previous studies have found that the main cause of medical evacuation due to illness is increasing. In Thailand, there have been no studies on the causes and costs of medical evacuation in the offshore oil and gas industry. This study aims to study on the causes and costs of medical evacuation among offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Thailand. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of data of medical evacuation among the offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Thailand from 2016 to 2019 for a period of 36 months. Results: During the research period, a total of 416 cases were evacuated. The majority of the causes of Medevac (84.13%) were illness. We found that 60.1% of all Medevacs were unpreventable or difficult to prevent, and only 39.9% were preventable. The cost of Medevac ranged from 10,000 to 880,000 THB per case. The cost of Medevac occurring from preventable causes was 17,160,000 THB for this period of 36 months. Conclusions: Reducing the cost of Medevac can be done by: 1) vaccination to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases, 2) screening to prevent people at risk of getting complications from pre-existing diseases to work offshore, and 3) increasing treatment capability of offshore facilities. Offshore oil and gas industry may consider cost-benefit of these approaches compared to status quo.",medical,"Medicine (miscellaneous), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

On both substrates, applying a higher reverse current or a longer reverse-time increases the Pt content due to higher Co dissolution from Pt–Co structures, but does not affect the morphology. Despite similar morphologies and compositions deposited on CC or GC, the electrochemical behaviors of Pt–Co on both substrates are significantly different. Distinct hydrogen under-potential deposition (HUPD) adsorption/desorption peaks are not observed on CC, while well-defined peaks are established on GC. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Pt–Co on CC is significantly higher than on GC due to its highly porous structure. The ORR on GC changes with the Pt content controlled by varying the reverse pulse during electrodeposition, where Pt–Co with 58 at.% Pt or higher provides a better activity than Pt, with 77 at.% Pt having the highest ORR activity.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, the two isolates formed a separate cluster from the type strains of the two species. The genomic DNA of isolate AC10T was sequenced. The assembled genomes of the isolate were analysed for average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH). The results showed that the highest ANI and dDDH values between isolate AC10T and G. oxydans DSM 3503T were 91.15 and 68.2%, which are lower than the suggested values for species delineation. The genome-based tree was reconstructed and the phylogenetic lineage based on genome sequences showed that the lineage of isolate AC10T was distinct from G. oxydans DSM 3503T and its related species. The two isolates were distinguished from G. oxydans and their relatives by their phenotypic characteristics and MALDI-TOF profiles. Therefore, the two isolates, AC10T (=BCC 15749T=TBRC 11329T=NBRC 103576T) and AC20 (=BCC 15759=TBRC 11330=NBRC 103579), can be assigned to an independent species within the genus Gluconobacter, and the name Gluconobacter aidae sp. nov. is proposed for the two isolates.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics"

Meanwhile, high-molecular weighted hydrocarbon could provide substantial yield of MWCNTs only within the growth temperature range of 850–950 °C. It was found that a higher heating rate of 9 °C/min could result in preferable production of MWCNTs with higher purity.

Microwave power 100 W, duty cycle 40 %, and 2 min treatment time led to a substantial improvement in the biomass and lipid content. Due to the simultaneous improvement in both the biomass and lipid content, the total lipid production was improved from 0.76 (microwave untreated) to 1.42 g/L (microwave treated) (12 days grown cells). In addition, with biomass and lipid content, microwave treatment also enhanced the production of Exopolysaccharides (EPS) up to 2.3-folds. Furthermore, biodiesel properties were improved to some extent after the microwave treatment.

In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed a systematic theoretical study of the OER electrocatalytic activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction. We find that the construction of heterojunction can efficiently modify the electronic properties of MoS2 phase, facilitate electron transfer, and thereby improving OER activity. In comparison to the pristine MoS2 monolayer, the theoretical overpotential of the MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction was significantly reduced nearly 69% from 2.52 to 0.78 V. Such outstanding OER activity mainly originates from the electronic coupling between MoS2 and g-C3N4. Overall, the present findings not only provide a vital insight into the catalytic mechanism of the enhanced OER activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction, but also provide a new pathway to develop high-performance OER electrocatalysts for future energy conversion applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

However, there are unclear patterns of differences in peripheral immune profiles between them. Methods: We examined such differences in 245 MDD and 59 BD patients, recruited in the same center, who were in an acute depressive episode of moderate severity. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models were used to compare levels of plasma biomarkers between groups and to predict dichotomous classification. Results: Interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, IL-12 and IL-10 were significantly higher in MDD than in BD, whereas IL-6, sTNFR2, IL-18, IL-33, ST2 (IL1R Like 1) and KLOTHO were significantly higher in BD than in MDD. Moreover, logistic regression analyses correctly classified BD and MDD patients with 98.1% accuracy, using a combination of IL-6, IL-8, ST2, sTNFR2 (directly associated with BD) and IL-12 and TNF-α (directly associated with MDD). Patients with MDD with melancholic features showed higher IL-1β levels than those without melancholia. The sTNFR1 / sTNFR2 ratio significantly predicted MDD and state and trait anxiety and negative affect. Results remained significant after covariate adjustment, including drug use. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Lack of control comparison group. Differences in exposure to medications among participants. Conclusions: Differences in immune profiles between BD and MDD patients exist, especially for the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS): increased IL-10 is the primary immune-regulatory mechanism in MDD, while increased sTNFR2 and KLOTHO are the primary regulatory mechanisms in BD.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

X-ray analysis discloses that the A–C-rings are buried in the β-CD cavity and the side chain is mostly outside the cavity, nearby the O2–H/O3–H side. Hence, the inclusion structures of both complexes are stabilized by host–guest C5–H∙∙∙π interaction and N5′–H∙∙∙O5/O6 H-bonds of twofold-screw-symmetry-related molecules, which are similar to those of the reported complexes of nortriptyline and amitriptyline. The DFT full-geometry optimization in the gas phase reveals an alternative inclusion scenario with the TCA side chain that is embedded in the β-CD cavity and stabilized by intermolecular O6–H∙∙∙N5’ H-bond and O2–H/O3–H∙∙∙π interactions. The β-CD encapsulation of the TCA side chain is more energetically stable by 10.76 and 4.70 kcal mol−1 than that of the aromatic moiety for the respective complexes of DPM and IPM, based on the relative stabilization energies (ΔΔEstb). This suggests the existence of the bimodal β-CD–TCA inclusion complexes as spectroscopically observed in solution, thus explaining the controversy in the inclusion mode and the improvement of TCA therapeutic effect by CD encapsulation.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

Dual Increment Shapelets: A Scalable Shapelet Discovery for Time Series Classification,"Vichit N., Ratanamahatana C.A.",2020-01-01,"Empirical experiments, Filtering process, Incremental neural networks, Search Algorithms, Shapelet, State-of-the-art algorithms, Three orders of magnitude, Time series classifications, Classification, Data mining, Shapelet, Time series","As time series data become more complex and users expect more sophisticated information, numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve these challenges. Among those algorithms to classify time series data, shapelet – a discriminative subsequence of time series data – is considered a practical approach due to its accurate and insightful classification. However, previously proposed shapelet algorithms still suffer from exceedingly high computational complexity, as a result, limiting its scalability to larger datasets. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel algorithm that speeds up shapelet discovery process. Our algorithm so called “Dual Increment Shapelets (DIS)” is a combination of two-layered incremental neural network and filtering process based on subsequence characteristics. Empirical experiments on forty datasets evidently demonstrate that our proposed work could achieve large speedup while maintaining its accuracy. Unlike the previous algorithm that mainly emphasizes speedup of the search algorithm, DIS essentially reduces the number of shapelet candidates based on subsequence characteristics. As a result, our DIS algorithm could achieve more than three orders of magnitude speedup, comparing with the baseline algorithms, while preserving the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithm.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"
Pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) after intramuscular administration at two dosages,"Poapolathep S., Giorgi M., Chaiyabutr N., Klangkaew N., Phaochoosak N., Wongwaipairote T., Poapolathep A.",2020-03-01,"Alligators and Crocodiles, Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Area Under Curve, Ceftriaxone, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Half-Life, Hemangioma, ceftriaxone, freshwater crocodiles, LC-MS/MS, pharmacokinetics","One of the major obstacles to the successful treatment of infectious disease in freshwater crocodile species is incorrect dosing of antibiotics. There are few reports on pharmacokinetics and dosage regimens of antimicrobial drugs in crocodiles. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ceftriaxone (CEF) in Siamese freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis). Freshwater crocodiles, Crocodylus siamensis, in breeding farms were treated with a single intramuscular administration of CEF at two dosages, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Blood samples were collected at preassigned times up to 168 hr. The plasma concentrations of CEF were measured by a validated method through liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. CEF plasma concentrations were quantified up to 72 and 96 hr after low- and high-dose administration, respectively. The Cmax values of CEF were 24.61 ± 5.15 µg/ml and 26.39 ± 2.81 µg/ml at dosages of 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w., respectively. The AUClast values increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The half-life values were not statistically different between the groups (around 20 hr). The average binding percentage of CEF to plasma protein was 53.78 ± 2.11%. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, susceptibility break-point and the surrogate PK-PD index (T > MIC, 0.2 μg/ml), i.m. administration of CEF at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg b.w. might be appropriate for initiating treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in freshwater crocodiles.","pharmacology, Veterinary Science","Pharmacology, Veterinary (all)"

Results showed that the roughest and least hydrophilic poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) based PIMs exhibited the best transport efficiency at the same current density (7 mA cm−2) compared to cellulose triacetate (CTA) and poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) based membranes. The addition of ionic liquids decreased the crystallinity of CTA based PIMs, but increased the crystallinity of PVDF-HFP based PIMs through forming hydrogen bonds and thus supported the fixed-site jumping mechanism. Additionally, the membrane area resistance of PVDF-HFP based PIMs was the lowest (28.4 and 5.4 Ω cm−2 for Cyphos IL 101 and Aliquat 336, respectively). Furthermore, a proper amount of plasticizer can improve the transport efficiency of Cr(VI), which the stripping degree and permeability reached 95.9% and 35.8 μm s−1 at a stack voltage of only 2.6 V. The prepared PIM also exhibited good stability during 10 cycles running in ED.

Recently, AlbuNet, a deep learning network, has shown a promising result and considered as the state-of-the-art technique. In this paper, we aim to enhance AlbuNet from two angles. First, squeeze-and-excitation is similar to the concept of attention on different channels, so it can combine variants of extracted features. Second, a pre-processing step to enhance an image’s quality is proposed by applying a computer vision technique called “contrast limit adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)”. The experiment was conducted on two benchmarks: MICCAI 2017 and 2018 datasets and evaluated in terms of Dice coefficient and Jaccard index scores.

Elucidation of the layered structures of AMO solvent-washed Mg–Al layered double hydroxides using Mg- and Al K-edge XANES and EXAFS: Impacts of washing solvents on structures and catalytic esterification of benzoic acid with 2-ethylhexanol to 2-ethylhexyl benzoate,"Kuljiraseth J., Wangriya A., Klysubun W., Jitkarnka S.",2020-07-01,"Catalytic esterification, Characterization techniques, Coordination number, Layered double hydroxides, Layered Structures, Linear combinations, Octahedral coordination, Radial distributions, Al K-edge, Esterification, LDHs synthesis, Mg K-edge, Structure, X-ray absorption","Recently, aqueous miscible organic-layered double hydroxides (AMO-LDHs) have been found to possess impressively-enhanced surface area and pore volume. Although computer simulations were adopted to understand the interaction between an AMO solvent and an LDH, their layered structures have not yet been clearly depicted. Therefore, in this work, Mg- and Al K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in association with characterization techniques such as XRD, BET, TEM, and STA-FTIR, were employed to visualize the layered structures in the atomic level of AMO-LDHs synthesized using two AMO solvents; that are, ethanol and acetone. XANES revealed that Mg (II) and Al (III) had octahedral coordination with oxygen atoms, whereas EXAFS revealed that the coordination numbers of Mg–O and Al–O bonds in the ethanol-washed LDH were distinguished from those of acetone- and water-washed LDHs. In addition, the radial distribution around cations of Mg–O–Al bonds in the layers was different from that in the conventional LDH, due to the differences in charge balance between the LDH sheets and AMO solvents. The illustrations of AMO-LDH layered structures were then constructed, in association with the information from the Molecular Dynamic simulation. As a result, the linear combination fitting based on the Mg K-edge XANES results showed that the change in phase composition of AMO-LDHs was attributed to the significantly-enhanced surface area, acid density, and base density, and consequently to the catalytic activity of AMO LDH-derived mixed oxides on the esterification of benzoic acid, a major component in chemical wastes, with 2-ethylhexanol to valuable 2-ethylhexyl benzoate.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics",Radiation

Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT was performed at the mixing ratio of 50:50 (wt.). The biomass samples were pyrolyzed at temperatures of 400, 450, and 500 °C under specific conditions. The results indicated that the yields of the bio-oil, biochar and pyrolysis gas were in the ranges of 38.5-46.5, 22.27-28.68 and 30.1-36.9 wt.%, respectively. Pyrolysis of RWS at 500 °C provided the most bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT could improve the product yield and quality. The bio-oil had relatively high water content, while its pH was low. The main compounds of bio-oil were oxygenated compounds such as acetic acid, phenols and 2-Propanone, 1-hydroxy-, determined by GC-MS. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil ranged from 16.1 to 20.36 MJ/kg. The biochar had high carbon content and low oxygen content in proximate and ultimate analysis, and based on FTIR. The HHV of biochar was in the range from 26.35 to 29.6 MJ/kg. The biochar also was highly porous, which was revealed by SEM and BET. The pyrolysis gas mainly contained CO, CO2, H2 and CH4, and its heating value was in the range from 3.23 to 6.7 MJ/m3. Based on these results, the RWS and OPT are alternative and challenging biomasses for conversion to biofuels and value-added products via pyrolysis.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

We initiated a prospective longitudinal study to determine durability of HBV virological control and clinical outcomes after prolonged TDF-based ART in HIV-HBV coinfection.Methods:Ninety-two HIV-HBV coinfected participants on, or about to commence, TDF-containing ART from Australia (n = 41) and Thailand (n = 52) were enrolled. Participants were followed 6-monthly for 2 years, then annually to 5 years. Laboratory and clinical assessments and a serum sample were collected at each study visit. These analyses compare follow-up at 2 and 5 years.Results:12.0% (95% confidence interval 6.8 to 20.2) of total study entry cohort (n = 92) or 15.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.8 to 25.3) of those with data to year 5 (n = 72) lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The only statistically significant association with HBsAg loss was lower study entry quantitative HBsAg. CD4 T-cell count increased by a median 245 cells/mm3 between the preTDF sample and 5 years of follow-up. By year 5, 98.5% of the cohort had undetectable HBV DNA (<15 IU/mL) and 91.4% had undetectable HIV RNA (<20 copies/mL).Conclusions:HBsAg loss was high and ongoing over 5 years of follow-up in HIV-HBV coinfected individuals on TDF-containing ART and undetectable HBV was almost universal. Although the pattern of HBsAg loss temporarily parallels immune reconstitution, we could not identify predictive immune markers. The high rate of HBsAg loss in HIV-HBV coinfection may offer valuable insights into the search for a functional HBV cure.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

The selected based-clays were plate-like kaolinite (Kaol; 1:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular montmorillonite (Mt; 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular bentonite (Bent; 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), and fibrous sepiolite (Sep; 2:1 inverted ribbons of magnesium phyllosilicate). The clay/AuNPs were synthesized using in situ chemical reduction of the gold precursor with anchoring 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) on the clay surfaces. The studied materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), zeta-potential analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Surface area, surface charges, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of based-clays and the clay/AuNPs played major roles on AChE loading, residual activity, and sensor storage stability. The Mt/AuNPs was determined, among the studied clays, as the best supports for AChE loading and residual activities due to its high specific surface area and weak electrostatic interaction with the immobilized enzyme. Since apparent catalytic efficiencies kcat app/KM appof the immobilized AChE in the four clay/AuNPs were found statistically similar, Mt/AuNPs which contained the highest enzyme loading was the favorite modified-electrode material. For chlorpyrifos detection, Kaol/AuNPs-based sensors resulted in the lowest detection limit, presumably due to the strong hydrophobic surface that helps to concentrate the nonpolar pesticide to the vicinity of the immobilized enzyme. Unfortunately, the highest electrostatic repulsion between the Kaol/AuNPs and AChE, and the dehydrated Kaol surface resulted in the lowest storage stability of the AChE pesticide sensors. Overall, Mt/AuNPs showed the highest potential as the AChE carrier and the modified electrode material for chlorpyrifos determination.","fluidex; related topics, clay minerals, earth sciences","Geology, Geochemistry and Petrology"

The Model-View-ViewModel or MVVM pattern is a design pattern that can be used to design structure of software which comprises three components. The Model component holds application data. The View component displays visual elements and controls on the screen. The ViewModel component is the intermediary between the Model and View and transforms model information for display on a view. The advantages of this pattern are that there is a clear separation between domain logic in the Model and the display on the View, and tests and maintenance of different components are facilitated. However, there are several developers in a software development team, and not all developers use the MVVM pattern. This makes the code not compliant with the pattern and affects code maintenance. To help developers to revise the code to comply with the MVVM pattern, this paper has studied the MVVM design pattern, summarized principles of the pattern, and proposed the criteria to detect pattern violation in Objective-C code. An automated tool has been developed to detect MVVM violation and report violation locations in the code so that developers can revise the code to follow the pattern. An experiment shows that the tool performs satisfactorily in pattern violation detection, compared with manual detection, with the precision of 0.81, recall of 0.77, and F1 of 0.79.","computer scienceuter software, data handling and applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

However, our knowledge of GPP at the stand scale remains uncertain, because estimates derived from eddy covariance (EC) rely on semi-empirical modelling and the assumptions of the EC technique are sometimes not fully met. We propose using the sap flux/isotope method as an alternative way to estimate canopy GPP, termed GPPiso/SF, at the stand scale and at daily resolution. It is based on canopy conductance inferred from sap flux and intrinsic water-use efficiency estimated from the stable carbon isotope composition of phloem contents. The GPPiso/SF estimate was further corrected for seasonal variations in photosynthetic capacity and mesophyll conductance. We compared our estimate of GPPiso/SF to the GPP derived from PRELES, a model parameterized with EC data. The comparisons were performed in a highly instrumented, boreal Scots pine forest in northern Sweden, including a nitrogen fertilized and a reference plot. The resulting annual and daily GPPiso/SF estimates agreed well with PRELES, in the fertilized plot and the reference plot. We discuss the GPPiso/SF method as an alternative which can be widely applied without terrain restrictions, where the assumptions of EC are not met.","plant science; environmentalronmental biology; ecology; growth and production processes, plant ecology; production and nutrients, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science"

In this work, three alternative methods for handling water content in WCO feedstocks using the earlier hybridization of esterification and transesterification in a single reactive distillation column (hybridized RD) were investigated. Our simulation results revealed that using two heat exchangers combined with the hybridized RD is a simple method to remove water from WCO. However, it requires the highest energy as well as biodiesel production cost (1.63 USD/kg biodiesel). The extended spacing stage modification of the hybridized RD was proposed to remove water content. It requires a new hybridized RD construction by spacing stages addition which can handle WCO with 10 wt% of water content and require less energy, resulting in lower biodiesel production cost (1.07 USD/kg biodiesel). The integration of pervaporation unit was found to be the best option. It offers the highest performance in terms of water removal and methanol recovery, resulting in the lowest biodiesel production cost (1.04 USD/kg biodiesel).

Technological advances have accelerated the identification of these allergens and characterized their putative roles within HDMs. Understanding their functional bioactivities is illuminating how they interact with the immune system to cause disease and how interrelations between them are essential to maximize allergic responses. Two types of allergen bioactivity, namely proteolysis and peptidolipid/lipid binding, elicit IgE and stimulate bystander responses to unrelated allergens. Much of this influence arises from Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 or TLR2 signalling and, in the case of protease allergens, the activation of additional pleiotropic effectors with strong disease linkage. Of related interest is the interaction of HDM allergens with common components of the house dust matrix, through either their binding to allergens or their autonomous modulation of immune receptors. Herein, we provide a contemporary view of how proteolysis, lipid-binding activity and interactions with polysaccharides and polysaccharide molecular recognition systems coordinate the principal responses which underlie allergy.

The H2S inlet concentration to the BTF was varied between ∼100 and ∼500 ppmv during steady-state tests, and thereafter to ∼1000, ∼2000, ∼3000 and ∼4000 ppmv during shock-load (i.e. transient state) tests. The H2S removal efficiency (RE) ranged between 17 and 100% depending on the operational mode of the BTF and the presence of acetate as a carbon source. The maximum elimination capacity (ECmax) of the BTF reached 113.5 (±6.4) g S/m3 h with 97% RE during H2S shock-load experiments at ∼4000 ppmv which showed the robustness and resilient capacity of BTF for the large fluctuations of H2S concentrations. The results from polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE) revealed that P. versutus remained dominant throughout the 189 days of BTF operation which can imply the crucial role of this bacterium to remove H2S and upgrade to clean biogas.

CD146 expression in oral lichen planus and oral cancer,"Pariyawathee S., Phattarataratip E., Thongprasom K.",2020-01-01,"Carcinogenesis, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, CD146 Antigen, Female, Humans, Lichen Planus, Oral, Male, Mouth Diseases, Mouth Mucosa, Mouth Neoplasms, CD146, METCAM, Oral epithelial dysplasia, Oral lichen planus, Oral squamous cell carcinoma","Objective: To examine the CD146/METCAM expression on keratinocytes in normal oral mucosa (NOM), oral lichen planus (OLP), oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Subjects and methods: Immunohistochemical examination of CD146 was performed on 80 specimens, divided into 20 cases from each group. The number of CD146+ keratinocytes was quantitatively assessed together with the staining intensity. Results: The mean percentage of CD146+ keratinocytes was 19.04±15.32, 59.40±24.48, 60.04±28.87, and 22.13±21.03 in NOM, OLP, OED, and OSCC, respectively. The mean percentages of CD146+ keratinocytes in OLP and OED were significantly higher than those of NOM and OSCC (p≤0.001). Most OED (55%) and OLP (60%) showed strong and moderate staining intensity, respectively, while NOM (50%) and OSCC (45%) predominantly expressed CD146 at mild intensity. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine CD146 expression in OLP and OED. CD146 is upregulated in OLP and OED but downregulated in OSCC. The alteration in CD146 may be involved in the immunoregulatory response of OLP and the early event of oral carcinogenesis. The loss of this protein may underlie the progression of OED into invasive OSCC. Clinical relevance: Overexpression of CD146 protein may play a role in the pathophysiology of OLP and OED.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

This study was conducted to evaluate the associations among subjective skin type, amount of sebum, stratum corneum hydration, and pore size in Thai women. Methods: Sixty-two healthy women with either self-described subjective oily or dry skin type were included and casual sebum level (CSL), sebum excretion rate (SER), clinical pore size score, mean pore area, and stratum corneum hydration were measured at several facial sites. Correlation coefficients between amount of sebum and other parameters were estimated. Results: Casual sebum level and sebum excretion rate were significantly higher in oily-skinned than dry-skinned group by 1.6-2.1 times. Mean pore area and clinical pore size score were not different between the 2 groups, nor did they correlate with CSL or SER. Corneometry was shown to be significantly higher in dry-skinned than oily-skinned group. Significant, negative correlations between corneometry and CSL were also found. Conclusion: The subjective facial skin types were consistent with the amount of sebum, but not pore size or corneometry, among Thai women.","genergyal, Materials Sciencerials science, dermatology and venergyeology, fluidex; related topics, medical",Dermatology
Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of infliximab and its biosimilar in patients with refractory moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease using real world evidence in Thailand,"Phisalprapa P., Kositamongkol C., Limsrivilai J., Aniwan S., Charatcharoenwitthaya P., Pisespongsa P., Kitiyakara T., Treepongkaruna S., Chaiyakunapruk N.",2020-11-01,"Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals, Budgets, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Crohn Disease, Health Expenditures, Humans, Infliximab, Models, Economic, Quality-Adjusted Life Years, Recurrence, Severity of Illness Index, Thailand, biosimilar, Cost-effectiveness analysis, Crohn's disease, infliximab, Thailand","Aims: This study aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of infliximab and its biosimilar compared to conventional therapy in refractory moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease (CD) in Thailand. Materials and methods: A Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of infliximab from a societal perspective. Our analyses consisted of three choices of treatment (conventional therapy, infliximab originator, and biosimilar) and three treatment scenarios (infliximab 2 years and 3 years if relapse, infliximab 2 years and lifelong if relapse, and infliximab lifelong). The input parameters were obtained from the CD registry and systematic literature reviews. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Threshold sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the optimal drug prices. Finally, budget impact analyses were conducted. Results: None of the scenarios was cost-effective at Thai willingness-to-pay threshold (4,706 USD/QALY gained). The lowest ICER of 30,121 USD/QALY gained was reported in the scenario that included only standard dose of infliximab biosimilar with the maximum of 5-year treatment. The drug prices need to be reduced by at least 72% to allow infliximab biosimilar to be cost-effective. The 5-year budget impact was only 695,958 USD for the current biosimilar price. Conclusions: Infliximab for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe CD in Thailand would be cost-effective if the drug prices were significantly decreased. The best value for money strategy was infliximab biosimilar with a restricted duration of treatment.Key points The use of infliximab and its biosimilar in a restricted duration of maximum 5-year is not cost-effective for patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease refractory to conventional therapy, unless their price was lowered around 72–90% in Thailand. The estimated budget impact for adopting infliximab or its biosimilar for such indication has potential financial feasibility. Policy makers may consider cost-effectiveness and budget impact findings as well as other aspects such as rarity of disease as a part of the decision making process.",medical,Health Policy
"Maternal Immune Activation Causes Schizophrenia-like Behaviors in the Offspring through Activation of Immune-Inflammatory, Oxidative and Apoptotic Pathways, and Lowered Antioxidant Defenses and Neuroprotection","Talukdar P.M., Abdul F., Maes M., Binu V., Venkatasubramanian G., Kutty B.M., Debnath M.",2020-10-01,"Animals, Antioxidants, Anxiety, Apoptosis, Behavior, Animal, Brain, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Inflammation, Lipopolysaccharides, Neuroprotection, Oxidative Stress, Poly I-C, Pregnancy, Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects, Prepulse Inhibition, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Schizophrenia, Signal Transduction, Social Behavior, Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances, Up-Regulation, Inflammation, Maternal immune activation, Neuro-immune, Neuroprotection, Oxidative stress, Schizophrenia-like behaviors","Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder, influenced by a combined action of genes and environmental factors. The neurodevelopmental origin is one of the most widely recognized etiological models of this heterogeneous disorder. Environmental factors, especially infections during gestation, appear to be a major risk determinant of neurodevelopmental basis of schizophrenia. Prenatal infection may cause maternal immune activation (MIA) and enhance risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. However, the precise mechanistic basis through which MIA causes long-lasting schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits in offspring remains inadequately understood. Herein, we aimed to delineate whether prenatal infection-induced MIA causes schizophrenia-like behaviors through its long-lasting effects on immune-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, oxidative stress toxicity, and antioxidant defenses in the brain of offspring. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 15/group) and were injected with poly (I:C), LPS, and saline at gestational day (GD)-12. Except IL-1β, plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17A assessed after 24 h were significantly elevated in both the poly (I:C)- and LPS-treated pregnant rats, indicating MIA. The rats born to dams treated with poly (I:C) and LPS displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors and significant deficits in social behaviors. Furthermore, the hippocampus of the offspring rats of both the poly (I:C)- and LPS-treated groups showed increased signs of lipid peroxidation, diminished total antioxidant content, and differentially upregulated expression of inflammatory (TNFα, IL6, and IL1β), and apoptotic (Bax, Cas3, and Cas9) genes but decreased expression of neuroprotective (BDNF and Bcl2) genes. The results suggest long-standing effects of prenatal infections on schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits, which are mediated by immune-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, increased oxidative stress toxicity, and lowered antioxidant and neuroprotective defenses. The findings suggest that prenatal infections may underpin neurodevelopmental aberrations and neuroprogression and subsequently schizophrenia-like symptoms.",neuroscience,"Neurology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience"
Coexistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa With Candida albicans Enhances Biofilm Thickness Through Alginate-Related Extracellular Matrix but Is Attenuated by N-acetyl-l-cysteine,"Phuengmaung P., Somparn P., Panpetch W., Singkham-In U., Wannigama D.L., Chatsuwan T., Leelahavanichkul A.",2020-11-24,"Acetylcysteine, Alginates, Animals, Biofilms, Candida albicans, Extracellular Matrix, Mice, Proteomics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alginate, biofilms, Candida albicans, l-cysteine, Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Bacteria and Candida albicans are prominent gut microbiota, and the translocation of these organisms into blood circulation might induce mixed-organism biofilms, which warrants the exploration of mixed- versus single-organism biofilms in vitro and in vivo. In single-organism biofilms, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) produced the least and the most prominent biofilms, respectively. C. albicans with P. aeruginosa (PA+CA) induced the highest biofilms among mixed-organism groups as determined by crystal violet straining. The sessile form of PA+CA induced higher macrophage responses than sessile PA, which supports enhanced immune activation toward mixed-organism biofilms. In addition, Candida incubated in pre-formed Pseudomonas biofilms (PA>CA) produced even higher biofilms than PA+CA (simultaneous incubation of both organisms) as determined by fluorescent staining on biofilm matrix (AF647 color). Despite the initially lower bacteria during preparation, bacterial burdens by culture in mixed-organism biofilms (PA+CA and PA>CA) were not different from biofilms of PA alone, supporting Candida-enhanced Pseudomonas growth. Moreover, proteomic analysis in PA>CA biofilms demonstrated high AlgU and mucA with low mucB when compared with PA alone or PA+CA, implying an alginate-related mucoid phenotype in PA>CA biofilms. Furthermore, mice with PA>CA biofilms demonstrated higher bacteremia with more severe sepsis compared with mice with PA+CA biofilms. This is possibly due to the different structures. Interestingly, l-cysteine, a biofilm matrix inhibitor, attenuated mixed-organism biofilms both in vitro and in mice. In conclusion, Candida enhanced Pseudomonas alginate–related biofilm production, and Candida presentation in pre-formed Pseudomonas biofilms might alter biofilm structures that affect clinical manifestations but was attenuated by l-cysteine.","Immunology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Candida administration in the DSS (DSS+Candida) model enhanced the mortality rate and induced bacteremia (without candidemia) resulting from a gut perm-selectivity defect despite similar diarrheal severity in mice treated with DSS alone. The dominant fecal bacteria in DSS+Candida and DSS alone mice were Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacter spp., respectively, implying that Candida induced gut dysbiosis. Interestingly, chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial colonies, predominantly Pseudomonas spp., appeared in the feces and blood of DSS+Candida mice (not the DSS alone group) during fungal culture. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria were also isolated, ex vivo, by incubating mouse feces with DSS and heat-killed Candida or (1→3)-β-D-glucan, suggesting bacterial fermentation on fungi. Administration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria in the DSS+Candida model enhanced the severity of disease, and increased growth of isolated P aeruginosa in blood agar containing heat-killed Candida was demonstrated. These data suggested the selection of a highly virulent bacterial strain following fecal Candida presentation in the gut. Additionally, reduction of fecal fungi with fluconazole decreased the burden of chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria, attenuating the severity of DSS+Candida. In conclusion, gut Candida induced bacteremia in the DSS model through an inflammation-induced gut perm-selectivity defect and facilitated the growth of some gut bacteria. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing gut fungi could attenuate disease severity. Further investigation of gut fungi in inflammatory bowel disease is warranted.",medical,"Emergency Medicine, Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine"

A growing body of literature has reported evidence of ancient hybridization events or natural hybrid zones in primates, including humans; however, we still have relatively limited knowledge about the pattern and history of admixture because there have been little studies that simultaneously achieved genome-scale analysis and a geographically wide sampling of wild populations. Our study applied double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to samples from the six localities in and around the provisional hybrid zone of rhesus and long-tailed macaques and evaluated population structure, phylogenetic relationships, demographic history, and geographic clines of morphology and allele frequencies. A latitudinal gradient of genetic components was observed, highlighting the transition from rhesus (north) to long-tailed macaque distribution (south) as well as the presence of one northern population of long-tailed macaques exhibiting unique genetic structure. Interspecific gene flow was estimated to have recently occurred after an isolation period, and the migration rate from rhesus to long-tailed macaques was slightly greater than in the opposite direction. Although some rhesus macaque-biased alleles have widely introgressed into long-tailed macaque populations, the inflection points of allele frequencies have been observed as concentrated around the traditionally recognized interspecific boundary where morphology discontinuously changed; this pattern was more pronounced in the X chromosome than in autosomes. Thus, due to geographic separation before secondary contact, reproductive isolation could have evolved, contributing to the maintenance of an interspecific boundary and species-specific morphological characteristics.","population genetics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics"

Physicochemical properties of the catalysts and effects of operating transesterification conditions on the biodiesel yield were investigated. Analytical data revealed that the biodiesel yield decreases with increasing crystallite and particle sizes, but it increases with the basic site density and surface area of the catalyst. Further, the results indicate that struvite should be used as the precursor to synthesize the catalyst in order to realize the highest biodiesel yield. Using the struvite-derived catalyst under the optimized transesterification conditions, the highest biodiesel yield was obtained. The transesterification reaction showed pseudo-first-order kinetics. In addition, the activation energy, frequency factor, and rate constant were also determined. The purification step is not needed, resulting in lower biodiesel production cost. Therefore, this catalyst is applicable as a potential transesterification catalyst for industrial plants.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The proper volumetric ratio of the three-stage UASB with flocculant sludge provided the dominance of the three sequencial steps of acidogenesis, acetognesis and methanogenesis to occur in the respective bioreactors, causing a higher process performance and giving the optimum COD loading rate of 15 kg/m3d. The presence of granular sludge in all three bioreactors, resulted from the slow increment in the COD loading rate over a long operation period with high levels of microbial concentrations in all three bioreactors under the continuous feed operation and steady sate condition. This further increased the optimum COD loading rate from 15 to 25 kg/m3d (calculated from the total liquid volume) with an extremely high energy yield of 11,740 kJ/kg COD applied.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; biological, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, process equipment, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

A small amount of Ca incorporated into the structure reduced the thermal expansion coefficient, improved the electrical conductivity, and increased power density by up to 30% of a La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte-supported single cell. The microstructure and oxygen permeability of the materials were independent of Ca substitution. A phase transformation of LaSr3-xCaxFe3O10-δ to perovskite was observed when the Ca composition of x > 1.0. Among the substitution of Pr and Sm for La in LaSr2.7Ca0.3Fe3O10-δ, only PrSr2.7Ca0.3Fe3O10-δ was pure with no phase transformation found. The co-substitution of Pr and Ca promoted the reduction of Fe, enhanced the oxygen permeation and active surface, and diminished the contact resistance at the cathode-electrolyte interlayer.

This paper selected Bangkok as a case study to evaluate options for preventing and reducing FW. The current situation and tendency of FW generation was clarified based on official published data, and ways in which FW is generated by consumers were examined via a questionnaire survey, followed by a review of the relevant existing FW policies and strategies, to provide policy implications for tackling the issues raised. It found that detailed stipulations by law remain incomplete, resulting in the increasing trend of FW generation over the past decade, with most FW being mixed with municipal solid waste and landfilled. FW generation doubled from 2,860 tonnes per day in 2003 to 5,669 tonnes per day in Bangkok in 2018. The proportion of FW in MSW was 53% in 2018, a figure that has been rising since 2015. Per capita, FW was estimated to be 0.38–0.61 kg per day in 2018, which is high even when compared to developed cities. Sources of FW are distributed widely through the whole supply chain due to diverse dietary and eating habits, with a high frequency of eating out and consuming ready-made food. This paper offers recommendations for FW policies and innovative actions targeting the entire supply chain to achieve more effective FW management.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Economics","Waste Management and Disposal, Economics and Econometrics"

Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the probability of CKD development. The area under the receiver operating characteristics was also used to validate the risk score.Results:We included 5701 participants in full model {median 8.1 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.8-10.9] years follow-up} and 9791 in short model validation [median 4.9 (IQR 2.5-7.3) years follow-up]. The crude incidence rate of CKD was 8.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.3 to 8.9] per 1000 person-years in the full model cohort and 10.5 (95% CI: 9.6 to 11.4) per 1000 person-years in the short model cohort. The progression rates for CKD at 10 years in the full model cohort were 2.7%, 8.9%, and 26.1% for low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups, and 3.5%, 11.7%, and 32.4% in the short model cohort. The area under the receiver operating characteristics for the full-risk and short-risk score was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79 to 0.83) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.85), respectively.Conclusion:The D:A:D CKD full-risk and short-risk score performed well in predicting CKD events among Asian PLHIV. These risk prediction models may be useful to assist clinicians in identifying individuals at high risk of developing CKD.",medical,"Infectious Diseases, Pharmacology (medical)"

Three cellular steel configurations with different hole diameters and spacings were fabricated from the parent wide-flange hot-rolled steel shape. Eleven CECS columns using the cellular steel and four concrete-encased steel (CES) columns using the parent steel were tested to investigate the influence of the cellular steel configuration and the spacing between the closed stirrups. The test results of bare cellular steel columns showed that the failure was due to local buckling at the steel flanges and web at the hole section. The bare cellular columns exhibited the load-deformation relationship with less hardening behavior than the parent steel column. The proportional limit loads, yield loads, and maximum loads of all cellular steel columns were less than the parent column. The test results of composite columns showed that the CECS columns exhibited the failure mode, load-deformation relationship, and load-strain relationship similar to the CES parent columns. The weakening effect due to the circular openings was minimized by the concrete encasement. The compressive strength of CECS and CES columns increased as spacing of the closed stirrups decreased. A modified squash load equation is recommended for both CECS and CES composite short columns made with low-strength concrete, small amount of longitudinal rebars, and maximum stirrup spacing limit based on the ANSI/AISC360–16 specification.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Mechanics of Materials, Metals and Alloys"

The catechol-Fe3+ coordination bonds existing in marine mussel byssal cuticle provide a reversible crosslinking structure for reprocessable thermosets. A reprocessable polybenzoxazine thermoset (PBOZ-dopa45-Fe3+) by catechol-Fe3+ coordination bonds was synthesized successfully based on mussel-inspired chemistry and benzoxazine chemistry. Firstly, benzoxazine monomers containing carboxyl groups were synthesized. Secondly, polybenzoxazine with carboxyl groups was obtained through thermal ring-opening polymerization. And then catechol groups were grafted onto the pendant groups of polybenzoxazine. Finally, the reprocessable polybenzoxazine was obtained by catechol groups coordinating with Fe3+. The structure of polybenzoxazine was characterized by NMR, FTIR and SEC measurements. The formation of reversible crosslinked network composed of catechol-Fe3+ coordination bonds is confirmed by UV–Vis absorbances, system color changes, and dissolution states in methanol solutions of different pH. Reprocessing experiments indicate that the reversible catechol-Fe3+ coordination bonds endow remarkable reprocessability of cured resin. Dynamic mechanical measurements and thermogravimetric measurements show that the PBOZ-dopa45-Fe3+ can still maintain excellent thermal properties. Cross-linking by catechol-Fe3+ coordination bonds provides a new way for the preparation of reprocessable thermosets.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Crude proteins were extracted from horsegram seeds and were converted into thin films by casting approach. Amino acid analysis of the extracted protein confirmed the presence of both essential and non- essential amino acids required for food applications. However, the protein films have relatively weak mechanical properties and poor aqueous stability which can be substantially improved by crosslinking with a biocompatible crosslinker, catechol. Crosslinked films had strength of 7.32 MPa and were stable in water and cell culture media for upto 4 days suggesting their suitability for tissue engineering and other medical applications. The swelling % of the films was directly proportional to the amount of catechol used. The 20% catechol crosslinked films displayed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and E. coli in comparison to the uncrosslinked films. In addition to demonstrating good antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, the films were conducive to the growth of L929 mouse fibroblast cells, better than Zn @20 ppm. Overall, large availability, presence of essential amino acids, ability to develop films and other biomaterials with desired properties and cytocompatibility make horsegram proteins desirable for food, medical and other applications.","fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, Materials Science","Physics and Astronomy (all), Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

There is a substantial need for further research and development to identify and develop more efficacious agents/regimens in order to improve clinical outcomes of patients for whom the prognosis is unfavorable. Recently, mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, has been found to have anticancer activity against osteosarcoma in both in vitro and animal experiments, so that further investigation in humans is warranted. Methods: A total of 27 patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma will be enrolled into this phase II, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, two-stage clinical trial. The main objectives of this study are to determine the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in the patients. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 16 weeks; the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, overall response rate, safety parameters, pharmacokinetic parameters, biomarkers, pain score, and quality of life. Mycophenolate mofetil at the initial dose of 5 g/day or lower will be administered for 4 cycles (28 days/cycle) or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of mycophenolate mofetil may be reduced by 1-2 g/day or withheld for some Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicities whenever clinically needed. The duration of study participation is approximately 4-5 months, with a minimum of 12 study visits. If mycophenolate mofetil proves beneficial to some patients, as evidenced by stable disease or partial response at 16 weeks, administration of mycophenolate mofetil will continue in the extension period. Discussion: This trial is the first step in the translation of therapeutic potential of mycophenolate mofetil emerging from in vitro and animal studies into the clinical domain. It is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with high-grade locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma. The results will provide important information about whether or not mycophenolate mofetil is worth further development. Trial registration: This trial was prospectively registered on Thai Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: TCTR20190701001).

During the survey, 455 swab samples were collected from broilers, layers, backyard chickens and ducks from the MTN-LBM. Ninety-one pooled samples were screened for IAVs by real-time RT-PCR specific to the M gene. Positive pooled samples were individually retested for IAVs. In total, 2.63% of individual samples (12/455) were positive for IAVs. Out of 12 samples, seven samples from layer chickens and the environment were identified as IAV subtype H5N1. In this study, four IAVs were successfully isolated and further characterized by whole genome sequencing. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that the viruses were characterized as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV-H5N1) of clade 2.3.2.1c. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses showed that Myanmar HPAIV-H5N1 was closely related to HPAIV-H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1c isolated from China and Vietnam in 2014. Our results suggested that the live bird market in Myanmar represents a significant risk of HPAIV-H5N1 transmission in poultry and humans.

Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each NOAC in a Thai health care environment, a country with upper middle-income economies based on the World Bank's classification. Method: A lifetime Markov model was created from a Thai societal perspective. The model consisted of 19 health states separated into two cycles: event cycle and consequence cycle. The consequences of AF included in the model were ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, extracranial haemorrhage, and myocardial infarction. All NOACs available in Thailand (dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily; rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily; apixaban 5 mg twice daily; edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg once daily) were assessed using warfarin with an international normalised ratio of 2–3 as the reference. Inputs were a combination of published literature and local data when available. A willingness-to-pay of 160,000 Thai baht (THB)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold of being cost-effective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. Results: All NOACs were not cost-effective strategies for the Thai AF population. The ranking of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from lowest to highest were apixaban 5 mg twice daily (THB 692,136 or US$21,862) followed by edoxaban 60 mg once daily (THB 911,772 or US$28,799), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (THB 913,749 or US$28,861), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (THB 1,102,106 or US$34,811), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (THB 1,195,347 or US$37,756), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (THB 1,347,650 or US$42,566). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that apixaban had the highest potential to be a cost-effective strategy versus other NOACs. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that all NOACs were not cost-effective in the Thai AF population. Of the NOACs, apixaban may be the most likely to be cost-effective. These data may be useful for policymakers to perform a comprehensive evaluation of these agents for formulary decision and pricing negotiation.",medical,"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

A model for solving the construction site layout problem (CSLP) is proposed. A grid system is implemented to simulate sites and facilities more realistically. This model incorporates an algorithm that imitates and calculates the distances of typical travel paths of workers between a pair of facilities during construction operations. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimisation is adopted to solve the problem model. The prototype program was developed and tested on a real construction project case. The results show that the model was able to lay out the site efficiently and optimally.

For example, online advertising should be shown to the targeted users and the recommender system suggests appropriate videos to a user. Video view count prediction can help improve these recommendations because the video will be more interesting if it gets more view count. On YouTube, video view count and revenue are positively correlated. However, to correctly predict the view count of a video on YouTube, we divide problems into two issues. First, the view count has several patterns, which cause poor prediction. They should be grouped and trained specifically. Second, some patterns cause more errors in prediction because they are rare. Therefore, they should be separated to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we aim to design a model, which accurately predicts the short-term view count of videos on YouTube. We present F7NML (The First 7-day Normalization for clustering with Multivariate Linear model), a predictive model that can group the view count patterns and remove outliers. First, we grouped the patterns into many groups using the clustering model, which is presented in the paper. Then, we removed the groups of rare patterns, which are called outliers. Next, the video view count in the test dataset was matched to the groups using 1-nearest neighbor method. Finally, the Multivariate Linear model was trained for each group specifically. The experimental results show that F7NML with an appropriate clustering model could reduce error when it was compared to the best baseline model from the literature by about 27% on the 30th day view count prediction.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

It contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in cell wall peptidoglycans. The major menaquinones were MK-9 (H4) and MK-9 (H2). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0 and C16:0. The polar lipids profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxyl phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, and unidentified ninhydrin positive phosphoglycolipids. Strain CR1-09T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Microbispora tritici DSM 104650T (99.5%). Based on the polyphasic approach, DNA–DNA relatedness and average nucleotide identity (ANI), the strain is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microbispora, for which the name Microbispora catharanthi is proposed.

With one million cases every year, breast cancer is the fast-growing cancer type that has a high prevalence rate in young women. The limitations and undesirable side effects of conventional therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy on malignant tumors necessitate the development of alternative therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy has emerged as a promising approach to cure a variety of malignant cancer types which involves the delivery of functional gene directly into the target tumor tissue. Efficient gene therapy approach relies on the effective delivery of therapeutic genes to the desired cell type. In this regard, biological and non-biological gene delivery vectors are used to protect the naked foreign DNA to mediate effective tissue entry of the desired gene of interest. In this review, the use of bacterial and viral vectors for breast cancer gene therapy was summarized.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The aim of this work is to modify silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) with poly 2-(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA) brushes for template synthesis and immobilization of AgNPs using electron beam assisted grafting and reduction reactions. The PDMAEMA moieties were grafted onto vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) modified SiO2NPs using pre-irradiation and peroxidation grafting approaches. Several grafting parameters, i.e., pre-irradiation doses, DMAEMA monomer concentrations, reaction times and temperatures, were studied to optimize degree of grafting (DG). AgNPs were constructed on the SiO2NPs through the grafted PDMAEMA brushes as polymer shell template. AgNPs were successfully created on SiO2NPs-VTMS-PDMAEMA by electron-induced reduction reaction. DG of the PDMAEMA on SiO2NPs-VTMS was confirmed by gravimetric measurement, FTIR, TGA, TEM, FE-SEM. The nanostructure information and AgNPs immobilization were revealed by UV–Vis, TEM, SEM-EDX and XRD. The optimized grafting degree to obtain desirable appearance was 190%. The AgNPs (6 ± 2 nm) on SiO2NPs-VTMS-PDMAEMA exhibited the characteristic UV-vis absorbance of spherical Ag nanoarchitecture around 418 nm.

Pinostrobin suppresses the Ca2+-signal-dependent growth arrest in yeast by inhibiting the Swe1-mediated G2cell-cycle regulation,"Sopanaporn J., Suksawatamnuay S., Sardikin A., Lengwittaya R., Chavasiri W., Miyakawa T., Yompakdee C.",2020-05-21,"Calcium, Cell Cycle Proteins, Flavanones, G2 Phase, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Genes, Fungal, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Signal Transduction, Ca2+-signaling, G2cell-cycle regulation, pinostrobin, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Swe1, Wee1","Pinostrobin, a flavonoid compound known for its diverse pharmacological actions, including anti-leukemic and anti-inflammatory activities, has been repeatedly isolated by various screenings, but its action mechanism is still obscure. Previously, pinostrobin was rediscovered in our laboratory using a yeast-based assay procedure devised specifically for the inhibitory effect on the activated Ca2+ signaling that leads the cells to severe growth retardation in the G2 phase. Here, we attempted to identify target of pinostrobin employing the genetic techniques available in the yeast. Using various genetically engineered yeast strains in which the Ca2+-signaling cascade can be activated by the controlled expression of the various signaling molecules of the cascade, its target was narrowed down to Swe1, the cell-cycle regulatory protein kinase. The Swe1 kinase is situated at the downstream of the Ca2+-signaling cascade and downregulates the Cdc28/Clb complex by phosphorylating the Cdc28 moiety of the complex in the G2 phase. We further demonstrated that pinostrobin inhibits the protein kinase activity of Swe1 in vivo as estimated by the decreased level of Cdc28 phosphorylation at Tyr-19. Since the yeast SWE1 gene is an ortholog for the human WEE1 gene, our finding implied a potentiality of pinostrobin as the G2 checkpoint abrogator in cancer chemotherapy.",Immunology,"Microbiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

However, they can be gathered by a PEV aggregator and play a role in so called markets. On the other hand the PEV aggregators are to deal with the uncertainties that go along with these markets and can highly affect their profit. In order to cover these uncertainties scenario-based stochastic approach can be taken into to account to optimally schedule the PEV aggregators so that the maximum profit is obtained. The main contribution of this paper is to involve risk related uncertainties through the downside risk constraints (DRC) which results in risk-constrained stochastic optimization model. The main advantage of this method is that it can provide the owner of PEV aggregator with decisions that are made by considering various quantities for risk. CPLEX solver of GAMS software is employed to solve the problem which is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. To investigate the accomplishment of DRC, risk-averse state of model is compared to risk-neutral which in former one the profit is reduced meanwhile that risk-in-profit (RIP) is declined.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, engineering, energy","Geography, Planning and Development, Civil and Structural Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Transportation"

The degree of Lewis acid transformation on WO3/SiO2 was higher than on WO3/Al2O3 because the weaker interaction between WO3 and SiO2 showed higher hydrogen accessibility as revealed by the H2-TPR and H2-TPD results. Moreover, Pt co-catalyst with supported tungsten oxide catalyst could enhance hydrogen uptake on WO3 catalyst, leading to higher Lewis acid transformation. However, the investigation of surface WO3 structures were observed by XRD, FT-Raman, UV–vis, and TEM to be the key point for allowing the Lewis acid transformation. After Lewis acid transformation, isolated tetrahedral WO3 were stable whereas octahedral polytungstate and crystalline WO3 decreased, converting to W4+ and W5+. The decreasing of crystalline WO3 after Lewis acid transformation was also found to be correlated well with the hydrogen uptake. Therefore, Lewis acid transformation on supported WO3 preferentially occurred on crystalline WO3 than on octahedral polytungstate WO3 and isolated tetrahedral WO3, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Although it is common, effective agents and the standardized sebum level for seborrhea are not elucidated. Aims: To determine the efficacy of chitosan particles (CP) formulation on controlling sebum secretion, its extended effects on skin redness and texture after combining with proretinal nanoparticles (CP-PRN), and a correlation of the clinical grading with sebum levels that affect mental health. Patients/Methods: A four-week clinical trial with forty subjects was conducted. Subjects applied either CP formulation or CP-PRN during nighttime. Objective measurements including sebum levels, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin corneometry, skin redness, and texture were analyzed. Subjects completed a self-assessment clinical grading of skin oiliness at every visit. Results: Both CP and CP-PRN significantly decreased sebum levels (P ≤.01) at week 4 compared to baseline. CP also resulted in significant decreases in TEWL (P ≤.05) and skin corneometry (P ≤.05) throughout the study. A significant improvement in skin redness was observed with CP-PRN (P ≤.01). A moderate correlation between the clinical grading and sebum levels was detected (coefficient of 0.5, P ≤.001), with a sebum level of 106 μg cm-2 indicating emotional discomfort. One subject experienced local irritation with the CP-PRN. Mild pruritic symptoms were reported in both groups. Conclusions: Chitosan particles exhibited an interesting anti-sebum effect. It could be combined with PRN to extend benefits without losing the sebum controlling effect.

To date, no cross-national research studies have examined the psychometric properties of the frequently used Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) in depth. Method: Using data from 3,731 older adults from 10 national samples (Australia, Brazil, Canada, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, Thailand, and United States), this study used bifactor modeling to analyze the dimensionality of the GAI. We evaluated the ""fitness""of individual items based on the explained common variance for each item across all nations. In addition, a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was applied, testing for measurement invariance across the samples. Results: Across samples, the presence of a strong G factor provides support that a general factor is of primary importance, rather than subfactors. That is, the data support a primarily unidimensional representation of the GAI, still acknowledging the presence of multidimensional factors. A GAI score in one of the countries would be directly comparable to a GAI score in any of the other countries tested, perhaps with the exception of Singapore. Discussion: Although several items demonstrated relatively weak common variance with the general factor, the unidimensional structure remained strong even with these items retained.

We conducted a study to test the effects of increased serum bicarbonate level on muscle parameters, nutrition, and renal function in pre-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled study. CKD stage 3-4 patients with serum HCO<sub>3</sub>- <22 mEq/L were randomized to either receive oral sodium bicarbonate with high target bicarbonate level of 25 ± 1 or standard level of 22 ± 1 mEq/L as control group using protocol-based titration of dosage adjustment. The changes of muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength by hand grip dynamometer, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation, nutritional markers, and muscle-related biomarkers were determined. Data at baseline and after 4 months of sodium bicarbonate supplementation were compared between groups using Student t test or chi-square test as appropriate. Results: Forty-two patients completed the study (n = 21 per group). The mean age and eGFR were 61.2 ± 9.8 years and 32.4 ± 14.1 mL/min respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels at baseline were 21.0 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Baseline data including sex, diabetes, serum bicarbonate level, creatinine, and blood pressure were similar. After 4 months of treatment, the average serum bicarbonate levels in both groups were 24.0 ± 1.4 and 20.7 ± 2.3 mEq/L (p < 0.001). Both BIA-derived total-body muscle mass and appendicular lean balance were increased at 4 months in the higher bicarbonate group (26.0 ± 5.3 to 26.7 ± 5.5 kg, p = 0.04 and 19.8 ± 4.1 to 20.7 ± 4.4 kg, p = 0.06, respectively) despite comparable body weight and protein intake. Patients in the high bicarbonate group had a significant reduction of plasma myostatin levels, a surrogate of muscle degradation, at the study exit after adjusting for baseline values (-3,137.8; 95% CI -6,235.3 to -40.4 pg/mL, p= 0.04), but unaltered insulin-like growth factor-1 level, as the mediator of muscle cell growth, (141 [106-156] to 110 [87-144] ng/mL, p = 0.13) compared to the control group. Muscle strength, eGFR as well as serum prealbumin were not significantly different between 2 groups (p > 0.05). Neither worsening hypertension nor congestive heart failure was found throughout the study. Conclusion: Bicarbonate supplementation to achieve the serum level ∼24 mEq/L demonstrates better muscle mass preservation in patients with pre-dialysis CKD.

However, the association of OFD with other adjacent symptoms has not been explored. Objectives: To identify clinical characteristics of OFD and associated bulbar symptoms in MSA patients. Methods: In this blinded trial, video clips of 24 MSA patients were reviewed by two movement disorder neurologists who rated the presence of OFD. Analysis was performed to determine correlations between the presence of OFD and clinical demographics as well as associated bulbar symptoms. Results: There were 14 patients with MSA-P and 10 patients with MSA-C. OFD was identified in seven patients (29.16%) and MSA-P as the majority (85.71%). Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) was hardly ever identified in isolation with the most frequent combination being OMD with upper facial dystonia, blepharospasm and platysma dystonia. All OMD patients had the jaw-closing subtype. Mean onset of OFD was 1.7 (SD = 0.5) years after the first symptom onset and 1.1 years (SD = 0.4) after the introduction of levodopa. Patients with OFD used significantly higher levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) than those without (p = 0.02). There were moderate correlations between the presence of OFD and LEDD (r = 0.458, p = 0.02), and dysarthria (r = 0.639, p = 0.001) while a strong correlation was demonstrated between the presence of OFD and dysphagia (r = 0.9, p < 0.001). Conclusion: OFD is probably a manifestation of motor fluctuations in MSA and its presence is significantly associated with bulbar symptoms.

Methods: This study investigates associations of psychomotor retardation (PMR), clinical and biomarker characteristics of schizophrenia. We recruited 40 healthy controls and 79 schizophrenia patients and measured IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), IgM to malondialdehyde and nitroso (NO)-cysteinyl, CCL-11, an immune activation index based on cytokine levels, and motor screening task (MOT) scores. Results: PMR differentiated schizophrenia from controls and MNP from SNP. In addition, PMR was strongly associated with impairments in executive functions and episodic and semantic memory, psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative (PHEMN) symptoms. Around 50% of the variance in PMR was predicted by the cumulative effects of the immune activation index, CCL-11, TRYCATs, NO-Cysteinyl and natural IgM. PRM can reliably be combined with PHEMN symptoms, memory and executive impairments into one latent vector reflecting overall severity of schizophrenia. Conclusions: PMR is a key psychopathological feature of schizophrenia mainly MNP. In addition, PMR may be driven by deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system and increased production of neurotoxic immune products, namely TRYCATs, IgM to NO-cysteinyl, and CCL-11, an endogenous cognition deteriorating chemokine.","medical, neuroscience","Psychiatry and Mental Health, Biological Psychiatry"

Because of their high capacity for milk synthesis, dairy ruminants have been distributed throughout the world. In tropical areas, dairy animals face high ambient temperatures (HTa). The indirect effect of HTa on milk synthesis is mediated in part by a reduction in feed intake. The current experiment focused on the direct natural effect of HTa on mammary function. Multiparous Saanen goats were used in this study. The physiological responses for HTa were evaluated from the control period during the winter and from the natural HTa during the summer. Milk samples were collected for isolation of the goat milk cells to study the expression of the β-1,4 galactosyltransferase (β-GALT1), Akt, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes. Although goats in the summer maintained rectal temperature and plasma cortisol levels similar to those observed in the winter, the higher respiratory rate and lower feed intake and milk yield (MY) from the goats in the summer indicated that the goats in the summer were exposed to a higher degree of HTa. This was supported by the significantly higher level of plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Moreover, the relative expression levels of β-GALT1 and Akt were not different. The relative expression of HSP70 during the summer was significantly higher than what was observed in cells isolated in the winter. In conclusion, the HTa effect on MY during the summer was related to its indirect effect on feed intake. The direct HTa effect might be related to HSP70 gene expression in goat milk cells and to plasma GPX activity. However, the natural HTa did not affect the expression of Akt or β-GALT1.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Physiology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all), Developmental Biology"

Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the arteries on the glabellar and central forehead regions. The aim of this study was to correlate the topography and location of the arteries in this area with anatomical landmarks to propose a safety guideline. Two methods were used to investigate the glabellar and central forehead areas: dissection of 19 Thai embalmed cadavers, and ultrasonographic examination of 14 healthy Thai volunteers. At the level of the glabellar point, the horizontal distances from the midline to the arteries were 4.7 mm (central artery), 7.8 mm (paracentral artery), and 14.7 and 19.2 mm (superficial and deep branches of supratrochlear artery). The depths from the skin of the arteries were 3.1 mm (central artery), 4.8 mm (paracentral artery), and 4.2 and 5.9 mm (superficial and deep branches of supratrochlear artery). The periosteal artery was detected in 71.1% as a branch of either the superior orbitoglabellar or the supratrochlear artery.

First, the base case simulation was validated with the experimental data. Next, the 2k factorial experimental design and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to identify the significant main and interaction contact force modeling parameters. Four response variables were observed: the translation kinetic energy of particles, the rotational kinetic energy of particles, the bed expansion, and the standard deviation of pressure drop. Based on these results, the particle–particle friction coefficient, spring constant, and normal restitution coefficient were the major contact force modeling parameters that affected the system hydrodynamics in the spouted bed system. In addition, the effects of main and interaction contact force modeling parameters were summarized, which enhanced our knowledge of the modeling parameters on system hydrodynamics. Contact force modeling parameters must be carefully selected when simulating the spouted bed reactor or related gas-solid multiphase flow process, such as fluidized bed reactor.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
BoundWarden: Thread-enforced spatial memory safety through compile-time transformations,"Dhumbumroong S., Piromsopa K.",2020-10-15,"Buffer overflows, Compile time, Memory layout, Monitoring techniques, Multi-core processor, OLDEN benchmarks, Runtime overheads, Spatial memory, Bound checking thread, Buffer overflows, Compile-time transformation, Concurrent monitoring, Spatial memory safety","This paper presents BoundWarden, a novel spatial memory safety enforcement approach that utilizes a combination of compile-time transformation and runtime concurrent monitoring techniques. The compiler extension component of BoundWarden transparently instruments source code of C programs with the code that allows the runtime component of BoundWarden to comprehensively detect and prevent buffer overflow and other out-of-bound errors in buffers on the stack, heap, as well as BSS and data segments of memory. To reduce runtime overhead of bound checking, the runtime component of BoundWarden leverages the ubiquity of multi-core processors by offloading most of the work to a dedicated bound checking thread, which is responsible for performing bound checking and managing metadata. To preserve memory layout and maintain compatibility with existing libraries and binaries, BoundWarden stores the base and the bound of buffers in a separated dedicated bound table. Experiments showed that the prototype of BoundWarden is effective at enforcing spatial memory safety by successfully passing all 850 tests of RIPE test suite, and 94% of NIST's SARD test suite 89, while the results from the Olden benchmark suite showed that on average BoundWarden introduced roughly 1.85x overhead, compared to the uninstrumented code.","computer scienceuter software, data handling and applications, fluidex; related topics, computer science",Software

However, darkened skin from the localized or systemic accumulation of melanin is viewed in many cultures as an esthetic problem. Consequentially, searching for anti-melanogenic agents from natural sources is very popular worldwide. Previous screening of fermented rice products, obtained from various rice cultivars fermented with different sources of loog-pang (Thai traditional fermentation starter), revealed that the highest ability to reduce the melanin content in B16F10 melanoma cells was from unpolished black rice fermented with a defined starter mixture of microbes isolated from loog-pang E11. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the fermented unpolished black rice (FUBR) on the inhibition of melanogenesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. The strongest reduction of cellular melanin content was found in the FUBR sap (FUBRS). The melanin reduction activity was consistent with the significant decrease in the intracellular tyrosinase activity. The FUBRS showed no cytotoxic effect to B16F10 melanoma or Hs68 human fibroblast cell lines. It also significantly reduced the transcript and protein expression levels of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP-1), TYRP-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Furthermore, it induced a significantly increased level of phosphorylated ERK, p38 and Akt signaling pathways, which likely contributed to the negative regulation of melanogenesis. From these results, a model for the mechanism of FUBRS on melanogenesis inhibition was proposed. Moreover, these results strongly suggested that FUBRS possesses anti-melanogenesis activity with high potential for cosmeceutical application as a skin depigmenting agent.","biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Based on rainfall gauge data over 36 years (1981– 2016), a frequency analysis was performed for this basin to understand and evaluate its overall flood risk; daily rainfall measurements of 119 rain gauge stations within the basin were considered. Four common probability distributions, i.e., Log-Normal (LOG), Gumbel type-I (GUM), Pearson type-III (PE3), and Log-Pearson type-III (LP3) distributions, were used to calculate the return period of rainfall at each station and at the basin-scale level. Results of each distribution were compared with the graphical Gringorten method to analyze their performance; GUM was found to be the best-fitted distribution among the four. Thereafter, design hyetographs were developed by integrating the return period of rainfall based on three adopted methods at basin and subbasin scales; each method had its pros and cons for hydrological applications. Finally, utilizing a Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, we estimated the possible flood inundation extent and depth, which was outlined over the Chao Phraya River Basin using the design hyetographs with different return periods. This study can help enhance disaster resilience at industrial complexes in Thailand for sustainable growth.","water engineeringneering, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

For comparison purposes, the SSP supported Ni catalysts were also prepared by impregnation method (Ni/SSP (Imp)). All the prepared catalysts showed spherical shape with high specific surface area (357-868 m2/g). The X-ray diffraction and H2-temperature programmed reduction results revealed the stronger interaction between Ni and SiO2 in the form of nickel silicate for all the Ni-doped SSP catalysts except Ni/SSP (imp), in which only NiO species were detected. For the reaction temperature 350 ̊C, the CO2 conversion was in the order: Ni_Alt_Si (51%) > Ni1_Si2 (49%) > Si1_Ni2 (28%) > Ni/SSP (Imp) (10%) with methane selectivity 80–95%. The superior performances of the Ni_Alt_Si catalyst were correlated well to the higher electron density of Ni on the surface and higher CO2 adsorption ability as revealed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and CO2-temperature program desorption results.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

In this work, the uncertainties of upstream grid price, the demand of IPL, wind speed, solar irradiation and temperature are modeled via scenario approach based on stochastic programing. Furthermore, the downside risk constraints method (DRCM) is applied to consider risk related to uncertainties to get risk-involved stochastic performance of hydrogen storage based intelligent parking lots of electric vehicles. The proposed risk-based formulation is modeled using mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) which is implemented under GAMS software and solved via CPLEX solver. Two cases namely risk-averse and risk-neutral strategies are studied and compared to show the effects of DRCM implementation. The obtained results demonstrate the expected performance cost (EPC) of IPL is slowly raised while risk-in-cost (RIC) is significantly reduced due to model of risk related to uncertainties.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Imaging Enhancement in Angle-Domain Common-Image-Gathers Using the Connected-Component Labeling Method,"Thongsang P., Hu H., Zhou H.-W., Lau A.",2020-10-01,"Connected component labeling, Geological features, Laplacian filters, Migration sections, Migration velocity, Reverse time migrations, Seismic interpretation, Seismic resolution, angle-domain common-image-gathers, connected-component labeling (CCL), Seismic migration","The quality of seismic migration images strongly depends on accurate velocity models. However, migration velocity models often contain errors causing artifacts which degrade seismic resolution and fidelity. Here, we propose a method to enhance seismic migration images using processes in angle-domain common-image-gathers (ADCIGs), without requiring modification to the velocity model. The ADCIGs impacted from velocity errors show non-flat gathers and scattered noise. To enhance the imaging quality in ADCIGs, these problems need to be treated prior to stacking. Ideally, layers in ADCIGs should be flat without smearing amplitudes through all angles. Using this principle, we iteratively process one reflection at a time by isolating it into a local window and then flattening it. Also, we apply internal processing steps to enhance the signal. The algorithm for segregating a reflection, referred to as the connected-component labeling (CCL) method, is the primary method for extracting any feature that has a continuous form within the ADCIGs. Moreover, this method is insensitive to scattered noise so it is a suitable approach for classifying reflections or noise. To test the efficiency of this algorithm, we create ADCIGs containing relatively poor-quality images using an inaccurate migration velocity model. The primary objective of this test is to show how well the CCL method can select various forms of reflections in the presence of various levels of noise. The results show that the CCL method is capable of individually decomposing a reflection, which can facilitate processing in the internal workflow. Finally, we evaluate the quality of processed migration images by comparing our processed Poynting-vector reverse time migration (PVRTM) images with reverse time migration applied Laplacian filter and partial stacked PVRTM. These comparable migration images are benchmarked against a baseline synthetic reflector model. The essential improvements of our method are addressed by the migration sections, namely the removal of diffraction artifacts at both small and large scales and the improvement of phase coherency. The final stacked migration image produced with our methods shows clearer geological features that are capable of delivering a more reliable seismic interpretation.","fluidex; related topics, seismic theory, earth sciences","Geophysics, Geochemistry and Petrology"

Traditional methods suffer from poor performance in predicting missing values using simple techniques, e.g., mean and mode. In this paper, we present and discuss a novel method of imputing missing values semantically with the use of an ontology model. We make three new contributions to the field: first, an improvement in the efficiency of predicting missing data utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is applied to the numerical data cleansing problem, with the performance of PSO being enhanced using K-means to help determine the fitness value. Second, the incorporation of an ontology with PSO for the purpose of narrowing the search space, to make PSO provide greater accuracy in predicting numerical missing values while quickly converging on the answer. Third, the facilitation of a framework to substitute nominal data that are lost from the dataset using the relationships of concepts and a reasoning mechanism concerning the knowledge-based model. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method could estimate missing data more efficiently and with less chance of error than conventional methods, as measured by the root mean square error.","fluidex; related topics, Business, computer science, decision sciences","Management Information Systems, Software, Information Systems and Management, Artificial Intelligence"

Although academic research on remanufacturing has been increasingly conducted, the majority of prior research were conducted in the theme of best practices. A small number of studies started to address the demand for circular economy products as a challenge to the continuity of circular economy practices. Thus, this study focuses on the demand aspect of remanufacturing, especially in emerging economies where literature in this area of study is limited. This research was conducted with the objective to explore the key drivers to enhance consumer demand for remanufactured products, especially in emerging economy like Thailand, where socio-economic conditions are different from those in developed countries. Quantitative data collection method was employed with a survey of 200 vehicle owners in Bangkok. The extended theory of planned behavior was used as theoretical framework with the inclusion of marketing stimuli to analyze consumer behavior in purchasing remanufactured products. In addition, partial least square-structural equation modeling with the importance-performance map analysis was employed as the key statistical analysis technique. The findings indicate that attitude and subjective norm are positively correlated with consumers’ purchase intention toward remanufactured products. Product and price stimulating factors are also determined to significantly enhance consumers’ purchase intention with significant effect size via attitude. Results lead to practical implication that joint coordination between government agencies and industrial players is required for product and price improvement to enhance consumers’ purchase intention for remanufactured products in emerging economy.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; ecological and environmentalronmental Economicsomics, fluidex; related topics, environmental, Economics","Waste Management and Disposal, Economics and Econometrics"

Therefore, it is very important to prevent the phase transformation and stabilize the metastable structure. In this work, the first-principles calculations method based on density functional theory was used to explore the intrinsic mechanism of adding solute atoms to effectively control the phase transition proposed in the experimental research. Based on the determination of the optimal doping sites of atoms, the calculation of the diffusion energy barrier proves that the introduction of alloying elements does hinder the diffusion of atoms, thus effectively suppressing the phase transition process at the interface. From the perspective of Griffith work of fracture (G), the effects of alloying element and vacancy on the interfacial bonding strength were considered. There is the best strength effect while the alloying atom replaces the β′-Al site at the interface with VAl or without VAl, and among the four elements studied, the alloying effect of Nb is the best, and Cu is relatively poor. In addition, the calculation results of the Griffith work of fracture were explained by the electronic local function. The introduction of alloying element makes the change of the degree of electron localization of Al atoms nearby is an important reason for the interfacial bonding strength. The obtained results in the present work instructive for the interfacial strengthening mechanisms and it may serve as a design tool for Al–Zr alloys with desired properties.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The nanoemulsions were formulated by using 10% of rice bran oil (RBO) as an oil phase and either single emulsifier (1,3,5% sodium caseinate (SC) or 4,6,8% polysorbate 80 (P80)) or mixed emulsifiers (1,3,5% SC and 4,6,8% P80). The nanoemulsions were prepared by Microfluidizer® at 1,500 bar for five cycles and evaluated for droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, pH, and viscosity. Their physical stability was tested under heating-cooling cycles for six cycles. The results indicated that the nanoemulsions with SC (162.50-163.48 nm) had a larger droplet size than those with P80 (90.11-105.94 nm). The concentration of SC had no significant effect on the droplet size, whereas increasing the P80 concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the droplet size. For the formulations with mixed emulsifiers, an increase in the concentration of the second emulsifier leaded to a decrease in the droplet size. All nanoemulsions had narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.2), negative charge, neutral pH value, and low viscosity. The nanoemulsions with alone SC showed a larger negative charge value as compared to those with alone P80 and mixed emulsifiers. All formulations with a single emulsifier were physically stable under heating-cooling cycles for six cycles, whereas the nanoemulsions with mixed emulsifiers showed good stability for only those with the low SC concentration (1%). The rice bran oil O/W nanoemulsions obtained from this study could be developed as oral delivery systems for further applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The system has been characterised using a high-quality three-dimensional seismic survey tied to available exploration boreholes using regional two-dimensional seismic data. In this study area, two polygonal fault intervals are identified and analysed, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 coincides with the Tucker Cove Formation (Late Eocene) with small polygonal faults. Tier 2 is restricted to the Paleocene-to-Late Eocene interval with a great number of large faults. In map view, polygonal fault cells are outlined by a series of conjugate pairs of normal faults. The polygonal faults are demonstrated to be controlled by depositional facies, specifically offshore bathyal deposits characterised by fine-grained clays, marls and muds. Fault throw analysis is used to understand the propagation history of the polygonal faults in this area. Tier 1 and Tier 2 initiate at about Late Eocene and Early Eocene, respectively, based on their maximum fault throws. A set of three-dimensional fault throw images within Tier 2 shows that maximum fault throws of the inner polygonal fault cell occurs at the same age, while the outer polygonal fault cell exhibits maximum fault throws at shallower levels of different ages. The polygonal fault systems are believed to be related to the dewatering of sedimentary formation during the diagenesis process. Interpretation of the polygonal fault in this area is useful in assessing the migration pathway and seal ability of the Eocene mudstone sequence in the Great South Basin.","petroleum engineeringneering, earth sciences",Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)

The data analysis from 120 consumers presented the higher liking scores of the soups using the KLO film-0 and KLO film-6 on aroma, taste and overall preference than those using the instant Tom-Yum paste and the KL leaves. Additionally, chefs noted a longer lasting aroma intensity of the soups prepared with KLO films. Thus, this edible KLO film can be used in place of fresh KL leaves with the additional benefits of a long shelf-life, ease of use and better consumer preferences in Tom-Yum soup cooking.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, engineering","Food Science, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Tensile properties improvement by homogenized nitrogen solid solution strengthening of commercially pure titanium through powder metallurgy process,"Issariyapat A., Visuttipitukul P., Song T., Bahador A., Umeda J., Qian M., Kondoh K.",2020-12-01,"Commercially Pure titaniums, Micro-structural observations, Microstructural homogeneity, Powder metallurgy process, Solid solution strengthening, Strength and elongations, Strengthening and mechanisms, Ultimate tensile strength, Heat treatment, Interstitial solid solution, Nitrogen, Powder metallurgy, Pure titanium, Tensile properties","In this study, interstitial solid solution behavior of nitrogen atoms dissolved in commercially pure Ti fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) followed by the extrusion process was investigated. Microstructural observations of the extruded Ti-(N) samples before homogenization, ExTi-(N), revealed the nitrogen element's segregated regions as a result of a short time of the SPS process. Because of the inadequate sintering time, nitrogen atoms were unable to dissolve in the α-Ti matrix homogeneously, which caused a material degradation through brittle failure initiating at high nitrogen absorbed regions. Applying homogenization heat treatment at 1123 K for 180 min followed by hot extrusion, improved microstructural homogeneity without the nitrogen segregation. Furthermore, grain morphology was transformed from coarse elongated grains with substructures into refined equiaxed α-Ti grains. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the Ti-(N) sample with 0.69 wt%N reached maximum 957 MPa and 1117 MPa, respectively, which represented 148% and 214% increments over as-extruded pure Ti sample. In addition, a 50% enhancement of elongation of homogenized Ti-(N) alloys compared to the non-homogenizing condition was achieved. The improvement of strength and elongation was primarily attributed to grain refinement and solid solution strengthening. The quantitative evaluation of strengthening and mechanisms was discussed in detail by the Hall-Petch formula and Labusch model.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Thailand implemented tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination of pregnant women in 1977, which was replaced by tetanus–diphtheria toxoid (dT) vaccination in 2005. The tetanus–diphtheria–acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended for pregnant women at 27–36 weeks of gestation since 2012 in several countries. Data on antibody responses to diphtheria toxoid (DT), TT, and Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) induced by combined vaccines in children born to TT-vaccinated and/or Tdap-vaccinated mothers are limited. Material and methods: We investigated anti-DT, anti-TT, and anti-Hib IgG responses in a cohort of Thai children (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02408926) born to mothers who received a TT-containing and/or the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy. Children born to Tdap-vaccinated mothers were randomized to receive either a hexavalent (Infanrix-hexa) or pentavalent (Quinvaxem) vaccine, whereas children born to TT-vaccinated mothers received only Quinvaxem vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. IgG levels were evaluated at birth (cord blood), 2 (pre-primary), 7 (post-primary), 18 (pre-booster), and 19 months of age (post-booster) using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results: Seroprotective concentrations of anti-DT, anti-TT, and anti-Hib IgG were achieved in >90% and >99% of children following primary and booster vaccination, respectively. Among children born to Tdap-vaccinated mothers, the pentavalent vaccine induced higher levels of anti-Hib IgG than the hexavalent vaccine after primary and booster vaccination. Significantly higher anti-Hib IgG levels were observed among children receiving the pentavalent vaccine and who were born to TT-vaccinated mothers than among children receiving the pentavalent vaccine and born to Tdap-vaccinated mothers after primary and booster vaccination. Conclusions: Vaccination with a TT-containing and/or the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy did not compromise the seroprotection rate achieved following primary and booster immunization in individuals receiving either the pentavalent or hexavalent vaccine.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

As a result of phylogenetic analyses using COI, mtMutS, and 28S rDNA sequences of these two species, these three specimens constituted an independent small clade within a large mixed clade of Siphonogorgia and Chironephthya, with the two species slightly different from each other. The discrepancy in the morphology suggested the erection of a new genus to accommodate these species, however, as the subclade was included in a large mixed clade of Siphonogorgia and Chironephthya, we place these species within genus Chironephthya. Our results further highlight the continuing confusion between Siphonogorgia and Chironephthya, and demonstrate the need for taxonomic revision of these genera.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Animal Science and Zoology"

The aim of this study was to analyze pre- and post-LT outcomes and survival of patients having different overlap syndromes (OS) undergoing LT. Methods: Patients with compatible clinical and pathologic features of AIH-PBC (n = 86), AIH-PSC (n = 22), and AIH-SDPSC (n = 9) were included in the study. Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and survival data were analyzed. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine factors predicting transplant-free survival. Results: AIH-primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were less treatment-responsive and were more likely to undergo LT than other OS. No survival difference was noted among the 3 groups. Liver decompensation was independently associated with higher mortality (HR 21.78; 95% CI 2.50-190.01). Thirteen patients with OS underwent LT. One-year survival post-LT was 91.7%. Overall recurrence rate for OS post-LT was 8%. Conclusions: AIH-primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were more likely to require LT compared with patients having AIH-PBC. Transplant-free survival was similar among the three AIH-overlap syndromes. Allograft recurrence of OS occurred in about 10% of cases.

The root of Rn is used in Thai traditional medicine to treat snake bites, and the roots and/or leaves can be made into a balm and applied to the skin for the treatment of skin infections such as ringworm, or they may be brewed to form an infusion for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Rn leaves are available to the public for purchase in the form of “tea bags” as a natural herbal remedy for a long list of disorders, including diabetes, skin diseases (antifungal, ringworm, eczema, scurf, herpes), gastritis, raised blood pressure, improved blood circulation, early-stage tuberculosis antitumor activity, and as an antipyretic. There have been many studies investigating the roles of Rn or compounds isolated from the herb regarding diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and infection with bacteria, fungi or viruses. There have, however, been no clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of Rn in the treatment of any of these disorders, and the safety of these teas over long periods of consumption has never been tested.

Thai is particularly interesting as it has both syllabic and phonemic characteristics. Using the masked priming paradigm, we examined the functional unit that is initially activated when naming monosyllabic Thai words (Experiment 1) and pseudowords (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, the response times to the onset prime and identity (onset + vowel) conditions were not significantly different but were both significantly faster than the control prime (onset different). In Experiment 2, pseudowords were used so that the effects of orthographic vowel position could be examined. In Thai, vowels can precede the consonant in writing but phonologically follow it in speech (e.g., the written word ‘odg’ would be spoken as /dog/) whereas other vowels are spoken in the order that they are written. Similar results were found as in Experiment 1, as the identity prime did not have a greater facilitatory effect than the onset consonant prime. Notably, there were no orthographic effects due to orthographic vowel position. These results support the view that the onset is the initial functional unit that is activated when naming Thai visual words/pseudowords using the masked priming paradigm.","arts, psychology, sociology","Language and Linguistics, Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics and Language, Psychology (all)"

Both cellulose solution and activated carbon were prepared from sisal fiber. These films were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and X-ray Diffractometer (XRD). The specific surface area of activated carbon was found to be 1165 m2/g. The maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity of the ACC film reached 103.66 mg/g with the dye concentration of 100 mg/L, solution pH of 6.9, at 35○C for 24 h. The adsorption data suggested that the isotherm model for the equilibrium process was that of Langmuir model, and the adsorption kinetic was best described by pseudo-second-order model. The effect of initial dye concentration (20–100 mg/L), contact time (0–2,880 min), pH (3–11), and temperature (35–80○C) on adsorption capacity of ACC3 film were also examined. Thermodynamics studies of ACC3 film revealed that the adsorption process was endothermic, spontaneous, and feasible. Therefore, the activated carbon/cellulose composite films can be potentially used as biosorbents to remove dyes from contaminated water.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

Although green roof ecosystems (GREs) are able to provide ecosystem services, there is currently no assessment tool available to specifically evaluate this. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a rapid assessment checklist (RAC) to assess GRE services (GRES), which was developed and tested on 10 green roofs in Bangkok, Thailand. Results: The RAC consisted of 46 proxy indicators (33 qualitative and 13 quantitative indicators) encompassing various aspects of GRESs. The GRES values or scores varied according to structural differences in the green roofs. The average score (from a maximum of 100) of total ecosystem services was 61 ± 7, which could be inferred as a good performance in ecosystem service provision. The highest scores were obtained from the regulating services at 68 ± 7. The lowest average score was 53 ± 11 from the provisioning services. Conclusions: The RAC was able to evaluate the levels of GRES provided by the selected green roofs, enabling the meaningful comparison of their potential capability to provide GRES. Therefore, this RAC could be an innovative tool for evaluation of four categories of GRES.","ecology and ecosystems, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Ecology, Ecological Modeling"

It was found that the different immobilization methods or different fillers altered the properties of the obtained composites and also the catalytic activity of the polymerization systems. It was found that Cellulose/MAO provided the highest catalytic activity among all fillers due to a crown-alumoxane complex, which caused the heterogeneous system with this filler behaved similarly to the homogeneous system. The different fillers also produced the biocomposites with some different properties such as crystallinity which Cellulose/Zr provided the highest crystallinity compared with other fillers as observed by a thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC).

Dynamics of microbial diversity during processing and its contribution to the flavor of shrimp paste was investigated by next generation sequencing. Bacteria containing aminopeptidase genes were analyzed to present the possibility relating to taste-enhancing di- and tripeptide generation. Furthermore, this study showed the difference of microbial community structure in shrimp pastes collected from various regions in Thailand. The microbial diversity structure dramatically changed from the raw materials since the first step of processing. Salimicrobium spp. (53.6%) and Salinicoccus spp. (44.0%) were the major population; however, they were decreasing during processing. Alkalibacterium, Macrococcus caseolyticus, Jeotgalicoccus psychophillus, and Staphylococcus spp. became visible. M. caseolyticus and J. psychrophilus were detected as the first time in shrimp paste products. Then in one-month fermented sample, Lentibacillus spp. was 3.3%. Although, as per our experimentation (water activity, salt and pH), we could not observe any significant difference among different products. In two-month fermented sample, Lentibacillus spp. was solely the most abundant microorganism. From aminopeptidase genes analysis, the abundance of Salinococcus spp. during preparation and Lentibacillus spp. during fermentation may relate to good flavor quality of shrimp paste.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

The high extraction efficiency could be achieved at optimal parameter condition using 45 min of extraction time, 40 °C and 10 ml distilled water/mg butterfly pea. Liquid–solid ratio exhibited the highest contribution for anthocyanin and total phenolic content. A high temperature of ultrasonication resulted in a negative effect on antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. The findings from this study indicated that the UAE process optimization would be an efficient and sustainable method for the preparation of bioactive compounds from medical plants with saving of reaction time and cost in which extraction yields of antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were also increased.

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number of acupuncture therapy sessions, following which significant clinical improvement could be anticipated. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study in stroke patients who had received acupuncture therapy as an adjunct treatment at Trang Hospital—a non-academic provincial hospital in Southern Thailand—between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. Significant clinical improvement in activities of daily living (ADLs) was defined as an increase in the Barthel Index of ⩾10 points from baseline. Survival analysis techniques were applied to determine the optimal number of acupuncture therapy sessions. Results: Of 89 patients, 78% had a significant clinical improvement. Kaplan–Meier analysis estimated that 50% of the patients exhibited significant improvements by the eighth acupuncture therapy session. By the 16th session, the proportion of patients increased to 81%. Subgroup analyses revealed that the clinical improvement did not depend on baseline Barthel index, whereas early treatment (within 3 months of stroke onset) was associated with a faster response than late treatment. The median numbers of sessions required to achieve a significant improvement in the early and late treatment groups were 8 and 11, respectively. Conclusion: Stroke patients who were going to improve saw a significant improvement in Barthel index by the 16th acupuncture session and the marginal improvement declined substantially afterward. Our approach required minimal data available from the medical records of a non-academic facility, yet practical implication could be achieved.

Maltitol and lactitol have been extensively used in place of sucrose due to their capability to prevent dental caries. Herein, several molecular modeling approaches were applied to investigate the structural and energetic properties of these two polyols/hSTR complexes. Triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA)-based free energy calculations revealed that the TAS1R2 monomer is the preferential binding site for maltitol and lactitol rather than the TAS1R3 region. Several polar residues (D142, S144, Y215, D278, E302, R383, and especially N143) were involved in polyols binding through electrostatic attractions and H-bond formations. The molecular complexation process not only induced the stable form of ligands but also stimulated the conformational adaptation of the TAS1R2 monomer to become a close-packed structure through an induced-fit mechanism. Notably, the binding affinity of the maltitol/TAS1R2 complex (ΔGbind of -17.93 ± 1.49 kcal/mol) was significantly higher than that of the lactitol/TAS1R2 system (-8.53 ± 1.78 kcal/mol), in line with the experimental relative sweetness. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of the differences in the sweetness response between maltitol and lactitol, which could be helpful to design novel polyol derivatives with higher sweet taste perception.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Chemistry (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of specimen pooling for testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus, to determine whether costs and resource savings could be achieved without impacting the sensitivity of the testing. Ten previously tested nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were pooled for testing, containing either one or two known positive specimens of varying viral concentrations. Specimen pooling did not affect the sensitivity of detecting SARS-CoV-2 when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of original specimen was lower than 35. In specimens with low viral load (Ct > 35), 2 of 15 pools (13.3%) were false negative. Pooling specimens to test for Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection in low prevalence (≤1%) areas or in low risk populations can dramatically decrease the resource burden on laboratory operations by up to 80%. This paves the way for large-scale population screening, allowing for assured policy decisions by governmental bodies to ease lockdown restrictions in areas with a low incidence of infection, or with lower-risk populations.","Immunology, medical","Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Dynamic feedback control of day-to-day traffic disequilibrium process,"Zhong R.X., Cai H.X., Xu D.B., Chen C., Sumalee A., Pan T.L.",2020-05-01,"Convergence and stability, Dynamic feedback, Dynamic feedback controllers, Stability and convergence, Static traffic assignments, Steady-state analysis, Traffic dynamics, Traffic regulations, Demand and supply traffic regulation, Disequilibrium traffic dynamics, Dynamic feedback traffic control, Stability and convergence","In the literature, networks are usually assumed to operate at their steady states in static traffic assignment models. Given a set of demand management and supply regulation strategies, whether the vehicular traffic on a network would approach or not to a steady state under certain assumptions of behavioral realism is of importance and great interest in practice. Moreover, one primary reason for understanding the long-term traffic evolution dynamics is to control or influence the system trajectory in an efficient manner. To address these problems, we focus on a dynamic feedback control design and its subsequent steady-state analysis for a class of day-to-day (DTD) disequilibrium process so that the network traffic would evolve towards the desired stable traffic equilibrium. We propose an interconnected dynamic system framework for the stability and convergence analysis of DTD traffic adjustment process under the dynamic feedback control. Distinguished from the existing studies, we introduce a notion of output stability as well as the Lyapunov-like conditions to carry out the investigation noting that the steady states of the dynamic tolls that correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the traffic equilibrium problem can be non-unique. The proposed method gives rise to a new approach to selecting pricing strategy. The proposed method involves only two adjustment parameters with well-identified physical meanings while the requirement on adjustment parameters for convergence and stability is mild. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the insightful findings. It is found that, with dynamic feedback control, the network traffic state can converge to the desired equilibrium in a much faster manner than the case without control. The dynamic feedback controller can be implemented as demand management and supply regulation strategies such as road pricing and signal control.","fluidex; related topics, transport planning, engineering, sociology, computer science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Transportation, Computer Science Applications"

A designed wearable balance assistance device which consists of scissored-pair control moment gyroscopes and a two-axis inclination sensor is introduced to reduce fall risk from excessive sway among the elderly. The prototype has dimensions of H50cm × W44cm × D30cm and weighs 15.03 kg. This study aims to investigate the effects of generated torque of the prototype on human subjects and aims to determine if the two-axis inclination sensor can detect sway amplitude and sway direction during an occurrence of excessive sway. Two healthy male subjects participated in the study. According to the results, the detected body incline angle related to the acquired sway amplitude of COP trajectories with correlation factors of 0.92 and 0.88 for the two subjects. The detected sway angle related to the acquired sway direction of COP trajectories with the correlation factors of 0.99 and 0.98 for the two subjects. The maximum-allowable generated torque of the prototype with an assigned actuating angle varying within ±15.6° from the acquired sway direction of COP trajectories was able to drive the COP of 60-kilogram-weighted healthy subject maintaining balance at posterolateral limits of stability with an average body incline angle of 5.74° to pass his standing secure zone. The results indicate that the prototype has the potential of being a wearable balance assistance device which can reduce fall risk from excessive sway among the elderly; however, some improvements are still required in regards to shape, size, mass, generated torque, and strength.","biophysicsics, bioengineeringneering and medicalcal instrumentation, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, medical","Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Rehabilitation"

A simulation of random locations was initially performed to define the studied locations. The dynamic parameters, such as the soil index properties, shear modulus, and shear wave velocity, were determined from the subsurface modeling of Bangkok subsoils. Next-generation attenuation analysis was performed to define the input ground motion at each investigated site. Non-linear one-dimensional site response analysis was performed to investigate the surface ground motion, amplification factor, and spectral acceleration during short (0.2 s) and long (1 s) time periods. In general, it is important to consider the ground spatial variation in any seismic ground response analysis. The results show that Bangkok subsoils could magnify the seismic wave during an earthquake. For example, in the 2011 Tarlay earthquake, the magnification varied from two- to four-fold. The results from this study can be used to define the microzonation of the ground motion characteristic of Bangkok subsoils, such as the peak ground acceleration and the spectral acceleration, at short and long periods.",earth sciences,"Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

We use the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to decompose the source of changes of CO2 emission level and CO2 emission intensity of the sector for the period 2005–2017. The results show that during this period, on average the amount of CO2 emissions and the CO2 emission intensity increased annually. The structural change effect helped reduce both the amount of CO2 emissions and the emission intensity. However, the increased energy intensity of individual industries led to an increase in the amount of CO2 emission and CO2 emission intensity. The study thus calls for policies to reduce energy intensity of firms in the manufacturing sectors in order for Thailand to benefit from industrial growth without having to incur greater polluting emissions.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Thus, we used CBA in traditional clay ceramics that had the triple advantage of consuming troublesome waste, adsorbing volatile organics and being decorative indoors, replacing up to 40% by weight of clay with CBA and firing from 700 to 1300 °C. Clay and CBA mixtures were cast, cured at room temperature for 24 h and fired at several temperatures. Firing temperature impacted linear shrinkage, water absorption and fracture toughness, more strongly than CBA mixing proportion. Above 1000 °C, fracture toughness and water absorption resistance was enhanced but shrinkage increased. However, adding CBA lessened the contraction. SEM confirmed complete sintering as clay particles fused as a rigid solid above 1000 °C. X-ray diffraction patterns of ceramics containing CBA showed crystobalite and labradorite, in addition to quartz, due to flux materials in CBA. Leachability tests showed that the CBA ceramics were not ‘toxic’ on the USEPA TCLP regulatory list. Adsorption of gaseous toluene, a representative indoor pollutant, followed a Freundlich model: CBA made the adsorption sites more homogeneous, reduced the interaction mechanisms on the surfaces and thus the Freundlich exponent. Increased CBA increased toluene adsorption by 2–7 times.","mixing and separation, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

The datasets include twelve-years market data with generated technical indicators (73 time-series) and Thai economic news headlines from various online sources. The proposed model consists of a long-short term memory model and textual representations to predict one-day-ahead percentage market changes. We experiment on two textual representation approaches, which is the Hierarchical neural network and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) together with aggregated embedding. The three-year average experimental results show that adding textual representation increase profit of 6.9% on the proposed strategy-free metric. Next, the Hierarchical approach performs considerably better than the BERT method showing up to 4.4% profit increase. Finally, we demonstrate another advantage of the hierarchical approach for model interpretability using the integrated gradient attribution methods.

The HTL optimized parameters were obtained from response surface methodology (RSM). The Spirulina Platensis is blue-green algae were used to convert into bio-oil. The major processing method for bio-oil conversion was designed based on three key parameters, such as temperature, residence time and catalyst concentration. A remarkable enhancement of bio-oil production was observed for 0.20 g of CeO2 catalyzed HTL at 250 °C for 30 min, and around 26% of conversion was achieved which is higher than catalyst-free HTL reaction (16%). The synthetic CeO2 nanostructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), brunauer-emmett-teller surface area (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the functional group analysis was done using fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR). The obtained results clearly reveal that the major chemical constituents such as hydrocarbons (7.55%), amino acids (36.69%) and nitrogen compounds (21.58%) for the bio-oil increased during CeO2 catalyzed HTL reaction. This investigation depicts that, the CeO2 nanoparticle could be employed as a potential candidate to accelerate the bio-oil conversion through HTL at low temperature from Spirulina platensis.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

To corroborate the proposed control law, an FC boost converter (2.5-kW two-phase interleaved converter) is used and investigated in the laboratory. The methanol FC system is composed of a fuel reformer reactor that transforms water and methanol liquid fuel into hydrogen gas to a polymer electrolyte membrane FC stack (2.5 kW, 50 V).

Humans, domestic animals, and wild mammals are susceptible to infection. Etiological agents reside in the Order Mononegavirales, Family Rhabdoviridae, Genus Lyssavirus. This acute, progressive encephalitis causes the highest case fatality of any conventional infectious disease. Tens of millions of humans become exposed annually to the bites of infected mammals, predominantly in Asia and Africa. Despite the existence of effective vaccines and immune globulins, tens of thousands of people, typically children in the developing world, succumb. Areas covered: Concentrating upon both historical and major published references from the peer-reviewed literature over the past 5 years, we describe current biologics for rabies prevention, newly recommended principles for prophylaxis, and relevant future products in the developmental pipeline. Expert opinion: Modern human rabies biologics are pure, potent, safe, and efficacious, when used in a timely and appropriate manner. Few individuals survive after clinical signs. Anti-viral compounds are not licensed. Experimental therapy, while obviously desirable, is highly controversial. Education on bite prevention and integrated risk management are critical.

Effective management of hyperlipidaemia in such patients is essential. We aimed to document the use of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target achievement in patients hospitalised with an ACS in Thailand. Methods: The Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS) II was a multinational, observational study that enrolled patients over 18 years of age who were hospitalised with an ACS in 2013–2014 and survived until discharge. Patients were analysed according to whether or not they were treated with LLT prior to hospital admission. A lipid profile was carried forward from blood taken within the first 24 hours after admission, and attainment of the LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for very high-risk subjects was reported. Details of LLTs were collected. Lipid levels, LLT use and cardiovascular events since discharge were collected at a follow-up interview 4 months later. Results: A total of 320 ACS patients were enrolled from seven sites across Thailand, 188 (58.8%) of whom were being treated with LLT prior to the acute event. The mean LDL-C levels of the LLT and no LLT patients were 106.2 ± 39.4 mg/dL (2.75 ± 1.02 mmol/L) and 139.8 ± 46.6 mg/dL (3.62 ± 1.21), respectively, with 15.4% and 4.5% having an LDL-C level below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Lipid-lowering therapy consisted mainly of statins, with an atorvastatin-equivalent daily dosage of 17 ± 13 mg/day. At the 4-month follow-up, LDL-C target attainment remained low at 26.7% for the initial LLT group and 24.1% for the no LLT group. Although most patients were being treated with LLT at this point, the dosage was still low (28 ± 16 mg/day) and there was little use of combination therapy. Conclusion: In this cohort of Thai ACS patients, LDL-C levels were highly elevated, placing them at extreme risk of recurrent adverse cardiovascular events. Lipid-lowering therapy was widely used after the ACS; however, treatment was rarely optimised.

Formation of drug/cyclodextrin (drug/CD) inclusion complexes is a formulation technology that can be applied to enhance drug solubility in aqueous media. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CD complexation and pH adjustments on the ECN solubility. The ECN pH-solubility and ECN/CD phase-solubility profiles were determined. The solubility of ECN in aqueous acidic solutions containing α-cyclodextrin (αCD) was relatively high and much higher than in aqueous γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) solutions under same conditions. The complexation efficiency of the ECN/CD complex was relatively low for the unionized drug. Formation of ECN/CD inclusion complex was verified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Formation of ECN/CD complexes enhanced the drug stability during autoclaving. γCD complexes self-assembled to form nano- and microparticles whereas αCD complexes had negligible tendency to self-assemble. Formation of CD complex nano- and microparticles was investigated by dynamic light scattering and by drug permeation through semipermeable membranes of different molecular weight cut-off. The largest aggregate fraction was observed for the unionized ECN in aqueous pH 7.5 solution containing high CD concentration, that is 10% (w/v) CD. It was shown that in acidic solutions ECN/αCD can enhance the antifungal activity to filamentous fungi. This was associated with the increased ECN solubility and increase of readily available ECN molecules in aqueous αCD solutions.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

Although various adverse changes in cardiac contractile function following loss of female sex hormones have been reported, a clear mechanism of action has never been characterized. In order to examine whether an elevation in oxidative stress is a major cause of cardiac contractile dysfunction after female sex hormone deprivation, cardiac functions of ovariectomized rats with and without supplementation of superoxide scavenger tempol were compared to those of sham-operated controls. Chronic deprivation of female sex hormones reduced total oxidative capacity and increased plasma carbonyl protein content. Tempol supplementation of ovariectomized rats significantly ameliorated plasma oxidative stress status. Echocardiography demonstrated a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction in ovariectomized rats, which was completely prevented by tempol supplementation. Decreased myocardial contractility occurs with reduced maximum myofilament force of contraction and amplitude of transient intracellular Ca2+ concentration, both phenomena completely attenuated by tempol supplementation. However, tempol only partially prevented shift of heart myosin heavy chain from dominant α-to β-isoform of ovariectomized rats. Immunoblot analysis of protein carbonylation indicated that tempol supplementation significantly reduced the level of cardiac myofibrillar proteins oxidation increased in ovariectomized rat heart. Taken together, the results indicate changes of cardiac contractile machinery following loss of female sex hormones were, in part, due to an increase in oxidative stress, and antioxidant supplementation could be considered another potential prevention measure in postmenopausal women.","genergyal, biochemistryistry, medical","Biochemistry, Physiology (medical)"

Thermal stability of AS through heating process was determined and found that It could withstand by heating through sonication method. Phase-solubility profiles showed that β-cyclodextrin (βCD) exhibited the greatest solubilizing effect but sulfobutylether-βCD (SBEβCD) was selected for further investigations due to its relatively high complexation efficiency (CE) value. The effect of polymers that were poloxamer 407 (P407) and chitosan (CS) on CD solubilization were investigated. It was found that the increment of CE was resulted from the formation of ternary complexes or complex aggregates with confirmed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) data indicated that the cyclohexane moiety of AS was totally inserted into the hydrophobic inner cavity of SBEβCD in the presence or absence of polymer. The molecular modeling study displayed the binding orientation of such complex which correlated to 1H NMR result. The solid state characterized by Fourier transform infra-red, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction demonstrated the formation of binary AS/SBEβCD and ternary AS/SBEβCD/polymer inclusion complexes.

Subgenus Mundinia, established in 2016, is geographically widely dispersed, its distribution covers all continents, except Antarctica. It consists of 5 species; L. enriettii and L. macropodum are parasites of wild mammals while L. martiniquensis, L. orientalis and an unnamed Leishmania sp. from Ghana are infectious to humans. There is very little information on natural reservoir hosts and vectors for any Mundinia species. Methods: Experimental infections of guinea pigs with all five Mundinia species were performed. Animals were injected intradermally with 107 culture-derived promastigotes into both ear pinnae. The courses of infections were monitored weekly; xenodiagnoses were performed at weeks 4 and 8 post-infection using Lutzomyia migonei. The distribution of parasites in different tissues was determined post-mortem by conventional PCR. Results: No significant differences in weight were observed between infected animals and the control group. Animals infected with L. enriettii developed temporary lesions at the site of inoculation and were infectious to Lu. migonei in xenodiagnoses. Animals infected with L. martiniquensis and L. orientalis developed temporary erythema and dry lesions at the site of inoculation, respectively, but were not infectious to sand flies. Guinea pigs infected by L. macropodum and Leishmania sp. from Ghana showed no signs of infection during experiments, were not infectious to sand flies and leishmanial DNA was not detected in their tissue samples at the end of experiments at week 12 post-inoculation. Conclusions: According to our results, guinea pigs are not an appropriate model organism for studying Mundinia species other than L. enriettii. We suggest that for better understanding of L. (Mundinia) biology it is necessary to focus on other model organisms.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

Methods: This study is supported and endorsed by the Asia Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology. Due to the inability to have face to face discussions during the pandemic, an online survey was performed by inviting key opinion leaders (cardiac surgeon/interventional cardiologist/echocardiologist) in the field of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in Asia to participate. The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from a mean of 4.4 to 4 days. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services to patients in Asia. This expert recommendation on best practices may be a useful guide to help TAVI teams during this period until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available.",medical,"Surgery, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

Despite growing urban green areas, only a few studies have quantified A of urban trees and assessed their dynamical changes with varying atmospheric conditions. Hence, we investigated A in nine dominant tree species in a new park of Bangkok. Results: Results revealed that A of two tree species (Millingtonia hortensis and Afzelia xylocarpa) significantly increased with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) until it reached a maximum and declined when VPD decreased, with no seasonal difference. Five of them (Dalbergia cochinchinensis, Tabebuia rosea, Lagerstroemia floribunda, Dipterocarpus alatus and Bauhinia purpurea) exhibited different response patterns of A to VPD between wet and dry seasons. In contrast, the A of two tree species (Samanea saman and Homalium tomentosum) did not respond to changing VPD in either season. Conclusions: Comparing planting scenarios of insensitive (i.e. no response to VPD) versus sensitive (i.e. significant response to VPD) species, we found that planting a mixture of sensitive and insensitive tree species would improve the park's capacity of A across seasons, allowing climate change adaptation to adverse environmental impacts such as droughts and the urban heat island effects, and would increase biodiversity. Additionally, planting insensitive tree species would significantly increase the capacity of the park for CO2 mitigation. These findings are useful for those who design parks and expand urban green areas to fully benefit ecosystem services from trees.","plant ecology; production and nutrients, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Environmental Science (all)"

Six electronic databases were searched for suitable original articles investigating immune biomarkers in FMS in comparison to HC. We extracted outcomes and variables of interest, such as mean and SD of peripheral blood immune biomarkers, age or sex. A random-effects model with restricted maximum-likelihood estimator was used to compute effect sizes (standardized mean difference and 95% CI, Hedges’ g) and meta-analysis, group meta-analysis and meta-regressions were conducted. Forty-three papers were included in this systematic review, of which 29 were suitable for meta-analysis. Interleukin (IL)-6 (g = 0.36 (0.09–0.63); I2 = 85.94; p = 0.01), IL-4 (g = 0.50 (0.03–0.98); I2 = 81.87; p = 0.04), and IL-17A (g = 0.53 (0.00–1.06); I2 = 87.15; p = 0.05), were significantly higher in FMS compared to HC while also combinations of cytokines into relevant phenotypes were significantly upregulated including M1 macrophage (g = 0.23 (0.03–0.43); I2 = 77.62; p = 0.02), and immune-regulatory (g = 0.40 (0.09–0.72); I2 = 84.81; p = 0.01) phenotypes. Heterogeneity levels were very high and subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that many covariates explained part of the heterogeneity including medication washout, sex, time of blood sampling and exclusion of patients with major depressive disorder. In conclusion, FMS is accompanied by a disbalance between upregulated pro-inflammatory (M1 and Th-17) and immune-regulatory cytokines although effect sizes are small-to-moderate. Based on our results we provide specific methodological suggestions for future research, which should assess Th-1, Th-17, chemokines, and Th-2 phenotypes while controlling for possible confounding variables specified in this study.","Immunology, neuroscience","Immunology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Behavioral Neuroscience"

Its incidence is highest in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand. Mucinous intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (mucinous iCCA), characterized by an abundant extracellular mucin pool accounting for at least 50% of total tumor volume, is an extremely rare variant of such malignancy and is notorious for rapid progression and dismal prognosis. We conducted an 11-year retrospective analysis of resected mucinous iCCAs from our institution with a systematic review on mucinous iCCAs and combined hepatocellular-mucinous cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-mCCA). There were four resected mucinous iCCA specimens at our institution (prevalence = 0.5%). Most of the patients were male. The clinicopathological characteristics were variable. The diagnosis of mucinous iCCAs could not be rendered without pathological evaluation. Either intraductal papillary neoplasm or biliary intraepithelial neoplasia was present in three out of four cases. One patient passed away at 11 months following liver resection. A total of 19 mucinous iCCAs and four cHCC-mCCAs from previously published literature were analyzed. The 1-year mortality rate of mucinous iCCAs from our series and published literature is 35%. The present study confirmed that mucinous iCCA is an exceedingly uncommon variant of iCCA.

The main question is "" What are the economic impacts of IUU-fishing and government's countermeasures on Thai fishing communities, in particular small scale fishermen's households, before and after 2015?"". A mixed quantitative and qualitative approach was chosen to better grasp the complexity of fishing- related changes to household income, by looking into the case study of a small scale fishing community in Ao Noi Subdistrict of Prachuap Kiri Khan Province. The main results show the since the enforcement of the new regulation in 2014/2015, the fishermen have felt some improvement through the regrowth of fish stock and the enforcement of stricter regulation for commercial vessels. The income situation has, after initial gains, seen some losses in 2016, mainly due to higher costs or investments. The results provide data for future research on the economic situation of small scale fishermen. This approach might be useful as a template to be applied to other small scale fishing communities in Thailand or elsewhere. The limitations of this work are given by the sample size and the selected target community.","sociologyal sciences, fluidex; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

In this work, SMPs that could be actuated by an NIR light without using any NIR photothermal filler was introduced for the first time. Benzoxazine/epoxy (V-fa/ECO) copolymers with a shape memory property were synthesized from bio-based raw materials, which were vanillin, furfurylamine, paraformaldehyde, and epoxidized castor oil. The glass transition temperature of the copolymers could be tuned from 144 to 14 °C, by increasing the ECO content from 40 to 60% by weight. The V-fa/ECO copolymers were found to exhibit a shape memory property that could be remotely actuated by an NIR laser with a wavelength of 808 nm. A high recovery ratio of 100% within a 30 s of NIR irradiation was achieved when the percent weight of ECO in the copolymers was at least 50. We found that the shape memory property of V-fa/ECO copolymers was due to their photothermal effect in the NIR region that could induce the shape recovery process. The temperature of V-fa/ECO copolymers rose from room temperature to 100 °C within a 30 s of NIR irradiation (laser power density of 2.5 W/cm2). It was proposed that the π-conjugation in benzene rings of copolymers might play role on their NIR photothermal effect, due to the π-π interactions between polymer chains. The findings of this study suggested a new way to produce NIR light responsive SMPs without using any NIR photothemal filler.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Ti2N compound layers were formed at the Ti-(N) powder surface as a shell, and solid solution nitrogen elements were also detected in the matrix of this powder. Ti-(N) powder was consolidated by spark plasma sintering (SPS), where Ti2N compounds were completely decomposed, and hot extrusion was then used to fabricate fully dense titanium with solid solution nitrogen elements. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the lattice constant of α-Ti along the c-axis clearly increased in proportion to the nitrogen content due to the nitrogen solid solution behavior. Tensile test results revealed that the powder metallurgy titanium with 0.52 mass% nitrogen exhibited a 0.2% yield stress of 813 MPa and 31% elongation, which were remarkably superior to the strength-ductility balance of pure titanium with a 0.2% yield stress of 305 MPa and 25% elongation. In this study, the Hall-Petch equation and Labusch model were used to quantitatively evaluate the mechanism for the α-Ti grain refinement and solid solution strengthening effects of Ti-(N) powder metallurgy materials.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In this study, we conducted swine influenza surveillance in pig farms in the Yangon and Bago regions, Myanmar, during 2017–2019. Nasal swabs (n = 500) were collected from pigs in 10 swine farms. Our results showed that 11 out of 100 pooled samples (11%) were positive for influenza A virus (IAV) by real-time RT-PCR. Five SIVs could be isolated and could be subtyped as SIV-H1N1 (n = 4) or SIV-H3N2 (n = 1). The viruses were further characterized by whole-genome sequencing and classified as pdmH1N1-2009 (n = 3), reassortant H1N1 (n = 1) or reassortant H3N2 (n = 1). Phylogenetic analysis of Myanmar SIVs showed that all genes of the three SIV-H1N1 (pdmH1N1-2009) were clustered with viruses of the pdm/09 lineage. For one SIV-H1N1 (rH1N1), the HA1 gene was clustered with those of endemic SIVs of the classical swine lineage, and seven genes were clustered with those of viruses of the pdm/09 lineage. For SIV-H3N2 (rH3N2), the HA3 and NA2 genes were clustered with those of endemic SIVs of the human-like swine lineage, while six internal genes were clustered with those of viruses of the pdm/09 lineage. Genetic analysis indicated that all the Myanmar SIVs possessed amino acids that favour binding to the human receptor. All the Myanmar SIVs contained amino acids related to amantadine resistance but not oseltamivir resistance. Notably, the pdmH1N1-2009 virus might have been circulating in the Myanmar pig population for a period of time after pdmH1N1-2009 outbreaks in humans. Then, reassortment between endemic SIV-H1N1 or SIV-H3N2 and pdmH1N1-2009 in pig farms in Myanmar could have occurred. Our findings ascertained the genetic diversity of SIVs, especially pdmH1N1-2009, in the pig population in Myanmar, with zoonotic and reverse zoonotic potentials.","Immunology, Veterinary Science","Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all)"

In this study, we developed a hybrid system to produce hydrogen, whereby the highly efficient light-harvesting inorganic semiconductor (TiO2) was mixed with Escherichia coli to form a biocatalyst with the addition of an electron mediator (MV2+) under different visible light irradiation. Under this hybrid system, the hydrogen production by E. coli was light intensity-dependent showing maximum production at 2000 W m−2, with a 2-fold increase in the hydrogen production compared to that without TiO2. The experiments on the continued cycle of hydrogen production revealed that the production could be continued for at least 3 cycles of 5 h incubation for each. A possible pathway utilizing glucose for hydrogen production by the hybrid system was proposed based on the analysis of the levels of metabolites. A feasibility study was also conducted using natural sunlight for hydrogen production by the hybrid system. Overall results demonstrated that whole cells of E. coli could be employed for photocatalytic hydrogen production where the intactness of the E. coli was retained under experimental conditions.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Fault gouges in the shear zone are mainly composed of kaolinite, illite-mica, and illite-smectite and exhibit weak preferred orientation, ranging from 1.2 to 2.3 m.r.d. These fault cores are characterized by high localized strain and intense deformation due to cataclasis and frictional granular flow mechanisms, which produce transgranular fractures, rounded quartz grains, and an ultrafine clay matrix. In contrast, wall rocks show stronger clay preferred orientation, up to 3.9 m.r.d., despite having less clay content than the fault gouges. Much larger fault-related bent and sheared clay grains are present in the wall rocks, suggesting less severe deformation. The discrepancy between fault cores and wall rocks indicate that the development of fabrics is related to faulting and authigenic processes. Weak fabrics in the slip zone are attributed to the comminution of grains and neomineralization, allowing clay platelets to grow and rotate in many directions. In addition, the abundance of metal oxides indicates extensive, multiple fluid alteration processes, which further influence microstructures and fault properties.","fluidex; related topics, regional structure and tectonics, earth sciences",Geology

In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of CurDG were evaluated. The effects of CurDG on inflammatory mediators were evaluated in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. CurDG reduced the increased levels of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as iNOS and COX-2 expression in cells to a greater extent than those of curcumin, along with the potent inhibition of MAPK (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38) activity. The anti-inflammatory effects were assessed in vivo by employing a carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema model. Oral administration of CurDG demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in a dose-dependent manner in mice. The effects were significantly higher compared to those of curcumin at the corresponding doses (p < 0.05). Moreover, 25 mg/kg curcumin did not exert a significant anti-inflammatory effect for the overall time course as indicated by the area under the curve data, while the equimolar dose of CurDG produced significant anti-inflammatory effects comparable with 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg curcumin (p < 0.05). Similarly, CurDG significantly reduced the proinflammatory cytokine expression in paw edema tissues compared to curcumin (p < 0.05).

The downstream signalling of the innate immune responses against pathogen molecules, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), and the adaptive immune response to antibodies, Fc gamma receptor (FcgR), is spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Because pathogen molecules and antibodies could be presented in lupus, impact of Syk and macrophages in lupus is explored. FcgR-IIb deficient (FcgRIIb-/-) mice, a model of inhibitory signalling loss, at 40 weeks old, but not pristane mice (a chemical induction lupus model) demonstrated spontaneous elevation of LPS and BG in serum from gut translocation despite the similarity in faecal microbiome analysis. Syk abundance in FcgRIIb–/– mice was higher than in pristane mice, possibly due to several Syk activators (anti-dsDNA, LPS and BG), and Syk inhibitor–attenuated proteinuria and serum cytokines only in FcgRIIb–/– mice. In addition, LPS + BG enhanced the expression of activating FcgRs, NF-κB and Syk, together with supernatant TNF-α predominantly in FcgRIIb–/– compared to wild-type macrophages. The inhibitors against Dectin-1, Syk and nuclear factor kappa B, but not anti-Raf-1, reduced supernatant TNF-α in LPS+BG-activated macrophages, implying Syk-dependent signalling. The pathogen molecules enhanced activating-FcgRs, without inhibition, through Syk, a shared downstream innate and adaptive signalling, is responsible for the hyper-responsiveness in FcgRIIb–/– macrophages.

Taxonomic composition of donor intestinal microbiota may influence the efficacy of FMT in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections and UC. FMT not only alters bacteria composition but also establishes trans-kingdom equilibrium between gut fungi, viruses and bacteria to promote the recovery of microbial homeostasis. FMT is not a one size fits all and studies are required to identify microbial components that have specific effects in patients with different diseases. Conclusion FMT requires optimisation before their therapeutic promise can be evaluated for different diseases. This summary will guide future directions and priorities in advancement of the science and practice of FMT.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; transplantation Immunologynology; transplantation, medical",Gastroenterology
Higher platelet distribution width is associated with unfavorable prognosis in ovarian cancer,"Qin L., Li J.-Y., Huang W.-J., Zhang M.-L., Wang R.-T., Shen W.",2020-01-01,"Adult, Aged, Blood Platelets, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Male, Middle Aged, Ovarian Neoplasms, Platelet Activation, Prognosis, Progression-Free Survival, Retrospective Studies, ROC Curve, Young Adult, Ovarian cancer, platelet distribution width, prognosis","BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most malignant gynecological cancers. Platelets play a profound role in cancer growth and metastasis. Platelet distribution width (PDW) is an indicator of platelet activation and is altered in malignancies. However, the prognostic value of PDW in OC remains unclear. This present study aimed to investigate the predictive significance of PDW in OC. METHODS: 221 OC patients, between January 2013 and December 2013, were included in this study. The correlations between PDW and clinicopathological features were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of PDW. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients, increased PDW levels were observed in 163 (73.6%) patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that higher PDW levels were associated with poor progression-free survival and overall survival (both p< 0.001). Cox-regression analysis confirmed the independent predictive value of PDW on overall survival (HR = 2.820, 95% CI = 1.776-4.476, p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Higher PDW levels predict poor prognosis in patients with OC. Elevated PDW may be a novel target for therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Genetics, Cancer Research"
Combining angiodysplasia classification and segmentation on capsule endoscopy images using attentional albunet,"Gobpradit S., Vateekul P.",2020-07-17,"Capsule endoscopy image, Improve performance, Joint modeling, Learning approach, Lesion image, Loss calculation, Segmentation models, Wireless capsule endoscopy, Angiodysplasia, classification, deep learning, segmentation","Wireless capsule endoscopy is a useful method for physicians to retrieve images in gastro patients trying to segment bleeding or lesion areas called ""angiodysplasia"". There were prior successes of the deep learning approach that solely focused on the lesion images. However, most frames in endoscopy videos are non-lesions. Thus, they incorrectly segmented angiodysplasia in non-lesion images. In this paper, we introduce a method to take a classification of lesion/non-lesion images into consideration of the segmentation framework. We propose to combine classification and segmentation using two approaches: (i) cascading model and (ii) joint model with various joint loss calculations. Also, the segmentation model is employed from the winner of our previous work called ""Attentional AlbuNet"". The experiment was conducted on two angiodysplasia datasets from MICCAI 2017 and 2018. The results show that our joint model outperforms the traditional segmentation model. It can improve performance in both classification and segmentation tasks. For the classification, it can almost perfectly classify lesion images from non-lesion images. For the segmentation task, it achieves dice of 92.16% and 71.54% on MICCAI 2017 and 2018 datasets, consecutively.","medicalcine and pharmacologymacology, fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Future cities are expected to be smart and billions of devices will be connected forming a network. The emergence of the Internet of Things proffers to link sensors enabled digital devices with the internet thus offering new services in the context of smart cities. In this regard, it is crucial for the internet service providers (ISPs) to observe/monitor their end-to-end network performance and identify any possible service degradation(s) as the goal of smart cities can only be realized through good quality internet. In this paper, we demonstrate our hardware-software co-designed quality of experience (QoE) management solution for ISPs. Our system is capable of monitoring and reporting the web, video, VoIP, IPTV, and WiFi QoE at various network levels. We experimentally tested our solution at appropriate network locations and demonstrated QoE and latency results for one of the leading ISP of South Asia. Our solution enables the ISPs to remotely monitor the quality of their network and identify any issue(s) which can lower the customer's QoE. As the internet is the backbone of smart cities, we believe our proposed solution for QoE will help expedite the smart cities’ infrastructure and solutions.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology, energy","Civil and Structural Engineering, Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Transportation"

The endeavors have been even more striking with the recent inception of deep learning. Deep learning has a well-known strength in its accuracy and effectiveness but with the main drawback of very long converging time during deep learning network training. Moreover, current state-of-the-art denoising techniques still lack the edge feature, one of the crucial attributes for sharp images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional neural network with Edge Feature (DCEF) for denoising Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). However, as the deep learning model training takes too much time to converge, we also propose an adaptive learning rate using a triangle technique that allows much faster converging time comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. Our DCEF demonstrates that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of average PSNR scores in = 15 and 25 by 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, while achieving high MS-SSIM scores and using much fewer iterations to converge.","information and communication theory, fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

The present article reviews a) novel drug targets that should be targeted to slow PD progression, and b) clinical and experimental research data reporting new treatments targeting immune-inflammatory and oxidative pathways. A systematic search was performed based on the major databases, i.e., ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PubMed, CABI Direct databases, and Scopus, on relevant studies performed from 1900 to 2020. This review considers the crucial roles of mitochondria and immune-inflammatory and oxidative pathways in the pathophysiology of PD. High levels of oxidative stress in the substantia nigra, as well as modifications in glutathione regulation, contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, with a decline in complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain reported in PD patients. Many papers suggest that targeting antioxidative systems is a crucial aspect of preventive and protective therapies, even justifying the utilization of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) supplementation to fortify the protection afforded by intracellular glutathione. Dietary recommended panels including ketogenetic diet, muscular exercise, nutraceutical supplementation including NAC, glutathione, nicotine, caffeine, melatonin, niacin, and butyrate, besides to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and memantine treatment are important aspects of PD therapy. The integration of neuro-immune, antioxidant, and nutritional approaches to treatment should afford better neuroprotection, including by attenuating neuroinflammation, nitro-oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegenerative processes. Future research should clarify the efficacy, and interactions, of nicotine receptor agonists, gut microbiome-derived butyrate, melatonin, and NSAIDs in the treatment of PD.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

This problem is solved by introduction of the complex inductance concept by which the saliency is parametrized in terms of the current angle. From the circle diagram of the complex inductance, the vector diagram of the motor can then be drawn, and machine behaviors can be graphically visualized and investigated. The proposed equivalent circuit is further modified to include the magnetic cross coupling and core loss. The complex inductance concept can be extended to other types of machines with saliency such as IPMSMs.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Control and Optimization"

The dimension and morphology evolutions of InSb/InAs quantum nanostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy with respect to the number of InSb monolayers (MLs) are investigated. The formation of the quantum nanostructures is dominated by lateral growth, in which the morphology is further elongated as the number of MLs is increased. Such an anisotropic growth is explained by the difference in the surface energy along each direction, which corresponds to different atomic arrangements in the crystalline structure of InSb. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic images show a reduction in the lateral dimension and an increase in the height of the embedded InSb quantum nanostructures when they are embedded in the InAs matrix. The results herein provide a means for obtaining the precise control over dimensions and morphologies of the InSb/InAs nanostructures, which is essential for extending the operating wavelength further into the mid-infrared region.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics"

Since geopolymer concretes made with recycled aggregates generally have weaker internal structure compared with those using natural aggregates, SiO2-rich materials have therefore been used to improve the strength properties, one of which is the well-known nano-SiO2 (nS). However, because nS is not environmental friendly, other green SiO2-rich materials, such as rice husk ash (RHA) from agricultural wastes, are needed. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of replacing nano-SiO2 with rich husk ash for improving the performance of recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete (RAGC) made from high-calcium fly ash that is able to set and harden without heat curing. The mechanical properties and fire-resistant performance of RHA-added and nS-added geopolymer concretes were tested and compared. The results show that the addition of RHA is effective in improving the strengths of RAGCs, particularly when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is increased to 4.17. The 28-day compressive strengths of RAGCs containing RHAs ranged from 36.0 to 38.1 MPa due to the improved microstructure and denser matrix and were comparable to those of RAGCs made with nS. However, the inclusion of SiO2-rich materials had an adverse effect on the post-fire residual strength of geopolymer concretes made from recycled aggregates due primarily to the reduced porosity.","fluidex; related topics, energy, environmental, Business, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

During polymerization, different cocatalysts were also used. It was found that Cat C with triethylaluminum as a cocatalyst exhibited the highest activity. This was likely attributed to optimal distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface. It can be observed by increased temperature in the reactor due to highly exothermic reaction during polymerization. By the way, the morphologies of the polymer obtained from this catalyst were spherical, which is more preferable. Besides the catalytic activity, crystallinity and morphology were also affected by the different magnesium sources used to prepare the catalysts.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Here, TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via sol-gel process and Poly vinyl chloride chemically altered with 4-amino benzoic acid. Functionalized PVC was blended uniformly throughout PSf matrix rendering the yellowish-orange color and porous structure giving better productivity. TiO2 NPs were studied for optimum concentration to provide the excess charge for Cr (VI) rejection. SEM images revealed the porous finger like structure within the membranes and the molecular weight cutoff confirmed the ultrafiltration nature of the membranes. Composites showed good wetting behavior with contact angle (between 67 and 76°) and swelling behavior (≈50–79%). Cr (VI) aqueous rejection and the key parameters namely pressure, pH, filler TiO2 concentration and BSA protein were studied in detail. Maximum of 87 ± 5% rejection of Cr (VI) was obtained with productivity of 6.5 L/m2h at 100 kPa pressure in acidic medium. While the antifouling experiments indicated incorporation of TiO2 NPs increased the flux recovery ratio, presence of BSA protein in feed solution showed binding effects with Cr2O72− anions. The membranes showed good reusability for continuous 3 cycles maintaining the rejection efficiency above 70 ± 5% at the end of 3rd cycle.","mixing and separation, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The results showed that the reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DON, hydrophobicity (HPO), absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) of both water samples by VUV was higher compared to using UV. The addition of H2O2 remarkably improved the performances of VUV and UV. VUV/H2O2 exhibited the highest removal efficiency for DOC and DON. Even though HANFP increased at the early stage, its concentration decreased (19–72%) at the end of treatment (60 min). Decreases in DON (30–41%) and DOC (51–57%) led to HANFP reduction (53–72%). Moreover, FEEM revealed that substantial reduction in soluble microbial product-like compounds (nitrogen-rich organic) had a strong correlation with HANFP reduction, implying that this group of compounds act as a main precursor of HANs. The VUV/H2O2 system significantly reduced HANFP more than UV/H2O2 and therefore is suitable for controlling HAN precursors and HAN formation in drinking water and reclaimed wastewater.","ecological and environmentalronmental sciences; applied ecology/pollution; waste treatment; chemistryical, environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

However, when the oil pressure drops or the well is nearly depleted, the flow rate up to the WHP declines. Installing a Wellhead Compressor (WC) on the WHP is the solution [9]. The WC acts locally on the selected wells and reduces back pressure, thereby substantially enhancing the efficiency of oil and gas recovery [21]. The WC sensors transmit data back to the historian time series database, and intelligent alarm systems are utilized as a critical tool to minimize unscheduled downtime which adversely affects production reliability, as well as monitoring time and cost burden of operating engineers. In this paper, an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ABD-LSTM) model is presented for WC failure prediction. We also propose feature extraction and data reduction techniques as complementary methods to improve the effectiveness of the training process in a large-scale dataset.

In this study, the biodegradable polymer composites, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)/cellulose fiber composites with different types of cellulose were prepared. The kenaf fiber treated with hydrochloric acid (KTH), extracted cellulose fiber (EC), and commercial cellulose fiber (CC) were selected as alternative renewable fillers in the PBS (the biodegradable polymer). Regarding the fiber characteristics, the aspect ratio of the EC (11.5) was found to be higher than that of the CC (6.1). In a similar manner, the EC contained 65.9% crystallinity, which was higher than that of the CC (37.0%) and the KTH (58.9%). Moreover, the EC exhibited higher thermal stability (Td[Max] = 362.9°C) than the CC (Td[Max] = 302.0°C) and the KTH (Td[Max] = 353.8°C). For PBS/cellulose fiber composites, the rheological, tensile, and thermal properties were studied. The rheology results revealed that the addition of the fiber changed the PBS microstructure. The EC fiber dispersion in the PBS seemed to be better than the others; however, the KTH fiber dispersion was poor. The addition of the fiber raised the elastic moduli of the composites by 5-26%; however, it reduced the tensile strengths (by 14-53%) and the decomposition temperatures (by 1-2%). Furthermore, the addition of the fiber slightly affected the crystallization temperatures and melting temperatures of the composites. The yellowness and whiteness of the composites were marginally reduced. The composite with the EC fiber showed a significant improvement in the elastic modulus as compared to the composite with the CC fiber, while the tensile strength and the strain at maximum stress were comparable. Thus, according to the rheological, thermal, and tensile properties of the composites, the EC fiber showed a possibility of using as an alternative reinforcement material from a local renewable resource.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Ceramics and Composites, Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Methods: Outpatient electroencephalographs (EEGs) in alert patients were selected. The three compared groups include 1) patients with an interested AED (monotherapy or combined with other AEDs); 2) patients with AEDs other than the interested AED; and 3) patients who did not take AEDs. Outcomes were frequency of posterior alpha rhythm and presence of generalized continuous (CSWs) and generalized intermittent slow waves (ISWs). Analysis of variance was used to assess which AED was associated with slower posterior alpha rhythm. Chi-square and logistic regression were employed to assess association and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) between pathological generalized slow waves and each AED. Results: Among 1050 EEG tracings, 638 EEGs met our criteria. Electroencephalographs requested because of cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms were excluded, leaving 616 EEGs for analysis. Four hundred thirty-seven patients received at least one AED, whereas the remaining 179 patients did not take AED. Conventional AEDs [carbamazepine (CBZ), p = 0.024; phenobarbital (PB), p = 0.013; phenytoin (PHT), p = 0.001] except valproic acid (VPA) were associated with slower alpha frequency. Carbamazepine [adjusted OR: 5.74 (95% CI: 2.07, 15.94)] and PB [adjusted OR: 2.58 (95% CI: 1.15, 5.78)] were significantly associated with generalized ISWs. None were associated with generalized CSWs. Conclusions: Phenytoin, CBZ, and PB are associated with slower posterior alpha frequency. The latter 2 AEDs also produced pathological generalized ISWs. Valproic acid, benzodiazepines, and new-generation AEDs are not associated with either outcome. The presence of generalized ISWs in patients taking CBZ or PB should be cautiously interpreted since there can be drug effects. Association with cognitive side effects of these slow waves should be further studied.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Behavioral Neuroscience"

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the complex pore structures of the MCFs were retained after the functionalization at relatively high temperature (573K). TGA and FTIR results showed that the functionalization led to a reduction of water adsorbed on the surfaces of the MCF. The functionalization improved adsorption of benzene compared to the pristine MCF and the optimum HMDS:MCF molar ratio was 1.5.

The 3D-BTO/epoxy composites were prepared at various BTO contents of 5, 7, and 10 vol%. The dielectric constant and tanδ of the composites increased as the BTO content increased. With a BTO content of 10 vol%, the dielectric constant and discharged energy density were 42.0 at 1 MHz and 1.57 mJ/cm3 at 25 kV/cm, respectively. However, tanδ and energy loss density were larger. The enhancement of dielectric constant and discharge energy density at low BTO content (10 vol%) was attributable to a continuous 3D network structure of BTO phase in the composites.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The morphology and physical properties of resultant rubber composite powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, laser light scattering particle sizer and thermogravimetric analyzer. The results showed that spray-dried NR-SiO2 particles were spherical in shape with diameter of less than 10 μm, with silica on the outer layer. The particle size was found to increase gradually with the increase in NR/Si mass ratio. Marginal growth in particle size was observed with increasing feed flow rate. Increasing inlet air temperature improved the latex particle encapsulation by silica layer while maintaining the final particle size. The mechanical properties of NR-SiO2 powders-filled polylactic acid (PLA) composite increase gradually with the addition of dried particles of higher rubber content. However, the composite exhibited relatively lower or reduced tensile strength and elongation at break compared to the host PLA polymer. This could be attributed to poor filler dispersion associated with weak filler/matrix interaction effect occurring during melt-compounding process.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

We used two evaluation metrics: Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) and a novel ""robustness"", which quantifies the models' ability to detect adversarial essays created by modifying normal essays to cause them to be less coherent. We found that: (1) the BERT-based model achieved the greatest robustness, followed by the GloVe-based and ELMo-based models, respectively, and (2) fine-tuning the embeddings improves QWK but lowers robustness. These findings could be informative on how to choose, and whether to fine-tune, an appropriate model based on how much the AES program places emphasis on proper grading of adversarial essays.","computer scienceuter theory, includes computer scienceutational logic, automata theory, switching theory, programming theory, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study aimed to investigate the shielding efficiency and usefulness of tungsten-containing rubber against radiation from radionuclides. Materials and Methods: Shielding efficiency due to different thickness of tungsten-containing rubber was measured for the following radionuclides mostly used in nuclear medicine such as 99mTc, 131I, 18F and 68Ga then the linear attenuation coefficient (μ) and half value layer (HVL) were calculated. The assessment of energy spectrum with and without tungsten-containing rubber of half value layer were evaluated for 99mTc, 131I, 18F and 68Ga. Results: The μ of 99mTc, 131I, 18F, and 68Ga were 1.357 mm−1, 0.096 mm−1, 0.076 mm−1, and 0.063 mm−1, respectively.

Current works typically struggle with object detection and localization problems due to crowded and complex scenes. Hence, we propose a Deep Spatiotemporal Translation Network (DSTN), novel unsupervised anomaly detection and localization method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Edge Wrapping ( $EW$ ). In training, we use only the frames of normal events in order to generate their corresponding dense optical flow as temporal features. During testing, since all the video sequences are input into the system, unknown events are considered as anomalous events due to the fact that the model knows only the normal patterns. To benefit from the information provided by both appearance and motion features, we introduce (i) a novel fusion of background removal and real optical flow frames with (ii) a concatenation of the original and background removal frames. We improve the performance of anomaly localization in the pixel-level evaluation by proposing (iii) the Edge Wrapping to reduce the noise and suppress non-related edges of abnormal objects. Our DSTN has been tested on publicly available anomaly datasets, including UCSD pedestrian, UMN, and CUHK Avenue. The results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with respect to the frame-level evaluation, the pixel-level evaluation, and the time complexity for abnormal object detection and localization tasks.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Despite its outstanding properties in terms of flexibility in application and environmental friendliness when compared with other alternative energy, the main obstacle to the development of commercial biomethane production is the uncertain value of investment. This research reveals the pros and cons in terms of specific energy used in production of biomethane from biogas, specific production cost and the current investment cost of biogas upgrading techniques including pressurized water scrubbing, chemical scrubbing, cryogenic separation, pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation. It was found that the specific energy used in the production of biomethane from biogas varies in the range of 0.05 - 0.62 kWh/m3 biogas. Increasing production capacity, the investment cost decreases while the energy consumptions for all production techniques increases, except for cryogenic separation which remain constant. Comparison of the specific production cost and the price of fossil fuels shows that to make the production of biomethane from biogas economically worthwhile, a development for more efficient technology to reduce production costs is of paramount importance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks and Communications"

Herein, NiMn-LDHs were anchored on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene sheets using an in situ crystallization process. Chemical bonds have been demonstrated as the main linkage between MXene and NiMn-LDH to inhibit structure degradation. Furthermore, the size of NiMn-LDH nanosheets was reduced with the incorporation of MXene due to heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in faster ion transport and electron transfer. As expected, the rate performance and cycle stability of this hybrid material are significantly improved (1330 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 88.6% capacity retention over 3000 cycles), compared with those of the MXene and NiMn-LDH mixture (875 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 41.8% left after 3000 cycles), indicating that the oxygen bridge is critical in improving the internal cohesion of the hybrid materials. A lithium-ion capacitor equipped with a NiMn-LDH/MXene anode and an activated carbon (AC) cathode provides a high energy density of 122.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 199 W kg−1, even a high power density of 10 002.9 W kg−1 at an energy density of 77.8 Wh kg−1, and excellent cycle stability (90.4% retention after 10 000 cycles at 1 A g−1) in a broad working voltage (0.01−4.0 V), exhibiting the potential of this hybrid materials in lithium storage.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

For this study, a phantom comprising five elliptical sections of varying diameters in the shape of a pagoda has been made to represent the range of sizes for patients in Thailand and the Far East. ATCM performance can be evaluated in terms of how tube current and image noise vary with changes in the sizes of the sections. Additional rods of different materials with similar properties to human tissues have been inserted to allow the measurement of contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) for assessment of image quality. The phantom has been used to test and compare the performance of CT ATCM systems for the major four CT scanner vendors. The results showed that the ATCM systems of Toshiba and GE CT scanners maintained image noise and CNR within narrower ranges by varying tube current aggressively along the scan length, and commencing modulation before the high attenuation sections are reached. In contrast, the ATCM systems of Philips and Siemens scanners adjusted the tube current within narrower ranges, allowed larger variations in image noise and CNR, and commenced modulation at the start of sections with higher attenuation. The phantom can be used to confirm functionality of the system for acceptance testing, as well as providing information on the tradeoff between radiation dose and image quality when setting up clinical protocols during commissioning of new CT scanners. The phantom can also be used on a routine basis to check that performance is maintained, and could be used in the future for selecting protocol settings to give required values of CNR or adjusting protocol settings on different CT scanners to provide similar levels of clinical performance.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, medical","Waste Management and Disposal, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In 2013, one of the parameter-free techniques called the Ordered Difference Distance Outlier Factor algorithm is proposed. It calculates a score using an ordered difference distance among all instances which derives from the distance matrix sorted in each row before computing the difference. The score contribution from other instances must be compared with the global minimum distance to avoid misdetecting boundaries. However, this degrades the performance of the detection rate. To avoid the use of the global minimum distance term, the new technique is proposed using the ordered difference distance along the appropriate direction based on the acute angle. This technique is called the acute angle ordered difference distance outlier factor (AOF) algorithm. Three collections of ten synthesized datasets are designed to show the performance of AOF. The AOF algorithm reports very high scores for anomalies in synthetic datasets and has better performance than OOF when the anomalies are close together.","Mathematicsematical statistics, fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science (all)"

Natural frequencies of a mechanical system are obtained from free vibration analysis commonly done by the finite element method. One important step in the analysis is matrix tridiagonalization commonly performed by the block Lanczos method. However, the classical block Lanczos method suffers numerical instability due to the loss of matrix orthogonality. In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of the block Lanczos method with an orthogonality fixing scheme for 3D free vibration problems. The solution accuracy and computational time of this method are compared with those of the classical block Lanczos method and the Householder method. The results show that the block Lanczos method with the orthogonality fixing scheme employed in this work can effectively avoid the numerical instability due to the loss of matrix orthogonality. Furthermore, the block Lanczos method with the orthogonality fixing scheme provides solution accuracy as good as the Householder method while using significantly less computational time.","numerical methods, fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all), Numerical Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, Applied Mathematics"

Methods: Validity and reliability of both instruments were assessed in 260 participants with OLP in one tertiary oral medicine centre through confirmatory factor analysis and calculation of reliability coefficients. Prevalence, clinical and demographic predictors of the presence of psychological symptoms in OLP were calculated and identified using multivariated logistic regression. Results: Factor analysis results demonstrated that a bifactor model described the underlying structure of both scales better than other models. Values of omega indicated adequate reliability of total HADS and PSS-10 score while low coefficient omega hierarchical values limit clinical applicability of their subscale scores. The prevalence of anxiety, depressive and distress symptoms in OLP was 39.23%, 20.77% and 27.69%, respectively.

Medical specialists require sufficient PD knowledge to provide high-quality care. Methods: This study outlines a Centre-to-Centre programme for developing PD expertise in underserved regions through a tailored two-year educational enterprise between an established movement disorder mentor centre at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand and mentee centres in Lao PDR. Background knowledge of 80 Laotian physicians was assessed using a validated PD knowledge questionnaire containing 26 questions divided into 3 sections (diagnosis, therapeutic options, disease course) before and immediately after one-day kick-start training. Responses were compared across physicians' demographic groups. Results: Of 80 respondents, 50 (62.5%) were board-certified physicians, of which 27 (54%) specialised in internal medicine. Apparent knowledge gaps were shown by a 51.2% correct response rate for total score, 52.8% for diagnosis, 50.6% for therapeutic options, and 48.2% for disease course. No significant differences in total score or any domain sub-scores between neurologists and other specialties were found. Many did not know which non-motor symptoms could occur as prodromal symptoms or late in course of PD. Incorrect responses mainly reflected a lack of knowledge of the impact of medication on disease. Total and domain sub-scores significantly improved after the course (p < 0.05, each). The size of difference of the means was significant for the total score (d = 0.82), therapeutic option (d = 0.56), and disease course (d = 0.68) sub-scores. Conclusions: Significant improvement of PD knowledge amongst Laotian physicians is demonstrated after a training course, focusing on practical management of PD.

Synthesis of hierarchical structured rare earth metal–doped Co3O4 by polymer combustion method for high performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrode materials,"Theerthagiri J., Durai G., Tatarchuk T., Sumathi M., Kuppusami P., Qin J., Choi M.Y.",2020-04-01,"Active electrode materials, Capacitance retention, Charge transfer resistance, Cobalt oxides, Electrochemical energy storage, Electrochemical supercapacitor, High specific capacitances, Polymer combustion, Cobalt oxide, Electrochemical energy storage, Polymer combustion process, Rare earth–doped electrodes, Supercapacitor","In this study, hierarchical-structured Co3O4 nanocapsules and various rare earth metal (La, Nd, Gd, Sm)–doped Co3O4 materials were synthesized by a polymer-assisted combustion route. These rare earth metal–doped Co3O4 materials were tested as active electrode materials for high performance electrochemical supercapacitors. The Sm-Co3O4 electrode has shown an extraordinary electrochemical supercapacitor performance with high specific capacitance and exhibited a good cycling stability with the capacitance retention of 93.18% after 5000 cycles. The doping of rare earth metals in Co3O4 can reduce the charge transfer resistance and crystalline nature which are expected to improve the transfer of ions and electrons. Also, the large number of structural defects can promote the diffusion of electrolyte ion and electrochemical supercapacitance behavior. Furthermore, the antistructural modeling has shown that isovalent cation substitution leads to the formation of cation vacancies and interstitial defects, which enhance the electrochemical properties of doped Co3O4 materials.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering, physics","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all), Physics and Astronomy (all)"
Economic Analysis of Swine Farm Management for the Enhancement of Biogas Production and Energy Efficiency,"Putmai N., Jarunglumlert T., Prommuak C., Pavasant P., Flood A.E.",2020-10-01,"Biogas production, Digestion performance, Farm management, Generation capacity, Greenhouse gas reductions, Power requirement, Renewable energies, Swine farming, Biogas, Renewable energy, Swine farming, Wastewater","Abstract: The conventional all-in/all-out batch management that is applied in most small to medium swine farms often provides an inconsistent feed of wastewater to biogas systems, causing an imbalance between the power requirements and generation capacity of a farm. This study proposes two alternative models that can be employed to ease this problem. In Model 1, the operation was divided into two offset batch intervals, while in Model 2, the operation used four separate offset batch intervals. The models developed here help avoid an unnecessary long lag phase in the digester, allowing more stable anaerobic digestion performance and more evenly distributed biogas production. Accordingly, the models produce a more stable supply of energy for domestic use, achieving a 36–44% reduction in the electricity expense or a savings of 43,782 m3 biogas/year or 35,834 kWh equivalent compared with that of conventional management. Conventional farm management has periods of excess and deficient biogas production; excess biogas is produced at a rate of up to 14,714 m3/year or 12,043 kWh equivalent at the peak period. This excess could be reduced by 79–100% by using the proposed farming models. This reduction is equivalent to greenhouse gas reductions of 9441 and 11,902 m3 CO2 eq./year by Models 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is used to show how the profitability of biogas plants would vary due to changes in some key parameters, such as the electricity buyback price. The results suggest that more profit could be attained from a significant reduction in operating costs by proper farm management without requiring additional investment.

Reversible thermochromic polydiacetylene/Zn(II) ion assemblies prepared via co-assembling in aqueous phase: The essential role of pH,"Pattanatornchai T., Rueangsuwan J., Phonchai N., Traiphol N., Traiphol R.",2020-06-05,"Aqueous suspensions, Colorimetric sensors, Large scale productions, Polydiacetylenes, Self-assembling, Self-assembling process, Thermochromism, UV-light irradiation, Colorimetric sensor, Intercalation, Polydiacetylene, Reversible thermochromism, Self-assembling","Reversible thermochromism of polydiacetylene/zinc(II) ion (PDA/Zn2+ assemblies is achieved via co-assembling process in an aqueous medium. Our preparation method is quite easy compared to other previous reports. Diacetylene monomer, 1012-pentacosadiynoic acid PCDA, and ZnCl2 are simply mixed in water followed by an incubation in a refrigerator and then UV light irradiation. The resultant assemblies prepared using normal conditions (pH 6.5) exhibits partially reversible themochromism. Hydroxide ion (OH−) is a key component for promoting strong interaction between PCDA carboxylate headgroup and Zn2+ ions during the self-assembling process. We have found that increasing the pH above 8 yields fully reversible thermochromism. The reversible blue-to-purple color transition occurs at about 75 °C. X-ray diffraction reveals the Zn2+-intercalated bilayer structure while infrared spectroscopy probes strong interactions within the assemblies. The PCDA/Zn2+ mole ratio is also a very important parameter for achieving reversible thermochromism. An ability to prepare the PDA/Zn2+ assemblies in aqueous suspension allows the fabrication of solid-state colorimetric sensors by drop-casting on a glass slide, writing on a paper or incorporating into a polyvinylalcohol film. The reversible color-transition temperature can be tuned to about 40 °C by shortening the alkyl chain of constituent PDA. Our new approach for preparing the reversible thermochromic PDA-based materials is quite easy and can be utilized for large scale production of colorimetric sensor, smart ink or paint.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The fillets were treated with low and high concentrations of cinnamon oil nanoemulsion (CN) and bulk cinnamon oil (BO), marked as LC-CN, HC-CN, LC-BO, and HC-BO, respectively. The comparative studies were made with the use of commercially used sanitizer, sodium hypochlorite solution (Na-HPW), and untreated samples. During storage, cinnamon oil nanoemulsion was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria by 1–3 log CFU/g compared to the control. Cinnamon oil nanoemulsion was also more effective in delaying the production of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and lipid oxidation in samples, hence, preserving the sample qualities, especially for color and texture when compared to BO and Na-HPW. The shelf-life of the fillets was 2–4 days for the control and at least 6–8 days for the CN-treated samples. These results indicated that cinnamon oil nanoemulsion could effectively be used as a natural preservative for maintaining quality and extending shelf-life of fish fillets.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science
Computational design of oligosaccharide producing levansucrase from Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 to improve its thermostability for production of levan-type fructooligosaccharides from sucrose,"Klaewkla M., Pichyangkura R., Charoenwongpaiboon T., Wangpaiboon K., Chunsrivirot S.",2020-10-01,"Amino Acids, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacterial Proteins, Computational Chemistry, Fructans, Hexosyltransferases, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Mutation, Oligosaccharides, Sucrose, Computational protein design, Flexibility, Levansucrase, Molecular dynamics simulations, Oligosaccharides, Thermostability","Levansucrase catalyzes production of levan and levan-type fructooligosaccharides (LFOs) with potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries such as prebiotics and anti-tumor agents. Previous study found that Y246S mutant of Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase (oligosaccharide producing levansucrase, OPL) could effectively produce LFOs but its thermostability is limited at high temperature. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) and computational protein design were used to create mutants with higher thermostability than OPL by rigidifying highly flexible residues on enzyme surface. MD results show that highly flexible residues suitable for design are K82, N83, D179, and Q308. Two approaches were employed to improve their interactions by allowing them to be amino acids that could potentially form favorable interactions with their neighboring residues or natural amino acids except G, P and C. Flexibilities of designed residues of K82H, N83R, Q308S and K82H/N83R mutants are lower than those of OPL. Experimental results show that characteristics and product patterns of designed mutants are relatively similar to those of OPL. K82H/N83R mutant has higher thermostability than OPL with 1.7-fold increase in t1/2. Circular dichroism result suggests that designed mutations do not drastically affect secondary structures. This study shows how computational technique can engineer enzyme for thermostability improvement.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry, Economics, energy","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Economics and Econometrics, Energy (all)"

Imaging was repeated at 24 months. Regional brain volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline. Voxel-wise analyses using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) were conducted to verify regional assessments. Baseline brain metabolite levels, blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers assessed by ELISA, and peripheral blood monocyte phenotypes measured by flow cytometry were examined as predictors of significant volumetric change.Results:Participants were 31±8 years old. The estimated mean duration of infection at cART initiation was 15 days. Longitudinal analyses revealed reductions in volumes of putamen (P<0.001) and caudate (P=0.006). TBM confirmed significant atrophy in the putamen and caudate, and also in thalamic and hippocampal regions. In exploratory post-hoc analyses, higher baseline frequency of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)-expressing total monocytes correlated with greater caudate volumetric decrease (ρ=0.67, P=0.017), whereas the baseline density of PSGL-1-expressing inflammatory (CD14+CD16+) monocytes correlated with putamen atrophy (ρ=0.65, P=0.022).Conclusion:Suppressive cART initiated during AHI may not prevent brain atrophy. Volumetric decrease appears greater than expected age-related decline, although examination of longitudinal change in demographically similar HIV-uninfected Thai individuals is needed. Mechanisms underlying progressive HIV-related atrophy may include early activation and enhanced adhesive and migratory capacity of circulating monocyte populations.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"
Depression in the medically ill,"Rosenblat J.D., Kurdyak P., Cosci F., Berk M., Maes M., Brunoni A.R., Li M., Rodin G., McIntyre R.S., Carvalho A.F.",2020-04-01,"Antidepressive Agents, Depression, Depressive Disorder, Major, Humans, adjustment disorder, antidepressant, cancer, Major depressive disorder, organic illness, psychosomatics, psychotherapy, screening","Background: Depressive disorders are significantly more common in the medically ill compared to the general population. Depression is associated with worsening of physical symptoms, greater healthcare utilization and poorer treatment adherence. The present paper provides a critical review on the assessment and management of depression in the medically ill. Methods: Relevant articles pertaining to depression in the medically ill were identified, reviewed and synthesized qualitatively. A systematic review was not performed due to the large breadth of this topic, making a meaningful summary of all published and unpublished studies not feasible. Notable studies were reviewed and synthesized by a diverse set of experts to provide a balanced summary. Results: Depression is frequently under-recognized in medical settings. Differential diagnoses include delirium, personality disorders and depressive disorders secondary to substances, medications or another medical condition. Depressive symptoms in the context of an adjustment disorder should be initially managed by supportive psychological approaches. Once a mild to moderate major depressive episode is identified, a stepped care approach should be implemented, starting with general psychoeducation, psychosocial interventions and ongoing monitoring. For moderate to severe symptoms, or mild symptoms that are not responding to low-intensity interventions, the use of antidepressants or higher intensity psychotherapeutic interventions should be considered. Psychotherapeutic interventions have demonstrated benefits with small to moderate effect sizes. Antidepressant medications have also demonstrated benefits with moderate effect sizes; however, special caution is needed in evaluating side effects, drug–drug interactions as well as dose adjustments due to impairment in hepatic metabolism and/or renal clearance. Novel interventions for the treatment of depression and other illness-related psychological symptoms (e.g. death anxiety, loss of dignity) are under investigation. Limitations: Non-systematic review of the literature. Conclusion: Replicated evidence has demonstrated a bidirectional interaction between depression and medical illness. Screening and stepped care using pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is merited.",medical,Psychiatry and Mental Health

Five conformers of the α-mangostin dye were obtained using three different polarizable continuum model (PCM)/density functional theory (DFT) methods: wB97XD/6-31+G(d,p), M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). The species distribution of the five conformers in acetonitrile, water, and the gas phase was derived from the Gibbs free energy changes of their interconversion equilibria. Three dominant conformers (Conformers 2, 3, and 4) were found as coexisting species in solvents. Chemical descriptors of the three dominant conformers of the α-mangostin in acetonitrile and water were obtained. Simulated UV–Vis spectra of the existing conformers and their mixtures in acetonitrile and water derived from the PCM/TD-DFT calculations were in good agreement with experimental results. Because the three dominant conformers of α-mangostin absorb light in the UV region, the application of α-mangostin dye for UV protection is suggested. The performance of the three dominant α-mangostin conformers in dye sensitized solar cells was also investigated.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The present study investigated the effect of two cAMP modulators, cilostamide and forskolin, on in vitro growth of isolated dog secondary follicles and enclosed oocytes, communication between the gamete and surrounding granulosa cells, expression of GJA1 and GDF9, as well as cAMP level. Secondary follicles were incubated with cilostamide or forskolin alone or a combination of 20 μM cilostamide +1 μM forskolin, and the diameter of the incubated follicles and enclosed oocytes assessed every 72 h. Gap junction activity, GJA1 and GDF9 expression and cAMP level were assessed on Days 6 and 12 and transzonal projection (TZP) density was evaluated on Day 12. Neither cilostamide nor forskolin alone enhanced in vitro growth of dog follicles and the enclosed oocytes (P > 0.05). However, these two cAMP modulators dose dependently sustained gap junction activity and stimulated cAMP production compared with the non-supplemented control. Cilostamide at the high dosage (20 μM) also upregulated GJA1 expression. The combination of cilostamide and forskolin supported oocyte growth during the first 9 days and upregulated GJA1 and GDF9 expression at Day 12 of in vitro culture. This combination treatment also sustained gap junction activity, cAMP production, and increased TZP function (calcein intensity: TZP density ratio). The findings indicated that a combination of cilostamide and forskolin supported growth and survival of oocytes enclosed within cultured follicles by sustaining cAMP production and gap junction activity.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

Symptomatic dengue infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild dengue fever (DF) to potentially fatal disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). We conducted a literature review to analyze the risks of DHF and current perspectives for DHF prevention and control. Methods: According to the PRISMA guidelines, the references were selected from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar database using search strings containing a combination of terms that included dengue hemorrhagic fever, pathogenesis, prevention and control. Quality of references were evaluated by independent reviewers. Results: DHF was first reported in the Philippines in 1953 and further transmitted to the countries in the region of South-East Asia and Western Pacific. Plasma leakages is the main pathophysiological hallmark that distinguishes DHF from DF. Severe plasma leakage can result in hypovolemic shock. Various factors are thought to impact disease presentation and severity. Virus virulence, preexisting dengue antibodies, immune dysregulation, lipid change and host genetic susceptibility are factors reported to be correlated with the development of DHF. However, the exact reasons and mechanisms that triggers DHF remains controversial. Currently, no specific drugs and licensed vaccines are available to treat dengue disease in any of its clinical presentations. Conclusion: This study concludes that antibody-dependent enhancement, cytokine dysregulation and variation of lipid profiles are correlated with DHF occurrence. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment, active and continuous surveillance of cases and vectors are the essential determinants for dengue prevention and control.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

After irradiation at 365 nm, the caged compounds exhibited the fastest release rate at t1/2 of 6.7 days and the slowest release rate at t1/2 of 73.7 days. Caged compounds at high concentrations (10-5 and 10-6 M) significantly stimulate secondary root germination while free NAA at the same level is toxic and leads to inhibition of secondary root germination. The cytotoxicity of the caged compounds against fibroblasts and vero cells were evaluated, and the results suggested that, at 10-5-10-6 M, caged compounds exhibited no significant cytotoxicity to the cells.

Previous neuroimaging research identifies abnormalities in emotion-related brain regions in depression without HIV, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala. However, no studies have examined the neural signatures of depressive symptoms in acute HIV infection (AHI). Seed-based voxelwise resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) for affective seed regions of interest (pregenual ACC, subgenual ACC [sgACC], bilateral amygdala) was computed for 74 Thai males with AHI and 30 Thai HIV-uninfected controls. Group analyses compared rsFC of ACC and amygdala seed regions between AHI and uninfected control groups. Within the AHI group, voxelwise regression analyses investigated the relationship between depressive symptoms and rsFC for these affective seed regions. Group analyses revealed alterations in rsFC of the amygdala in AHI versus uninfected controls. Depressive symptoms associated with decreased rsFC between ACC regions and posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial temporal, and lateral parietal regions in AHI. Symptoms of depression also correlated to increased rsFC between ACC regions and lateral prefrontal cortex, sgACC, and cerebellum in AHI. Similar to the ACC, depressive symptoms associated with decreased rsFC between amygdala and precuneus. Of blood biomarkers, only HIV RNA inversely correlated with rsFC between posterior sgACC and left uncus.

Longitudinal research in this cohort will be necessary to determine whether these early alterations in rsFC of affective network regions are related to persistent depressive symptoms after combination antiretroviral therapy.","neuroscience, medical, Immunology","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, Virology"

In this strategy, a sulfur atom and a cyano group can be together introduced to the lattice of g-C3N4. It is also interesting that a small amount of nulvalent sulfur is produced to construct a binary composite via incomplete oxidization of H2S. The experimental and calculated results reveal that the sulfur atom and cyano group avail the efficient separation and shuttle the charge carriers across g-C3N4 nanosheets to prompt delocalization of redox active sites. Notably, the best photocatalytic rate of 1901 μmol·g-1·h-1 is attained for the S/g-C3+xN4+y nanophotocatalyst, 5.3 times faster than that of g-C3N4. In addition, AQEs of 33.5% and 13.1% are achieved under the irradiation of 405 and 420 nm, respectively. This work introduces S/g-C3+xN4+y as a highly active nanophotocatalyst that offers a potential application prospect for environmental remediation and energy storage and conversion.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The sensing dye was synthesized by solvatochromism of rhodamine B via rhodamine lactone–zwitterion equilibrium. UV–vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were employed to confirm that the rhodamine-lactone (RhoL) was incorporated into the agarose hydrogel. The results showed that the sensor was highly selective for recognizing Au3+ over other metal ions in real systems. In addition, DFT calculation results suggested that the membrane sensor formed stable complexes with Au3+ through a large number of cation-dipole and ion–ion interactions. In addition, according to changes in signaling upon adding various Au3+ concentration, the limit of detection of Arg-RhoL for Au3+ is calculated to be 5 µM. This approach may provide an easily measurable and inherently sensitive method for Au3+ ion detection in environmental and biological applications.","genergyal, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

Method: A retrospective case-control study was conducted among 88 PHT- cADRs (25 SJS/TEN, 37 DRESS/DIHS and 26 MPE) compared to 70 PHT-tolerant controls during 2008-2017. Genotyping was performed by Taqman RT-PCR (EPHX1 337 T > C, EPHX1 416A > G and CYP2C9*3), pyrosequencing (UGT1A1*28, UGT1A1*6) and polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (HLA-B). Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with PHT-cADRs. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that HLA-B*46:01 was significantly associated with all PHT-induced cADRs (OR 2.341; 95% CI, 1.078-5.084; P =.032). Age of ≥60 years showed a significant association with PHT-induced SJS/TEN (OR 3.600; 95% CI, 1.214-10.672; P =.021). CYP2C9*3 was almost reaching statistically associated with an increased risk of PHT-induced SJS/TEN (OR 4.800; 95% CI, 0.960-23.990; P =.056).

Inhibition effect of Na+ form in ZSM-5 zeolite on hydrogen transfer reaction via 1-butene cracking,"Auepattana-aumrung C., Suriye K., Jongsomjit B., Panpranot J., Praserthdam P.",2020-12-01,"1-butene, Acid site, Hydrogen transfer, Hydrogen-transfer reactions, Operating condition, Physical and chemical properties, Propylene selectivity, ZSM-5, 1-Butene, Hydrogen transfer, Na+and H+ ion, Strong and medium acid sites, ZSM-5","The Na+ and H+ of ZSM-5 having three Si/Al molar ratios (20, 35, and 50) were synthesized to investigate and illustrate 1-butene cracking mechanism. The physical and chemical properties of ZSM-5 were described by XRD, SEM-EDX, N2 physicsorption, FT-IR, pyridine-IR, 1H MAS NMR, TPO, and NH3-TPD techniques. For the characterization, the Na-ZSM-5 consisted of two main types of acid sites (weak and medium acid sites), whereas strong, medium, and weak acid sites were detected on H-ZSM-5. For H-ZSM-5, the Si-(OH)-Al site (strong Brønsted site) was an active site for 1-butene cracking reaction, while the active site of Na-ZSM-5 in the reaction was silanol nest (moderate Brønsted site). The 1-butene cracking reaction on H-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-5 was studied under the operating condition of temperature =500 °C, pressure =1 atm, and WHSV =3 h−1. The oligomerization, cracking, and hydrogen transfer were three main reactions in the 1-butene cracking mechanism. The alkenes excluding propylene occurred on weak acid site, while the formation of propylene underwent on medium acid site of ZSM-5 catalyst. The presence of strong acid site on ZSM-5 catalyst promoted the hydrogen transfer reaction, which provoked the alkane formation. The hydrogen transfer index in 1-butene reaction of Na-ZSM-5 was less than H-ZSM-5 in all Si/Al molar ratios because of the absence of strong acid. The Na-ZSM-5 (Si/Al molar ratio = 20) reached the highest propylene selectivity at 31.73 C-wt.% and the Na+ ion could block the strong acid site. At low Si/Al molar ratio, the stability of Na-ZSM-5 was higher than H-ZSM-5 because of the lower coke formation. Therefore, the Na-ZSM-5 was more suitable catalyst than H-ZSM-5 for propylene formation in 1-butene cracking reaction.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Profile of Histone H3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation and the Effect of Lipopolysaccharide/Immune Complex-Activated Macrophages on Endotoxemia,"Ruenjaiman V., Butta P., Leu Y.-W., Pongpanich M., Leelahavanichkul A., Kueanjinda P., Palaga T.",2020-01-10,"Animals, Antigen-Antibody Complex, Endotoxemia, Female, Histones, Humans, Interferon-gamma, Lipopolysaccharides, Lysine, Macrophages, Methylation, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, endotoxemia, epigenetics, H3K4me3, immune complex, LPS, macrophage","Macrophage plasticity is a process that allows macrophages to switch between two opposing phenotypes based on differential stimuli. Interferon γ (IFNγ)-primed macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [M(IFNγ+LPS)] produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, TNFα, and IL-6 and low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while those stimulated with LPS in the presence of the immune complex (IC) [M(IFNγ+LPS+IC)] produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of IL-12. In this study, we investigated the plasticity between M(IFNγ+LPS) and M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) in vitro and compared one of the active histone marks [histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3)] between M(IFNγ+LPS) and M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that in an in vitro system, macrophages exhibited functional plasticity from M(LPS) to M(LPS+IC) upon repolarization after 2 days of washout period while IFNγ priming before LPS stimulation prevented this repolarization. Phosphorylation of p38, SAPK/JNK, and NF-κB p65 in M(LPS+IC) repolarized from M(LPS) was similar to that in M(LPS+IC) polarized from resting macrophages. To obtain the epigenetic profiles of M(IFNγ+LPS) and M(IFNγ+LPS+IC), the global enrichment of H3K4me3 was evaluated. M(IFNγ+LPS) and M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) displayed marked differences in genome-wide enrichment of H3K4me3. M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) showed increased global enrichment of H3K4me3, whereas M(IFNγ+LPS) showed decreased enrichment when compared to unstimulated macrophages. Furthermore, M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) exhibited high levels of H3K4me3 enrichment in all cis-regulatory elements. At the individual gene level, the results showed increased H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of known genes associated with M(IFNγ+LPS+IC), including Il10, Cxcl1, Csf3, and Il33, when compared with those of M(IFNγ+LPS). Finally, we investigated the impact of M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) on the systemic immune response by adoptive transfer of M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) in an LPS-induced endotoxemia model. The cytokine profile revealed that mice with adoptively transferred M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) had acutely reduced serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-p12p70. This study highlights the importance of epigenetics in regulating macrophage activation and the functions of M(IFNγ+LPS+IC) that may influence macrophage plasticity and the potential therapeutic use of macrophage transfer in vivo.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Concern has been raised about the use of patch tests for protein allergens (APTs) to detect SCD in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Methods: We present atopy patch test (APT) data for 97 people. We reviewed APTs and tests for antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the same allergen in pediatric AD patients. We compared the frequency of APTs as a function of age in AD patients. To study the irritancy potential of APTs, we prospectively tested consenting non-AD dermatitis patients undergoing evaluation for allergic contact dermatitis and healthy controls to an APT panel. Results: APT demonstrated fewer positive results than serum-specific IgE or skin prick tests to the same allergen. Positive APT to food was more common in children under 3 years, whereas positive APT to aeroallergens were more common in teens and adults. Only positive APTs to dust mite were significantly more common positive in subjects without AD. Conclusion: Our aggregate findings suggest that most APTs, but not dust mite, behave like conventional patch tests to low-potency allergens. They are more likely to be positive in patients with chronically inflamed skin and to identify allergens that cause SCD. The higher prevalence of APT positivity to foods in young children is consistent with food allergy as a trigger of AD (also known as SCD) being more common in children than adults. Positive APTs define patients who may have SCD; negative APTs may guide elimination diets.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Here we summarize the virology, disease burden, prevalence, distribution of genotypes and seasonality of RVs, and the current status of RV vaccination in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) from 2008 to 2018. Methods: Rotavirus infection in Children in Southeast Asia countries was assessed using data from Pubmed and Google Scholars. Most countries in Southeast Asia have not yet introduced national RV vaccination programs. We exclude Brunei Darussalam, and Timor Leste because there were no eligible studies identified during that time. Results: According to the 2008-2018 RV surveillance data for Southeast Asia, 40.78% of all diarrheal disease in children were caused by RV infection, which is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old in Southeast Asia. Mortality was inversely related to socioeconomic status. The most predominant genotype distribution of RV changed from G1P[8] and G2P[4] into the rare and unusual genotypes G3P[8], G8P[8], and G9P[8]. Although the predominat strain has changed, but the seasonality of RV infection remains unchanged. One of the best strategies for decreasing the global burden of the disease is the development and implementation of effective vaccines. Conclusions: The most predominant genotype distribution of RV was changed time by time. Rotavirus vaccine is highly cost effective in Southeast Asian countries because the ratio between cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is less than one. These data are important for healthcare practitioners and officials to make appropriate policies and recommendations about RV vaccination.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Molecular Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

In this work, the nonmetallic impurities (C, H, O, N) segregation and their effects on the strength of Zr (10 1¯ 2) GB were thoroughly investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. A comprehensive analysis of the interstitial configurations and the relative site energies indicating that C, N and O overwhelmingly prefer the octahedral sites, only H, prefers to reside in the tetrahedral sites. Moreover, the strengthening/embrittlement potency of impurity atoms on the GB was estimated using both the Rice-Wang model and first-principles tensile test calculations. The results show that all impurities, exhibit a strong segregation tendency near the GB region. The segregation of C, N and O has a remarkable strengthening effect on strength of the GB, whereas the presence of impurity H weaken the GB. Most importantly, the underlying mechanism of the strength change of the GBs due to the segregation of impurities was profoundly discussed by charge density and the bond lengths analyses, revealing that the strengthening effect especially for C-doped GB, mainly comes from an enhancement of the charge density across the GB plane. In the end, we expect that our results will be certainly useful for future theoretical and experimental investigations on Zr and its alloys.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Ceramics and Composites, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The effects of hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H2/CO) and carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide (CO2/CO) ratios on DME yield of the indirect and direct processes were firstly investigated. When considering the combined processes, the results were found that the DME yield of the system with direct DME synthesis is higher than that of the indirect system. Moreover, the energy consumption and exergy destruction of biomass gasification and DME synthesis processes in the indirect system are considerably higher when compared to the direct system. For exergoeconomic analysis, the DME unit cost of the direct system (1.66 $/kg DME) also has lower than that of the system with indirect DME synthesis (2.26 $/kg DME). In addition, the CO2 emission of both systems was also considered. The CO2 emission intensity of the system with direct DME synthesis shows 32.35% lower than the system with indirect DME synthesis.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The appearance, pH and viscosity of all formulations were within the acceptable range. All formulations formed relatively rapid sol-to-gel transition when contacted with simulated salivary fluid at body temperature. Compared to non-encapsulated formulations, in vitro gelation and rheological studies of encapsulated formulations displayed gel formation that remained longer with high mechanical strength. In vitro mucoadhesion and in vitro release studies revealed that nanoencapsulated in situ gel had excellent mucoadhesive property and could release AS in a sustained manner. These formulations exhibited no cytotoxic effects to HPDCLs. The SBEβCD/CS NPs containing low AS content could express the COL I synthesis.

This research presented green construction materials or so-called geopolymers from metakaolin substituted by high calcium fly ash by 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 wt%. Some researches reported that geopolymer produced from metakaolin and fly ash with alkali solution gave a great result, but usually, they used fly ash containing very low calcium component. Compressive strength at 3, 7 and 28 curing days and flowability were conducted. The compressive strength of geopolymers blended with high calcium fly ash was still developed as the curing day increased and revealed the highest at 28 days especially on MK40 (high calcium fly ash 60 wt%). Geopolymer pastes prepared with a higher amount of high calcium fly ash exhibited less viscous. It was proved that the high amount of high calcium fly ash could be applied and gave extraordinary compressive strength. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence were used to investigate chemical properties as well as microstructure by a scanning electron microscope. For phase analysis, the existence of oxides of calcium and sulfur in high calcium fly ash resulted in the formation of thenardite, calcite, portlandite and C-S-H phase associating with geopolymeric phase. Therefore, this research proposed the opportunity for geopolymer production by using abundant high calcium fly ash to raise the value of the industrial waste products and green alternative construction material compared with OPC.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In this study, subsurface characterization of the tunnel excavation section in Kenny Hill Formation (KHF) was conducted to develop 3D ground model and tunnel-filtered models and obtain ground sections through the spatial interpolation of borehole data using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method. Six greenfield ground sections were selected by using the tunnel-filtered model’s configuration of tunnels and available tunneling-induced ground movement data. Conceptual models for finite element modeling were developed based on soil profiles, and the corresponding soil parameters were determined from ground sections. The strength and stiffness parameters of the Hardening Soil (HS) model were established using data from site investigation, in situ and laboratory tests, and empirical correlations with standard penetration test. The effectiveness of empirical correlations was determined through back analysis of twin-tunnel excavation in 2D finite element analysis using the contraction method and verified with monitored ground movement data. The numerical back-analyzed results of twin-tunnel excavation simulation using HS parameters obtained from a selected empirical correlation showed good agreement with construction-monitored ground movements.

Prevalence and diagnostic challenges of thyroid lymphoma: A multi-institutional study in non-western countries,"Hirokawa M., Suzuki A., Hashimoto Y., Satoh S., Canberk S., Jhuang J.Y., Jung C.K., Tangnuntachai N., Kovacevic B., Zhu Y., Agarwal S., Kakudo K.",2020-01-01,"Biopsy, Fine-Needle, China, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, India, Japan, Lymphoma, Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone, Lymphoma, Follicular, Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse, Prevalence, Republic of Korea, Serbia, Taiwan, Thailand, Thyroid Neoplasms, Thyroidectomy, Turkey, Ultrasonography, Ancillary study, Aspiration cytology, Immunohistochemistry, Lymphoma, Thyroid","Research on the primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) diagnosis is limited, with only a few large sample size studies, reported from Asian countries. The aim of the present study was to clarify the current prevalence and challenges in PTL diagnosis, and recommended ancillary studies for PTL in non-Western countries. PTL (n = 153) cases were retrieved from 10 institutions in non-Western countries and analyzed. Ultrasound examination (UE) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were used as main preoperative diagnostic tools in all participating institutions. Flow cytometry (FCM) was performed in the 5 institutions (50%). Lobectomy was the most common histological procedure to confirm the PTL diagnosis. All institutions routinely performed immuno-histochemical analysis. PTL was 0.54% of malignant thyroid tumor cases, with mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALTL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being 54.9% and 38.6%, respectively. Kuma Hospital, where the frequency of MALTL was highest (83.7%), routinely performed FCM using the materials obtained by FNAC. UE and FNAC sensitivities were 62.5% and 57.8%, respectively. In both UE and FNAC, sensitivity of MALTL was lower than of DLBCL. The study elucidated that the prevalence of PTL in non-Western countries was lower than previously reported. We propose that FCM should be more actively used to improve the preoperative diagnosis of MALTL. Our data predicted that the MALTL proportion will increase with improved diagnostic tools, while observation of PTL-suspected nodules without histological examination remains a viable option.","Immunologynology and infectious diseases; Immunologyne response disorders; autoImmunologynity; diagnosis and therapy, medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"
Comprehensive investigation on bond mechanism of embedded through-section fiber-reinforced polymer bars to concrete for structural analysis,"Van Hong Bui L., Stitmannaithum B., Jongvivatsakul P.",2020-05-01,"Bond models, Embedded through-section, Fiber reinforced polymers, Pull-out test, Shear strengthening, Bond model, Embedded through-section, Fiber-reinforced polymer, Pullout test, Shear strengthening","This study investigates the bond behavior between embedded through-section (ETS) fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars and concrete, as well as its effect on the structural performance of beams strengthened in shear with ETS bars, through experiments, analytical evaluations, and numerical simulations. A series of pullout tests was carried out to analyze the bond mechanism between ETS bars and concrete for various influences such as embedment length and ETS stiffness. Together with previous data, a comprehensive analytical method for defining the ETS–concrete interfacial profile is proposed. Additionally, the proposed bond model is used to build a new method of predicting the ETS shear resisting force and assessing the absorption energy of strengthened beams. Results indicate that the developed bond model is reasonable for simulating ETS–concrete interfaces, and the method for deriving the shear contribution of ETS FRP bars through bonding-based mechanism shows good performance compared to other shear models. Bonding parameters such as interfacial ductility index (B) and interfacial energy (Gf) are observed to strongly affect the performance of strengthened members. Moreover, finite element (FE) simulations of beams strengthened with ETS bars were conducted, and the proposed bonding approach was utilized. Comparisons between the results achieved from FE modeling and experiments clarify that FE simulation with the proposed bond model is effective for analyzing shear strengthened beams by ETS bars.",engineering,"Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"
Affective EEG-Based Person Identification Using the Deep Learning Approach,"Wilaiprasitporn T., Ditthapron A., Matchaparn K., Tongbuasirilai T., Banluesombatkul N., Chuangsuwanich E.",2020-09-01,"Affective Computing, Convolutional neural network, Learning approach, Person identification, Personal identification, Recurrent neural network (RNNs), Spatial informations, Temporal information, Affective computing, biometrics, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning (DL), electroencephalography (EEG), long short-Term memory (LSTM), personal identification (PI), recurrent neural networks (RNNs)","Electroencephalography (EEG) is another method for performing person identification (PI). Due to the nature of the EEG signals, EEG-based PI is typically done while a person is performing a mental task such as motor control. However, few studies used EEG-based PI while the person is in different mental states (affective EEG). The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of affective EEG-based PI using a deep learning (DL) approach. We proposed a cascade of DL using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs are used to handle the spatial information from the EEG while RNNs extract the temporal information. We evaluated two types of RNNs, namely long short-Term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed method is evaluated on the state-of-The-Art affective data set DEAP. The results indicate that CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM can perform PI from different affective states and reach up to 99.90%-100% mean correct recognition rate. This significantly outperformed a support vector machine baseline system that used power spectral density features. Notably, the 100% mean CRR came from 32 subjects in DEAP data set. Even after the reduction of the number of EEG electrodes from 32 to 5 for more practical applications, the model could still maintain an optimal result obtained from the frontal region, reaching up to 99.17%. Amongst the two DL models, we found that CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM performed similarly while CNN-GRU expended faster training time. In conclusion, the studied DL approaches overcame the influence of affective states in EEG-Based PI reported in the previous works.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Artificial Intelligence"
Effects of ginger adjunct to the standard prophylaxis on reducing carboplatin and paclitaxel-induced nausea vomiting: a randomized controlled study,"Uthaipaisanwong A., Oranratanaphan S., Musigavong N.",2020-08-01,"Carboplatin, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Ginger, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nausea, Paclitaxel, Vomiting, Carboplatin, Chemotherapy-induced nausea and/or vomiting (CINV), Ginger, Nausea","Purpose: To determine effects of ginger on reducing the severity of nausea and/or vomiting among gynecologic cancer patients receiving a combined carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen. Methods: The research was a randomized, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were patients with gynecologic malignancies receiving carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Either ginger (2 g per day) or placebo was prescribed in adjunct to standard antiemetic prophylaxis, in alternated cycles between groups: in group 1, ginger was prescribed in odd cycles and placebo in even cycles and vice versa in group 2. Patients with gut obstruction or brain or bowel metastasis, those using anticoagulants or other ginger or antiemetic medications, or patients who had ginger allergy were excluded from the study. Statistics were analyzed by STATA version 15.1. Results: Overall, 47 participants were recruited. Mean age was 53.9 years. Seventeen subjects were chemotherapy-naïve. In an acute phase of nausea, ginger therapy significantly reduced the mean nausea score comparing to placebo (P = 0.03). However, in the delayed phase, there were no significant differences between groups. For the acute and delayed phase of vomiting, there was no difference between the groups. No serious adverse effects were demonstrated in the ginger group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Adjunct ginger therapy on standard nausea and vomiting prophylaxis protocol especially in day 1 has benefit in reducing an acute phase nausea in patients receiving a combined carboplatin-paclitaxel regimen. The benefit on delayed phase nausea and vomiting is still equivocal.",medical,Oncology
Vanadium-Based Oxide on Two-Dimensional Vanadium Carbide MXene (V2Ox@V2CTx) as Cathode for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries,"Venkatkarthick R., Rodthongkum N., Zhang X., Wang S., Pattananuwat P., Zhao Y., Liu R., Qin J.",2020-05-26,"Capacity retention, Environmental friendliness, Layered Structures, Positive electrodes, Rate performance, Reversible capacity, Two Dimensional (2 D), Vanadium carbides, aqueous zinc-ion battery, cathode, energy storage, MXene, vanadium carbide, vanadium-based oxides","Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered for emerging cutting-edge energy storage technologies as an alternative to the existing nonaqueous lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their inimitable advantages of low-cost materials, high safety, high abundance, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the key challenges of the AZIBs are mainly due to the development of cathode (positive electrode) materials. Here, we report the synthesis of vanadium-based oxides on two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide MXene (V2Ox@V2CTx) that can serve as an efficient cathode material for AZIBs. The vanadium-based oxides could be formed during the high-temperature etching method and by the electrochemical cyclic process. The prepared V2Ox@V2CTx electrodes can deliver an ideal rate performance with an average reversible capacity of about 304 to 84 mAh g-1 at current densities ranging from 0.05 to 2 A g-1, respectively. The obtained results can be comparable to the well-known cathode materials reported for the ZIBs. Advancing from the characteristic, stable 2D layered structures, V2Ox@V2CTx electrodes could exhibit an improved cycling life with the capacity retention of 81.6% at a rate of 1 A g-1 for about 200 cycles in 1 M ZnSO4 electrolyte. The prepared MXene as cathode materials could further pave the way for the development of the advanced zinc ion storage systems.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Technological Applications of Honeycomb Monoliths in Environmental Processes: A review,"Hosseini S., Moghaddas H., Masoudi Soltani S., Kheawhom S.",2020-01-01,"Accessible surface areas, Environmental, Environmental process, Honeycomb, Metallic structures, Monolith, Technological applications, Thin layer coatings, Adsorbent, Catalyst, Environmental, Honeycomb, Monolith","Honeycomb monoliths are carbon-based, ceramic or metallic structures, comprising a significant number of packed, small-in-diameter channels. One of the features associated with the honeycomb monoliths is the demonstrated low pressure drops in processes involving high flow rates. Honeycomb monoliths, with a range of structures, have found increasingly promising applications in various industries. Owing to their physical structures, they keep finding new applications in industrial treatment systems. They are mainly fabricated via two different techniques: extrusion and coating. Monoliths fabricated via each of these techniques demonstrate specific characteristics suitable for a certain number of applications. With the presence of cordierite substrate in the coated monoliths, higher mechanical strength of coated honeycomb monoliths is expected when compared to the integral monoliths. The coated monoliths are suitable when mechanical strength is of importance where the adhesion of the thin layer coating on monoliths is a determining factor in the performance of the entire process. The integral monoliths are most-commonly employed in gas-phase processes rather than liquid phase applications due to their high accessible surface area per total weight (or volume) of the monoliths. Embedding mesoporous carbon coating and nanoparticles into honeycomb monoliths has improved the efficiency of monoliths in comparison to the more conventional preparation methods.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"
Bi-metallic CuO-NiO based multifunctional material for hydrogen production from sorption-enhanced chemical looping autothermal reforming of ethanol,"Nimmas T., Wongsakulphasatch S., Kui Cheng C., Assabumrungrat S.",2020-10-15,"Auto-thermal reforming of ethanols, Autothermal reforming, Catalytic properties, Material preparation, Multi-functional materials, Operating temperature, Reforming temperatures, Regeneration temperature, Bi-metallic multifunctional material, Ethanol reforming, Hydrogen production, Sorption-enhanced chemical looping autothermal reforming","Bi-metallic CuO-NiO based multifunctional materials were developed and employed for H2 production via sorption-enhanced chemical looping autothermal reforming (SE-CLAR) of ethanol. The effects of adding copper oxide (CuO) as a co-oxygen carrier and material preparation method on H2 production performances, including activity, reusability, and energy penalty, were studied. The results revealed that adding CuO into one-body multifunctional material provided positive impacts on H2 production performances. The use of multifunctional material could reduce reforming temperature to milder temperature at 500 °C. The key finding is that position of CuO in the multifunctional material showed a significant effect. Placing of CuO on the surface could enhance catalytic property whereas placing NiO closed to CaO could reduce heat for CaO regeneration. For the SE-CLAR operating temperature at 500 °C and steam to ethanol ratio (S/E) = 3, impregnation of NiO on the surface of homogeneous CuO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33, NiO/CuO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33, produced 83% H2 purity for 30 min while impregnation of CuO on the surface of homogeneous NiO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33, CuO/NiO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33, produced 89% H2 for 45 min. Sol-gel one-pot synthesis method of NiO-CuO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 produced 91% H2 purity for 60 min. Complete regeneration temperature of CaO was achieved at 800 °C, which accounts for 14% thermal energy reduction for the CuO/NiO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33. The NiO/CuO-CaO-Ca12Al14O33 could maintain its performance on producing high H2 purity for at least five consecutive operating cycles.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Effectiveness of a health education intervention on the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets for the prevention of malaria in pregnant women of Pakistan: A quasi-experimental study,"Kumar R., Farzeen M., Hafeez A., Achakzai B.K., Vankwani M., Lal M., Iqbal R., Somrongthong R.",2020-06-29,"Adult, Female, Health Education, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Insecticide-Treated Bednets, Malaria, Mosquito Control, Pakistan, Pregnancy, Pregnant Women, Young Adult, Antenatal care, Awareness and use of bed nets, Long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, Malaria prevention, Vector control disease","Background: About one quarter of pregnant women in the population of Pakistan are using long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) for prevention of malaria. Past research reported that adequate information and education would act as mediator to change behaviour among patients for prevention of malaria infection. The effective use of LLINs would contribute to reduction of disease burden caused by malaria. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of health education on the adoption of LLINs among pregnant women living in Tharparkar, a remote district in Sindh Province, Pakistan. Methods: A quasi-experimental study design with control and intervention groups was conducted with 200 pregnant women (100 in each group). Women in the intervention group were provided with health education sessions on malaria for 12 weeks, while those in the control group obtained routine information from lady health workers (LHWs). Pre- and post-intervention assessment was done of knowledge about malaria and use of LLIN, which was statistically analysed using descriptive statistics and difference in difference (DID) multivariable regression analysis to test effectiveness of the intervention. Results: Baseline was conducted with 200 pregnant women. Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups with slight differences in age, education, income, type of latrine, and source of drinking water. There were no significant differences between mean knowledge and use of LLINs scores between groups at baseline. However, the estimated DID value after the intervention was 4.170 (p < 0.01) and represents an increase in scores of knowledge in the intervention group compared to control. Similarly DID value of 3.360 (p < 0.05) showed an increase in use of LLINs score after the intervention which was significant, showing that the intervention had a positive effect. Conclusions: Results proved that health education could be an effective intervention for improving knowledge and usage of LLINs among pregnant women for the prevention of malaria. Such educational interventions have a positive potential to be implemented at larger scale by incorporating them into routine health sessions provided by health workers.","Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"

The use of non-calcined Mg(Al)O-sv obtained from the solvothermal method led to the highest Pt dispersion, the lowest fraction of strong acid sites, and the lowest metallic tin species as well as coke content. Unlike the other catalysts that gradually deactivated with time-on-stream, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv maintained high propylene yield ˜26.9% during 5 h reaction time without any sign of catalyst deactivation. The improved catalyst performances were attributed not only to the high surface area flower-like nanosheet structure of the Mg(Al)O-sv but also the uniform Mg-O-Al bonding and high Al/Mg atomic ratio on the catalyst surface as confirmed by the XPS results.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Systemic distribution of progesterone receptor subtypes in human tissues,"Asavasupreechar T., Saito R., Miki Y., Edwards D.P., Boonyaratanakornkit V., Sasano H.",2020-05-01,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Fetus, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Middle Aged, Pregnancy, Progesterone, Protein Isoforms, Receptors, Progesterone, Reproduction, Tissue Distribution, Young Adult, Human tissues, Progesterone receptor, Progesterone receptor isoform B, Systemic distribution","Progesterone receptor (PR) is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. Upon binding to the PR, progesterone can display several non-reproductive functions, including neurosteroid activity in the central nervous system, inhibition of smooth muscle contractile activity in the gastrointestinal tract, and regulating the development and maturation of the lung. PR exists as two major isoforms, PRA and PRB. Differential expression of these PR isoforms reportedly contributes to different biological activities of the hormone. However, the distribution of the PR isoforms in human tissues has remained virtually unexplored. In this study, we immunolocalized PR expression in various human tissues using PR (1294) specific antibody, which is capable of detecting both PRA and PRB, and PRB (250H11) specific antibody. Tissues from the uterus, ovary, breast, placenta, prostate, testis, cerebrum, cerebellum, pituitary, spinal cord, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, heart, aorta, thymus, adrenal gland, thyroid, spleen, skin, and bone were examined in four different age groups (fetal, pediatric, young, and old) in male and female subjects. PR and PRB were detected in the nuclei of cells in the female reproductive system, in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of pituitary gland and pancreatic acinar cells, and only in the cytoplasm of cells in the testis, stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, lung, adrenal gland, and skin. Of particular interest, total PRB expression overlapped with that of total PR expression in most tissues but was negative in the female fetal reproductive system. The findings indicate that progesterone could affect diverse human organs differently than from reproductive organs. These findings provide new insights into the novel biological roles of progesterone in non-reproductive organs.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"
