"Peroxiredoxin-4 supplementation modulates the immune response, shapes the intestinal microbiome, and enhances AHPND resistance in Penaeus vannamei","Wanvimonsuk S., Somboonwiwat K.",2023-08-01,"Animals, Dietary Supplements, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Immunity, Innate, Penaeidae, Peroxiredoxins, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Intestinal microbiome, Peroxiredoxin-4, Shrimp","Peroxiredoxin-4 from Penaeus vannamei (LvPrx4) is considered a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can activate the expression of immune-related genes through the Toll pathway. We previously demonstrated that the recombinant LvPrx4 (rLvPrx4) can enhance shrimp resistance against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (VPAHPND), which causes great production losses in shrimp farming. Herein, we showed that the rLvPrx4 had a thermal tolerance of around 60 °C and that the ionic strength had no noticeable effect on its activity. We discovered that feeding a diet containing rLvPrx4 to shrimp for three weeks increased the expression of the immune-related genes LvPEN4 and LvVago5. Furthermore, pre-treatment with rLvPrx4 feeding could significantly prolong shrimp survival following the VPAHPND challenge. The shrimp intestinal microbiome was then characterized using PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and Illumina sequencing. Three weeks of rLvPrx4 supplementation altered the bacterial community structure (beta diversity) and revealed the induction of differentially abundant families, including Cryomorphaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Pirellulaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae, in the rLvPrx4 group. Metagenomic predictions indicated that some amino acid metabolism pathways, such as arginine and proline metabolism, and genetic information processing were significantly elevated in the rLvPrx4 group compared to the control group. This study is the first to describe the potential use of rLvPrx4 supplementation to enhance shrimp resistance to VPAHPND and alter the composition of a beneficial bacterial community in shrimp, making rLvPrx4 a promising feed supplement as an alternative to antibiotics for controlling VPAHPND infection in shrimp aquaculture.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"
Silicalite-1 zeolites for toluene sorption: Effects of the particle size and intracrystalline mesopores,"Chen D., Jiang Z., Jia Y., Wang X., Deng W., Chaianansutcharit S., Zhou A., Guo L.",2023-06-01,"Adsorption capacities, Breakthrough time, Diffusion limitations, Diffusion rate, Intracrystalline mesopore, Mesopore, Particles sizes, Silicalite-1, Sorption effects, Sorption properties, Intracrystalline mesopore, Particle size, Silicalite-1, Sorption properties, Toluene","The diffusion limitation of conventional silicalite-1 zeolites was addressed by particle size modulation and intracrystalline mesopore introduction, and the two effects on toluene sorption over silicalite-1 zeolites were systematically investigated. The diffusion rate of toluene increases as the particle size of silicalite-1 zeolites decreases, while the introduction of mesopores into zeolite crystals can further increase the diffusion rate. However, higher diffusion rates of toluene do not always result in better adsorption capacity. The breakthrough time of silicalite-1 zeolites with different particle sizes shows a “volcano” shape. And the breakthrough time decreases after the introduction of intracrystalline mesopores into silicalite-1 zeolites. For toluene adsorption capacity, the microporous structure plays the main role, the mesoporous structure mainly diminishes diffusion limitation and improves the utilization of micropores. The nanosized zeolites with dispersed intracrystalline mesopores exhibit the best dynamic adsorption capacity with the lowest diffusion limitation. The short microporous diffusion path and abundant micropore structure are the vital parameters for silicalite-1 zeolite adsorbents with high performance.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"
Investigating the synergistic effect of graphene nanoplatelets and fly ash on the mechanical properties and microstructure of calcium aluminate cement composites,"Win T.T., Prasittisopin L., Jongvivatsakul P., Likitlersuang S.",2023-11-01,"Calcium-aluminate cement, Cement composite, Dispersants, Graphene nanoplatelets, Mechanical performance, Properties and microstructures, Reinforcing effects, Reinforcing materials, Synergistic effect, Ultra-sonication, Calcium aluminate cement, Fly ash, Graphene nanoplatelets, Mechanical properties, Microstructure","Nanomaterials like graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) have been extensively applied in various fields as reinforcing materials offering excellent mechanical properties. However, for calcium aluminate cement (CAC) composites, the investigation of the GNP reinforcing effect is lacking. The synergistic effects of GNP and fly ash (FA) in CAC composites were evaluated in this study. The GNP was initially dispersed in mixing water using a dispersant combined with ultrasonication. The CAC composites with different GNP contents were prepared and their mechanical performance was investigated. In addition, partial replacement of CAC with FA was investigated for increasing sustainability and material cost of GNP-CAC composites. Their fresh properties, mechanical properties, and microstructural performance were analyzed using different techniques involving flowability, bulk density, volume of permeable void, water absorption, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, nitrogen adsorption, TGA, and SEM-EDS tests. Using FA and GNP in CAC composites offers a positive impact by significantly increasing their strengths. Optimized mix was achieved by replacing 20% of FA and adding 0.3% of GNP in CAC composites. Results revealed that the 20% FA replacement of cement with 0.3% GNP addition remarkably increased the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths at 28 days by about 57.2%, 35.5%, and 21.7%, respectively. The results suggest that using FA and GNP contributes to synergistic effects to promote the formation of silica tetrahedron in calcium aluminate silicate hydrate (CASH) gel, to refine pore characteristics, and to reduce conversion effects of metastable phases of CAC such that it can ultimately produce a green rapid-set high-performance concrete system.","mixing and separation, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

We report in-depth analyses of three-year safety, tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from ADAURA. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to osimertinib 80 mg or placebo once daily for up to 3 years. Safety assessments were performed at baseline, week 2, week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks until treatment completion or discontinuation, and 28 days after treatment was stopped. The SF-36 survey measured HRQoL at baseline, week 12, week 24, and every 24 weeks until recurrence, treatment completion or discontinuation. Data cutoff: April 11, 2022. Results: Safety and HRQoL analysis sets: osimertinib, n = 337 and n = 339; placebo, n = 343 each. Median (range) total exposure duration was longer with osimertinib versus placebo: 35.8 (0–38) versus 25.1 (0–39) months. Most adverse events (AEs) were first reported within 12 months of starting treatment (osimertinib 97%, placebo 86%). AEs leading to dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation were reported in 12%, 27% and 13% respectively of patients with osimertinib; 1%, 13% and 3% with placebo. Stomatitis and diarrhea were the most common AEs leading to osimertinib dose reduction or interruption; interstitial lung disease was the most common leading to osimertinib discontinuation (per protocol). There were no differences in time to deterioration for SF-36 physical, mental component summaries between osimertinib and placebo. Conclusions: No new safety signals were reported and HRQoL was maintained with 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib treatment. Combined with significant efficacy benefit, these data further support adjuvant osimertinib in stage IB to IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",medical,"Oncology, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine"

Studies have confirmed that hydrophilic modification can inhibit secondary reactions. Herein, hydroxyapatite (HAP)-supported Fe catalysts (Fe/HAP) were prepared using an impregnation method. The effect of the catalyst surface properties on the product distribution in CO hydrogenation was studied. The surface hydroxyl groups on Fe/HAP promoted the growth of carbon chains and improved olefin selectivity. The addition of Na as a promoter to Fe/HAP suppressed the formation of undesirable CH4, further improving the selectivity for light olefins and C5+ hydrocarbons. Compared with Fe2O3, Fe/HAP showed lower CH4 selectivity (15%) and higher C5+ selectivity (45%). Meanwhile, the Fe/HAP -Na catalysts with a higher selectivity of light olefins (with an O/P ratio reaching 4.51).","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
Microbiological Processes of Submicrometer Plastics Affecting Submerged Plant Growth in a Chronic Exposure Microcosm,"Lin L., Xu E.G., Liu M., Yang Y., Zhou A., Suyamud B., Pan X., Yuan W.",2023-01-10,"Community assembly, Freshwater environments, Microbiological process, Microplastic contamination, Microplastics, Rhizosphere microbial communities, Rhizosphere microorganisms, Submicrometers, Vallisneria, Vallisnerium denseserrulata, community assembly, freshwater environment, Microplastic contamination, rhizosphere microorganism, Vallisneria denseserrulata","Laboratory microcosms were designed to investigate the chronic influence of sedimental submicrometer plastics (sMPs) on the growth of an aquatic submerged plant, Vallisneria denseserrulata, and the involved microbiological processes. A dose-response experiment (0-1000 μg/g) showed that the growth of V. denseserrulata was not affected by 8-week exposure to sedimental sMPs (100 and 1000 nm) until the dose reached 1000 μg/g (i.e., 0.1% w/w) in wet sediment. The observed-effect dosage of 0.1% w/w sMPs significantly suppressed the plant height and biomass of V. denseserrulata by 19.19-22.26% and 10.81-15.80%, respectively. Changes in rhizosphere microbial community structure were detected under the observed-effect dosage, with relatively higher community diversity and weaker conflicting interaction. Sedimental sMPs decreased the stochasticity ratio of rhizosphere microbial community assembly by 11.0-27.7% compared with the control group. Furthermore, functional analysis showed that the ecological processes related to the carbon and nitrogen cycle were suppressed at the observed-effect dosage, among which phototrophy, nitrogen fixation, and nitrate reduction were significantly decreased by 68.30%, 23.56%, and 17.59%, respectively. Our results revealed the responses of an aquatic plant to sedimental sMPs exposures, and the adverse impacts of sMPs were associated with the ecological assembly processes of the rhizosphere microbial community.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Ecology, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Predicting Cost and Schedule Performance of Green Building Projects Based on Preproject Planning Efforts Using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis,"Khun-Anod K., Limsawasd C., Athigakunagorn N.",2023-09-01,"Cost and schedule, Cost performance, Green building projects, Green buildings, Multiple linear regression, Multiple linear regressions, Planning elements, Pre-project planning, Project definition rating index, Schedule performance, Cost performance, Green building projects, Multiple linear regression (MLR), Preproject planning, Project definition rating index (PDRI), Schedule performance","Although the building industry has attempted to adopt the green construction paradigm worldwide, evidence shows that it has not been fully implemented. Consequently, an efficient preplanning tool is pressingly needed to motivate project teams to adopt the green construction concept to increase project success. Other research has focused on essential planning elements that enable projects to achieve green building certification. However, only a few attempts have emphasized cost and schedule performance. This paper developed an efficient-yet-simple predictive model for predicting the project performance (cost and time) of green building construction projects, associated with the effectiveness of preproject planning at the initial stage represented in terms of the Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI). The analysis was conducted in three steps: (1) identifying significant planning elements affecting cost and schedule performance using an independent t-test, (2) constructing predictive models by applying multiple linear regression, and (3) validating the constructed models using a paired sample t-test. Sample data from 17 certified green buildings were utilized. The results identified 10 planning elements that differed significantly between under- and overbudget projects, related to the project requirements, procurement strategy, schedule control, project design, and safety considerations. Similarly, six elements were identified for schedule performance that were classified under the business strategy, economic analysis, and values analysis. Then, predictive models were proposed with coefficients of determination of 0.94 for cost performance and 0.60 for schedule performance. The developed models not only contributed to the preliminary assessment of the possible cost and schedule performance for the current level of a project team's preplanning efforts but also could be further adapted for exploratory evaluation of expected outcomes due to a certain level of improvement in preproject planning.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, arts","Architecture, Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Visual Arts and Performing Arts"

However, the energy resources rapidly decrease for responding to the global need. Many previous researchers suggest the ideas for solving this situation and the most interesting solution is the heat integration which intends to produce cost-effective energy with minimal impact on the environment. Energy integration thus should be noticeable for the industry process to minimize the loss along the industrial process. The ethanol production process is interested in this study because it can add value to agricultural products like cassava which is an industrial crop in several countries and produces ethanol products that can decrease the usage of gasoline. Here, the heat integration model was developed for the ethanol production process by using low to medium-pressure steam. For the simulation model, the ethanol production process used the cellulose content as the main inlet component to be easy for applicable corresponding to feed casava cellulosic substances. The process contained three sections including enzymatic hydrolysis, simultaneous saccharification fermentation (SSF), and fractional distillation. The quality and quantity of low to medium-pressure steam were investigated for maintaining the operation of the enzymatic hydrolysis reactor by varying steam pressure between 1–2 atm and steam temperature between 100–105 °C. The results achieved the methodology to find optimum conditions by the ratio between steam flow rate and product quantity. The best case could reduce 6.49% of the excessive usage of low to medium-pressure steam which pointed out the way to use the energy efficiently.","mixing and separation, energy",Energy (all)

Since the process of screening AMPs from a large number of peptides is still high-priced and time-consuming, the development of a precise and rapid computer-aided tool is essential for preliminary AMPs selection ahead of laboratory experiments. In this study, we proposed AMPs recognition models using a new peptide encoding method called amino acid index weight (AAIW). Four AMPs recognition models including antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal were trained based on datasets combined from the DRAMP and other published databases. These models achieved high performance compared to the preceding AMPs recognition models when evaluated on two independent test sets.

Following the successful experimental synthesis of Ni atom doping to GDY monolayer, the CRR activity of double–atom catalysts was evaluated, including homo and hetero metal-Ni doped on the GDY monolayer (MNi@GDY where M is Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) using the density functional theory calculations. The valence-electron number of the catalytic center shows a strong positive correlation to the limiting potentials in the volcano plot. NiNi@GDY is the most promising candidate for converting CO2 to produce CH4 with a remarkable low limiting potential of −0.28 V, which is better than Ni@GDY and Ni3@GDY counterparts. NiNi@GDY shows excellent thermal stability and ability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, showing its high selectivity to CH4.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

However, most of them are established in developed economies. There is a scarcity of practitioners’ perspectives on their implementation process, difficulties, and outcomes in other socio-cultural conditions. Therefore, this research reflects the realization of these principles in Thailand. It does so by literature review, hosting four public discussion forums in Bangkok, thematic analysis, and data triangulation with case studies. Despite many hospital design principles established, this research shows that it is still a chaotic task to execute them in different contexts. As some may conflict with the national health system, practitioners have to both scrutinize the principles and acquaint themselves with the existing system before balancing, prioritizing, and deciding whether to follow, adjust, or deny the principles. This decision-making process also varies from hospital to hospital due to health disparities, site constraints, local culture, and laws and regulations. This research forms an understanding of healthcare facility design in developing economies and reveals some dilemmas. It also paves the way for future research on hospital design principles localization.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology, arts","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Cultural Studies, Building and Construction, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)"

Due to the lack of cross-reactivity of these antibodies in dogs, a specific canine PD-1/PD-L1 antibody is required. The aim of this study is to develop mouse anti-canine PD-L1 (cPD-L1) monoclonal antibodies and characterize their in vitro properties. Six mice were immunized with recombinant cPD-L1 with a fusion of human Fc tag. The hybridoma clones that successfully generated anti-cPD-L1 antibodies and had neutralizing activity were selected for monoclonal antibody production. Antibody properties were tested by immunosorbent assay, surface plasmon resonance, and immunohistochemistry. Four hybridomas were effectively bound and blocked to recombinant cPD-L1 and cPD-1-His-protein, respectively. Candidate mouse monoclonal antibodies worked efficiently on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of canine cancers, including cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, mammary carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and malignant melanomas.

We employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design, in which 63 individuals aged 18–45 years were assigned to receive either a synbiotic supplement or placebo for 12 weeks. The synbiotic group consumed a daily dose of 37 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of a unique blend of seven different probiotics, along with 2 g of fructooligosaccharides, while the placebo group consumed 2 g of maltodextrin daily. Assessments were performed at baseline, week 6, and the end of the study. The results of the study indicated that synbiotic supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in waist circumference and body fat percentage compared to the baseline measurements, as observed at 12 weeks. At the end of the study, there were no significant differences observed in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, or percentage of body fat between the synbiotic group and the placebo group. An analysis of plasma antioxidant capacity revealed that synbiotic supplementation caused a significant increase in Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and a concomitant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) in the test group when compared to the placebo. For the gut microbiota analysis, synbiotic supplementation significantly decreased Firmicutes abundance and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio at week 12 as compared to the placebo group. Nevertheless, the synbiotic group did not exhibit any substantial alterations in other biochemical blood parameters compared to the placebo group.

However, the clinical relevance of therapeutic effects in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and dyssynchrony remains unknown. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until June 2022. Data from each study was combined using a random-effects model, the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird, to calculate standard mean differences and pooled incidence ratio, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 772 HFrEF patients were analyzed from 15 observational studies per protocol. The success rate of LBBAP implantation was 94.8% (95% CI 89.9–99.6, I2 = 79.4%), which was strongly correlated with shortening QRS duration after LBBAP implantation, with a mean difference of −48.10 ms (95% CI −60.16 to −36.05, I2 = 96.7%).

In this work, imidazolium-based chiral ionic liquids with a (–)-menthol substituent on the cation 1-alkyl-3-[(1R,2S,5R)-(–)-menthoxymethyl]imidazolium chlorides were studied in aqueous solutions. Their volumetric properties and electrical conductivity were measured to better understand their hydration and dissociation. The bulk experimental data were interpreted in the light of MD simulations that enabled us to obtain spatial and radial distribution functions and to estimate the volumetric and transport properties of the studied systems. Experimental data of density and conductivity were analyzed by methods of mathematical gnostics which is naturally robust, is valid for small data set (no coverage factor needed), and does not require prior knowledge of the distribution of the measurement errors. It is therefore applicable in cases where tests of data normality are statistically insignificant or even fail.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Modeling local interfacial area concentration for adiabatic and boiling bubbly flows,"Hibiki T., Rassame S.",2023-11-05,"Bubble coalescence, Bubbles breakup, Bubbly flow, Coalescence rate, Drag forces, Heat and mass transfer, Interfacial area concentrations, Interfacial drag force, Interfacial heat transfer, Subcooled boiling flow, Bubbly flow, Interfacial area concentration, Interfacial drag force, Interfacial heat transfer, Subcooled boiling flow","Bubbly flows appear in various heat and mass transfer systems, and interfacial area concentration (IAC) is a critical geometrical parameter for the flows. The fidelity of accurately computed IACs is essential for reliable three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analyses of bubbly flows because the IACs directly affect the interfacial force and interfacial heat and mass transfer rates. This study targeted development of a simple and robust model for predicting the local IAC under steady-state bubbly flows with and without phase change. The dependent two-phase flow parameters of the IAC were derived by considering bubble coalescence and breakup rates. The IAC transport equation simplified under steady-state conditions was used for this purpose. A simplified turbulence model was introduced to formulate the energy dissipation rate per unit mass necessary for computing the bubble coalescence and breakup rates. The prediction accuracy of the local IAC model for bubbly flow conditions with area-average void fraction values less than 10 % was estimated to be 20 % based on 803 local data collected for adiabatic air–water bubbly flows in round tubes with diameters ranging from 9.0 to 200 mm. The model was also applied to predict the local IAC data of subcooled boiling flows in heated channels with hydraulic diameters ranging from 18.5 to 22.2 mm. The test conditions covered pressures from 0.1 to 1.46 MPa. The model prediction accuracy for bubbly flow conditions with area-average void fraction values less than 10 % was estimated to be 40 % based on 155 subcooled boiling flow data.","energy, engineering, coastal engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Chitosan Oligosaccharide Promotes Junction Barrier through Modulation of PI3K/AKT and ERK Signaling Intricate Interplay in T84 Cells,"Mehmood T., Pichyangkura R., Muanprasat C.",2023-04-01,"AKT, Barriers functions, Chitosan oligosaccharide, Diarrhea, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Junction barrier, Post treatment, Pre-incubation, Transepithelial electrical resistances, Wortmannin, AKT, chitosan oligosaccharide, diarrhea, ERK, junction barrier, SC79, wortmannin","Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is a breakdown product of chitin, a polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. COS promotes barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. However, the exact mechanism of COS-induced barrier function remains unknown. This study was aimed to explore the intricate signaling cascades in the junction barrier induced by COS (100 μg/mL) in human intestinal epithelial cells (T84 cells). COS (100 μg/mL) promoted tight junction assembly and increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). COS inhibited FITC-dextran flux in T84 cell monolayers at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 24 h post treatment. In addition, the effect of COS on TEER and FITC-dextran flux was abrogated by pre-incubation of wortmannin (2 μM), an AKT (protein kinase B) inhibitor, at 2 h and 4 h post treatment, indicating that COS-induced tight junction integrity was mediated at least in part by AKT activation. COS-induced TEER was amplified at 24 h and 48 h post treatment by pre-incubation with SC79 (2.5 μM), an AKT activator. Moreover, COS induced inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in T84 cells. Wortmannin and SC79 pre-incubation promoted ERK activation and ERK inhibition, respectively, suggesting that COS-induced ERK inhibition was mediated by AKT. Collectively, this study reveals that COS promotes junction barrier integrity via regulating PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling intricate interplay in T84 cell monolayers. COS may be beneficial in promoting junction barrier in intestinal disorders.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Various properties of the prepared glass scintillators were evaluated through density, X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, transmittance, photoluminescence, decay time, X-ray-induced luminescence, and proton-induced luminescence measurements. The highest density of the fabricated glass scintillators reached 4.31 g/cm3. The X-ray-induced luminescence showed a broad emission band centered at approximately 400 nm, and the decay time was less than 30 ns. The glass scintillators were irradiated by a proton beam with a beam energy of 100–115 MeV. It was found that the glass scintillators emitted light at almost the same wavelength as that of the X-ray-induced luminescence. Moreover, the energy deposition inside the fabricated glass scintillators was simulated using GATE simulation and compared with the results obtained for proton-induced luminescence. The energy deposition obtained from the simulation showed the same trend as that for the fraction of light emitted from the proton irradiation measurement. Therefore, these fabricated glass scintillators can be used as calorimeter in medical physics and other applications related to proton or X-ray irradiation.","fluidex; related topics, physics","Radiation, Instrumentation"

We aimed to investigate the effects of vericiguat, an sGC stimulator, on cardiac function, blood pressure (BP), cardiac mitochondrial quality, and cardiac fibrosis in rat models of chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). Materials and methods: We surgically induced MR in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats and performed sham procedures on 10 rats (negative control). Four weeks post-surgery, we randomly divided the MR rats into two groups: MR group and MR + vericiguat group. Vericiguat (0.5 mg/kg, PO) was administered once a day via oral gavage for 8 weeks, while the sham and MR groups received equivalent volumes of drinking water instead. We took echocardiography and BP measurements at baseline (4 weeks post-surgery) and at the end of study (8 weeks after treatment). At the study end, all rats were euthanized and their hearts were immediately collected, weighed, and used for histopathology and mitochondrial quality assessments. Key findings: Vericiguat preserved cardiac functions and structural remodeling in the MR rats, with significantly lower systolic BPs than baseline values (P < 0.05). Additionally, vericiguat significantly improved the mitochondrial quality by attenuating ROS production, depolarization and swelling when comparing the values in both groups (P < 0.05). The fibrosis area also significantly decreased in the MR + vericiguat group (P < 0.05). Significance: Vericiguat demonstrated cardioprotective effects on cardiac function, BP, and fibrosis by preserving mitochondrial quality in rats with HF due to MR.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

The phosphorescent compound was used as a lighting material for LEP development. However, using the phosphorescent compound for LEPs development required optimization and phytotoxicity evaluation. Strontium aluminate (SrAl2O4) is a phosphorescent compound that can glow for a long time and is easily recharged by visible light. In this study, using SrAl2O4 to develop LEPs was evaluated. Additionally, plant stress under SrAl2O4 was investigated. Metabolomic analysis can explain the possible mechanism of plants’ stress under SrAl2O4. After, injecting 3 mL of 5 % (w/v) SrAl2O4 products 1, 2, and 3 into the stem of Ipomoea aquatica, the result showed that SrAl2O4 products 2 and 3 caused oxidative stress. The metabolomic analysis also indicated that I. aquatica responded to SrAl2O4 product 1 by increasing pipecolic acid and salicylic acid, while I. aquatica injected with SrAl2O4 products 2 and 3 showed a decrease in salicylic acid around 0.005 and 0.061-fold, respectively, compared to control plants. and an excess accumulation of MDA around 10.00–12.00 μmol g−1 FW.

Ce0.9M0.1O2 nanospindles (where M is a transition metal, i.e., Zr, Fe, Cu and Co) were prepared by a template-free hydrothermal method. The substitution of different valence and size cations, including Zr4+, Fe3+, Cu2+ and Co2+, for Ce4+ sites in the fluorite CeO2 lattice induced the defect formation of surface-active sites of exposed Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies through the charge compensation and redox pair reactions. Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 solid solution with well-preserved spindle shaped morphology showed the highest catalytic performance by giving DMC yield at 3.56 mmol.gcat−1 with 100% DMC selectivity. The improvement of catalytic activity was attributed to the higher proportion of surface defect sites and variation of acid-base properties caused by the integration of Fe dopants into CeO2 ionic system.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The resultant epoxy polymers showed flexible nature, thermal stability (e.g., thermal decomposition temperature of 300°C). Furthermore, the epoxy polymers possessed the anti-microbial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus The molecular weight of the epoxy prepolymer also strongly affected the drying property, suggesting that the drying time can be controlled by the molecular weight of the prepolymer. Thermal treatment of the polymers as post-curing was effective approach to improve the hardness, thermal stability, and mechanical strength.

The lipid content of CU-CV7 grown on a glucose-based medium was 26.77 ± 0.56% of the cell dry weight (CDW). Strain CU-CV7 is a great CBP-enabling microbe because of its native capacity to generate lipid (22.19 ± 0.72% of CDW) while simultaneously expressing endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase activities (0.33, 0.06, and 0.20 IU/mL, respectively) on carboxymethylcellulose. Strain CU-CV7 was demonstrated to be a lipase-producing strain and could potentially be employed as a biocatalyst to produce biodiesel with a maximum extracellular lipase activity of 1.47 IU/mL. The lipid production from 13 types of grass without the need for additional cellulase was evaluated. The highest lipid yield was obtained from Napier (Lampang ecotype; 1.01 ± 0.14 g/L) and was comprised of a high proportion of saturated fatty acids. The predicted biodiesel properties were found to be suitable with respect to the biodiesel international standards. Thus, lipid production from these grasses by CU-CV7 appears to open a new path for the renewable biodiesel industry and to satisfy the SDG 7 and SDG 13 goals.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Currently, the LED conversion formulae proposed in 2010 by Tomlinson et al. based on a systematic review are predominantly used. However, new drugs with established and novel mechanisms of action and novel formulations of longstanding drugs have been developed since 2010. Therefore, consensus proposals for updated LED conversion formulae are needed. Objectives: To update LED conversion formulae based on a systematic review. Methods: The MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase databases were searched from January 2010 to July 2021. Additionally, in a standardized process according to the GRADE grid method, consensus proposals were issued for drugs with scarce data on levodopa dose equivalency. Results: The systematic database search yielded 3076 articles of which 682 were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Based on these data and the standardized consensus process, we present proposals for LED conversion formulae for a wide range of drugs that are currently available for the pharmacotherapy of PD or are expected to be introduced soon.

However, its mechanism of action in adipocytes remains unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate how cyanidin inhibits adipocyte formation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Cells were cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium supplemented with cyanidin and examined for adipogenesis, cell viability, and adipocyte gene expression using Oil Red O staining, MTT assay, and RT-qPCR. Real-time Ca2+ imaging analysis was performed in living cells to elucidate cyanidin's mechanism of action. The results demonstrated that cyanidin (1–50 μM) supplementation to the adipogenic medium inhibited adipogenesis by downregulating adipogenic marker gene expression (PPARγ, C/EBPα, adiponectin, and aP2) without affecting cell viability after 4 days of treatment. Stimulation of cells with cyanidin (30–100 μM) increased intracellular Ca2+ in a concentration dependent manner with peak calcium increases at 50 μM. Pretreatment of cells with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor blocker 2-APB, and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin abolished the Ca2+ increases by cyanidin.

However, devices consisting of Ni-rich materials are less thermally stable, and several factors hinder their use in practical high-energy–density applications. Herein, an approach for plasma-modified NCM811 with TiN is proposed to effectively improve the electrochemical performance and stabilize the cathode–electrolyte interface reaction. In addition, the following aspects are systematically investigated using different techniques: (i) physicochemical properties; (ii) Li storage performance, particularly, cyclic/rate capacity, kinetic behavior of the lithium-ion diffusivities, and electrical conductivity; and (iii) key factor for improving the electrochemical performance through ex-situ/in-situ investigations. The NCM811-TiN/graphite pouch cell displays a high reversible capacity of 17.5 mAh and sustains over 200 cycles at 1C. Comprehensive characterization and probes indicate that the TiN interface with the NCM electrode enhances thermal stability, cyclic capacity, and rate stability without changing the bulk structure and morphology. Hence, these findings facilitate the practical use of safe and high-energy–density Li-ion batteries.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

However, negative effect was found when tungsten was incorporated in the 1%Al-doped SiO2 as the catalysts contained more crystalline WOx, lower tetrahedral species, and lower Lewis acid sites, compared to the W-imp 1Al2O3/SiO2 prepared by impregnation. Incorporating both W and Al in the SiO2 by sol-gel method may lead to suppression of bridge hydroxyl Si(OH)Al group, as a consequence more crystalline WOx was formed. Nevertheless, the abundance of Bronsted and Lewis acid was found to play important role in the propene metathesis and the secondary metathesis of 1-butene reactions than surface silanol and the presence of tetrahedral tungsten oxide species on the 1%Al-doped SiO2 supported catalysts.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

Currently, most radiopharmaceuticals are based on small molecules with targeting ability. However, some concerns over their stability or non-specific interactions leading to off-target localization are among the major challenges that need to be overcome. Emulsion technology has great potential for the fabrication of carrier systems for radiopharmaceuticals. It can be used to create particles with different compositions, structures, sizes, and surface characteristics from a wide range of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) materials, which allows their functionality to be tuned for specific applications. In particular, it is possible to carry out surface modifications to introduce targeting and stealth properties, as well as to control the particle dimensions to manipulate diffusion and penetration properties. Moreover, emulsion preparation methods are usually simple, economic, robust, and scalable, which makes them suitable for medical applications. In this review, we highlight the potential of emulsion technology in nuclear medicine for developing targeted radionuclide therapies, for use as radiosensitizers, and for application in radiotracer delivery in gamma imaging techniques.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, pharmacology, chemistry","Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Organic Chemistry"
Numerical investigation on the responses of existing single piles due to adjacent twin tunneling considering the lagging distance,"Phutthananon C., Lertkultanon S., Jongpradist P., Duangsano O., Likitlersuang S., Jamsawang P.",2023-08-01,"Existing pile, Finite element analyse, Numerical investigations, Pile response, Side by sides, Single piles, Three-dimensional numerical analysis, Tunnel face, Tunnel lagging distance, Twin tunnels, Existing pile, Finite element analysis, Pile responses, Tunnel lagging distance, Twin tunnels","This paper presents an assessment of the influence of the lagging distance between two horizontal tunnel faces of the side-by-side twin tunnels on the responses of the adjacent existing single pile by a series of three-dimensional numerical analyses. Two different relative positions between the pile tip and the tunnel are considered to cover the short and long pile behaviors. The responses of the existing pile in terms of pile head settlement, axial force, lateral movement and bending moment are considered and discussed. The numerical results indicate that the lagging distance between twin tunnel faces significantly affects not only the soil movements but also the responses of the existing single pile. The critical case that produces unsatisfactory pile responses due to twin tunneling is when the lagging distance between the second tunnel and the preceding tunnel equals to the shield length. It is recommended that the lagging distance be not less than three times of shield length when the two tunnels need to be concurrently excavated.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Although there are numerous conventional manufacturing approaches for processing BMGs, the most commonly used like copper-mould casting have some limitations. It is not easy to manage and control the critical cooling rate, especially when the fabrication of complex BMG geometries is involved. Other limitations of these techniques include the size constraints, non-flexibility, and the tooling and accessories are costly. The emergence of additive manufacturing (AM) has opened another promising manufacturing route for processing BMGs. AM processes, particularly laser powder-bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) builds parts layer-by-layer and successively fused the powder-melted feedstocks using prescribed computer-controlled laser scanner system, thereby forming a BMGs part upon sufficiently rapid cooling to ensure the glass forming-ability. PBF-LB/M overcomes the limitations of the pre-existing BMGs processing techniques by not only improving the part size, but also produces exceptionally complex structures and patient-specific implants. This review article aims to summarise and discuss the mechanism of BMGs formation through PBF-LB/M for biomedical applications and to highlight the current scientific and technological challenges as well as the future research perspectives towards overcoming the pore-mediated microcracks, partial crystallisation, brittleness and BMG size constraint.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

Microalgae are a valorous source of proteins that can be employed as functional, nutritional, and remedial supplies. An effective microwave-assisted extraction method based on ionic liquids has been utilized in this study to extract proteins from microalgae Nannochloropsis oceanica biomass. The study of microwave-assisted extraction was carried out under varying conditions of temperature (30–80 °C), extraction time (5–35 min), and IL concentration (0–4.67% w/v). Among the six types of examined IL, choline acetate was an effective one for extracting total protein from microalgae biomass. The highest protein yield was obtained at 0.5 g microalgae, 2% w/v [Ch][Ac], and 40 °C for 30 min, representing 26.35% of protein yield and 65.06% of total protein extracted from the Nannochloropsis oceanica biomass. Meanwhile, conventional method of Soxhlet resulted in the protein yield of 0.63%. Only 1.56% of total Nannochloropsis oceanica protein was extracted by extraction method of Soxhlet which uses the hazardous solvent. The outcomes illustrated the superiority of [Ch][Ac]-based microwave-assisted extraction to conventional methods. This innovative procedure is recommended to have significant usage for the separation of proteins. The outcomes from this study would be beneficial in recognizing and harnessing significant microalgae biochemical from IL-based microwave-assisted extraction process to develop new and improved bioproduct technologies.

The impact of the autologous graft CD34+ dose on patient outcomes is unknown. We wanted to analyze the relationship between CD34+ dose, total nucleated cell (TNC) dose, and clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), endothelial-injury complications (EIC), and time to neutrophil engraftment in children undergoing autologous HSCT for CNSTs. A retrospective analysis of the CIBMTR database was performed. Children aged <10 years who underwent autologous HSCT between 2008 to 2018 for an indication of CNST were included. An optimal cut point was identified for patient age, CD34+ cell dose, and TNC, using the maximum likelihood method and PFS as an endpoint. Univariable analysis for PFS, OS, and relapse was described using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Cox models were fitted for PFS and OS outcomes. Cause-specific hazards models were fitted for relapse and NRM. One hundred fifteen patients met the inclusion criteria. A statistically significant association was identified between autograft CD34+ content and clinical outcomes. Children receiving >3.6×106/kg CD34+ cells experienced superior PFS (p = .04) and OS (p = .04) compared to children receiving ≤3.6 × 106/kg. Relapse rates were lower in patients receiving >3.6 × 106/kg CD34+ cells (p = .05). Higher CD34+ doses were not associated with increased NRM (p = .59). Stratification of CD34+ dose by quartile did not reveal any statistically significant differences between quartiles for 3-year PFS (p = .66), OS (p = .29), risk of relapse (p = .57), or EIC (p = .87). There were no significant differences in patient outcomes based on TNC, and those receiving a TNC >4.4 × 108/kg did not experience superior PFS (p = .26), superior OS (p = .14), reduced risk of relapse (p = .37), or reduced NRM (p = .25). Children with medulloblastoma had superior PFS (p < .001), OS (p = .01), and relapse rates (p = .001) compared to those with other CNS tumor types. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 10 days versus 12 days in the highest and lowest infused CD34+ quartiles, respectively. For children undergoing autologous HSCT for CNSTs, increasing CD34+ cell dose was associated with significantly improved OS and PFS, and lower relapse rates, without increased NRM or EICs.","medical, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Molecular Medicine, Hematology, Cell Biology, Transplantation"

Geopolymers with a low quantity of alkali activator produced by the compression process are one way to bring this technology to industry because of the higher strength and lower efflorescence of the product. In this work, calcined kaolin residue-based geopolymers with a low alkali activator content were synthesized by various Si/Al mole ratios with soluble silicate from Na2SiO3 to adjust the Si ratio. The effects of Si/Al mole ratios on the structural transformation, microstructure, and compressive strength of geopolymers containing low alkali activator content were studied. The structural transformation and microstructure of geopolymers were characterized by NMR, SEM, and BET, and the compressive strength was assessed using a mechanical testing machine. The results present that geopolymer synthesized with various Si/Al mole ratios of precursor materials impacted the change in polymerization degree of silicate species (Qn(mAl)) and aluminate species. The Q4(4Al) and Q4(3Al) structures were transformed into the Q4(2Al) structure, and the content of the AlIV structure decreased when the Si/Al mole ratio of geopolymer was increased to 1.58. However, the contents of Q4(4Al) and AlIV structures increased again when the geopolymer had a Si/Al mole ratio of 1.62. SEM/EDX and BET results of geopolymers presented denser matrices, more amorphous aluminosilicate gels, and higher Si/Al ratios in aluminosilicate gels, while the pore size and pore volume were quite small when the Si/Al mole ratio of precursor materials was increased. In contrast, the highest Si/Al mole ratio of 1.62 showed different properties. The compressive strength of geopolymer was maximized at a Si/Al mole ratio of 1.58, and the decline in compressive strength of geopolymer with higher Si/Al mole ratio was related to the contents of Si–O–Si, Si–O–Al, and Al–O–Al bonds, content of aluminosilicate gels, and properties of the microstructure. The geopolymer synthesis using calcined kaolin residue and low alkali activator content is considered an eco–friendly process, which uses waste materials and less chemicals, and obtains high-strength products.","mixing and separation, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

However, supported Pd catalysts are easily deactivated by sulfur-containing FAMEs. Herein, the performance and sulfur poisoning of Pd-Pt/SiO2, Pd-Pt/γ-Al2O3, and Pd-Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts containing 3–10 nm Pt-Pd alloy particles and possessing surface acidity of 0.1–2.4 mmol NH3 g−1 were examined. Pd-Pt/SiO2 with large Pd-Pt alloy particles (10 nm) and weak acidity (0.1 mmol NH3 g−1) favored the selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated-FAME (poly-FAME) to mono-FAME, while Pd-Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pd-Pt/SiO2-Al2O3 with smaller Pd-Pt alloy particles and stronger acidity favored the formation of saturated-FAME. These Pd-Pt catalysts were poisoned when using FAME containing 3.4–5.3 ppm of sulfur. However, the performance of the Pd-Pt/SiO2 catalyst physically mixed with γ-Al2O3 did not deteriorate when using a feedstock containing 5.3 ppm of sulfur because the acidic γ-Al2O3 support could adsorb sulfur. Thus, the combination of acidic γ-Al2O3 and Pd-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be efficiently used to produce mono-FAME through the selective hydrogenation of commercial biodiesel fuels containing high poly-FAME concentrations.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

The material small-scale effect is consistently represented by the stress-driven nonlocal integral model and the element equation is constructed within the framework of flexibility-based finite element formulation. The merits of both stress-driven nonlocal integral model and flexibility-based finite element formulation render the proposed nonlocal frame element “consistent” and “exact”. Therefore, the “one-element-per-member” modeling approach is applicable. The modified Tonti’s diagram is utilized to show the overview of the element formulation and to summarize the formulation step. The element state determination process as well as the displacement recovery procedure are also discussed. Three numerical examples are employed to show accuracy, characteristics, and applications of the proposed nonlocal frame element. The first example shows the model capability to eliminate the “constant-force” paradoxical responses inherent to the Eringen’s nonlocal frame model and the simplified strain-gradient frame model; the second presents and characterizes the essence of the material small-scale effect on global and local responses of a propped-cantilever nanobeam; the third investigates the material small-scale effect on the tensile response of an auxetic metamaterial.

Women with diabetes, stroke, cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, weak/failing kidneys, or amputation were excluded. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the association between breastfeeding and DSP. Results: Among 798 participants, 386 (44.30%) reported breastfeeding history and 51 (5.29%) were defined as having DSP using the monofilament test. A significant inverse association was observed between breastfeeding and DSP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11-0.79; p = 0.017) after adjusting for other confounding variables. In subgroup analysis, this adjusted association was observed only in the obese group (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06-0.73, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Breastfeeding was found to have potential benefits in the presence of DSP in postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years, and obesity modified the association between breastfeeding and DSP.

Utilization of agricultural waste to herbicide removal: Magnetic BEA zeolite adsorbents prepared by dry-gel conversion using rice husk ash–derived SiO2 for paraquat removal,"Phouthavong V., Hagio T., Park J.-H., Nijpanich S., Srihirunthanon T., Chantanurak N., Duangkhai K., Rujiravanit R., Chounlamany V., Phomkeona K., Kong L., Li L., Ichino R.",2023-08-01,"Beta zeolite, Dry gel conversion, Herbicide removal, Magnetic beta zeolite, Paraquat, Rice-husk ash, SiO 2, Sustainable utilization, Synthesised, Zeolite adsorbents, Dry-gel conversion, Herbicide removal, Magnetic BEA zeolite, Paraquat, Rice husk ash","This study presents a method that will allow for the sustainable utilization of rice husk ash-SiO2 (RHAS), an agricultural-waste–derived material, as a bulky solid SiO2 source in the zeolite beta (BEA)/Fe3O4 composite (magnetic RHAS-BEA) synthesis via a dry-gel conversion method for the removal of paraquat, a typical herbicide, from aqueous solutions. Ultrasonic waves were used to facilitate the formation of uniform Fe3O4-contained dry precursor gel before converting to the magnetic BEA zeolite composite for the first time. Magnetic RHAS-BEA was then characterized and compared with a non-magnetic sample (RHAS-BEA) using X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. In terms of adsorption, we found that paraquat had a high adsorption rate on the samples and conformed to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption behavior of paraquat on the synthesized RHAS-BEA and magnetic RHAS-BEA obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The synthesized adsorbents were reusable for at least four cycles, via thermal regeneration at 450 °C. The inclusion of Fe3O4 particles in magnetic RHAS-BEA disrupted neither the crystallization of the BEA zeolite nor the adsorption of paraquat and enabled easy collection via an external magnet.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Development of Microencapsulation-Hybrid Jig Separation Technique as a Clean Coal Technology,"Phengsaart T., Park I., Pasithbhattarabhorn J., Srichonphaisarn P., Kertbundit C., Phumkokrux N., Juntarasakul O., Tabelin C.B., Hiroyoshi N., Ito M.",2023-03-01,"Acid mine-drainage, Clean-coal technologies, Hydrophilics, Hydrophobics, Jig separation, Particle size ranges, Required time, Separation efficiency, Separation techniques, Target materials, acid mine drainage, coal, jig, microencapsulation, pyrite","In this study, the microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation technique was developed to improve the separation efficiency of pyrite and coal in the particle size range of 1–4 mm where conventional jig separation becomes inefficient. A hybrid jig is a gravity concentrator combining the concepts of jig separation and flotation to stratify particles based on their apparent specific gravity. Meanwhile, microencapsulation—a technique that encapsulates target materials with a protective coating—was applied to render pyrite hydrophilic and improve its separation from hydrophobic coal. The results showed that the required time for separation in the hybrid jig (0.5 min) was shorter than in conventional jig (2 min). Moreover, the effects of particle size on separation efficiency were reduced when a hybrid jig is used. However, the separation efficiency of hybrid jig separation was lower than that of the conventional jig because attachment of bubbles occurred to both pyrite and coal, which are hydrophobic. Using the microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation technique, the separation of coal and pyrite was significantly improved (~100%) because of the formation of hydrophilic iron phosphate coatings on pyrite that limited bubble attachment. This means that microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation is a promising clean coal technology that not only enhances the separation efficiency of the hybrid jig but also passivates pyrite and limits AMD formation in the tailings/rejects.","energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Stiffness-Tunable Hydrogel-Sandwich Culture Modulates the YAP-Mediated Mechanoresponse in Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell Embryoid Bodies and Augments Cardiomyocyte Differentiation,"Nattasit P., Niibe K., Yamada M., Ohori-Morita Y., Limraksasin P., Tiskratok W., Yamamoto M., Egusa H.",2023-07-01,"Cardiomyocytes, Culture systems, Differentiation, Embryoid body, Induced pluripotent stem cells, Mechanical cues, Microenvironmental factors, Polyacrylamide hydrogels, Substrate stiffness, Tunables, Animals, Cell Differentiation, Embryoid Bodies, Hydrogels, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, Mechanotransduction, Cellular, Mice, Myocytes, Cardiac, cardiomyocyte, differentiation, embryoid body, hydrogel, induced pluripotent stem cells, stiffness","Microenvironmental factors, including substrate stiffness, regulate stem cell behavior and differentiation. However, the effects of substrate stiffness on the behavior of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- derived embryoid bodies (EB) remain unclear. To investigate the effects of mechanical cues on iPSC-EB differentiation, a 3D hydrogel-sandwich culture (HGSC) system is developed that controls the microenvironment surrounding iPSC-EBs using a stiffness-tunable polyacrylamide hydrogel assembly. Mouse iPSC-EBs are seeded between upper and lower polyacrylamide hydrogels of differing stiffness (Young's modulus [E’] = 54.3 ± 7.1 kPa [hard], 28.1 ± 2.3 kPa [moderate], and 5.1 ± 0.1 kPa [soft]) and cultured for 2 days. HGSC induces stiffness-dependent activation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) mechanotransducer and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in the iPSC-EBs. Moreover, moderate-stiffness HGSC specifically upregulates the mRNA and protein expression of ectoderm and mesoderm lineage differentiation markers in iPSC-EBs via YAP-mediated mechanotransduction. Pretreatment of mouse iPSC-EBs with moderate-stiffness HGSC promotes cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation and structural maturation of myofibrils. The proposed HGSC system provides a viable platform for investigating the role of mechanical cues on the pluripotency and differentiation of iPSCs that can be beneficial for research into tissue regeneration and engineering.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Screening of lung nodules is essential for early recognition to facilitate treatment that improves the rate of patient rehabilitation. An increase in accuracy during lung cancer detection is vital for sustaining the rate of patient persistence, even though several research works have been conducted in this research domain. Moreover, the classical system fails to segment cancer cells of different sizes accurately and with excellent reliability. This paper proposes a sooty tern optimization algorithm-based deep learning (DL) model for diagnosing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours with increased accuracy. We discuss various algorithms for diagnosing models that adopt the Otsu segmentation method to perfectly isolate the lung nodules. Then, the sooty tern optimization algorithm (SHOA) is adopted for partitioning the cancer nodules by defining the best characteristics, which aids in improving diagnostic accuracy. It further utilizes a local binary pattern (LBP) for determining appropriate feature retrieval from the lung nodules. In addition, it adopts CNN and GRU-based classifiers for identifying whether the lung nodules are malignant or non-malignant depending on the features retrieved during the diagnosing process. The experimental results of this SHOA-optimized DNN model achieved an accuracy of 98.32%, better than the baseline schemes used for comparison.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The second stage involves molecular-orientations and molecular-orbitals energy-levels (MOrbE). The components of a reaction must be compatible in terms MRec and MOrbE. Therefore, the comprehension of photocatalytic systems applied in wastewater treatment will be improved if the MRec effect is also considered as an important factor. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the less studied anatase-brookite mixed-phase (doped and undoped). Anatase/brookite photocatalytic systems were evaluated utilizing experimental/theoretical approaches in H2O (aerobic/anaerobic) environments with Vis-light and the organic pollutant (OrPo) methyl orange (MO). The compatibility of MRec and MOrbE of anatase-brookite mixed-phase (with the different reactive system components) confirmed this is the optimal combination for photocatalytic application. Using the sol-gel method, AM-TiO2NP (amorphous), TiO2NP (crystalline), and TiO2NP-Co0.1 at% (crystalline Co-doped) anatase-brookite mixed-phase photocatalysts were obtained. The morphology and surface were characterized using XRD, BET, SEM, HR-TEM, FT-IR and XPS. Employing UV–vis DRS and PL, photo-response and electron-hole recombination were studied. LVS and Mott-Schottky plot were employed to determine photo-electrochemical activity. The results of TiO2NP photocatalytic degradation in both aerobic and anaerobic environments are remarkable. The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and Fukui Function (FF) based on density functional theory (DFT) validate the remarkable photocatalytic MO degradation.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Methods: Prior to RCT, the effect of trehalose (5–20%) on the epithelial growth of fetal mouse salivary gland (SG) explants was evaluated to confirm if 10% trehalose exerted the best epithelial outcomes. Participants who completed radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment were enrolled in a double-blind RCT, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as per the CONSORT statement. The experimental group (n = 35) received 10% trehalose spray, while the control group (n = 35) received carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) spray to apply intra-orally 4 times/day for 14 days. Salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were recorded pre- and post-interventions. The Xerostomia-related Quality of Life scale (XeQoLs) was filled, and scores assessed post-interventions. Results: In the SG explant model, pro-acinar epithelial growth and mitosis was supported by 10% topical trehalose. As for RCT outcomes, salivary pH and unstimulated salivary flow rate were significantly improved after use of 10% trehalose spray when compared to CMC (p < 0.05). Participants reported an improvement of XeQoLs dimension scores after using trehalose or CMC oral sprays in terms of physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological dimensions (p < 0.05), but not social (p > 0.05). When comparing between CMC and trehalose sprays, XeQoLs total scores were not statistically different (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The 10% trehalose spray improved salivary pH, unstimulated salivary flow rate, and the quality-of-life dimensions linked with physical, pain/discomfort, and psychological signs. The clinical efficacy of 10% trehalose spray was equivalent with CMC-based saliva substitutes for relieving radiation-induced xerostomia; therefore, trehalose may be suggested in alternative to CMC-based oral spray.(Thai Clinical Trials Registry; https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/ TCTR20190817004).",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

In the first stage, bottom ash quality was improved by sieving through a No. 50 sieve and grinding to increase fineness. Ground bottom ash (GBA) replaced ordinary Portland cement (OPC) at 35%, 50%, and 65% by weight to produce high-strength concrete. In the second stage, coarse bottom ash (CBA) retained by a No. 50 sieve replaced fine aggregate in an optimum mixture at 20%, 40%, and 60% by volume. Concrete properties including compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, autogenous shrinkage, and heat evolution were evaluated. The economic and environmental impacts of GBA were assessed. The results indicated that concrete with 50% GBA cement replacement could be classified as high-strength concrete at 7 d, achieving a compressive strength of approximately 80.9 MPa at 28 d. Autogenous shrinkage was decreased with an increase in GBA content. The heat evolution of concrete with 50% GBA was decreased by 36.4% compared with the control concrete.

However, it has since become an important concept in a range of human sciences, particularly for its explanatory power in psychology, education, and clinical neurosciences. Nevertheless, its use has been limited by vague definitions and confusion between the related conceptualizations of executive process and intelligence. Here we explore the concept of executive control in detail, drawing on psychology, neurology, and computer science/human-machine interaction. We explore both computationalist and embodied cognition approaches. We describe the core goal-directed and resource-limited features of executive control, its fractionation into components, and partial overlap with psychometric conceptions of intelligence. We also examine its associations with neurological systems beyond those usually linked to executive function (i.e., the frontal lobes). We propose that executive functions are ‘intelligent’, and can be defined by their goal-directedness. Furthermore, executive function tasks can be classified by their task goals into one of three types: Those that involve i) convergent, or ii) divergent thinking, or iii) not responding, such as in psychomotor response inhibition. Conventional intelligence tests measure only convergent thinking. The recognition of non-convergent executive functions allows the identification of executively controlled intelligent goal-directed behavior beyond that controlled by domain-general cognitive processes. This reconceptualization may benefit research in education, clinical and cognitive sciences, as well as the quest for artificial general intelligence.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science (all)"

Herein, we determine the effects of varying reaction conditions, i.e., ethanol:RBAO molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, enzyme loading, and agitation speed, on the degrees of glyceride removal, γ-oryzanol loss, free fatty acid (FFA) remaining, and biodiesel content. Up to 100% glyceride removal was achieved with a relatively high biodiesel yield (84%) and γ-oryzanol loss as low as 26% under our most suitable reaction conditions (5:1 ethanol:RBAO molar ratio, 40 °C, 24 h reaction time, 10%wt enzyme loading, 200 rpm agitation). Furthermore, of the remaining oryzanol, up to 94% was recovered by the acid-base extraction with 2-4 M ethanolic NaOH solution. Our results suggest that a combination of enzymatic esterification/transesterification with subsequent acid-base extraction offers an efficient alternative approach to the simultaneous production of biodiesel and γ-oryzanol recovery from low-cost RBAO. Based on our analysis of techno-economic and environmental sustainability, integration of the present method into a rice bran oil refinery would make the process profitable, with the minimum use of toxic chemicals and energy.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Biotechnology, Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

However, those data on advanced cannulation techniques are scarce. We aimed to study the impact of MDP morphology on the outcome of both standard and advanced cannulation methods. Methods: Images of naïve papilla were retrospectively reviewed and independently classified into 4 types (1: classic appearance, 2: small, 3: bulging, and 4: ridged papillae). All cannulation was started with guidewire cannulation. After failure, advanced cannulation including double guidewire (DG) and/or precut sphincterotomy (PS) was performed. Outcomes including success rate and complications were analyzed. Results: A total 805 naïve papilla were included. The overall advanced cannulation rate was 23.2%. The MPD type 2 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.8–2.9) and type 4 (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1–3.8) required advanced cannulation technique at a higher rate than type 1.

While a number of reports had highlighted the beneficial attributes of various extracts prepared from C. odorata, the biological properties of the lipophilic extract remained unexplored. This work aimed at examining the anticancer, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of C. odorata aerial part lipophilic extract (COLE). The results revealed that COLE possessed potent and selective anticancer properties against human breast and colon cancer cells. The extract presented strong cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells (IC50 of 9.18 µg/mL), MDA-MB-231 (IC50 of 12.19 µg/mL), HT-29 (IC50 of 19.48 µg/mL), and HCT-116 cells (IC50 of 14.12 µg/mL). Meanwhile, COLE was found to be non-toxic at the concentrations tested against normal (HEK-293 and CCD-841 CoN) cells. In addition, COLE demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against B. cereus (MIC value of 0.157 mg/mL), and moderate activity against L. monocytogenes (MIC value of 0.63 mg/mL) and E. coli (MIC value of 1.06 mg/mL). Furthermore, COLE effectively scavenged free radical species, including ABTṠ+ (IC50 of 46.80 µg/mL), DPPḢ (IC50 of 27.78 µg/mL), and superoxide anion (IC50 of 64.07 µg/mL), likely due to the high phenolic (262.48 mg gallic acid equivalent/g) and flavonoid content (70.20 mg quercetin equivalent/g). UPLC-MS analysis revealed the putative identities of 85 secondary metabolites whereas the GC–MS analysis detected 36 volatile constituents in COLE. Also, it was revealed that terpenes and phenolic compounds were the predominant specialized metabolites present in COLE, and putatively responsible for the remarkable biological properties. Taken together, these results revealed the richness of C. odorata lipophilic extract in terms of its metabolite profile and biological activities. In conclusion, COLE is worthy of further investigation to take advantage of its good anticancer, antioxidative and antimicrobial properties in pharmacological or nutraceutical application.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

In this study, we investigated the potential of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, BA.2 and BA.5, to evade neutralization by a human monoclonal antibody targeting the virus’s spike RBD (mAb 1D1). By subjecting the viruses to serial propagation in the presence of the antibody, we found that BA.2 exhibited poor growth, whereas BA.5 regained robust growth with significantly higher kinetics than the parental virus. Genetic analysis identified a single mutation, A475V, in the spike protein of BA.5 that substantially reduced the neutralizing activities of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera. In addition, the A475V mutation alone in BA.2 moderately reduced the neutralizing activity but completely abolished the neutralizing effect of mAb 1D1 when F486V or L452R were also present. Our results shed light on the possible evolutionary development of SARS-CoV-2 variants under selection pressure by monoclonal antibodies and have implications for the development of effective antibody therapies and vaccines against the virus.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Rats in cisplatin+CYM-5478 group showed not only fewer abnormal structures than those in cisplatin only group, but also showed Bands of Büngner and onion bulb-like structures, which are characteristic of nerve regeneration. Interpretation: Together with our previous study, showed that CYM-5478 attenuated neuropathy and allodynia in a rat model of cisplatin-induced neuropathy, these results suggest S1P2 agonists as a potential approach the for treatment of cancer due to the reduction of side effects of cisplatin.","neuroscience, medical","Neuroscience (all), Neurology (clinical)"
Effects of probiotics on pancreatic inflammation and intestinal integrity in mice with acute pancreatitis,"Werawatganon D., Vivatvakin S., Somanawat K., Tumwasorn S., Klaikeaw N., Siriviriyakul P., Chayanupatkul M.",2023-12-01,"Acute Disease, Amylases, Animals, Arginine, Claudin-1, Inflammation, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred ICR, Occludin, Pancreatitis, Peroxidase, Probiotics, Acute pancreatitis, Intestinal integrity, Mice, Probiotics","Background: Severe acute pancreatitis is a potentially life-threatening disease. Despite being a common disorder, acute pancreatitis lacks a specific treatment. The present study aimed to examine the effects of probiotics on pancreatic inflammation and intestinal integrity in mice with acute pancreatitis. Methods: Male ICR mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 6 per group). The control group received two intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of normal saline as a vehicle control. The acute pancreatitis (AP) group received two i.p. injections of L-arginine 450 mg/100 g body weight. AP plus probiotics groups received L-arginine to induce acute pancreatitis as above. In the single-strain and mixed-strain groups, mice received 1 mL of Lactobacillus plantarum B7 1 × 108 CFU/mL and 1 mL of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 1 × 108 CFU/mL and Lactobacillus paracasei B13 1 × 108 CFU/mL by oral gavage, respectively for 6 days starting 3 days prior to the AP induction. All mice were sacrificed 72 h after L-arginine injection. Pancreatic tissue was obtained for histological evaluation and immunohistochemical studies for myeloperoxidase, whereas ileal tissue was used for immunohistochemical studies for occludin, and claudin-1. Blood samples were collected for amylase analysis. Results: Serum amylase levels and pancreatic myeloperoxidase levels in the AP group were significantly higher than in controls and significantly decreased in probiotic groups compared with the AP group. Ileal occludin and claudin-1 levels were significantly lower in the AP group than in controls. Ileal occludin levels significantly increased, whereas ileal claudin-1 levels did not significantly change in both probiotic groups as compared with the AP group. The pancreatic histopathology showed significantly higher degree of inflammation, edema, and fat necrosis in the AP group, and these changes improved in mixed-strained probiotic groups. Conclusions: Probiotics, particularly the mixed-strain ones, attenuated AP via the reduction of inflammation and the maintenance of intestinal integrity.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine
The fate of imazapyr herbicide in the soil amended with carbon sorbents,"Yavari S., Kamyab H., Asadpour R., Yavari S., Sapari N.B., Baloo L., Manan T.S.B.A., Ashokkumar V., Chelliapan S.",2023-06-01,"Amended soil, Bio-degradation, Biochar, Carbon sorbent;, Carbon sorbents, Imidazolinone, Imidazolinone;, Leaching;, Photo degradation, Photo-degradation;, Bio-degradation, Carbon sorbent;, Imidazolinones;, Leaching;, Photo-degradation;","Excessive application of agro-chemicals is a major factor in undesired environmental problems. Imidazolinone herbicides having high activity, leaching potential, and persistence are probable risks to ecosystems. Herbicides’ stabilization using biochar is an efficient and cheap strategy to protect the environment against their contaminations. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochars produced from oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) and rice husk (RH) on imazapyr fate in soil. Initially, the optimized biochars were compared for their sorption-desorption capacities as soil modifiers. The herbicide leaching in the amended soils was investigated by leaching columns. The herbicide photolysis and bio-degradations’ rates in the media were also evaluated during 70 days. Results indicated that the soil amendment significantly increased soil sorption capacity (up to 2.34-folds) and reduced the herbicide leaching. The lowest percentage of leached herbicide (2.8%) and the highest percentage of retained herbicide (97.1%) were achieved in EFB biochar-amended soil. The herbicide photo-degradation rate significantly reduced with a half-life of 38.5 days in non-amended soil to 53.3 days in EFB biochar-amended soils. The herbicide bio-degradation, however, increased with the biochars applications. In a conclusion, the optimized biochars have a high potential to protect the environment against herbicides hazards.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Urbanization and anthropogenic activities are the main sources of MPs in rivers; however, the MPs in plateau rivers with less human activities are not well understood. In this study, the pollution of MPs in the surface water and shore sediment of the Lhasa River from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was investigated, and a risk assessment was conducted. The abundance of MPs in the surface water and shore sediment of Lhasa River were 0.63 n/L and 0.37 n/g, respectively. MPs in surface water were mainly dominated by films (43.23%) and fibers (31.12%) in shape, transparent (54.25%) in color, and 0–0.5 mm (75.83%) in size, while MPs in the shore sediment were mainly fibers (43.69%) and fragments (36.53%), transparent (71.91%), and 0–0.5 mm (60.18%). PP and PE were the predominant polymer types, accounting for 44.55% and 30.79% respectively in the surface water and 32.51% and 36.01% respectively in the shore sediment. More notably, the polymer pollution index (H) of MPs in the Lhasa River was at hazard level III due to the high risk caused by PVC, but the pollution load index (PLI) was low at hazard level I. This study reveals that the remote river in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are polluted by MPs, and their potential risks to the vulnerable ecosystem deserve attention.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, water engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Science (all), Pollution, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

The effect of gamma radiation dose on cellulose showed an increment of oxidation degree, which was evidenced by the intensity ratio of I1718 (carbonyl)/ I2892 (aliphatic) from FTIR analysis. The obtained SC was introduced into polyether block amide/polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEBAX/PEGDA) polymer matrix as a reinforcement and hydrophilic filler for improving electrolyte affinity and thermal stability of its composite membrane. The increase of SC in PEBAX/PEGDA composite membranes resulted in enhancement of hydrophilicity, electrolyte uptake, and thermal stability compared to pristine composite membranes. However, the excess SC content in the composite membrane exhibited the low physical properties, caused by negligible dispersion on the surface membrane. With the optimum 2.0 wt% SC in PEBAX/PEGDA, the porosity, contact angle and electrolyte uptake capacity was found to be 64.0 %, 12.8° and 37.5 %, respectively. 2.0 wt% SC/PEBAX/PEGDA showed the outstanding thermal stability with negligible shrinkage <10 % at 150 °C whereas pristine PEBAX/PEGDA showed the shrinkage of 29 %. The obtained SC/PEBAX/PEGDA composite membrane is considered as a potential candidate to replace the commercial polyolefin-based separator in lithium-ion batteries.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, mixing and separation, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

Herein, a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for determining CEA concentration composed of the thiolated chitosan (tCHI) and the doped poly(N-methylaniline) (dPNMA) is proposed. The tCHI served as a support matrix for the immobilization of CEA antibodies (anti-CEA) and was prepared by using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) as a grafting agent on chitosan (CHI). The excellent electrical conductivity of the dPNMA was utilized as an electron transfer layer for the proposed immunosensor. The successful preparation of the tCHI was confirmed by the attenuated-total reflection Fourier transform spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to illustrate the performance of the proposed immunosensor. The determination of CEA concentration was relied on the decrease in the DPV current response with increasing CEA concentration from the creation of the antigen–antibody immunocomplex. The proposed immunosensor demonstrated a broad concentration range of 0.01 to 30 ng mL−1 with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 ng mL−1. In addition, the present sensor exhibited excellent selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability, suggesting its potential use to determine CEA in clinical immunoassay.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biophysics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Electrochemistry"

In addition, both experimental and analytical investigations have been performed to assess the suitability of the existing strength and strain models. However, the theoretical and analytical expressions to predict the stress–strain curves of HFRP-confined concrete were not developed. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop analytical expressions to predict the stress–strain curves of HFRP-confined waste brick aggregate concrete. For this purpose, a new experimental framework was conducted to examine the effectiveness of HFRP in improving the mechanical properties of concrete constructed with recycled brick aggregates. Depending on the strength of the concrete, two groups were formed, i.e., Type-1 concrete and Type-2 concrete. A total of sixteen samples were tested. The ultimate compressive strength and strain significantly increased due to HFRP confinement. Improvements of up to 272% and 457% in the ultimate compressive strength and strain were observed due to hemp confinement, respectively. To predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of HFRP-confined concrete, this study investigated several existing analytical stress–strain models. Some of the strength models resulted in close agreement with experimental results, but none of the models could accurately predict the ultimate confined strain. Nonlinear regression analysis was conducted to propose expressions to predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of HFRP-confined concrete. The proposed expressions resulted in good agreement with experimental results. An analytical procedure was proposed to predict the stress–strain curves of hemp-confined concrete constructed by partial replacement of natural coarse aggregates by recycled fired-clay brick aggregates. A close agreement was found between the experimental and analytically predicted stress–strain curves.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Transient model simulation and new sensitivity experiments further reveal that westward migration of the boundary between summer and winter rainfall regimes results in a summer to winter rainfall regime shift forced by distinct changes in summer and winter monsoons. Our findings suggest that the seasonal rainfall regime could be unstable under climate change around the boundaries of rainfall regimes in the tropics and possibly worldwide, which might be more critical for shaping both past and future ecological environments.","the atmosphere, earth sciences","Geophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

Mean (standard deviation) knowledge score was 6.72 (1.86) out of 10. Buddhist students were more likely to have a positive attitude toward abortions. Most students intended to practice safe abortions in pregnancies that affect maternal physical or mental health, or in pregnancies that resulted from unlawful sexual contact. Students were more ambivalent toward abortion practices for socioeconomic reasons. Better knowledge of abortion legislation was associated with a more positive attitude toward abortions and safe abortion practice intention.

At the same time, the surface water supply utilities still struggle to satisfy the total water demand in the developing region. The conjunctive use of surface and groundwater is an essential strategy of water supply management that has to be considered coupling with aquifer yield and surface water capability within a basin. The study aims to determine optimal intensity pumping and estimate aquifers yield within sustainable drawdown criteria. The optimal pumping intensity was analyzed from maximum existing pumping per square kilometer in four aquifers with no negative impacts on Saigon River Basin’s groundwater system. The study estimated the sustainable aquifers yield through increasing pumpage until the lowest drawdown of aquifers meets the drawdown criteria. Here, the drawdown criteria considered the groundwater pumping laws of Vietnam and the hydraulic gradient at the salinity interface. Regarding drawdown criteria and hydraulic gradient at salinity interface criteria, the drawdown constraints are –20 m. MSL for aquifer 2 and ‒30 m. MSL for aquifer 3 and aquifer 4. The simulation inputs utilized the historical 20-year climate data. According to the pumping scheme in the existing area, the optimal intensity pumping for aquifer 2, aquifer 3, and aquifer four are found to be 2000 m3/day/km2, 3500 m3/day/km2, and 4000 m3/day/km2, respectively. Based on the optimal pumping intensity, the sustainable aquifers yield in Saigon River Basin are estimated to be at the rate of 1.9 MCM/day, which includes 57,699 m3/day from aquifer 1, 465,233 m3/day from aquifer 2, 455,151 m3/day from aquifer 3, and 925,836 m3/day from aquifer 4.",engineering,Civil and Structural Engineering

In this study, the first crystal structures of a complete four-domain chitin-active AA10 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from the chitinolytic bacterium Vibrio campbellii type strain ATCC BAA-1116 are reported. The crystal structures of apo and copper-bound VhLPMO10A were resolved as homodimers with four distinct domains: an N-terminal AA10 catalytic (CatD) domain connected to a GlcNAc-binding (GbpA_2) domain, followed by a module X domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM73). Size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed that VhLPMO10A exists as a monomer in solution. The active site of VhLPMO10A is located on the surface of the CatD domain, with three conserved residues (His1, His98 and Phe170) forming the copper(II)-binding site. Metal-binding studies using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence, together with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, gave consistently strong copper(II) signals in the protein samples, confirming that VhLPMO10A is a copper-dependent enzyme. ITC binding data showed that VhLPMO10A could bind various divalent cations but bound most strongly to copper(II) ions, with a Kd of 0.1 ± 0.01 µM. In contrast, a Kd of 1.9 nM was estimated for copper(I) ions from redox-potential measurements. The presence of ascorbic acid is essential for H2O2 production in the reaction catalysed by VhLPMO10A. MALDI-TOF MS identified VhLPMO10A as a C1-specific LPMO, generating oxidized chitooligosaccharide products with different degrees of polymerization (DP2ox-DP8ox).

To find a solution, the factors mattering to the SADS ability of MOFs are comprehensively discussed by comparing the structure–activity relationship of 16 MOFs. Especially, the influence of topology, structure of second building unit (SBU) and coordination environment of metal cations of these MOFs are investigated. The experimental results indicate that the binding strength between copper cations and mercaptan is mainly dependent by the coordination environment of the copper cations. And a MOF, ADODAA with copper cations squarely coordinated with two oxygen and two nitrogen atoms exhibits significantly higher stability and renewability over other Cu-based MOFs whose copper cations only coordinates with four oxygen or nitrogen atoms, due to its moderate binding strength towards mercaptan. This work unravels the strong dependence of the stability of MOFs on the coordination environment of its metal cations and provides a platform for constructing highly stable SADS adsorbents.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; petroleum processing; treating, mixing and separation, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

We hypothesized that representative wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in two international gateway cities, Bangkok and Phuket, Thailand, could be sentineled for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to reflect the clinical distribution patterns at city level and serve as early indicators of new variants entering the country. Municipal wastewater samples (n = 132) were collected from eight representative municipal WWTPs in Bangkok and Phuket during 19 sampling events from October 2021 to March 2022, which were tested by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the US CDC N1 and N2 multiplex and variant (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2) singleplex assays. The variant detection ratios from Bangkok and Phuket followed similar trends to the national clinical testing data, and each variant's viral loads agreed with the daily new cases (3-d moving average). Omicron BA.1 was detected in Phuket wastewater prior to Bangkok, possibly due to Phuket's WWTPs serving tourist communities. We found that the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 viral loads predominantly drove the SARS-CoV-2 resurgence. We also noted a shifting pattern in the Bangkok WBE from a 22-d early warning in early 2021 to a near real-time pattern in late 2021. The potential application of tourist hotspots for WBE to indicate the arrival of new variants and re-emerging or unprecedented infectious agents could support tourism-dependent economies by complementing the reduced clinical regulations while maintaining public health protection via wastewater surveillance.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, environmentalronmental assessment and monitoring, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

A literature search was done to answer the focused questions “In partially edentulous patients, what are the alveolar ridge volumetric changes, histological findings, and implant survival rates in sites augmented with autogenous tooth bone graft prepared chairside?” Twenty articles were included at the end of the database search. Reported alveolar bone dimension changes after ridge preservation ranged between − 0.64 mm and + 2.26 mm for height, and between − 1.21 mm and + 0.41 mm for width. Augmented sites showed a significant increase in their dimensions in all investigations. The implant survival rate was 98.8% for delayed placement and 97.4% for immediate placement. Additional reports were found on the percentage bone formation following the use of this graft at different postoperative time points, which showed a higher bone volume with time. Currently available studies have included small samples, with short follow-up periods, and most have lacked a control group. Within the limitations of this review, the available evidence suggests that the autogenous tooth bone graft prepared chairside is as effective as other bone grafting materials.","otorhinolaryngology, medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

Strategic Roadmapping Framework for Disaster Response: Case of COVID-19 Pandemic Vaccine Rollout Program in the UK,"Yang Y., Vinayavekhin S., Phaal R., O'sullivan E., Leelawat N.",2023-01-01,"'current, Conceptual frameworks, Customizable, Decisions makings, Disaster-response, Roadmapping, Strategic roadmapping, United king-dom, United kingdom, Vaccine rollout program, COVID-19, disaster response, strategic roadmapping, United King-dom, vaccine rollout program","Strategic planning in response to disasters is distinctly different from strategic planning in normal situa-tions. The experience of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown that a vaccine roll-out program as a disaster response requires a different approach from current routine vaccination and disaster response frameworks. A holistic conceptual framework for planning vaccine rollout disaster response programs is proposed, building on the experience of COVID-19. The customizable framework was developed to have high dynamicity, flexibility, and applica-bility, incorporating key decision-making factors and suitable time frames (phases and transitions), based on roadmapping principles and techniques. In this re-search, we focus on the COVID-19 pandemic vaccine rollout program in the United Kingdom (UK) as a rep-resentative case of disaster response planning due to the availability of public data and access to the rel-evant stakeholders. We applied Platts’ process approach as a methodology and used various sources of information including an extensive literature re-view, expert interviews, and retrospective roadmap-ping (mapping past experience). As a result, we propose a strategic roadmapping framework for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout program to support visual planning of time-based strategies with the integration of various resources and demand environments. Apart from this practical contribution, we demonstrate that the concept of roadmapping can be applied beyond technology and innovation management domains to a novel research domain such as disaster response.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"
Contour angle and peri-implant tissue height: Two interrelated features of the implant supracrestal complex,"Puisys A., Janda M., Auzbikaviciute V., Gallucci G.O., Mattheos N.",2023-06-01,"Dental Implants, Humans, Peri-Implantitis, Prosthesis Implantation, emergence angle, implant prosthesis contour, implant supracrestal complex, peri-implant tissue height","Objectives: Recent research has suggested the contour of the prosthesis and the vertical height of the peri-implant mucosa as important parameters that can influence the long term health and stability of the peri-implant tissue. In particular, overcontouring of the prosthesis has been correlated with an increased risk for peri-implantitis, while reduced soft tissue height has been associated with marginal bone loss, recession, and other soft tissue complications. Although these two parameters have been investigated as independent in the current literature, clinical experience points toward a close interrelation between transmucosal tissue height and prosthesis contour angle. It is often found that a reduced vertical height of the implant supracrestal complex is the main reason for overcontouring of the prosthesis. At the same time, achieving a favorable contour of 30o or less is not possible unless the clinician has ensured an adequate vertical height of the soft tissue. The purpose of this short communication is to establish the relation between tissue vertical height and prosthesis contour by utilizing a theoretical geometry equation based on the Pythagorean theorem. In doing so, one can use the dimensions of the implant as well as those of the prosthesis at the mucosal margin to calculate the essential vertical height for achieving a favorable prosthesis contour. Conclusions: As the treatment plan of the implant supracrestal complex is “top-down,” in case of deficient vertical height, subcrestal placement of the implant should be considered to achieve a proper prosthesis contour.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Possible use of spent FCC catalyst for upgrading of wax from the pyrolysis of plastics to liquid fuel,"Kongngoen P., Phetwarotai W., Assabumrungrat S., Phusunti N.",2023-08-01,"Fixed bed, High-density polyethylenes, Liquid oil, Low-density polypropylenes, Pyrolysis reactor, Spend FCC, Spent fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, Wax cracking, Zeolite catalyst, ]+ catalyst, Catalytic cracking, Pyrolysis, Spent FCC, Wax, Zeolite catalysts","The cracking of heavy wax derived from mixed plastics (high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene) to chemical and fuel purposes was explored using spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (spent FCC). The wax cracking was performed by a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor with a slow heating rate. All catalysts, when compared to other catalysts (HY zeolite and MCM-41), could enhance liquid oil and gas production. While the spent FCC catalyst produced the highest liquid oil with least amount of coke production. The influence of spent FCC catalyst ratio on product distribution revealed that a catalyst-wax ratio of up to 1:1 resulted in a higher liquid oil yield than a low ratio. Additionally, the increase of cracking temperature promoted more oil production; however, at high temperature (above 400 °C) the evaporation of wax became more significant, and consequently a high portion of produced wax was obtained. Therefore, under suitable conditions, the spent FCC catalyst demonstrated the possibility of upgrading the heavy wax into liquid fuels and chemicals. In addition, this study also compared the products obtained from two processing routes using the spent FCC catalyst. The first route involved the pyrolysis of plastics into wax and then cracking the wax into liquid fuel, while the second route involved a one-step process that directly converted plastics into liquid fuel. The spent FCC catalyst promoted the production of diesel-range hydrocarbons and suppressed the aromatic production for the wax cracking. By contrast, the spent FCC catalyst significantly enhanced aromatic production during the cracking of mixed plastics.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

A hydrate-based technology has gained attention for CCS applications since it provides various advantages, particularly in terms of energy efficiency. However, the slow kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation without promoters has been a challenge for CCS on an industrial scale. In this study, amino acids including leucine, methionine, and valine were used as promoters to investigate their effect on the CO2 hydrate formation using a hybrid combinatorial reactor (HCR) configuration. The amino acids were tested at different concentrations. The results showed that the addition of amino acids had varying effects on CO2 hydrate formation kinetics. The highest rate of hydrate formation was observed in the methionine system. The amino acids and their concentrations had no significant impact on the gas uptake or the conversion of water to hydrates. All systems displayed a similar pattern of hydrate formation morphology. There was no foam formation during the hydrate dissociation, and the hydrate reformed in the reused solution had almost the same gas uptake as the fresh solution. Overall, the use of amino acids with the HCR approach may be a promising option for CCS applications.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Most suitable reaction condition was 1:5 oil to glycerol molar ratio, 1 cm discharge gap size, 0.5 L/min He gas flow rate, atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature (rising to about 100 °C due to plasma heating), and 500 rpm stirring rate for 2 h at 130 W input power. Findings revealed that plasma could extract hydrogen radicals from glycerol, and they successfully reacted with C[dbnd]C bonds. Hydrogenated palm oil was subsequently converted into hydrogenated FAME (H-FAME) via conventional base-catalyzed transesterification. Higher saturation degree of H-FAME compared to FAME produced directly from palm oil was indicated by reduction of iodine value to 52.2 from 59.2. Oxidation stability of H-FAME was significantly enhanced from 17.7 to 23.1 h while cloud point slightly changed from 14.0 to 14.8 °C. Plasma reactive species generated during reaction and possible mechanisms of glycerol decomposition and plasma hydrogenation were presented. Developed catalytic-free plasma hydrogenation process is highly environmentally friendly and presents a way to add more value to waste glycerol and provide other potential hydrogen sources.","energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The SCCO2 extracted oil yield of 11.93 wt% was observed at 30 MPa and 50 °C. The detectable volatile compounds in SCGs oil were aldehydes and flavor compounds classified as furans. Although the degree of hydrolysis of SCGs and defatted SCGs (DFSCGs) were not significantly different, the soluble protein of DFSCGs was higher than that of SCGs. Electrophoretic profiles of SCGs and DFSCGs comprise polypeptide bands at < 20 and ~ 24 kDa, which are mainly derived from 11S globulin subunits. After hydrolysis, the molecular masses of 4–20 and 24 kDa were virtually eliminated, thus releasing polypeptides with molecular masses < 4 kDa. Furthermore, the DFSCGs hydrolysate had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity than that of SCGs hydrolysate. Pretreatment of SCGs with SCCO2 enhances enzymatic accessibility, improves the quality of protein hydrolysate, and procures SCGs oil as a by-product.

Healing wounds with medicinal plants has been a practice of ancient civilizations for centuries. Nigella sativa L (N. sativa) is a medicinal plant that has several pharmacological properties. Methods: The present study evaluated the wound healing properties of Nigella sativa L. (N. sativa) seed extracts using normal cell lines such as normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were analyzed through western blot analysis. Furthermore, computational analyses were carried out to screen the potential bioactive compounds for wound healing applications. Results: The results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay revealed that, all the tested solvent extracts of N. sativa seeds (including ethanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and petroleum ether) did not exert any cytotoxic effects at the tested concentrations. Furthermore, the western blot analysis showed elevated levels of VEGF and PDGF upon treatment with N. sativa seed extracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of N. sativa extracts identified 268 phytocompounds. Molecular docking studies revealed that three phytocompounds of N. sativa extracts, including tricyclo[20.8.0.0(7,16)]triacontane, 1(22),7(16)-diepoxy-, adaphostin and obeticholic acid had strong binding affinity with wound healing-related target proteins, showing docking scores ranging from -5.5 to -10.9 Kcal/mol. These compounds had acceptable Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties. Conclusions: Based on these results, N. sativa seed extracts might possess potential wound healing properties owing to the presence of a wide range of bioactive components.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"

Herein, a whole-cell nano-biohybrid system consisting of biosynthesized cadmium sulfide, Enterobacter aerogenes cells, and metal oxide nanoparticles was constructed. The system was encapsulated with sodium alginate and used for light-driven biohydrogen production under anaerobic and in the presence of oxygen conditions. After 48 h incubation in the presence of oxygen, the E. aerogenes cells with the encapsulated hybrid system yielded 2.7 mmol H2/mmol glucose, a 13.5-fold higher than that of the E. aerogenes cells without encapsulation. The encapsulated hybrid system could produce hydrogen for up to 96 h and could produce hydrogen even under natural sunlight conditions. These results revealed that efficient hydrogen production is possible in the presence of oxygen. Overall, the present study demonstrated the potential of using proper nano-biohybrid system with encapsulation for the production of hydrogen under ambient air condition.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

Oleic acid, being one of the most widely found fatty acids in plant oils and animal fats; it was utilized as a model substrate to produce biodiesel in this study. The effect and interaction of four independent factors such as methanol to oleic acid molar ratio (MOMR), time, catalyst loading, and temperature were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). After doing the thirty experiments given by the central composite design (CCD), the optimized reaction condition using RSM was found to be MOMR of 21:1, 60 min, 8 wt % catalyst loading, and temperature of 80 °C that predicted 96.77% biodiesel yield under microwave irradiation, whereas, 97.6 ± 0.2% yield was observed experimentally. The kinetic study of the esterification reaction showed that it followed a pseudo first order reaction. The activation energy of the esterification was found to be relatively low at 49.19 kJ mol−1. The catalyst showed good recyclability when explored up to the 5th reaction cycle. The SEM analysis of the recycled catalyst showed its stability for at least 5 reaction cycles. Therefore, it can be promoted for sustainable production of biodiesel due to its moderate preparation method, good catalytic efficiency, and excellent recyclability.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"
Roles of amino acid hydrophobicity on methane-THF hydrates in the context of storage and stability,"Jeenmuang K., Pornaroontham P., Inkong K., Bhattacharjee G., Kulprathipanja S., Linga P., Rangsunvigit P.",2023-02-15,"Amino-acids, Formation kinetics, Glutamic acid, Hydrate formation, Hydrophilics, Hydrophobic amino acids, Kinetic promoters, Methionine, Solidified natural gas, Uptake kinetics, Amino acid, Hydrate Formation, Hydrophobicity, Solidified Natural Gas, Stability","This report reveals the success of the formation of mixed methane-THF hydrates at room temperature (298.2 K) and a pressure of 9.2 MPa equipped with a hybrid stirring in the presence of amino acids as kinetic promoters. Five different amino acids in increasing order of hydrophobicity: glutamic acid, valine, leucine, methionine, and tryptophan, were used to investigate their effects on methane uptake, formation, and dissociation kinetics. The addition of hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan, methionine, and leucine) promotes the hydrate formation to completion, which doubly increases the methane uptake compared to that without amino acids and with hydrophilic amino acids (glutamic acid and valine) at the same condition. The results indicate that the hydrophobicity has a positive contribution to the methane uptake by creating a hydrophobic area, enhancing hydrate growth to completion. Moreover, the time taken to complete hydrate by 90 percent has a negative correlation to the molecular weight of the amino acids. The morphological studies demonstrate that the hydrates with hydrophobic amino acids were more consolidated than the addition of hydrophilic amino acids. Lastly, the hydrates with hydrophobic amino acids show excellent stability for 30 days even if they are stored at a temperature higher than their equilibrium temperature at atmospheric pressure. The small amount of gas lost was due to intrinsic loss only. This opens the possibility for cost-reduction for methane hydrate in commercialization.","petroleum engineeringneering, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The effect of different amounts of ZnO-graphene on the properties of the nanocomposite materials was discussed. The results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis showed that PBAT-g-MAH could form coordination reaction and hydrogen bond with ZnO-graphene, and this synergistically enhanced the tensile properties of the nanocomposites. With the introduction of functional groups, the mechanical properties of PBAT-g-MAH/ZnO-graphene nanocomposites were significantly improved. Compared with pure PBAT, the nanocomposites showed that the maximum tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation at break increased by 20.58, 17.04, and 7.51%, respectively. This work revealed for the first time through X-ray diffraction tests the probable mechanism of dispersion or compatibility in the nanocomposites. Water absorption properties and water contact angle data proved that the introduction of MAH, along with the optimal amount of nanofillers, could greatly improve the tightness of internal and surface structures of the nanocomposites. Relative to PBAT, the use of PBAT-g-MAH/ZnO-graphene containing 0.6% nanofillers significantly improved the water vapor and oxygen barrier efficiencies by 152.8 and 273.5%, respectively. It was shown from the results of antibacterial evaluation that ZnO-graphene could impart PBAT and PBAT-g-MAH with excellent antibacterial activity. Compared with pure PBAT, the nanocomposite films had better mechanical and barrier properties. Both PBAT and PBAT-g-MAH nanocomposites could decompose naturally in soil, indicating that they were environmentally friendly and would have great application prospect in the fields of packaging and medical industries.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, Materials Science, chemistry","Process Chemistry and Technology, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

We aimed to evaluate rapid urine preparation procedures before MALDI-TOF MS application using dog clinical urine samples in comparison with standard microbiological diagnostic methods by agreement analysis. We determined the frequency and distribution of bacteria and bacterial resistance and their correlations to clinical history. Three experimental procedures comprising direct centrifugation, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate digestion, and ultrasonic preparation were performed for method validation and sensitivity. Sterile urine containing Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus were used as simulated samples. By ultrasonic preparation, the microorganisms could be detected 1.46–1.51 × 105 CFU, which was considered the most suitable technique. This preparation was significantly consistent with the routine method based on data from Hospital Information Systems for 50 urine samples from canine cystitis. By standard protocol, Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius were found in most of the 155 urine samples with cystitis. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae was found in 25–30% of the samples. Imipenem resistance was found in 70% of Acinetobacter baumannii cases; almost all were resistant to second-generation fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines.

Although cannabidiol (CBD) can be an alternative for pharmacologically managing RAUs due to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory in vivo effects, there is a lack of clinical and safety trials concerning its use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of topical 0.1% CBD for managing RAU. Methods: A CBD patch test was performed on 100 healthy subjects. CBD was applied on the normal oral mucosa of 50 healthy subjects 3 times/day for 7 days. Oral examination, vital signs, and blood tests were performed pre- and post-CBD use. Another 69 RAU subjects randomly received one of three topical interventions: 0.1% CBD, 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide (TA), or placebo. These were applied on the ulcers 3 times/day for 7 days. The ulcer and erythematous size were measured on day 0, 2, 5, and 7. Pain ratings were recorded daily. The subjects rated their satisfaction with the intervention and completed a quality-of-life questionnaire (OHIP-14). Results: None of the subjects exhibited allergic reactions or side effects. Their vital signs and blood parameters were stable before and after the 7-day CBD intervention. CBD and TA significantly reduced ulcer size more than placebo at all time points. The erythematous size reduction was higher in the CBD intervention than the placebo on day 2, while TA reduced the erythematous size at all time points. The pain score in the CBD group was lower compared with placebo on day 5, whereas TA reduced pain more than placebo on day 4, 5, and 7. The subjects receiving CBD reported higher satisfaction than placebo. However, the OHIP-14 scores were comparable among the interventions. Conclusions: Topical 0.1% CBD reduced ulcer size and accelerated ulcer healing without side effects. CBD exerted anti-inflammatory effects in the early stage and an analgesic effect in the late RAU stage. Thus, topical 0.1% CBD might be more appropriate for RAU patients who decline to take topical steroids, except for cases where CBD is contraindicated.

Various case definitions of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection (RSV-LRTI) are currently proposed. We assessed the performance of 3 clinical case definitions against the World Health Organization definition recommended in 2015 (WHO 2015). Methods. In this prospective cohort study conducted in 8 countries, 2401 children were followed up for 2 years from birth. Suspected LRTIs were detected via active and passive surveillance, followed by in-person clinical evaluation including single timepoint respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) assessment, and nasopharyngeal sampling for RSV testing by polymerase chain reaction. Agreement between case definitions was evaluated using Cohen's κ statistics. Results. Of 1652 suspected LRTIs, 227 met the WHO 2015 criteria for RSV-LRTI; 73 were classified as severe. All alternative definitions were highly concordant with the WHO 2015 definition for RSV-LRTI (κ: 0.95-1.00), but less concordant for severe RSVLRTI (κ: 0.47-0.82). Tachypnea was present for 196/226 (86.7%) WHO 2015 RSV-LRTIs and 168/243 (69.1%) LRTI/bronchiolitis/ pneumonia cases, clinically diagnosed by nonstudy physicians. Low oxygen saturation levels were observed in only 55/226 (24.3%) WHO 2015 RSV-LRTIs. Conclusions. Three case definitions for RSV-LRTI showed high concordance with the WHO 2015 definition, while agreement was lower for severe RSV-LRTI. In contrast to increased respiratory rate, low oxygen saturation was not a consistent finding in RSVLRTIs and severe RSV-LRTIs. This study demonstrates that current definitions are highly concordant for RSV-LRTIs, but a standard definition is still needed for severe RSV-LRTI.",medical,Medicine (all)

Methods: An observational follow-up study was conducted among PHIVA who received 48-week VitD/Cal supplementation (either high-dose [3,200 IU/1,200 mg daily] or standard-dose [400 IU/1,200 mg daily]). Lumbar spine BMD (LSBMD) was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, and bone turnover markers were measured. Changes in LSBMD z-scores and other bone parameters at 3 years after stopping VitD/Cal supplementation compared with baseline or week 48 of supplementation were assessed among participants previously receiving high-dose and standard-dose VitD/Cal supplementation. Results: Of 114 enrolled PHIVA, 46% and 54% had previously received high-dose and standard-dose VitD/Cal supplementation, respectively. The median age was 20 years; 53% were male. At 3 years after completion of VitD/Cal supplementation, we observed a significant decline in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increase in intact parathyroid hormone but no significant rebounds of C-terminal telopeptides of collagen type I and procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptides and no significant changes in LSBMD z-scores among PHIVA in both treatment groups, compared with the measurements at week 48 of supplementation. Notably, LSBMD z-scores at 3 years after stopping VitD/Cal supplements were not significantly altered from baseline evaluations in both PHIVA groups. Discussion: Three years after completion of high-dose or standard-dose VitD/Cal supplementation, LSBMD z-scores of our Thai PHIVA were not significantly changed from baseline and week 48 of supplementation. VitD/Cal supplementation of PHIVA during periods of peak bone mass accrual may have sustained and long-term skeletal benefits.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

In aqueous solutions, CDs are solubilizing complexing agents of poorly soluble drugs while they can also act as organic cosolvents like ethanol. CDs and their complexes self-assemble in aqueous solutions to form both nano- and microparticles. The nanoparticles have diameters that are well below the wavelength of visible light; thus, the solutions appear to be clear. However, the nanoparticles can result in erroneous conclusions and misinterpretations of experimental results.

In static schemes, manual washing steps are still necessary, resulting in a tedious and time-consuming process. In contrast, in flow-based electrochemical sensors, the current response is collected when the solution flows through the electrode continuously. However, the drawback of such a flow system is the low sensitivity due to the limited time for the interaction between the capturing element and the target. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical capillary-driven microfluidic DNA sensor to combine the advantages of static and flow-based electrochemical detection systems into a single device by incorporating burst valve technology. The microfluidic device with a two-electrode configuration was applied for the simultaneous detection of two different DNA markers, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cDNA, via the specific interaction between pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids (PNA) probes and the DNA target. The integrated system, while requiring a small sample volume (7 μL for each sample loading port) and less analysis time, achieved good performance in terms of the limits of detection (LOD) (3SDblank/slope) and quantification (LOQ) (10SDblank/slope) at 1.45 nM and 4.79 nM for HIV and 1.20 nM and 3.96 nM for HCV, respectively. The simultaneous detection of HIV-1 and HCV cDNA prepared from human blood samples showed results that are in complete agreement with the RT‒PCR assay. The results qualify this platform as a promising alternative for the analysis of either HIV-1/HCV or coinfection that can be easily adapted for other clinically important nucleic acid-based markers.","process equipment, chemistry, environmental, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Biochemistry, Spectroscopy"

Fossil fuels, without doubt, play a vital role in the development of today's world. However, there are increasing reservations about the consumption of fossil fuels due to their detrimental impact on our ecosystem. In recent decades, biodiesel has attracted much attention as a promising replacement for fossil fuel-based diesel, especially in the transportation sector. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and carbon-free fuel that can be made from any kind of vegetable oil or fat. In recent developments, numerous techniques have been developed to efficiently prepare biodiesel from oil/fats. Therefore, in this paper, we cover a new advancement in techniques used for the conversion of oil/fat to biodiesel and the role of artificial intelligence (AI). AI approaches help predict the effectiveness of biodiesel production techniques and optimize the process, in addition to minimizing the cost of the process. The AI-enabled biodiesel prediction methods consist of several stages, i.e., biodiesel data collection, biodiesel data preprocessing, developing, and tuning machine learning (ML) algorithm on biodiesel data, and predicting unknown biodiesel properties. Therefore, the main purpose of applying AI to the biodiesel production process is to improve the process optimization and to develop AI models for fuel properties measurements and ultimately reduce the cost of the product. Because these problems have not been addressed previously, we hope that our analysis will help future researchers identify the appropriate technique and feedstock to produce high-quality biodiesel.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Despite worldwide reports, there are no effective therapeutics for controlling EHP infections. In this study, five potential druggable targets of EHP, namely, aquaporin (AQP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase, thymidine kinase (TK), methionine aminopeptidase2 (MetAP2), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), were identified via functional classification of the whole EHP proteome. The three-dimensional structures of the proteins were constructed using the artificial-intelligence-based program AlphaFold 2. Following the prediction of druggable sites, the ZINC15 and ChEMBL databases were screened against targets using docking-based virtual screening. Molecules with affinity scores ≥ 7.5 and numbers of interactions ≥ 9 were initially selected and subsequently enriched based on their ADMET properties and electrostatic complementarities. Five compounds were finally selected against each target based on their complex stabilities and binding energies. The compounds CHEMBL3703838, CHEMBL2132563, and CHEMBL133039 were selected against AQP; CHEMBL1091856, CHEMBL1162979, and CHEMBL525202 against CTP synthase; CHEMBL4078273, CHEMBL1683320, and CHEMBL3674540 against TK; CHEMBL340488, CHEMBL1966988, and ZINC000828645375 against DHFR; and CHEMBL3913373, ZINC000016682972, and CHEMBL3142997 against MetAP2.The compounds exhibited high stabilities and low binding free energies, indicating their abilities to suppress EHP infections; however, further validation is necessary for determining their efficacy.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Effects of blue-light LED toothbrush on reducing dental plaque and gingival inflammation in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances: a crossover randomized controlled trial,"Manphibool C., Matangkasombut O., Chantarangsu S., Chantarawaratit P.-O.",2023-12-01,"Dental Plaque, Dental Plaque Index, Gingivitis, Humans, Inflammation, Orthodontic Appliances, Orthodontic Appliances, Fixed, Single-Blind Method, Streptococcus mutans, Toothbrushing, Biofilm, Dental plaque, Fixed orthodontic appliance, Gingival index, Gingival inflammation, LED toothbrush, Orthodontic patient, Plaque index, Streptococcus mutans","Background: Patients with fixed orthodontic appliances have higher plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of a light emitting diode (LED) toothbrush with a manual toothbrush in reducing dental plaque and gingival inflammation in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances, and to investigate the effect of the LED toothbrush on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) biofilm in vitro. Methods: Twenty-four orthodontic patients were recruited and randomly assigned into 2 groups: (1) started with manual and (2) started with LED toothbrushes. After a 28-day usage and 28-day wash-out period, the patients switched to the other intervention. The plaque and gingival indices were determined at baseline and 28 days after each intervention. The patients’ compliance and satisfaction scores were collected using questionnaires. For the in vitro experiments, S. mutans biofilm was divided into 5 groups (n = 6) with 15-, 30-, 60-, or 120-sec LED exposure, and without LED exposure as a control group. Results: There was no significant difference in the gingival index between the manual and LED toothbrush groups. The manual toothbrush was significantly more effective in reducing the plaque index in the proximal area on the bracket side (P = 0.031). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in other areas around the brackets or on the non-bracket side. After LED exposure in vitro, the percentages of bacterial viability after LED exposure for 15–120 s were significantly lower compared with the control (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Clinically, the LED toothbrush was not more effective in reducing dental plaque or gingival inflammation than the manual toothbrush in orthodontic patients with fixed appliances. However, the blue light from the LED toothbrush significantly reduced the number of S. mutans in biofilm when it was exposed to the light for at least 15 s in vitro.

The fibrous mats were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and mechanical tensile testing. Investigation of the stability of the membrane sensor revealed that this nanofiber was tolerant over a wide range of temperatures, and the color on the fiber mats was initially stable after 20 days of storage at room temperature. In addition, pH-responsive nanofiber was applied for real-time meat spoilage monitoring. The results indicated that their color changed with a change in pH as a result of the release of volatile basic compounds due to the spoilage of meat. Thus, the pH-responsive nanofibrous membrane developed in this study can be potentially utilized for food packaging applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering","Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"

The Ag/TiO2 hollow nanofibres were fabricated and calcined in ambient air at 500 °C. By calcination, the removal of organic materials and the formation of anatase TiO2 were achieved with a well-retained hollow structure. The embedded Ag nanoparticles functioned as seeds for the Ag2O outgrowth on the TiO2 surface using a hydrothermal treatment at different times and temperatures, which caused the change in physical appearance, surface area, and electrical conductivity of 2D Ag2O/TiO2. A high quantity of Ag2O nanobranches on TiO2 nanofibres were obtained with increasing the temperature from 110 to 115 °C and the reaction time to 60 min. Consequently, the electrochemical active surface area (EASA) value was maximised to 65.25 cm2 per cm2 with an enhanced electrical conductivity of 91.3 ± 3.9 × 10−2 S cm−1. Further studies on the depth-profiles of Ag, Ti, and O revealed the presence of Ag2O attached to the core structure of TiO2.

Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis and thus a target for reducing melanin production. Although abalone is a good source of bioactive peptides that have been used for several properties including depigmentation, the available information on the anti-tyrosinase property of abalone peptides remains insufficient. This study investigated the anti-tyrosinase properties of Haliotis diversicolor tyrosinase inhibitory peptides (hdTIPs) based on mushroom tyrosinase, cellular tyrosinase, and melanin content assays. The binding conformation between peptides and tyrosinase was also examined by molecular docking and dynamics study. KNN1 showed a high potent inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase with an IC50 of 70.83 μM. Moreover, our selected hdTIPs could inhibit melanin production through the reductions in tyrosinase activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by enhancing the antioxidative enzymes. RF1 showed the highest activity on both cellular tyrosinase inhibition and ROS reduction. leading to the lower melanin content in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Accordingly, it can be assumed that our selected peptides exhibited high potential in medical cosmetology applications.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The proposed deceptive jamming model works in passive mode. It interrupts the opponent radar signals and after addition of the deceptive signals, the processed signals are propagated back to neutralize the surveillance operation of the intended radar. When the opponent PAR receives these signals, it perceives multiple fake aircrafts flying at different ranges along the actual aircraft with modified and up-shifted radial velocity. Further, the proposed model uses diversification in frequencies, waveforms, and time modulation to protect the flight of the preferred aircraft. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified through several simulations in Matlab using different number of arrays, directions and ranges.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

In response to the court order, the PCD decided to reduce the contamination level by dredging the sediments of the creek. Therefore, this study is the first investigation to be conducted on the coupled effects of sediment resuspension caused by dredging and changes in water nutrient concentrations upon the remobilization of Pb from sediments into the water column. The Pb concentrations and speciation in both the water and sediments collected from upstream and downstream regions of the contaminated area were determined. The results showed that the total Pb concentrations in the water taken from all sampling sites in both the dry and wet seasons were lower than the national standard (50 μg/L), and a very low mobility index was found for Pb. The highest total Pb concentration in the sediments (6930 mg/kg) from the downstream site was 23.7- to 30.4-fold greater than those of the sediments collected from the upstream site. The predominant Pb species (organic and residual Pb fractions) in the sediments collected during the dry season were identified. However, carbonate- and Fe–Mn oxide-bound Pb fractions were mainly found in the sediments collected in the wet season. The diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)-labile Pb concentrations, which reached 2.1 mg/L, indicated potential toxicity to aquatic organisms. A total of nine resuspension scenarios generalizing all changes in water nutrient concentrations in addition to sediment resuspension due to dredging were constructed. The results confirmed that sediment resuspension alone could remobilize Pb from the sediments into the water at levels from 0.06 to 16.9 μg/L. Sediment resuspension in water contaminated with 1 mg/L phosphate (PO43−) led to the dissolution of 28.4–73.0 μg/L Pb in the water column. Nitrate (NO3−) did not significantly remobilize Pb from the sediments into the water. The high ionic strength and activity coefficient of PO43− in the water were expected to cause the retention of dissolved Pb in the water and enhance the remobilization of Pb from the sediments due to the association of Pb with PO43− in the water.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, applied sedimentology, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Hence, there is attention for trend prediction of the located deposition of inhaled particles. In this study, Weibel's based human airway model (G0-G5) was employed. The computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) simulation was successfully validated by comparison to the previous research studies. The CFD-DEM achieves a better balance between numerical accuracy and computational requirement when comparing with the other methods. Then, the model was used to analyze the non-spherical drug transport with different drug particle sizes, shapes, density, and concentrations. The results found that all the studied factors affected the drug deposition and particle out-mass percentage except the drug concentration. The drug deposition was increased with the increasing of particle size and particle density due to the influence of particle inertia. The Tomahawk-shaped drug deposited easier than the cylindrical drug shape because of the different drag behavior. For the effect of airway geometries, G0 was the maximum deposited zone and G3 was the minimum deposited zone. The boundary layer was found around bifurcation due to the shear force at the wall. Finally, the knowledge can give an essential recommendation for curing patients with pharmaceutical aerosol.

Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are double-stranded DNA sequences capable of downregulating the expression of downstream genes of the NF-κB pathway, which is recognized for regulating prototypical proinflammatory signals, physiological bone metabolism, pathologic bone destruction, and bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of NF-κB decoy ODNs on the extraction sockets of Wistar/ST rats when delivered by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres. Microcomputed tomography and trabecular bone analysis following treatment with NF-κB decoy ODN-loaded PLGA nanospheres (PLGA-NfDs) demonstrated inhibition of vertical alveolar bone loss with increased bone volume, smoother trabecular bone surface, thicker trabecular bone, larger trabecular number and separation, and fewer bone porosities. Histomorphometric and reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed reduced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-expressing osteoclasts, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, turnover rate, and increased transforming growth factor-β1 immunopositive reactions and relative gene expression. These data demonstrate that local NF-κB decoy ODN transfection via PLGA-NfD can be used to effectively suppress inflammation in a tooth-extraction socket during the healing process, with the potential to accelerate new bone formation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

This study investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on O-GlcNacylation in hepatocytes and its associations with hepatocarcinogenesis. Materials and Methods: Mouse and human HCC cell lines were used in an in vitro model of hyperglycemia. Western blotting was used to determine the effects of high glucose on O-GlcNacylation in HCC cells. Twenty 4-week-old C3H/HeNJcl mice were randomized into four groups: non-DM control, non-DM plus diethylnitrosamine (DEN), DM, and DM plus DEN. DM was induced using intraperitoneal injection of a single high dose of streptozotocin. DEN was used to induce HCC. All mice were euthanized at week 16 after DM induction, and the liver tissues were histologically examined using hematoxylin and eosin, and immunohistochemistry. Results: High glucose increased O-GlcNacylated proteins in mouse and human HCC cell lines compared with those cultured at normal glucose concentration. Mice with hyperglycemia or DEN treatment had increased O-GlcNacylated proteins in hepatocytes. No gross tumors were evident at the end of the experiment but hepatic morbidity was observed. Mice with hyperglycemia and DEN treatment showed greater histological morbidity in their livers, i.e. increased nuclear size, hepatocellular swelling and sinusoidal dilatation, compared with mice in the DM group or treated with DEN alone. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia increased O-GlcNAcylation in both in vitro and animal models. Increased O-GlcNAcylated proteins may be associated with hepatic histological morbidities which then promote HCC development in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Cancer Research"

In this study, a novel modeling approach was applied to a dataset of 117 groundwater samples collected from Kanchanaburi Province between April and July 2021. Twenty site-specific initial variables were considered as influencing factors to Ni contamination. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) function was used to select the fourteen most influencing variables. These variables were then used as input features to train a ME model to delineate the Ni contamination susceptibility at a high confidence (Area Under the Curve (AUC) validation value of 0.845). Ten input variables of the altitude, geology, land use, slope, soil type, distance to industrial areas, distance to mining areas, electric conductivity, oxidation–reduction potential, and groundwater depth were discovered in the most explaining the variation of spatial Ni contamination at very high (95.47 km2) and high (86.65 km2) susceptibility.

Y-X-Y Encoding for Identifying Types of Sentence Similarity,"Jinnovart T., Lursinsap C.",2023-01-01,"Direct encoding, Encoder, Encoding schemes, Encodings, Semantic similarity, Semantic similarity measures, Semeval, Sentence similarity, Similarity measure, Training time, Classifier, Encoder, SemEval, Sentence similarity","Determining the semantic similarity of any two arbitrary sentences requires two steps, i.e. sentence encoding and semantic similarity measure. The most important step is to encode a set of sentences into a set of equal-length vectors for similarity measure in forms of classification. Two practical encoding schemes had been proposed, statistical-based direct encoding and pretrained encoding. The first approach lacks considering word correlation and the dimension of encoded vector is very large. For the second approach, it requires an extra training time prior to the classification process. This study compromises the previous approaches by considering shallow neural networks for encoding sentences and classifying entailment relations between two sentences. A set of y-x-y encoder models is proposed where y can be greater or less than x depending on given dataset. Neither encoder models nor their corresponding classifiers are built upon big and complex structure, and hence is suitable for carrying out such task. The encoding scheme is tested with SICK 2014 dataset [1], specially designed for neutral, entailment, and contradiction sentence pairs. Comparison results (neutral 97.1%, entailment 91.1%, contradiction 94.6%) support the possibility of the proposed scheme to sentence similarity measure.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Information Systems, Media Technology, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Enhancing Network Visibility and Security with Advanced Port Scanning Techniques,"Abu Bakar R., Kijsirikul B.",2023-09-01,"Accuracy limitations, Cyberthreats, Intrusion Detection Systems, Network visibility, Networks security, Port scanning, Scanning methods, Scanning techniques, Speed accuracy, Vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection system, network security, network visibility, port scanning, vulnerability assessment","Network security is paramount in today’s digital landscape, where cyberthreats continue to evolve and pose significant risks. We propose a DPDK-based scanner based on a study on advanced port scanning techniques to improve network visibility and security. The traditional port scanning methods suffer from speed, accuracy, and efficiency limitations, hindering effective threat detection and mitigation. In this paper, we develop and implement advanced techniques such as protocol-specific probes and evasive scan techniques to enhance the visibility and security of networks. We also evaluate network scanning performance and scalability using programmable hardware, including smart NICs and DPDK-based frameworks, along with in-network processing, data parallelization, and hardware acceleration. Additionally, we leverage application-level protocol parsing to accelerate network discovery and mapping, analyzing protocol-specific information. In our experimental evaluation, our proposed DPDK-based scanner demonstrated a significant improvement in target scanning speed, achieving a 2× speedup compared to other scanners in a target scanning environment. Furthermore, our scanner achieved a high accuracy rate of 99.5% in identifying open ports. Notably, our solution also exhibited a lower CPU and memory utilization, with an approximately 40% reduction compared to alternative scanners. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed scanning techniques in enhancing network visibility and security. The outcomes of this research contribute to the field by providing insights and innovations to improve network security, identify vulnerabilities, and optimize network performance.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

However, the prevalence and impact of secondary invasive fungal infections (IFIs) post RVIs in LTRs have not been investigated. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective study including LTRs diagnosed with 5 different respiratory viral pathogens between January 2010 to May 2021 and evaluated their clinical outcomes in 1 year. The risk factors of IFIs were evaluated by logistic regression. The impact of IFIs on CLAD stage progression/death was examined by Cox regression. Results: A total of 202 RVI episodes (50 influenza, 31 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, 30 metapneumovirus, 44 parainfluenza, and 47 respiratory syncytial virus) in 132 patients was included for analysis. Thirty-one episodes (15%) were associated with secondary IFIs, and 27 occurred in LTRs with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI; 28% from 96 LRTI episodes). Aspergillosis was the most common IFI (80%). LTRs with IFIs had higher disease severity during RVI episodes. In multivariable analysis, RVI with LTRI was associated with IFI (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 7.85 (2.48-24.9). Secondary IFIs were associated with CLAD stage progression/death after accounting for LRTI, pre-existing CLAD, intensive care unit admission, secondary bacterial pneumonia and underlying lung diseases pre-transplant with adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) of 2.45 (1.29-4.64). Conclusions: This cohort demonstrated 15% secondary IFI prevalence in LTRs with RVIs. Importantly, secondary IFIs were associated with CLAD stage progression/death, underscoring the importance of screening for fungal infections in this setting.",medical,"Surgery, Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Transplantation"
Practical considerations for the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the Asia–Pacific countries—An expert consensus statement,"Liew A., Lydia A., Matawaran B.J., Susantitaphong P., Tran H.T.B., Lim L.L.",2023-08-01,"Aged, Blood Glucose, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Humans, Hypoglycemic Agents, Risk Factors, Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, ketosis, sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors, urinary tract infections","Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing the risks of cardiovascular and renal events in both patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Consequently, many international guidelines have begun advocating for the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for the purpose of organ protection rather than as simply a glucose-lowering agent. However, despite the consistent clinical benefits and available strong guideline recommendations, the utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors have been unexpectedly low in many countries, a trend which is much more noticeable in low resource settings. Unfamiliarity with the recent focus in their organ protective role and clinical indications; concerns with potential adverse effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, including acute kidney injury, genitourinary infections, euglycemic ketoacidosis; and their safety profile in elderly populations have been identified as deterring factors to their more widespread use. This review serves as a practical guide to clinicians managing patients who could benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitors treatment and instill greater confidence in the initiation of these drugs, with the aim of optimizing their utilization rates in high-risk populations.",medical,Nephrology

This approach is simple in concept, easy to implement and has the capability of solving complex optimization problems. The received data from the far field located targets are initially passed through the matched filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and then the fitness function is optimized by incorporating the concept of virtual or extended array manifold vectors of the system. The proposed approach outperforms other algorithms mentioned in the literature by utilizing statistical tools for fitness, root mean square error, cumulative distribution function, histograms, and box plots.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Comprehensive mass transfer analysis of CO2 absorption in high potential ternary AMP-PZ-MEA solvent using three-level factorial design,"Nakrak S., Tontiwachwuthikul P., Gao H., Liang Z., Sema T.",2023-01-01,"Amines, Carbon Dioxide, Ethanolamine, Piperazine, Solvents, Absorption, Amine, Carbon dioxide, Mass transfer","Mass transfer of CO2 absorption in 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) - piperazine (PZ) - monoethanolamine (MEA) was statistically investigated in terms of overall mass transfer coefficient (KGav) and CO2 removal percentage. The parameters of interest were lean solvent flux (A), rich gas flux (B), CO2 loading in the lean solvent (C), and ratio of the sampling height to the total column height h/ h (D). From ANOVA, A was the most impactable parameter on both responses with three-quarters of the overall contribution. Regarding the three-level factorial design, a second-order polynomial increasing trend of KGav was observed as C and/or D increased. Additionally, KGav linearly increased as A increased but was not affected by B. On the other hand, the CO2 removal percentage linearly increased as A and/or D increased but linearly decreased as B and/or C increased. Surface analysis suggested the optimum condition for both responses at a high level of A, low level of B, low level of C, and middle level of D. In this work, D was statistically investigated and included in the predictive correlation for KGav for the first time. The main advantage of the proposed correlation over the recently reported correlations was that it did not require a measurement of CO2 partial pressure along the column height. For each amine component in the blend, (i) AMP played a positive key role in cyclic capacity and solvent regeneration duty, (ii) PZ enhanced transfer rate, and (iii) MEA elevated total amine concentration. As a result, 1.5:1.5:3 was recommended due to (i) elevations of 68.2% KGav, 14% CO2 removal percentage, 15.1% absorption capacity, and 66.7% cyclic capacity and (ii) reduction of 50% regeneration duty compared with 5 M MEA. With respect to the other literature-reported solvents, AMP-PZ-MEA is very competitive in terms of transfer coefficient, cyclic capacity, and solvent regeneration heat duty.

Their screening and assessment are challenging due to clinical heterogeneity and different use of nomenclature between psychiatrists and neurologists. Objective: An International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society subcommittee aimed to rate psychometric quality of severity and screening instruments for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders. Methods: Following the methodology adopted by previous International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society subcommittee papers, instruments for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders were reviewed, applying a classification as “recommended,” “recommended with caveats,” “suggested,” or “listed.”. Results: Our review identified 23 instruments. The highest grade of recommendation reached is “recommended with caveats,” assigned to seven severity rating instruments (Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale, Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale, Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre involuntary movements scale, Simpson Angus Scale, and Matson Evaluation of Drug Side effects). Only three of these seven (Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale, Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre, Matson Evaluation of Drug Side effects) were also screening instruments. Their main caveats are insufficient demonstration of psychometric properties (internal consistency, skewing, responsiveness to change) and long duration of administration. Eight “suggested” instruments did not meet requirements for the “recommended” grade also because of insufficient psychometric validation. Other limitations shared by several instruments are lack of comprehensiveness in assessing the spectrum of antipsychotic-associated movement disorders and ambiguous nomenclature. Conclusions: The high number of instruments “recommended with caveats” does not support the need for developing new instruments for antipsychotic-associated movement disorders. However, addressing the caveats with new psychometric studies and revising existing instruments to improve the clarity of their nomenclature are recommended next steps. © 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical)"

Peroxisomal disorders represent a class of medical conditions caused by deficiencies in peroxisome function and are segmented into enzyme-and-transporter defects (defects in single peroxisomal proteins) and peroxisome biogenesis disorders (defects in the peroxin proteins, critical for normal peroxisome assembly and biogenesis). In this study, we employed multivariate supervised and non-supervised statistical methods and utilized mass spectrometry data of neurological patients, peroxisomal disorder patients (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome), and healthy controls to analyze the role of common metabolites in peroxisomal disorders, to develop and refine a classification models of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome, and to explore analytes with utility in rapid screening and diagnostics. Results: T-SNE, PCA, and (sparse) PLS-DA, operated on mass spectrometry data of patients and healthy controls were utilized in this study. The performance of exploratory PLS-DA models was assessed to determine a suitable number of latent components and variables to retain for sparse PLS-DA models. Reduced-features (sparse) PLS-DA models achieved excellent classification performance of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome patients. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated metabolic differences between healthy controls, neurological patients, and peroxisomal disorder (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome) patients, refined classification models and showed the potential utility of hexacosanoylcarnitine (C26:0-carnitine) as a screening analyte for Chinese patients in the context of a multivariate discriminant model predictive of peroxisomal disorders.","pediatrics and pediatric surgery, medical","Genetics (clinical), Pharmacology (medical)"

The ability to detect DNA and RNA in a simple, rapid, affordable and portable format leads to a range of important applications for early screening in the field of disease monitoring and management. Herein, we report the development of an isothermal, label-free electrochemical biosensor that was designed on the basis of target-driven MNAzyme cleavage activity. Hybridization with HPV mRNA, a model nucleic acid target, activated MNAzyme and initiated the cleavage of immobilized hairpin substrates, leading to changes in the electrochemical signal. Under optimal conditions, a detection limit of 2.6 pM was obtained with an incubation time of 60 min. Furthermore, an artificial chaperone-enhanced MNAzyme (ACEzyme) system was integrated to an electrochemical biosensor for the first time. The analytical performance of the biosensor was enhanced, and the detection time was significantly reduced by the addition of PLL-g-Dex, which exhibits nucleic acid chaperone-like activity. A detection limit of 0.88 pM was obtained with a threefold decrease in incubation time without prior amplification. The proposed biosensing platform shows the advantages of simple fabrication and operation, good selectivity in the presence of single-base mismatch, and excellent versatility in a complex mixture of total RNA. We believe that this isothermal, label-free, and protein-free nucleic acid analysis platform could provide foundations for the further development of a universal nucleic acid biosensing platform for clinical application.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

AAF mortars were synthesized using sodium silicate and high-calcium fly ash as the solid activator and aluminosilicate source, respectively. This procedure classified the binder as a one-part AAF mortar. The mechanical properties of the AAF mortar, including compressive and flexural strengths, were investigated considering eight mixes with varying SAP contents (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% by weight of binder) and fiber contents (0 and 0.2% by volume). Moreover, physical properties including the permeability and sorptivity were examined, and physiochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the behavior of AAF mortar at room temperature, 300, 500, and 700 °C. The results show that the compressive strength of specimens at room temperature slightly decreased owing to the increased macroporosity caused by SAPs through pre-swelling, while the flexural strength was maintained via an internal curing effect. The PP fibers significantly enhanced the flexural capacity of the cement mortar, while the compressive strength initially decreased at 28 d and later exhibited a negligible effect at 90 d. The specimens produced using SAPs were effective in preserving the residual compressive and flexural strengths compared with those without SAPs after exposure to 300 °C. Meanwhile, the residual strength of PP fiber specimens diminished after elevated temperature exposure because the melted fiber led to the excessive formation of cavities.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

The aims of this study were to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and physical performance and to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D levels, muscle strength and physical activity in elderly patients with LDD. The participants were 200 LDD patients, including 155 females and 45 males aged 60 years and over. Data on body mass index and body composition were collected. Serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone levels were measured. Serum 25(OH)D was classified into the insufficiency group: <30 ng/mL and the sufficiency group: ≥30 ng/mL. Muscle strength was assessed by grip strength, and physical performance (short physical performance battery) was evaluated by the balance test, chair stand test, gait speed, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25(OH)D levels in LDD patients with vitamin D insufficiency were significantly lower than in those with vitamin D sufficiency (p < 0.0001). LDD patients with vitamin D insufficiency had a prolonged time in physical performance on gait speed (p = 0.008), chair stand test (p = 0.013), and TUG test (p = 0.014) compared to those with vitamin D sufficiency. Additionally, we found that serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly correlated with gait speed (r = −0.153, p = 0.03) and TUG test (r = −0.168, p = 0.017) in LDD patients. No significant associations with serum 25(OH)D status were observed for grip strength and balance tests among patients. These findings demonstrate that higher serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with better physical performance in LDD patients.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Objective: To explore the correlation between serum TMAO reductase, gut leakage, and systemic inflammation in CKD. Methods: Mouse models of gut leakage; including 5/6 nephrectomy-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD), a model without colitis, and 1.5% dextran sulfate solution (DSS), a colitis model, were performed. In parallel, serum samples from patients with chronic hemodialysis (n = 48) and the healthy control (n = 20) were analyzed. Results: Gut-leakage (FITC-dextran, endotoxemia, and reduced intestinal tight junction protein) was detected in both CKD and DSS models. While TMAO reductase and TMAO were elevated in the serum of both mouse models and patients, TMAO reductase correlated with TMAO, gut-leakage, and serum IL-6 only in mice but not in patients. Notably, endotoxemia was used as a surrogate marker of gut leakage in patients. In patients, TMAO reductase and TMAO did not correlate with serum IL-6 and vascular complications using the ankle-brachial index and cardio-ankle vascular index.

By capitalizing on comparative advantages of experimental methods, we provide insights into how investors process the information contained in different presentation methods to make cash flow forecasts, especially in the context of various types of nonrecurring items. We predict and find that, when nonrecurring accrued expenses are present, the indirect method leads to lower forecast errors by activating investors’ underlying knowledge structures of operating cash flows in terms of an accrual (versus cash) basis. We also find that, in the presence of nonrecurring cash or nonrecurring accrued revenues, there is no difference in forecast errors between the indirect and direct methods. Moreover, we find that the combination of the direct and indirect methods (the direct-plus-indirect method) leads to lower forecast errors than the direct method, but it does not provide an incremental benefit for forecast accuracy beyond the indirect method.","fluidex; related topics, Business, decision sciences","Strategy and Management, Management Science and Operations Research"

It is very difficult to diagnose in the beginning as it is asymptomatic, which leads to blindness. Presently, there are about 422 million diabetes patients, and it is projected that the number will be 552 million in 2030, as per a report from the World Health Organization. With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision fields, many CNN-powered models have been developed for the detection and classification of DR using color fundus images. Early diagnosis of DR will increase recovery and decrease the possibility of vision loss threats. In this study, we aim to classify Diabetic Retinopathy in two stages, diseased versus healthy images. Three different pre-trained CNN models, namely, VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNet were deployed through transfer learning. Messidor and Messidor-2, two publicly available datasets are used in the training and testing of these CNN models. In terms of classification accuracy, the highest result of 84% was obtained using InceptionV3, whereas MobileNet and VGG16 shows 83% and 78% accuracy, respectively. The Highest 86 % precision for the healthy class and 88% sensitivity for the diseased class is shown by VGG16.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, arts, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, medical","Education, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Media Technology, Health Informatics"

Reliable biomarkers that can accurately reflect disease activity, diagnose, and monitor the progression of neurodegenerative diseases are crucial for the development of effective therapies. However, identifying suitable biomarkers has been challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of these diseases, affecting specific subsets of neurons in different brain regions. One promising approach for promoting brain regeneration and recovery involves the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs have demonstrated the ability to modulate the immune system, promote neurite outgrowth, stimulate angiogenesis, and repair damaged tissues, partially through the release of their extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSC-derived EVs retain some of the therapeutic characteristics of their parent MSCs, including their ability to regulate neurite outgrowth, promote angiogenesis, and facilitate tissue repair. This review aims to explore the potential of MSC-derived EVs as an emerging therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting their role in modulating disease progression and promoting neuronal recovery. By elucidating the mechanisms by which MSC-derived EVs exert their therapeutic effects, we can advance our understanding and leverage their potential for the development of novel treatment approaches in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.","medical, pharmacology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)"
Sequential most probable point update combining Gaussian process and comprehensive learning PSO for structural reliability-based design optimization,"Van Huynh T., Tangaramvong S., Do B., Gao W., Limkatanyu S.",2023-07-01,"Comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizations, Constraint boundaries, Expected feasibility function, Gaussian process regression, Gaussian process regression model, Inverse monte carlo, Inverse monte-carlo simulation constraint boundary, Monte Carlo's simulation, Most Probable Point, Reliability-based design optimization, Comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization, Expected feasibility function, Gaussian process regression, Inverse MCS constraint boundary, Most probable point, Reliability-based design optimization","This paper proposes an efficient reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) method that advantageously decouples comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) algorithm with Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, termed as GPR-CLPSO. The method iteratively performs the CLPSO with deterministic parameters based on the most probable point (MPP) underpinning limit-state functions (LSFs) iteratively updated by the active learning reliability evaluation process. The GPR model approximates, from the design data given by CLPSO, the spectrum of LSFs under random parameters, and hence enables a significant computational reduction of Monte-Carlo simulations (MCSs) for failure probability approximation. The expected feasibility function is maximized using the CLPSO code to systematically refine the GPR model by adaptively adding new (intelligent) learning points in the region with high-reliability sensitivity leading to the more accurate prediction of failure probability. A novel inverse MCS constraint boundary method is developed to redefine the MPP assigned for the CLPSO algorithm in determining the new optimal design. The method efficiently leverages the decoupling approach, whilst significantly alleviating computing efforts, to quickly and accurately capture the optimal RBDO design. The resulting failure probability well satisfies the allowable limit. Four RBDO examples are provided to illustrate applications and robustness of the proposed decoupling GPR-CLPSO approach.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Methods: JSE-HPS original version was translated to develop the draft Thai JSE-HPS version and was administered to 5 dental students for a pilot test. The final questionnaires (JSE-HPS) were completed by 439 dental students from five public universities and one private in Thailand in the 2021–2022 academic year. The internal consistency and reliability (test-retest) of the questionnaires were tested by using Cronbach’s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Factor analysis was used to examine the underlying factors of the JSE-HPS (Thai language). Results: The JSE-HPS represented good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.83). Factor analysis revealed, “Compassionate Care”, “Perspective Taking” and “Ability to stand in Patients’ Shoes” as the first, second, and third factors, respectively. The mean empathy score of dental students was 114.30 (SD = 13.06) from the total score of 140. There were no significant differences in the empathy levels among genders, study programs, grades, universities, regions, types of universities, and years of study. Conclusion: The findings confirm the reliability and validity of the JSE-HPS (Thai version) to measure the empathy level among dental students. Integrating empathic elements into the dental curriculum will help student learning to be more effective and improve treatment outcomes.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)
Initiation and termination of liquid flow controlled drying collapse of interconnected parenchyma cells in palm wood,"Dumyang K., Settapong P., Rittiphet C., Khongthong S., Matan N.",2023-01-01,"Compression, Degree of drying, Drying collapse, Liquid flow, Liquid surface tension, Microstructural examination, Oil palm, Parenchyma cells, Permeability, Wall thickness, capillary pressure, compression, Drying collapse, liquid flow, parenchyma cells, permeability","The underlying mechanisms of drying collapse in liquid-filled oil palm wood (OPW) have been explored. By systematically varying the liquid surface tension inside the OPW, different degrees of drying collapse commonly observed throughout the whole trunk were shown to be initiated at identical threshold capillary pressure. Microstructural examination confirmed that despite having different sizes and wall thicknesses, the thin-wall parenchyma cells possess a roughly constant wall thickness-to-radius ratio to resist buckling. The equivalent behavior of drying collapse and mechanical collapse under compression of saturated OPW was demonstrated to prove that the drying collapse is controlled by the flow of liquid through the wood. Less collapse corresponds to the lower permeability of the liquid through the wood cells. Variation in the post-collapse behavior is a result of the initiation and termination of the liquid flow inside the interconnected parenchyma cell cavities through small pit openings of plasmodesmata of various distributions. This new understanding provides insight into the drying collapse mechanism of the liquid-filled partially closed-cell foam of a similar structure.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

This study aimed to apply a biorefinery approach by examining the feasibility of microwave-assisted cassava pulp hydrolysis to attain sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. Four factors, namely, the liquid-to-solid ratio (20 mL/g, 10 mL/g, 7.5 mL/g, and 5 mL/g), types of acids (H2SO4 and H3PO4), watt power (600 W, 700 W, and 800 W) and time (3, 5 and 8 min), were carefully investigated. The highest fermentable sugar content of 88.1 g/L ± 0.7 g/L (0.88 g fermentable sugars/g dry cassava pulp) was achieved when 20 mL/g cassava pulp was hydrolyzed with 2.5% (v/v) H2SO4 under microwave irradiation at 800 W for 8 min. Glucose was a major product (82.0 g/L ± 5.2 g/L). The inhibitor concentration was 5.17 g/L ± 0.01 g/L, and the levulinic acid concentration was 5.15 g/L ± 0.01 g/L. The results indicated that the liquid-to-solid ratio, diluted acid concentration, irradiation watt power and time were important factors in producing fermentable sugars from acid hydrolysis under microwave irradiation. The crude hydrolysate was used for PHB production by Cupriavidus necator strain A-04. The hydrolysate to nutrients ratio of 30:70 (v/v) yielded a cell dry weight of 7.5 g/L ± 0.1 g/L containing PHB content of 66.8% ± 0.3% (w/w), resulting in a yield (Formula presented.)

Whether a strategy involving shorter initial treatment may lead to similar outcomes is unclear. Methods In this adaptive, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned participants with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis to undergo either standard treatment (rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks) or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen, extended treatment for persistent clinical disease, monitoring after treatment, and retreatment for relapse. There were four strategy groups with different initial regimens; noninferiority was assessed in the two strategy groups with complete enrollment, which had initial regimens of high-dose rifampin-linezolid and bedaquiline-linezolid (each with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). The primary outcome was a composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96. The noninferiority margin was 12 percentage points. Results Of the 674 participants in the intention-to-treat population, 4 (0.6%) withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. A primary-outcome event occurred in 7 of the 181 participants (3.9%) in the standard-treatment group, as compared with 21 of the 184 participants (11.4%) in the strategy group with an initial rifampin-linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 7.4 percentage points; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 13.2; noninferiority not met) and 11 of the 189 participants (5.8%) in the strategy group with an initial bedaquiline-linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 0.8 percentage points; 97.5% CI, -3.4 to 5.1; noninferiority met). The mean total duration of treatment was 180 days in the standard-treatment group, 106 days in the rifampin-linezolid strategy group, and 85 days in the bedaquiline-linezolid strategy group. The incidences of grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the three groups. Conclusions A strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week bedaquiline-linezolid regimen was noninferior to standard treatment for tuberculosis with respect to clinical outcomes. The strategy was associated with a shorter total duration of treatment and with no evident safety concerns.

In this study, aminosilane functionalization is employed to improve the nano-sized zeolite Y (ZeY) particle dispersion and adhesion in polyether block amide (Pebax). The performance of CO2/CH4 separation of Pebax mixed matrix composite hollow fiber membranes, incorporated with ZeY and aminosilane-modified zeolite Y (Mo-ZeY), is investigated. The addition of the zeolite filler at a small loading at 5 wt.% has a positive impact on both gas permeability and separation factor. Due to the CO2-facilitated transport effect, the performance of MMMs is further improved by the amino-functional groups modified on the ZeY. When 5 wt.% of Mo-ZeY is incorporated, the gas permeability and CO2/CH4 separation factor of the Pebax membrane are enhanced by over 100% and 35%, respectively.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The results demonstrated that the dielectric constant (ɛr) increased with increasing temperature from -50 °C to 120 °C at 104 Hz, indicating that the α-relaxation of main chain segments was occurred and the mobility of main chain could reorient the dipolar group, side group and end group to the same direction, and also increased at the temperature higher than glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer matrix and remained constant under a wide range of temperature because the rigidity of PCH decreased the mobility of the main chain segments. Furthermore, the disordered (α′) to ordered (α) phase transition is confirmed by the strong (110)/(200) and (203) reflection peaks, implying dipole alignment from the ordered main chain segments. In addition, after applying the pressure, the results demonstrated the change in charge density with increasing pressure, leading to a change in capacitance and the dielectric constant. Thus, this dielectric material with sensing and monitoring properties had considerable promise for a dielectric sensor.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Cytotoxicity was determined with MTT assay for the estimation of the half maximal cytotoxic concentrations (IC50). Effects of the test compounds on activities of efflux transporters (BCRP, P-gp, MRP1, and MRP2) were evaluated with substrate accumulation assays using fluorometry and flow cytometry analysis. Out of these 11 test compounds, the stilbene pinosylvin monomethyl ether displayed its cytotoxicity specifically toward MCF7 cells (IC50 = 6.2 ± 1.2 μM, 72-h incubation) with 4.96 folds higher than normal fibroblast. Its potency decreased in MCF7/DOX and MCF7/MX cells by 3.94 and 7.38 folds, respectively. Our transporter assay indicated that this stilbene significantly reduced the activities of P-gp, MRP1, and MRP2, but not BCRP. After 48-h co-incubation, this stilbene (at 2 μM) synergistically increased doxorubicin- and mitoxantrone-mediated cytotoxicity in MCF7, MCF7/DOX, and MCF7/MX cells potentially by increasing the intracellular level of cytotoxic drug.

The results showed that up to 88 mg H2/g wood pellets, which is 1.3 times higher than the theoretical hydrogen from feedstock (around 65 mg/g), was obtained at temperatures below 1000 °C. Combining CO2 and steam as gasifying agents resulted in a 6% increase in the gas yield and up to 93% reduction in tar content (0.03g/Nm3) compared to steam gasification (0.5–0.7 g/Nm3). Although the hydrogen content in the gas stream was similar in both cases of steam and CO2-steam gasification (88 mg/g pellets), the CO2 content in the gas stream from CO2-steam gasification was reduced by 12%–17% compared with steam gasification. The H2/CO ratio in the gas stream was between 3.2 and 3.8 for steam gasification and 1.6–2.3 for CO2-steam gasification. The cold gas efficiency (a ratio of calorific value of products to that of wood pellets) of CO2-steam gasification was up to 14–16% higher than that of steam-gasification due to higher CO content in the gas. It can be concluded that using CO2- steam two-stage gasification increases the process efficiency and sustainability by utilising carbon source in CO2 emission.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Objectives: We sought to conduct an indirect comparison of tezepelumab to dupilumab, benralizumab, and mepolizumab in the treatment of eosinophilic asthma. Methods: The investigators conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analyses. They identified randomized controlled trials indexed in PubMed, Embase, or Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) between January 1, 2000, and August 12, 2022. Outcomes included exacerbation rates, prebronchodilator FEV1, and the Asthma Control Questionnaire. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials (n = 9201) met eligibility. Tezepelumab (relative risk: 0.63; 95% credible interval [CI]: 0.46-0.86) was associated with significantly lower exacerbation rates than benralizumab and larger improvements in FEV1 compared to mepolizumab (mean difference [MD]: 66; 95% CI: −33 to 170) and benralizumab (MD: 62; 95% CI: −22 to 150), though the 95% CI crossed the null value of 0. Mepolizumab improved the Asthma Control Questionnaire score the most, but this improvement was not significantly different from that of tezepelumab (tezepelumab vs mepolizumab; MD: 0.14; 95% CI: −0.10 to 0.38).

However, the bio-inertness of PEEK's surface has limited its applications. Ambient sulfonation has been adopted to enhance bioactivity, but its nanoscale topographic changes are insufficient for implant-bone interlock. To further improve bone-implant interlock, this study employs CO2 laser machining to create sub-millimeter (0.5 mm) grooves on PEEK's surface, aiming to encourage bone ingrowth and strengthen the implant-bone interface. This research investigated the physical and chemical properties and bio-interaction of PEEK surface modified by sulfonation (SPEEK), laser machining (L-PEEK), and combination of both technique (L-SPEEK). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra revealed that sulfonation compensates for the surface chemical shift instigated by laser ablation, aligning the surface chemistry of L-SPEEK with that of SPEEK. Furthermore, L-PEEK surfaces presented pores with sizes ranging from 1 to 600 μm, while SPEEK surfaces exhibited pores between 5 and 700 nm. All tested samples demonstrated non-cytotoxicity, with L-SPEEK exhibiting the highest mineralization and ALP activity as 2 and 2.1 times that of intrinsic PEEK, after 21 days of incubation. Microscopic imaging reveals a notably higher extracellular content on L-SPEEK compared to the other groups. This study underscores the potential of combining sub-millimeter laser machining with sulfonation in enhancing early osteogenic markers, providing a promising pathway for future PEEK-based orthopedic applications.","heat exchange, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

Recognizing the significance of alternate wetting and drying technology in sustainable agriculture, this study aims to promote the adoption of this technology among both Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and non-GAP farmers in Suburban, Bangkok, Thailand. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire, which gathered information on farmers' cost and return values, as well as their adoption opinions. The collected data were then analyzed using cost and return analysis, as well as stochastic frontier analysis. The results indicate that non-GAP farmers face significantly higher total costs due to increased fixed costs compared to GAP farmers. While there were no significant differences in yield between the two groups, GAP farmers achieved significantly higher total income and net profit due to lower total costs and higher selling prices. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that both groups of rice farmers have the potential to improve their efficiency levels, with non-GAP farmers showing a higher potential for improvement. In terms of adoption opinion, both farmer groups recognize the advantages of wet and dry farming technology over traditional flooded rice farming. This study highlights that the adoption levels of both GAP and non-GAP farmers can be significantly improved through the implementation of best management practices.

Esterification of oleic acid to biodiesel using biowaste-based solid acid catalyst under microwave irradiation,"Kushwaha T., Ao S., Ngaosuwan K., Assabumrungrat S., Gurunathan B., Rokhum S.L.",2023-01-01,"Biodiesel production, Biowastes, Carbon-based, Esterification of oleic acids, Microwave- irradiations, Renewable energies, Solid acid catalysts, Solid catalysts, Synthesised, ]+ catalyst, biodiesel, renewable energy, sustainability, waste management","A novel carbon-based solid catalyst was synthesized from waste biomass of watermelon peel (Citrullus lanatus) by one pot carbonization and functionalization with H2SO4 for biodiesel production. Oleic acid was utilized as a test substrate in this study given that it is a key component for majority of feedstocks used for biodiesel production. Synthesized catalyst was extensively characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy–EDX and Brunauer–Emmett Teller analysis. The catalyst revealed aromatic structure, hydrophilic -OH and -COOH groups as well as a high density of -SO3H active centres with a total acidity of 3.6 mmol g−1. Using the optimized reaction condition (MeOH: oleic acid molar ratio 20:1, catalyst loading 8 wt.%, temperature 100°C and reaction time of 60 min) under microwave irradiation (50 W, 100 psi) a conversion as high as 94.36 ± 0.3% of oleic acid to biodiesel was reported. Activation energy of the esterification was found to be 38.16 kJ mol−1. Catalyst recovery was probed to over five reaction cycles, with a modest loss in activity (81.73 ± 0.4% conversion in the fifth cycle) resulting from limited active site leaching.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy, coastal engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Chemical Engineering (all), Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Environmental Science (all)"

Many Asia Pacific (AP) countries still lack access to diagnostic tests and evidence-based therapies. Epidemiologic data from the AP is needed to formulate regional guidelines to improve standards of care for HAE. Objective: To investigate the estimated minimal prevalence, needs, and potential interventions for the diagnosis and management of HAE in the AP. Methods: A structured questionnaire was distributed to representative experts from member societies of the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology. Patient profiles and the presence of diagnostic facilities or tests, regional and national HAE guidelines, and patient support groups were reported and compared. Results: Completed questionnaires were received from 14 representatives of 12 member countries and territories, representing 46% of the world population. Overall minimal prevalence of HAE in the AP region was 0.02/100,000 population, with significant heterogeneity across different centers. Only one-half and one-third had registered on-demand and prophylactic medications, respectively. Few had patient support groups (58%) or regional guidelines (33%), and their existence was associated with the availability of HAE-specific medications. Availability of C1-inhibitor level testing was associated with a lower age at HAE diagnosis (P = .017). Conclusions: Hereditary angioedema in the AP differs from that in Western countries. Hereditary angioedema–specific medications were registered in only a minority of countries and territories, but those with patient support groups or regional guidelines were more likely to have better access. Asia Pacific–specific consensus and guidelines are lacking and urgently needed.",medical,Immunology and Allergy
Correlates of early initiation of breast feeding and prelacteal feeding: A cross-sectional study in Sindh province of Pakistan,"Kumar R., Amir-Ud-Din R., Ahmed J., Asim M., Rashid F., Khan S.A., Ali S., Pongpanich S.",2023-02-01,"Breast Feeding, Child, Cross-Sectional Studies, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Mothers, Pakistan, Pregnancy, Prenatal Care, Community child health, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, PRIMARY CARE, PUBLIC HEALTH","Objectives The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of early initiation of breast feeding and prelacteal feeding in highly disadvantaged districts in Pakistan. Design This cross-sectional study design. Settings This study was carried out in twelve districts of the Sindh province of Pakistan. Participants A total of 4800 mothers with children under 2 years, selected through a multistage random sampling method. Data analysis Bivariate association, survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard techniques), multivariate linear regression and the ordinary least square model were used. Results The results show that the prevalence of early initiation of breast feeding was 68% and prelacteal feeding was 32%. Adequate treatment, proper guidance at antenatal care visits, postpartum health check, normal birth with skilled birth attendants, institutional birth, skin-to-skin contact at birth and birth size were all associated with early breastfeeding initiation (p<0.001). The odds of early initiation of breast feeding after birth are higher if the respondents received proper guidance (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.11) or made skin-to-skin contact (OR 10.65; 95% CI 6.82 to 16.65). Bivariate association between the prelacteal feeding and a set of correlates suggests that all variables under study were significantly associated with the outcome variable of interest at a 95% or higher significance level. The factors which significantly reduced the odds of prelacteal feeding were adequate treatment (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and postpartum health check (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.80). Conclusion Sudy concludes that the correlates like adequate treatment of mothers during labour, postpartum health check-up, normal birth with skilled birth attendants, institutional births and skin-to-skin contact between mother and the baby determine the early initiation of breast feeding and prelecteal feeding. Early initiation of breast feeding needs to be encouraged, and communities must be educated against the use of prelacteal feeding.",medical,Medicine (all)
A convex optimization approach to multi-objective design of two-stage compensators for MIMO linear systems,"Supithak T., Banjerdpongchai D.",2023-03-01,"Convex optimisation, Multi objective, Multi-input multi-output, Multi-input multi-output linear system, Multi-objective criteria, Objective criteria, Performance, Q parameterization, Time domain, Time-domain performance, Two-stage compensator, Convex optimization, Multi-input multi-output linear system, Multi-objective criteria, Q-parameterization, Time-domain performance, Two-stage compensators","The previous design of two-stage compensators with multi-objectives concerns the closed-loop stability, the low-sensitivity, and the satisfactory time-domain performance. However, the design only considers the single-input single-output system. This paper aims to present the design of two-stage compensators for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear systems which contain dynamical interaction between inputs and outputs. When Youla parameterization is applied to the MIMO linear system, the design criteria can be cast as a nonlinear optimization. In addition, the infinite dimension optimization problem is approximated to a finite dimension problem with Ritz approximation. The suitable form of design parameters is proposed to ensure the low sensitivity of the MIMO system. The two-stage compensator design is formulated as convex optimization which is efficiently solved using available solvers. Finally, the two-stage compensators are designed for Wood and Berry's model of binary distillation column. The numerical results indicate that all design objectives of frequency domain and time domain can be achieved by the two-stage compensators.","mixing and separation, engineering, Mathematics, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Computer Science Applications, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"
Rice husk and coir fibers as sustainable and green reinforcements for high performance gypsum composites,"Aramwit P., Daniel Chin Vui Sheng D., Krishna Moorthy G., Guna V., Reddy N.",2023-08-22,"Acoustic absorption, Coir fibers, Flexural properties, Gypsum composites, Gypsum tile, High flexural strength, Hybrid composites, Performance, Rice husk, Ricehusk, Acoustic absorption, Gypsum tiles, Mechanical properties, Reinforcement, Ricehusk, Thermal conductivity","Reinforcing gypsum with coir and rice husk enhances the flexural properties, acoustic and thermal insulation and resistance to environmental degradation. Coir and rice husks are agricultural coproducts available in large quantities at low cost and are renewable and sustainable source. In addition, coir provides excellent strength increase and rice husks have low density and good thermal resistance. In this study, rice husk and coir were used as reinforcement for gypsum as individual components and also as blends. Up to 30 % of reinforcement was possible with enhanced properties. Compared to pure gypsum, up to 187 % increase in flexural strength, reduced moisture absorption and excellent thermal resistance were achieved. Highest flexural strength of 1.5 MPa was obtained when 10 % rice husk was added compared to highest strength of 5.6 MPa when 30 % coir fibers were added into gypsum. An equal proportion of 50 % ricehusk and 50 % coir fibers provided the highest flexural strength for the hybrid composites. Addition of ricehusk and coir also improved the acoustic resistance particularly between 2500 and 4000 Hz whereas there was no major difference in the thermal conductivity of the samples with and without the reinforcement. The extent of increase in properties could be controlled by varying the proportion of ricehusk and coir in gypsum ceiling tiles. Developing hybrid composites particularly in equal proportion of ricehusk and coir was found to be better in terms of improving the performance of gypsum. Being byproducts of major food crops, ricehusk and coir provide sustainable and renewable source for developing composites. Reinforcing gypsum with ricehusk and/or coir will also assist in decreasing the environmental burden and increasing the sustainability of buildings.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

However, in industrial drying various drying defects still occur, which include uneven moisture content between and within boards, board distortion, residual drying stresses that may induce internal and external checking, and wood collapse. This paper presents a review on advances in wood drying research and development, which lay foundation for better understanding of the drying process, mechanisms of drying defect occurrence and affecting factors. In particular, recent progresses in understanding drying stress development and wood collapse formation during drying are presented in more details. Based on these advances, inter-linkage and interactions are analyzed among wood physical and microstructural properties, moisture movement in wood during drying, stress development and reversal, and wood collapse formation. Following this, drying schedule improvements and novel drying technologies are presented with targets to mitigate the drying defects, reduce energy consumption and increase the productivity. Application of artificial intelligence for modeling and control of the timber drying is also briefly described.

It is still unknown how varying periods of anchorage loss contribute to anoikis resistance, cell migration, and metabolic reprogramming of cancerous cells. Results: Our study demonstrated that prolonging the anchorage-free lifetime of non-small-cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells for 7 days strengthened anoikis resistance, as shown by higher half-life and capability to survive and grow without anchorage, compared to wild-type cells or those losing anchorage for 3 days. While the prolonged anchorage-free lifetime was responsible for the increased aggressive feature of survival cells to perform rapid 3-dimensional migration during the first 3 h of a transwell assay, no significant influence was observed with 2-dimensional surface migration detected at 12 and 24 h by a wound-healing method. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant alteration in the intracellular levels of six (oxalic acid, cholesterol, 1-ethylpyrrolidine, 1-(3-methylbutyl)-2,3,4,6-tetramethylbenzene, β-alanine, and putrescine) among all 37 identified metabolites during 7 days without anchorage. Based on significance values, enrichment ratios, and impact scores of all metabolites and their associated pathways, three principal metabolic activities (non-standard amino acid metabolism, cell membrane biosynthesis, and oxidative stress response) offered potential links with anoikis resistance. Conclusions: These findings further our insights into the evolution of anoikis resistance in lung cancer cells and identify promising biomarkers for early lung cancer diagnosis.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)"

By using the differential pulse (DPV) technique, the SSZ produced a well-defined peak of around -0.3 V (vs Ag AgCl-1) in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer pH 4. Supporting electrolytes, pH, and salts all significantly impact SSZ reduction. Therefore, their impact on the working solutions was assessed. We discovered that using a mixture of Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer with pH 4 and MgCl2 as a supporting electrolyte can enhance SSZ sensitivity by approximately 1.7 times while simultaneously increasing detection selectivity. Under optimal conditions, the proposed assay demonstrated the ultrasensitive determination of SSZ with a broad linear detection range from 0.01 to 100 μM and a low detection limit of 4.7 nM (S/N = 3). To demonstrate the impact of the proposed method, the sensor has been successfully applied for the quantitative determination of SSZ in pharmaceutical, urine, and artificial serum sample. Therefore, this approach could offer simplicity, and rapidity, and serve as an alternative to the SSZ detection in practical applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, energy, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Electrochemistry, Materials Chemistry"

However, in mild acidic electrolytes, zinc anodes pose several issues that have yet to be overcome. For tackling the major difficulties of zinc anodes, electrolyte engineering is the most practical and cost-effective strategy. Notwithstanding the broad variety of mechanisms associated with different electrolyte additives, the function of a single additive is straightforward. Finding combined additives with broader functionalities and greater efficacy is crucial. In this work, the combination of ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide ([BMPY][DCN]) and ethylene glycol (EG) as additives in an aqueous electrolyte 3 M ZnSO4 proves to be an effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing both zinc dissolution and deposition. IL significantly enhances zinc (Zn) dissolution and deposition while EG plays an important role in suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)and corrosion. Thus, 13.50 % improvement in capacity is achieved by the mixed additive EG + IL/ZnSO4 compared with the 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the Zn//Zn symmetrical system at 2 mA cm−2, the mixed additive greatly augments the cyclability of zinc, reaching over 400 h while maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency (CE). In-situ XAS and FT-EXAFS analyses confirm the high activities of both zinc oxidation/reduction in the mixed additive electrolyte. Results demonstrate that EG + IL/ZnSO4 can be applied to increase the cyclability of aqueous zinc-based batteries while sustaining high performance.","coastal engineering, energy, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Fuel Technology"

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential to support clinical care but remains challenging in many countries, especially the low- and medium-income ones. Hence, undiagnosed RD (URD) account for a significant portion of the overall RD burden. Methods: In October 2020, the Developing Nations Working Group of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network International (DNWG-UDNI) launched a survey among its members, belonging to 20 countries across all continents, to map unmet needs and opportunities for patients with URD. The survey was based on questions with open answers and included eight different domains. Conflicting interpretations were resolved in contact with the partners involved. Results: All members responded to the survey. The results indicated that the scientific and medical centers make substantial efforts to respond to the unmet needs of patients. In most countries, there is a high awareness of RD issues. Scarcity of resources was highlighted as a major problem, leading to reduced availability of diagnostic expertise and research. Serious equity in accessibility to services were highlighted both within and between participating countries. Regulatory problems, including securing informed consent, difficulties in sending DNA to foreign laboratories, protection of intellectual property, and conflicts of interest on the part of service providers, remain issues of concern. Finally, most respondents stressed the need to strengthen international cooperation in terms of data sharing, clinical research, and diagnostic expertise for URD patients in low and medium income countries. Discussion: The survey highlighted that many countries experienced a discrepancy between the growing expertise and scientific value, the level of awareness and commitment on the part of relevant parties, and funding bodies. Country-tailored public health actions, including general syllabus of medical schools and of the education of other health professionals, are needed to reduce such gaps.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The foam dressings will help alleviate the pain patients experience from wound treatment. In this study, mangosteen extract, which has antibacterial properties, was combined with curcumin extract, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, to emphasize the importance of Thai herbs as the driving force of the Thailand economy. The three formulations of foam materials, Anti-inflame #1, Anti-inflame #2 and Anti-inflame #3, which contain the components of the natural extracts by using the extracts at various ratios, were investigated. The antibacterial activity results showed that the inhibition zones of Anti-inflame #1 and #3 were 7.25 ± 2.47 and 3.25 ± 0.71 mm, respectively, while Anti-inflame #2 application did not produce an inhibition zone. Anti-inflame #1 and #3 had the best bacterial reduction effects of 99.99% after 24 h. In addition, the toxicity of the foam wound dressings was analysed by studying the survival of L929 cells after 3 days of testing, and all Polyurethane foams (PU) showed survival rates greater than 80%, which was considered safe in this experiment. The antioxidant ability was examined by three methods, DPPH, ABTS and FRAP, and Anti-inflame #3 with a mangosteen to curcumin extract ratio of 1:2 had the highest antioxidant effect, indicating that the developed foam has good properties for use as an antimicrobial wound dressing. Therefore, Anti-inflame #3 would be the optimal material in terms of antibacterial activity and antioxidant potency.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, environmental, Materials Science","Environmental Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Additional water with a certain design of insertion and water velocity is introduced at the intersection to support the recovery of CAF by suppressing fouling. This numerical work covered both qualitative evaluation of CAF consistency along the T-pipe and quantitative evaluation to analyze the attainable energy savings of the proposed strategy. From some candidates for water insertion geometries and velocities of additional water, the ducting insertion with a water velocity of 2 m/s showed a consistent CAF structure starting at about 200 mm from the intersection point to the final downstream exits. This proposed design was estimated to reduce pressure drop more than 98% compared to transportation without lubrication and 4% higher than design without additional water injection. The power reduction factor was computed at a value greater than 1 (30.3), indicating that the proposed system was energetically more advantageous than the single-phase oil system.",engineering,Engineering (all)

The administration of LPS exhibited a decline in memory performance via Morris' Water Maze test along with an elevation of IL-6, IL-17, amino acid neurotransmitters, Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and 8-OHdG, whereas a decrease in ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), monoamine transmitters, AChE (acetylcholinesterase) and PC (phosphatidylcholine). Additionally, there was a notable increase in GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and p-Tau protein immuno-expression levels along with obvious histological lesions in the hippocampal CA3 region. Moreover, the administration of protease or Donepezil restored the measured parameters to nearly normal levels and improved the histological architecture of the hippocampus and ameliorated memory impairments.

We propose a multimodal machine learning model that takes into account basic clinical information and non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images to predict the risk of cardioembolic stroke. The clinical information is not only used to provide additional information for the classification model but also to guide the attention module to extract better image features. Our model achieves a score of 0.840 using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) metric.

Methods: Group opinions among a panel of respiratory experts were obtained using two online questionnaires and a virtual scientific workshop. A consensus was pre-defined as agreement by >75% of participants. Results: From 26 experts who agreed to participate, 22 completed both surveys. At the end of the process, the panel rated their own understanding of modeling as good (77%) but that among physicians in general as poor (77%). Participants agreed that data from modeling studies should be used, at least sometimes, to inform treatment guidelines (91%) and could be useful for guiding clinical decisions (100%). Perceived barriers to using modeling studies were ‘A lack of understanding’ (81%) and ‘A lack of standardized methodology’ (82%). Based on data from two modeling studies, no consensus was reached on physicians recommending regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) versus as-needed therapy for patients with mild asthma, whereas 77% agreed that they would recommend regular ICS over maintenance and reliever therapy for ≥80% of their patients with moderate asthma. No consensus was reached on the value of modeling data in relation to empirical data. Conclusion: There is overall support among respiratory experts for the usefulness of modeling data to guide asthma treatment guidelines and clinical decision making.

Residential greenness and kidney function: A cohort study of Thai employees,"Paoin K., Pharino C., Vathesatogkit P., Phosri A., Buya S., Saranburut K., Ueda K., Seposo X.T., Ingviya T., Kitiyakara C., Thongmung N., Sritara P.",2023-03-01,"Air Pollutants, Air Pollution, China, Cohort Studies, Humans, Kidney, Neighborhood Characteristics, Nitrogen Dioxide, Particulate Matter, Southeast Asian People, Thailand, eGFR, EVI, Greenness, Kidney function, NDVI","Higher residential greenness is associated with a lower risk of chronic kidney disease, but evidence on the association between greenness exposure and kidney function has not been conducted. Using cohort data from Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) employees, we investigated the association between long-term exposure to greenness and kidney function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), Thailand. We analyzed data from 2022 EGAT workers (aged 25–55 years at baseline) from 2009 to 2019. The level of greenness was calculated using the satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). From 2008 to 2019, the average concentration of each air pollutant (PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO) at the sub-district level in BMR was generated using the Kriging method. Long-term exposure for each participant was defined as the 1-year average concentrations before the date of the physical examination in 2009, 2014, and 2019. We employed linear mixed effects models to evaluate associations of NDVI and EVI with eGFR. The robustness of the results was also tested by including air pollutants in the models. After relevant confounders were controlled, the interquartile range increase in NDVI was associated with higher eGFR [1.03% (95%CI: 0.33, 1.74)]. After PM10 and SO2 were included in the models, the associations between NDVI and eGFR became weaker. The additions of O3, NO2, and CO strengthened the associations between them. In contrast, we did not find any association between EVI and eGFR. In conclusion, there was a positive association between NDVI and eGFR, but not for EVI. Air pollutants had a significant impact on the relationship between NDVI and eGFR. Additional research is needed to duplicate this result in various settings and populations to confirm our findings.",sociology,"Health (social science), Sociology and Political Science, Life-span and Life-course Studies"
Difficult colorectal polypectomy: Technical tips and recent advances,"Pattarajierapan S., Takamaru H., Khomvilai S.",2023-01-01,"Colonic Polyps, Colonoscopy, Colorectal Neoplasms, Endoscopic Mucosal Resection, Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal, Humans, Adenoma, Colonic polyps, Colonoscopy, Endoscopic mucosal resection, Endoscopic submucosal dissection, Polypectomy","Colonoscopy has been shown to be an effective modality to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) development. CRC reduction is achieved by detecting and removing adenomas, which are precursors of CRC. Most colorectal polyps are small and do not pose a significant challenge for trained and skilled endoscopists. However, up to 15% of polyps are considered “difficult”, potentially causing life-threatening complications. A difficult polyp is defined as any polyp that is challenging for the endoscopist to remove owing to its size, shape, or location. Advanced polypectomy techniques and skills are required to resect difficult colorectal polyps. There were various polypectomy techniques for difficult polyps such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), underwater EMR, Tip-in EMR, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), or endoscopic full-thickness resection. The selection of the appropriate modality depends on the morphology and endoscopic diagnosis. Several technologies have been developed to aid endoscopists in performing safe and effective polypectomies, especially complex procedures such as ESD. These advances include video endoscopy system, equipment assisting in advanced polypectomy, and closure devices/techniques for complication management. Endoscopists should know how to use these devices and their availability in practice to enhance polypectomy performance. This review describes several useful strategies and tips for managing difficult colorectal polyps. We also propose the stepwise approach for difficult colorectal polyps.",medical,Gastroenterology

However, there were some published clinical trials that did not follow the new implemented policy. This study examines the number of clinical trials that endorsed IPD sharing policy among top ophthalmology journals. Method All published original articles in 2021 in 10 highest-ranking ophthalmology journals according to the 2020 journal impact factor were included. Clinical trials were determined by the WHO definition of clinical trials. Each article was then thoroughly searched for the IPD sharing statement either in the manuscript or in the clinical trial registry. We collected the number of published clinical trials that implemented IPD sharing policy as our primary outcome. Results 1852 published articles in top 10 ophthalmology journals were identified, and 9.45% were clinical trials. Of these clinical trials, 44% had clinical trial registrations and 49.14% declared IPD sharing statements. Only 42 (48.83%) clinical trials were willing to share IPD, and 5 (10.21%) of these share IPD via an online repository platform. In terms of sharing period, 37 clinical trials were willing to share right after the publication and only 2 showed the ending of sharing period. Conclusion This report shows that the number of clinical trials in top ophthalmology journals that endorsed the IPD sharing policy and the number of registrations is lower than half even though the policy has been implemented for several years.

However, the safety of such medications in the development of metastasis is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine, desipramine, and mirtazapine on the liver metastasis of murine C26 colon carcinoma (cc). Balb/c male mice were administered these antidepressants intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days following intrasplenic injections of C26 colon carcinoma cells. Desipramine and fluoxetine, but not mirtazapine, significantly increased the number of tumor foci and total volume of the tumor in liver tissue. This effect was associated with a decrease in the ability of splenocytes to produce interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ and an increase in their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-10. Similar changes were observed in plasma IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 levels. The current study demonstrates that the stimulatory effect of desipramine and fluoxetine, but not mirtazapine, on experimental colon cancer liver metastasis is associated with a suppression of immune defenses against the tumor.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Rapid photocatalytic gold recovery from industrial cyanide-based gold plating wastewater via TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites: Role of mixed hole scavengers and operating conditions,"Hunsom M., Kunthakudee N., Ramakul P., Serivalsatit K., Sangkhanak S., Wongyongnoi P., Pruksathorn K.",2023-10-01,"Cyanide-based gold plating, Gold recoveries, Hole scavenger, Operating condition, Photo-catalytic, Photocatalyst loading, Photocatalytic gold recovery, Plating wastewaters, Stable form, TiO2/WO3 nanocomposite, Cyanide-based gold plating, Photocatalytic gold recovery, TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites, Wastewater","A rapid photocatalytic gold recovery from the industrial cyanide-based gold plating wastewater was carried out via TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites synthesized by hydrothermal method. Effects of different weight ratios of TiO2 and WO3 in nanocomposites, types of hole scavenger (Na2S2O3, C2H5OH, Na2S2O3/C2H5OH), concentrations of Na2S2O3 (0–100 mM) and photocatalyst loading (1–4 g/L) were examined. The preliminary results demonstrated that the employed wet chemical process induced a well formation of TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites with better textural properties as well as a more negative band position than the pristine WO3. The presence of mixed hole scavengers of Na2S2O3 and C2H5OH played a crucial role on the photocatalytic gold recovery from the cyanide-based gold plating wastewater. A more stable form of gold cyanide ([Au(CN)2]-) was altered to a less stable form ([Au(S2O3)2]3-) by the addition of Na2S2O3. At the end, approximately 85.9 % and 98.2 % of gold were respectively recovered within 180 and 300 min via the T6/WO3 nanocomposite in the presence of 10 mM Na2S2O3 and 20 vol% C2H5OH at photocatalyst loading of 2 g/L and light intensity of 3.20 mW/cm2. The photocatalytic gold recovery was significantly improved via the 1st reused T6/WO3 nanocomposite, in which 99.9 % of gold was recovered within 180 min. The obtained results can pave the way for the design of novel TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites for gold recovery as well as the strategy of waste management for the practical operation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this paper, we apply the upwind finite volume method for solving the ion flow field of three HVDC configurations to clarify the effect of the wind and the role of shielding conductors. For the monopolar configuration installation, the ground current distribution with underbuilt shield wires was studied numerically and experimentally. For the ±250 kV bipolar configuration, the calculated peak electric field and current density are verified with the values in a reference. The ±500 kV bipolar configuration is used to investigate the change in electric field and ion current within the same corridors of the existing HVAC lines. We analyze the ion flow field with and without the dedicated metallic return conductor (DMRC). In the absence of wind, the maximum of the electric field is lower than that of the HVAC lines and the current density is very low on the ground. In the presence of wind, the electric field and the current distribution become unsymmetrical on the ground level. The peak current density increases significantly on the downwind side. The HVDC line without DMRC has the electric field peak higher than that of the HVAC lines. With the higher wind shear coefficient, the peak of the electric field and the current density increases on the downwind side. Overall investigations summarize that DMRC can effectively reduce the peak of the electric field to be lower than that of the existing 500 kV HVAC lines under all wind conditions.","energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This research aimed to investigate the effect of different ZnO sources as an activator: commercial ZnO (ZO), waste ZnO obtained from a ceramic industry (WZO), and calcinated WZO (C-WZO) on the properties of NR vulcanizates. The ZnO particles were characterized using X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, X-ray diffractometer, and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the calcination at 800 °C for 6 h could reduce the sulfur components in WZO; consequently, the particle size and appearance were changed. For rubber vulcanizates, the composition of ZnO in the activator had an effect on the crosslink density of the obtained vulcanizates, resulting in changes to the mechanical tensile, thermal, and dynamic mechanical properties. The crosslink density, tensile strength, and tear strength of the rubber vulcanizate filled with C-WZO (NR/C-WZO (II), 0.18 mmol/cm3, 21.3 MPa, 68.4 N/mm, respectively) was acceptable for rubber products com-pared with those of the vulcanizate filled with ZO (NR/ZO, 0.19 mmol/cm3, 26.4 MPa, 71.6 N/mm, respectively).

A biopsy of the skin lesion gives the definitive diagnosis of skin cancer. However, before the definitive diagnosis, specialists observe some symptoms that justify the request for a biopsy and consider a early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of skin cancer is subject to errors due to the lack of experience of specialists and similar characteristics with other diseases. This work proposes a CNN architecture, called EfficientAttentionNet, to provide early diagnosis of melanoma and non-melanoma skin lesions. The methodology represents the stages of development of the proposed classification model and the benefits of each stage. In the first step, the set of images from the International Society for Digital Skin Imaging (ISDIS) is pre-processed to eliminate the hair around the skin lesion. Then, a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model generates synthetic images to balance the number of samples per class in the training set. In addition, a U-net model creates masks for regions of interest in the images. Finally, EfficientAttentionNet training with the mask-based attention mechanism to classify skin lesions.

Various phase-change systems including Piperazine (PZ), 1-(2-aminoethyl) piperazine (AEP), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), sulfolane, 1-propanol and water with different concentration ratios were investigated comprehensively in terms of initial absorption rate, equilibrium solubility, phase splitting and desorption rate in the present work. Experimental results indicated that with the aid of organic solvents, PZ and AEP were proved to be promising candidates to accelerate the initial absorption and desorption rates, as well as enhance the CO2 absorption capacity due to their excellent reaction kinetics. The tunable phase separation property could be achieved by varying the concentration ratios of amine/organic solvent. After achieving equilibrium, the two liquid–liquid phases would not return back to one homogeneous liquid phase. Among these biphasic solvents, aqueous 2.5 M PZ + 2.5 M sulfolane with a large CO2 loading 0.85 mol CO2/mol amine at the phase change point was the optimal choice owing to good phase separation and great absorption and desorption properties. Compared to aqueous 2.5 M PZ single solvent, it demonstrated a 16% higher initial absorption rate, 9% larger CO2 absorption capacity and double desorption rate. This research provided a potential alternative absorbent for CO2 capture.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

However, there is a lack of understanding of farmers’ safety behavior in pesticide use and the psychological factors that influence it, especially in Nigeria. Objective: This study aimed to identify safety behaviors in pesticide use and their determinants among cocoa farmers in Nigeria using the Health Belief Model (HBM). Methods: We used a suitable questionnaire to retrieve data from 391 cocoa farmers across three major cocoa-producing belts in Nigeria. The data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Findings showed that cocoa farmers in this study sprayed insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides on their cocoa farms. The study revealed that most pesticides were not approved for cocoa production by the authority, but the farmers were still using them. The study participants overused surveyed pesticides as the quantities applied were beyond the recommended dosage by the manufacturers. Correlation analysis showed a relationship between education status, pesticide training, perceived susceptibility and cue to action, and the farmers’ pesticide overuse. In all, 42.7% of the farmers showed unsafe behaviors, 49.1% showed intermediate behaviors, and just 8.2% reported safe behaviors in pesticide use. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that perceived barriers, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and cue to action were related to age, education status, and farm experience and accounted for 59.3% of the total variance in the farmers’ pesticide safety behaviors. Perceived barriers had the most significant negative influence on the farmers’ behaviors, while perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and cue to action positively influenced the farmers’ behavior. Conclusion: Future intervention programs in Nigeria incorporating significant variables, especially perceived barriers, in their designs with proper implementation could be more effective.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

While problem-based learning (PBL) is a widely applied pedagogy in nursing education, an emerging technology-based pedagogy, virtual simulation provides a realistic clinical learning experience for students. It can be an effective solution for continuing clinical and cultural learning across countries in the era of the pandemic. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of virtual simulation and PBL on the perceived clinical and cultural competence for nursing students. Design: A randomized controlled cross-over study design was used. Settings and participants: Sixty-one undergraduate and postgraduate nursing students from five Asian regions were selected for participation. Methods: Participants were randomized to receive either virtual simulation (group A) or PBL (group B) for one day, followed by another intervention on the second day. Three self-reported questionnaires were used: Clinical Competence Questionnaire (CCQ), Inventory for Assessing the Process of Cultural Competence among Healthcare Professionals-Student Version (IAPCC-SV), and demographic questionnaire. Results: The results revealed that students in both arms had significant improvements in CCQ total score (A: d = 21.500, P < 0.001; B: d = 16.710, P = 0.001), nursing professional behavior (A: d = 8.233, P < 0.001; B: d = 6.323, P < 0.001), and advanced nursing skills (A: d = 2.533, P = 0.008; B: d = 2.129, P = 0.029) after two interventions. In addition, both arms demonstrated significant improvements in IAPCC-SV total score (A: d = 3.467, P = 0.037; B: d = 4.032, P = 0.010) and cultural skills (A: d = 0.767, P = 0.012; B: d = 1.000, P = 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two arms. Conclusions: The findings indicated that both virtual simulation and PBL were effective in promoting students' perceived clinical and cultural competence. As both education modes have their own uniqueness and effectiveness in both outcomes, the combination of both could enhance the variability of learning modalities. Notably, the use of virtual simulation first could engage students better in learning and achieve better educational outcomes.","Nursing, sociology","Nursing (all), Education"

Advanced Stiffness Sensing through the Pincer Grasping of Soft Pneumatic Grippers,"Sithiwichankit C., Chanchareon R.",2023-07-01,"Grasped object, Haptic sensing, Human hands, Object classification, Object property, Pincer grasping, Pneumatic grippers, Sensible grasping, Soft gripper, Stiffness sensing, Equipment Design, Hand, Hand Strength, Humans, Pressure, Robotics, object classification, pincer grasping, pneumatic gripper, sensible grasping, soft gripper, stiffness sensing","In this study, a comprehensive approach for sensing object stiffness through the pincer grasping of soft pneumatic grippers (SPGs) is presented. This study was inspired by the haptic sensing of human hands that allows us to perceive object properties through grasping. Many researchers have tried to imitate this capability in robotic grippers. The association between gripper performance and object reaction must be determined for this purpose. However, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA), the main components of SPGs, are extremely compliant. SPA compliance makes the determination of the association challenging. Methodologically, the connection between the behaviors of grasped objects and those of SPAs was clarified. A new concept of SPA modeling was then introduced. A method for stiffness sensing through SPG pincer grasping was developed based on this connection, and demonstrated on four samples. This method was validated through compression testing on the same samples. The results indicate that the proposed method yielded similar stiffness trends with slight deviations in compression testing. A main limitation in this study was the occlusion effect, which leads to dramatic deviations when grasped objects greatly deform. This is the first study to enable stiffness sensing and SPG grasping to be carried out in the same attempt. This study makes a major contribution to research on soft robotics by progressing the role of sensing for SPG grasping and object classification by offering an efficient method for acquiring another effective class of classification input. Ultimately, the proposed framework shows promise for future applications in inspecting and classifying visually indistinguishable objects.","fluid mechanics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This study aimed to extract lignin from real pulp and paper wastewater and then utilized it as an adsorbent for water contaminated-Pb removal. Two types of extracted lignin were compared including 1) lignin precipitated by hydrochloric acid (LP) and 2) lignin separated by the coagulation-flocculation process using iron(III) trimesate, a type of the iron-based metal–organic framework, (LPF). They were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), nitrogen adsorption–desorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). LPF showed amorphous characteristics, surface area, and porous increased, and iron oxide appeared compared to LP. Batch experiment results revealed that LPF decreased Pb contamination in water by approximately 65 % in 60 min. Adsorption kinetics had a better fit to the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption process occurred spontaneously and was endothermic, following the physisorption mechanism. The adsorption isotherm model fitted the Freundlich isotherm well, while parameter (n) as 2.015 implied favorable adsorption. The outcomes of the research might open the door to the creation of lignin-based adsorbents for the elimination of Pb in wastewater.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Molecular immune monitoring in kidney transplant rejection: a state-of-the-art review,"Chancharoenthana W., Traitanon O., Leelahavanichkul A., Tasanarong A.",2023-01-01,"Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents, Inflammation, Kidney, Kidney Transplantation, Monitoring, Immunologic, Postoperative Complications, Transplantation, Homologous, chemokine, donor-derived cell-free DNA, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, MicroRNAs, molecular immune monitoring, nucleosome, transcriptomics","Although current regimens of immunosuppressive drugs are effective in renal transplant recipients, long-term renal allograft outcomes remain suboptimal. For many years, the diagnosis of renal allograft rejection and of several causes of renal allograft dysfunction, such as chronic subclinical inflammation and infection, was mostly based on renal allograft biopsy, which is not only invasive but also possibly performed too late for proper management. In addition, certain allograft dysfunctions are difficult to differentiate from renal histology due to their similar pathogenesis and immune responses. As such, non-invasive assays and biomarkers may be more beneficial than conventional renal biopsy for enhancing graft survival and optimizing immunosuppressive drug regimens during long-term care. This paper discusses recent biomarker candidates, including donor-derived cell-free DNA, transcriptomics, microRNAs, exosomes (or other extracellular vesicles), urine chemokines, and nucleosomes, that show high potential for clinical use in determining the prognosis of long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation, along with their limitations.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

The vWF type D (VWD) domain in hemocytin is thought to be a major mediator of hemocyte aggregation and the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation system. Here, we report for the first time the role of hemocytin from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvHCT) against Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), the pathogenic microsporidian causing hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis in Pacific white shrimp (L. vannamei). The LvHCT gene contains 58,366 base pairs consisting of 84 exons encoding for 4267 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvHCT was clustered with crustacean hemocytins. Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that LvHCT in hemocytes was significantly upregulated at 9 and 11 days post-EHP cohabitation, which was consistent with EHP copy numbers in the infected shrimp. To further investigate the biological function of LvHCT in EHP infection, a recombinant protein containing an LvHCT-specific VWD domain (rLvVWD) was expressed in Escherichia coli. In vitro agglutination assays showed that rLvVWD was functionally representative of LvHCT and induced aggregation of pathogens, including Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, fungi, and EHP spore. LvHCT suppression resulted in higher EHP copy numbers and proliferation due to the lack of hemocytin-mediated EHP spore aggregation in LvHCT-silenced shrimp. Moreover, immune-related genes in the proPO-activating cascade and Toll, IMD and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were upregulated to eliminate the over-controlled EHP in LvHCT-silenced shrimp. Furthermore, the impaired phenoloxidase activity due to LvLGBP suppression was recovered after rLvVWD injection, suggesting that LvHCT may be directly involved in phenoloxidase activation. In conclusion, a novel LvHCT is involved in shrimp immunity against EHP via EHP spore aggregation and possible activation of the proPO-activating cascade.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The morphology and structures of as-prepared Ce–ZnO & PANI nanoparticles were analyzed by numerous kinds of techniques. Ce–ZnO & PANI nanoparticles were mixed with n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) which is coated over the gold coated PET electrode by doctor blade method and dried overnight at 60 °C to form p-n junction. The as-formed p-n junction is to be driven with the help of 1.5 V potential at ambient temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results of Ce–ZnO nanoparticles confirmed the existence of Ce4+ and the improved amount of both chemisorbed oxygen and oxygen vacancy after the formation of Ce–ZnO heterojunction. The maximum response of 80% was realized for hollow Ce–ZnO/PANI sensor at 100 ppm.

This study is the first of its kind for this rare, endangered species, and it begins to fill critical information gaps about its ecology and life history. Study animals were tagged subcutaneously in the dorsal area with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 12 months using a fixed array of eight receivers. Receivers were positioned within an 18 rkm section of the Maeklong, starting approximately 4 rkm upstream from the mouth. We calculated individual residency indices, tracked longitudinal movements, and assessed annual and seasonal patterns of site use. We also investigated spatial use patterns, diel activity patterns, and relationships of temperature and site fidelity. We detected 86% of our tagged whiprays, 53% of which were detected for the majority of the study period. Whiprays exhibited high site fidelity across seasons. Individuals made long longitudinal movements within the site for much of the study period but seemed to remain closer to the estuary during the second half of the rainy season and early winter. All receivers had large numbers of detections, but upstream receivers were visited for longer time durations than downstream receivers. A receiver in the middle of the study area had the highest detection rate, but low detection durations, suggesting that this receiver is in a migration corridor. A mix of immature and mature males and females was present in the site throughout the study period, suggesting that this area is not exclusively a breeding or nursery site. However, the high site fidelity suggests that this is an important aggregation site for the species. Effective conservation measures may include conservation zones and a shrimp reintroduction program upstream, ensuring fish passage through the middle of the site, and regulating traffic and pollution downstream. We found acoustic telemetry to be an effective study method and encourage its use to improve understanding of the giant freshwater whipray.","water engineeringneering, biochemistryistry, sociology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Biochemistry, Geography, Planning and Development, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

The MCC-graft-polyacrylate (MCC-g-PA) was then prepared using N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) at 0.05 wt% of acrylic acid via radical polymerization, and was then used as an additive in PA superabsorbent polymers (SAP). The presence of 0.05 g MCC-g-PA in PA (0.1 g) was found to exhibit a 1.17-fold greater water absorbency than the neat PA SAP, which was due to the increased level of hydroxyl and carboxylate groups from the added MCC-g-PA. The MCC-g-PA/PA SAP exhibited a similar reusability to the commercial SAP and could be degraded via cellulase and laccase enzymes.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

Determining accurate coordinates of parcel boundary markers at building corners or near fences and walls is difficult because a GNSS range pole cannot be leveled with a circular bubble. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the receivers equipped with tilt sensors for horizontal and vertical positioning. Two types of tilt sensors used for evaluation were a magnetometer and micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Conducting the NRTK GNSS surveying tests was based on the pole tilt angles of 0°, 15°, 25°, 35°, and 45° from a plumb line in controlled and obstructed environments. The IMU-based tilt sensor had more advantage of accurately positioning over the MEMS sensor. The results showed that using the IMU, better than 4 cm horizontal positioning accuracy was achievable when the pole was tilted by 15° or less under non-multipath and open-sky conditions. The vertical accuracy was of a few centimeter levels and least sensitive to tilt angles using either type of sensor. However, none of the sensors precisely compensated for pole tilt in strong-multipath and complex environments, causing increased horizontal errors in decimeter levels.","fluidex; related topics, remote sensing; numerical and image analysis, Mathematics, engineering, earth sciences","Modeling and Simulation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)"

Thus, a facile synthesis of SiO2-carbon core–shell (SiO2@C) nanoparticles with tunable sizes and shapes for efficient controlled release was developed to prolong the antibacterial activity of thymol (T). The physicochemical properties, and surface bonding between thymol and the carbon shell were determined with XPS, NEXAFS, and DFT studies. An in vitro thymol release study was also applied, and the prolonged antibacterial performance was evaluated with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The optimal conditions for producing spherical SiO2@C core–shell nanostructures with a uniform size distribution included an ethanol-to-water ratio of 20:80 (E20W80). This produced a SiO2@C core–shell material with a high porous carbon content and a large pore volume. Moreover, SiO2@C-T exhibited the highest thymol release profile. DFT studies demonstrated that the thymol was physically adsorbed on the carbon surface. This adsorption mode was advantageous for prolonged release. Consequently, the bacteriostatic agent SiO2@C-T E20W80 showed sustained thymol release levels of up to 40% over 48 h. The developed SiO2@C material shows potential for use as a nanocarrier of drug/active ingredients.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

The conditions (ambient temperature occurred in an exothermic reaction, drying time, yield, and solubility) of the reaction between the bio-green CaCO3 and three different acetic (CH3COOH) concentrations (8, 10, and 12 M) were investigated. The product's maximum yield (93%) with a shorter drying time (18 h) was obtained from the reaction between the bio-green CaCO3 with 12 M acetic acid revealing a lower cost. The chemical compositions without any toxic metal impurity revealed by the X-ray fluorescence technique would be useful to suggest use in the specific application. The X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared, and Thermogravimetric analysis data of Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O prepared by the bio-green CaCO3 obtained from oyster shell wastes in this work and those in previous works used other calcium sources were consistent. The morphologies with different sizes of the obtained Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O depend on the CH3COOH concentrations reported in this work and were different from those reported in previous works because of different calcium sources. According to the observation, it can be concluded that the low-cost and bio-green technique without the environmental effects was successfully applied to produce cheap Ca(CH3COO)2·H2O and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used in the specific industry.","mixing and separation, environmental, energy","Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The present study aimed to characterize EO compositions of 12 Curcuma species, as well as to detect the compositional variation among different species, and between the plant specimens and their related genetically validated crude drug samples using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The plant specimens of the same species showed similar EO patterns, regardless of introducing from different geographical sources.

Effects of the exfoliation solvent, preparation method, and Ru loading level on the physicochemical and catalytic properties of the resulting catalysts were investigated. The exfoliated LDO-supported Ru catalysts exhibited enhanced textural properties, RuOx dispersion, and basicity, resulting in better catalytic activity (at least 6 times higher FDCA yield) than conventional LDO-supported Ru catalysts in the conversion into FDCA. The Ru-based catalyst supported on an exfoliated LDO/carbon nanocomposite, Ru(3)/ESV-LDC, revealed the nearly complete HMF conversion (99.2%) at an FDCA selectivity of >98%. This was attributed to the synergistic effect derived from good RuOx dispersion, providing a high proportion of lattice oxygen for boosting surface oxygen mobility, and high basicity, in terms of both strength and number of basic sites. Moreover, Ru(3)/ESV-LDC exhibited good reusability without a significant loss of HMF conversion and FDCA yield, suggesting strong chemical robustness of RuOx species and a stable interaction between the active metal and support.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The material properties are assumed to vary along in-plane directions and are effectively homogenized via the rule of mixture. Within the Galerkin weak form, tensor-based governing equations of motion expressed in natural curvilinear coordinates are first formulated and accordingly solved by a non-uniform rational basis spline-based isogeometric analysis (IGA) approach. As its general characteristics, the numerical formulation can not only accurately simulate the size-dependent behaviors of thin to moderately thick IFG microshells with arbitrary shapes and material gradation patterns but also effectively provide the predictions of different reduced SGT-based theories, i.e., the modified strain gradient, modified couple stress, and simplified strain gradient theories. These features are confirmed using selected examples related to static, free vibration, and transient dynamic problems.

The leading indication for biopsy differed across practice types, with suspected kidney involvement in SLE being the primary indication in UVH, while NS took precedence in both PBH and PVH practices. Notably, UVH performed fewer kidney biopsies for asymptomatic urinary abnormalities and diabetes-related indications compared with PVH and PBH. The leading glomerular diagnoses correlated with the biopsy indications, with lupus nephritis (LN) being the most common diagnosis in UVH and PBH practices, whiles immunoglobulin A nephropathy was the predominant diagnosis in PVH practice. Conclusion: Hospital practice types significantly impact the prevalence of glomerular pathologic diagnosis patterns in kidney biopsy data, highlighting the importance of considering this influence in epidemiological comparisons.",medical,Nephrology

In the present work, an attempt has been made to assess the method to minimise environmental problems associated with granite dust pollution to the possible extent by converting the granite dust waste into value added high voltage electrical insulator products. Two types of epoxy matrices comprising bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether-phenalkamine (ER-1) and bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether-methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (ER-2) separately reinforced with varying weight percentages of (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 wt%) of granite dust. The matrices and composites obtained were characterized for their structural, morphology, hydrophobic properties, thermal stability, mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, thermal resistivity, electrical resistivity, breakdown voltage and dielectric strength behaviour using appropriate analytical testing methods. Data resulted from different studies, it was inferred that the composites prepared using ER-2 possess better properties than those of ER-1. The composites with 100 wt% of cutting waste granite fly dust reinforced ER-2 possesses the higher values of electrical surface resistivity (5.22 × 1012 Ω), and electrical volume resistivity (5.60 × 1013 Ω) than those of neat ER-2 matrix (surface resistivity 4.82 × 109 Ω and volume resistivity 2.48 × 1013 Ω). The breakdown voltage and dielectric strength of ER-2 matrix were increased from 28 ±1 kV and 14 ± 0.5 kV/mm to 34 ±1 kV and 17 ± 0.5 kV/mm respectively, when reinforced with 100 wt % granite dust. The value of breakdown voltage was increased by 22% for 100 wt% granite dust reinforced composites when compared to that of neat epoxy matrix.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

Here, we report the potential application of enzymatically produced CA from low-cost tapioca starch as a nanocarrier for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 siRNA in cervical cancer treatment. The cationic charged CA (CAQ) was produced by the introduction of (3-Chloro-2 hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (Q188) to the particle, resulting in successful complexation of CAQ and siRNA. This was then transfected into the cervical cancer cell line (CaSki). The CAQ-siRNA complex demonstrated no cytotoxicity in normal cells and exhibited the same level of transfection efficiency compared to a commercial liposome-based particle. In contrast, the commercial liposome-based particles showed a 40 % decrease in the viability of normal cells. These results suggest that low-cost, high biocompatibility and easy-to-use CAQ is a feasible alternative for an siRNA carrier. This new system had no impact on cell viability and has the potential to be used in medical applications.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, environmental, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Biomedical Engineering"

The effects of the reduction methods on their properties were investigated. The chitosan-reduced composite exhibited dispersed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) within the nanocellulose matrix with the smallest size, while the ascorbic-reduced composite displayed the largest size. The incorporation of AgNPs tended to reduce the crystallinity of the composites, except for the ascorbic-reduced composite, which exhibited an increase in crystallinity. Mechanical testing revealed that the ascorbic-reduced composite had the highest Young’s modulus of 8960 MPa, whereas the UV-reduced composite had the highest tensile strength and elongation at break. Thermal analysis of BC-Ag composites indicated similar glass transition temperature and decomposition profiles to BC, with additional weight-loss steps at high temperatures. The sodium hydroxide-reduced composite demonstrated the highest electrical conductivity of 1.1 × 10−7 S/cm. Water absorption capacity was reduced by the incorporation of AgNPs, except for the chitosan-reduced composite, which showed an enhanced water absorption capacity of 344%. All BC-Ag composites displayed very strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

"In Schizophrenia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome-and Fibromyalgia-Like Symptoms are Driven by Breakdown of the Paracellular Pathway with Increased Zonulin and Immune Activation-Associated Neurotoxicity","Maes M., Andres-Rodriguez L., Vojdani A., Sirivichayakul S., Barbosa D.S., Kanchanatawan B.",2023-02-01,"Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic, Humans, Quality of Life, Schizophrenia, bacterial translocation, Chronic fatigue syndrome, inflammation, myalgic encephalomyelitis, neuro-immune, oxidative stress","Background: A meaningful part of schizophrenia patients suffer from physiosomatic symptoms (formerly named psychosomatic), which are reminiscent of chronic fatigue syndrome and fi-bromyalgia (FF) and are associated with signs of immune activation and increased levels of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). Aims: The study aims to examine whether FF symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with the breakdown of the paracellular pathway, zonulin, lowered natural IgM responses to oxidative specific epitopes (OSEs); and whether FF symptoms belong to the behavioral-cognitive-physical-psychosocial-(BCPS)-worsening index consisting of indices of a general cognitive decline (G-CoDe), symptomato-me of schizophrenia, and quality of life (QoL)-phenomenome. Methods: FF symptoms were assessed using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Rating scale in 80 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls and serum cytokines/chemokines, IgA levels to TRY-CATs, IgM to OSEs, zonulin and transcellular/paracellular (TRANS/PARA) molecules were assayed using ELISA methods. Results: A large part (42.3%) of the variance in the total FF score was explained by the regression on the PARA/TRANS ratio, pro-inflammatory cytokines, IgM to zonulin, IgA to TRYCATs (all positive-ly), and IgM to OSEs (inversely). There were highly significant correlations between the total FF score and G-CoDe, symtopmatome, QoL phenomenome, and BCPS-worsening score. FF symptoms belong to a common core shared by G-CoDe, symtopmatome, and QoL phenomenome. Conclusion: The physio-somatic symptoms of schizophrenia are driven by various pathways, including increased zonulin, breakdown of the paracellular tight-junctions pathway, immune activation with induction of the TRYCAT pathway, and consequent neurotoxicity. It is concluded that FF symptoms are part of the phenome of schizophrenia and BCPS-worsening as well.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"

The Emergy to Money Ratio (EMR) is the performance parameter to be optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to obtain the optimal use of available resources. A framework, so-called EMR-PSO, has been proposed to determine the minimum EMR, reflecting the low emergy investment with high system net profit. The system boundary consisted of four selected biomass and six alternative conversion processes. The framework was implemented in three scenarios covering feedstocks and product constraints. The optimization result indicated that, in the supply aspect, liquid fuel production from eucalyptus is the optimum solution in the case of normal operation. While eucalyptus availability was limited, Napier grass and PEFB were suggested as alternative substitutes. The minimum EMR from the production system in case of normal operation and high product demand with limited biomass availability were 2.04E+09 sej/$ and 6.77E+09 sej/$, v. Furthermore, the performance of the EMR-PSO was compared with other optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm (EMR-GA) and gradient-based method (EMR-GBM). The EMR-PSO was found to be superior to the others.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The implementation of an edit distance and dictionary mapping to identify and correct misspelled words is a widely used method for addressing this challenge in the Thai language. However, this technique excludes contextualization from the input and can yield incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages pre-trained language models, such as WangchanBERTa, for correcting Thai misspellings. Our proposed method consists of a model for misspelling detection based on the token prediction task and a correction model based on masked prediction. Additionally, character edit distance (CED) can be used as a post-processing step to help improve the correction results. Our experiments were conducted on two standard datasets for Thai misspellings, namely UGWC and VISTEC-TPTH-2021. On the UGWC data, our model can help correct 3,867 out of the 6,399 misspelled words (60.43%), which is higher than the baseline's rate of 41.75%.11https://github.com/bookpanda/Two-stage-Thai-Misspelling-Correction-Based-on-Pre-trained-Language-Models","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

The optimized pretreatment conditions of 2% sulfuric acid with sonication (AS) and 2% Viscozyme L with sonication (ES) of garden wastes yielded a maximum of 33 and 37% total reducing sugar, respectively. In addition, the supplementation of 30 mg/L of magnetic NPs to dark fermentative system of AS and ES yielded 32 and 30% increased hydrogen production compared with the control without NPs, respectively. A maximum yield of 2.43 mol H2/mol sugar utilized was achieved in the optimized system supplemented with NPs. The reusability of the magnetic NPs offers an additional advantage showing more than 90% relative hydrogen production retained after four consecutive cycles. The proposed mechanisms suggest that the optimum level of magnetic NPs supplementation increases the electron transfer rate and modifies the E. aerogenes metabolic pathway, limiting ethanol production and increasing acetate proportion in the end metabolite analysis. Overall, the addition of magnetic NPs to the dark fermentative system improved the biological hydrogen production.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Organic Chemistry"

Materials and Methods: Genetic variant was identified with exome sequencing. The hDPs isolated from a patient with Cowden syndrome were investigated for their proliferation, osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and gene expression compared with controls. The normal hDPs and hADSCs were treated with the PTEN inhibitor, VO-OHpic trihydrate (VOT), to investigate the effect of PTEN inhibition. Results: A heterozygous nonsense PTEN variant, c.289C>T (p.Gln97*), was identified in the Cowden patient's blood and intraoral lipomas. The mutated hDPs showed significantly decreased proliferation, but significantly upregulated RUNX2 and OSX expression and mineralization, indicating enhanced osteogenic ability in mutated cells. The normal hDPs treated with VOT showed the decreases in proliferation, colony formation, osteogenic marker genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineral deposition, suggesting that PTEN inhibition diminishes proliferation and osteogenic potential of hDPs. Regarding adipogenesis, the VOT-treated hADSCs showed a reduced number of cells containing lipid droplets, suggesting that PTEN inhibition might compromise adipogenic ability of hADSCs. Conclusions: PTEN regulates proliferation, enhances osteogenesis of hDPs, and induces adipogenesis of hADSCs. The gain-of-function PTEN variant, p.Gln97*, enhances osteogenic ability of PTEN in hDPs.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

Despite circRNAs being traditionally considered by-products rather than independently functional, circRNAs play many vital roles, such as in host immunity during viral infection. However, in shrimp, these remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to identify circRNAs in Litopenaeus vannamei in the context of WSSV infection, one of the most eradicative pathogens threatening shrimp populations worldwide. We identified 290 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) in L. vannamei upon WSSV infection. Eight DECs were expressed from their parental genes, including alpha-1-inhibitor-3, calpain-B, integrin-V, hemicentin-2, hemocytin, mucin-17, proPO2, and rab11-FIP4. These were examined quantitatively by qRT-PCR, which revealed the relevant expression profiles to those obtained from circRNA-Seq. Furthermore, the structural and chemical validation of the DECs conformed to the characteristics of circRNAs. One of the functional properties of circRNAs as a miRNA sponge was examined via the interaction network between DECs and WSSV-responsive miRNAs, which highlighted the targets of miRNA sponges. Our discovery could provide insight into the participation of these ncRNAs in shrimp antiviral responses.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The density at an integration point is determined proportionally to its compliance. Then, the NURBS description of the density is constructed elementwise by deriving a relation between densities assigned to integration points and control points. The global NURBS description of the density for the whole domain is a blend of those from elements.

The simulated test results reveal that such impacts of reverse power flows from the PV prosumers can be manageable in all cases. Moreover, they contribute to reduction of power loss in respective cases. The study also compares the case of distributed PV installations (prosumers) versus the single-sited lumped PV installation (a producer).

Seventy-nine patients with prediabetes participated. Nonparametric rest–activity rhythm parameters, sleep duration and efficiency were obtained from 7-d actigraphy recordings. Sleep-disordered breathing severity was assessed using a home sleep apnea test. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was obtained to evaluate glycemic control. The results revealed that shorter sleep duration, lower relative amplitude and higher L5 (average activity of the least active 5-h period) were associated with higher HbA1c, while other sleep variables were not related to HbA1c. Multiple stepwise regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and sleep duration revealed that lower relative amplitude, but not L5, was independently associated with higher HbA1c (B = −0.027, p = 0.031). In summary, among patients with prediabetes, an abnormal circadian rhythm was associated with higher HbA1c, implying a greater risk of developing diabetes.

A preventive strategy is proposed based on an endotracheal tube (ETT) modified by the in situ deposition of eucalyptus-mediated synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The surfaces of the modified ETT were embedded with AgNPs of approximately 28 nm and presented a nanoscale roughness. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of silver on and inside the coated ETT, which exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Inhibition of planktonic growth and microbial adhesion ranged from 99 to 99.999% without cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. Kinetic studies showed that microbial adhesion to the coated surface was inhibited within 2 h. Cell viability in biofilms supplemented with human tracheal mucus was reduced by up to 95%. In a porcine VAP model, the AgNPs-coated ETT prevented adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and completely inhibited bacterial invasion of lung tissue. The potential antimicrobial efficacy and safety of the coated ETT were established in a randomized control trial involving 47 veterinary patients. The microbial burden was significantly lower on the surface of the AgNPs-coated ETT than on the uncoated ETT (p < 0.05). Key points: • Endotracheal tube surfaces were modified by coating with green-synthesized AgNPs • P. aeruginosa burden of endotracheal tube and lung was reduced in a porcine model • Effective antimicrobial activity and safety was demonstrated in a clinical trial.","fluidex; related topics, genergyal microbial ecology, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was utilized to determine cell survival, and phase contrast microscopy was used to examine cell morphology. Through using real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and RT-PCR, the molecular mechanisms were investigated. According to the findings, whilst hepataphylline caused cytotoxicity in normal colon FHC cells, in comparison to healthy colon FHC cells, 7-methoxyheptaphylline inhibited cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Heptaphylline alone or in conjunction with TRAIL showed no discernible effect on TRAIL-induced HT29 cell death, but 7-methoxyheptaphylline boosted caspase-3 cleavage. The study showed that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was responsible for the 7-methoxyheptaphylline’s enhancement of the death receptor 5 (DR5) mRNA, TRAIL receptor, and protein.

Total cost of care in Thailand was 500,731.09 Thai baht (THB) (14,584.12 EUR) with an LPD and 421,019.22 THB (12,262.46 EUR) with an sVLPD (difference –79,711.86 THB; –2,321.66 EUR). Conclusion: A ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian sVLPD increased QALYs and lowered lifetime care costs versus an LPD in patients with predialysis CKD in Taiwan and Thailand. These data, together with the new KDOQI Guidelines for nutrition in CKD, support dietary intervention using ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian sVLPDs to prevent CKD progression and postpone dialysis as a cost-effective approach, with beneficial effects for patients and health care providers.","medical, Nursing","Medicine (miscellaneous), Nutrition and Dietetics, Nephrology"

Using ambient vibration and forced excitation, the dynamic characteristics (i.e., modal frequency, modal damping, and strain patterns) were extracted to evaluate existing performances. Then, the numerical modal analysis was conducted with the dynamic properties at the initial service stage since the joint degradation was not accounted. In general, modal frequency obtained from field measurement was approximately 19.8%–20.8% smaller than that obtained from the numerical analysis, indicating the degraded stiffness due to existing cracks at joint connections. In addition, the measured strain patterns and neutral axis location were eventually compared with the analytical results, proving the potential indicators for identifying local imperfections of the targeted high-rise buildings.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"

The Shan-5 vaccine is administered to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, after initial vaccination with monovalent hepatitis B (HepB) and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines at birth. This study compared the immunogenicity of the HepB, diphtheria, tetanus, and Bordetella pertussis antigens incorporated in the EPI Shan-5 vaccine versus the optional pentavalent (DTwP-HB-Hib) Quinvaxem and hexavalent (DTaP-HB-Hib-IPV) Infanrix-hexa vaccine. Methods: Three-dose Shan-5-vaccinated children were prospectively enrolled at the Regional Health Promotion Centre 5, Ratchaburi province, Thailand, between May 2020 and May 2021. Blood sampling was performed at months 7 and 18. The levels of HepB surface antibody (anti-HBs), anti-diphtheria toxoid (DT) IgG, anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) IgG, and anti-pertussis toxin (PT) IgG were evaluated using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays. Results: Anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/mL were achieved in 100 %, 99.2 %, and 99.2 % of infants in the Shan-5 EPI group, hexavalent group and Quinvaxem group one month after four dose immunization (at 0, 2, 4, 6 months of age), respectively. The geometric mean concentrations of the EPI Shan-5 and hexavalent groups were comparable but were higher than those of the Quinvaxem group. At one month after primary vaccination (month 7), infants in the Shan-5 EPI group had significantly higher levels of anti-DT IgG, anti-TT IgG, and anti-PT IgG than infants in the hexavalent and Quinvaxem groups. Conclusions: The immunogenicity of the HepB surface antigen in the EPI Shan-5 vaccine was similar to that achieved by the hexavalent vaccine, but was higher than that achieved by the Quinvaxem vaccine. The Shan-5 vaccine is highly immunogenic and generates robust antibody responses after primary immunization.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

This study aimed to investigate (1) the effects of pimobendan on cardiac function, cardiac mitochondrial quality and morphology, and cardiac ultrastructure in a rat model of chronic MR and (2) the direct effect of pimobendan on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cardiac cells. MR was surgically induced in 20 Sprague-Dawley rats, and sham procedures were performed on 10 rats. Eight weeks post-surgery, the MR rats were randomly divided into two groups: the MR group and the MR + pimobendan group. Pimobendan (0.15 mg/kg) was administered twice a day via oral gavage for 4 weeks, whereas the sham and MR groups received equivalent volumes of drinking water. Echocardiography was performed at baseline (8 weeks post-surgery) and at the end of the study (4 weeks after treatment). At the end of the study protocol, all rats were euthanized, and their hearts were immediately collected, weighed, and used for transmission electron microscopy and mitochondrial quality assessments. To evaluate the role of pimobendan on intracellular ROS production, preventive or scavenging properties were tested with H2O2-induced ROS generation in rat cardiac myoblasts (H9c2). Results: Pimobendan preserved cardiac functions and structure in MR rats. In addition, pimobendan significantly improved mitochondrial quality by attenuating ROS production and depolarization (P < 0.05). The cardiac ultrastructure and mitochondrial morphology were significantly preserved in the MR + pimobendan group. In addition, pimobendan appeared to play as a ROS scavenger, but not as a ROS preventer, in H2O2-induced ROS production in H9c2 cells. Conclusions: Pimobendan demonstrated cardioprotective effects on cardiac function and ultrastructure by preserving mitochondrial quality and acted as an ROS scavenger in a rat model of MR.",Veterinary Science,Veterinary (all)

Renewable energy sources can be integrated with heat pumps to improve these systems in term of fossil fuel consumption and mitigation of greenhouse gases. Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs), using geothermal energy as heat source, are promising technologies for supplying heating and cooling loads in a clean and sustainable way. Aside from energy analysis, exergetic dimensions of GSHPs has been considered in recent decades. Regarding the advantages of exergy analysis in providing deep insight into the energy systems, this work reviews the study on the exergy analysis of GSHPs. In this regard, this study is performed to provide a comprehensive review on the GSHPs’ exergetic dimensions. According to the findings, exergy efficiency of GSHPs depends on several elements such as the installation depth of the components, specification of the units, dead state temperature, configuration of the system and operation mode. In addition, it is found that irreversibilites of GSHPs is decreasable by utilizing some additional components such as thermoelectric. Furthermore, utilization of material with improved properties such as nanofluids can enhance the exergy efficiency of GSHPs, i.g. 89.7% in optimal concentration compared 88.3% by using base fluid as indicated in one of the studies.","geothermal energygy, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

A significant amount of carotenoid accumulation has been recently improved by genetic engineering. In this study, to achieve higher carotenoid production with higher antioxidant activity, we successfully constructed five Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains overexpressing (OX) native genes related to the carotenoids biosynthetic pathway, including OX_CrtB, OX_CrtP, OX_CrtQ, OX_CrtO, and OX_CrtR. All of the engineered strains maintained a significant quantity of myxoxanthophyll, while increasing zeaxanthin and echinenone accumulation. In addition, higher components of zeaxanthin and echinenone were noted in all OX strains, ranging from 14 to 19% and from 17 to 22%, respectively. It is worth noting that the enhanced echinenone component responded to low light conditions, while the increased β-carotene component contributed to a high light stress response. According to the higher antioxidant activity of all OX strains, the carotenoid extracts presented lower IC50 in lung cancer cell lines H460 and A549, with values less than 157 and 139 µg/mL, respectively, when compared with those of WTc, particularly OX_CrtR and OX_CrtQ. A higher proportion of zeaxanthin and β-carotene in OX_CrtR and OX_CrtQ, respectively, may considerably contribute to the ability to treat lung cancer cells with antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Accordingly, the development of safe materials for implants has become increasingly critical for minimizing health complications in patients. Herein, additively manufacturable binary titanium-zirconium (Ti-Zr) alloys are investigated as an alternative to the conventionally used Ti-6Al-4V alloys, in which the release of toxic vanadium (V) ions has been identified as a potential health hazard. Using commercially pure (CP)-Ti and pre-mixed blends of Ti 0–10 wt% ZrH2 powders as feedstock, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was used to successfully prepare high-density (>98%) Ti–Zr materials with a homogeneous distribution of Zr in the Ti. The presence of Zr was found to promote grain refinement, which reduced the large α/α’ grains in several hundred microns found in the Zr-free samples to a fine acicular grain structure (3.96 µm, 10 wt% ZrH2 addition). Tensile yield strength was also significantly enhanced with increasing Zr content with a remarkable improvement of up to 154% (853.9 MPa, 10 wt% ZrH2 addition) than the Zr-free Ti material, meanwhile retaining acceptable ductility (approximately 10%). To clarify the mechanisms of strengthening, the contributions of grain refinement and solid solution hardening are quantitatively evaluated. Given the excellent performance of the bulk materials, the fabrication of lattice scaffold structures from the Ti-Zr materials was investigated to further evaluate the applicability of the material fabricating lightweight, high-strength, and low-elastic modulus geometries. Ti–Zr scaffolds with different cellular structures are mechanically tested to determine the potential of each design. With compressive performance comparable to Ti-6Al-4V scaffold structures, and no inclusion of harmful elements, this study reveals the strong potential of the use of Ti-Zr scaffolds in orthopedic applications.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science (all), Engineering (miscellaneous), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

In this study, we investigated the prediction ability of machine learning models for posttraumatic (6 months) functional recovery in middle-aged and older patients on the basis of their preexisting health conditions. Methods: Data obtained from injured patients aged ≥45 years were divided into training–validation (n = 368) and test (n = 159) data sets. The input features were the sociodemographic characteristics and baseline health conditions of the patients. The output feature was functional status 6 months after injury; this was assessed using the Barthel Index (BI). On the basis of their BI scores, the patients were categorized into functionally independent (BI >60) and functionally dependent (BI ≤60) groups. The permutation feature importance method was used for feature selection. Six algorithms were validated through cross-validation with hyperparameter optimization. The algorithms exhibiting satisfactory performance were subjected to bagging to construct stacking, voting, and dynamic ensemble selection models. The best model was evaluated on the test data set. Partial dependence (PD) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots were created. Results: In total, nineteen of twenty-seven features were selected. Logistic regression, linear discrimination analysis, and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances and were, therefore, used to construct ensemble models. The k-Nearest Oracle Elimination model outperformed the other models when evaluated on the training–validation data set (sensitivity: 0.732, 95% CI: 0.702–0.761; specificity: 0.813, 95% CI: 0.805–0.822); it exhibited compatible performance on the test data set (sensitivity: 0.779, 95% CI: 0.559–0.950; specificity: 0.859, 95% CI: 0.799–0.912). The PD and ICE plots showed consistent patterns with practical tendencies.

Methods: This is an international multicenter study evaluating medical management of HSO in SBS patients using a questionnaire survey. Thirty-three intestinal-failure centers were invited to complete the survey as one multidisciplinary team. Results: Survey response rate was 91%. Dietary recommendations varied based on anatomy and geographic region. For patients without colon-in-continuity (CiC), clinical practices were generally consistent with ESPEN guidelines, including separation of fluid from solid food (90%), a high-sodium diet (90%), and a low-simple-sugar diet (75%). For CiC patients, practices less closely followed guidelines, such as a low-fat diet (35%) or a high-sodium diet (50%). First-line antimotility and antisecretory medications were loperamide and proton-pump inhibitors. Other therapeutic agents (e.g., pancreatic enzymes and bile acid binders) were utilized in real-world practices, and usage varied based on intestinal anatomy. Conclusion: Expert centers largely followed published HSO-management guidelines for SBS patients without CiC, but clinical practices deviated substantially for CiC patients.

Although hydroquinone, kojic acid, and arbutin are the most well-known tyrosinase inhibitors, their adverse effects are inevitable. In the present study, an in silico drug repositioning combined with experimental validation was performed to search for novel potent tyrosinase inhibitors. Docking-based virtual screening results revealed that, among the 3210 FDA-approved drugs available in the ZINC database, amphotericin B, an antifungal drug exhibited the highest binding efficiency against human tyrosinase. Results from tyrosinase inhibition assay demonstrated that amphotericin B could inhibit the activity of mushroom and cellular tyrosinases, especially from MNT-1 human melanoma cells. Molecular modeling results revealed that amphotericin B/human tyrosinase complex exhibited high stability in an aqueous environment. Melanin assay results demonstrated that amphotericin B significantly suppressed melanin production in α-MSH-induced B16F10 murine melanoma and MNT-1 human melanoma cell lines better than the known inhibitor, kojic acid. Mechanistically, amphotericin B treatment significantly activated ERK and Akt signaling pathways, resulting in the decreased expression of MITF and tyrosinase. The obtained results may pursue pre-clinical and clinical studies to examine the possibility of using amphotericin B as an alternative treatment for hyperpigmentation disorders.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

PEEK dental prostheses for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems on the market often have additives of titanium dioxide (TiO2) to strengthen their mechanical properties. However, the effects of combining aging, simulating a long-term intraoral environment, and TiO2 content on the fracture characteristics of PEEK dental prostheses have rarely been investigated. In this study, two types of commercially available PEEK blocks, containing 20% and 30% TiO2, were used to fabricate dental crowns by CAD/CAM systems and were aged for 5 and 10 h based on the ISO 13356 specifications. The compressive fracture load values of PEEK dental crowns were measured using a universal test machine. The morphology and crystallinity of the fracture surface were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and an X-ray diffractometer, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test (α = 0.05). Results showed no significant difference in the fracture load value of the test PEEK crowns with 20% and 30% TiO2 after 5 or 10 h of aging treatment; all test PEEK crowns have satisfactory fracture properties for clinical applications. Fracture surface analysis revealed that all test crowns fractured from the lingual side of the occlusal surface, with the fracture extending along the lingual sulcus to the lingual edge, showing a feather shape at the middle part of the fracture extension path and a coral shape at the end of the fracture. Crystalline analysis showed that PEEK crowns, regardless of aging time and TiO2 content, remained predominantly PEEK matrix and rutile phase TiO2. We would conclude that adding 20% or 30% TiO2 to PEEK crowns may have been sufficient to improve the fracture properties of PEEK crowns after 5 or 10 h of aging. Aging times below 10 h may still be safe for reducing the fracture properties of TiO2-containing PEEK crowns.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Information on whether tissue tropism persists is lacking. Objectives: To determine the disease association of CaChPV-1 in dogs with diarrhea and to investigate viral tropism and genetic diversity. Animals and methods: CaChPV-1 infection was investigated in five recently deceased puppies and designed a retrospective study to determine whether the presence of CaChPV-1 is associated with diarrhea. The retrospective study was conducted in 137 intestinal tissue samples and 168 fecal samples obtained from 305 dogs. CaChPV-1 tissue localization was determined using in situ hybridization, and CaChPV-1 complete genomes obtained from dead puppies and retrospective study were sequenced and analyzed. Results: CaChPV-1 was detected in 6.56% (20/305) of tested dogs, including 14 diarrheic- and 6 non-diarrheic dogs, and was significant in puppies with diarrhea (p = 0.048). Among the CaChPV-1-positive diarrheic dogs, one sample was obtained from intestinal tissue and 13 samples were fecal samples. However, six CaChPV-1 positive non-diarrheic dogs were based on fecal samples but not on intestinal tissue. Within the age range, the presence of CaChPV-1 was significant in puppies (p < 0.00001) and was mainly localized in the stromal and endothelial cells of intestinal villi and pulmonary alveoli. Phylogenetic analysis indicated genetic diversity of CaChPV-1 Thai strains that were mostly clustered within the sequences found in China. Conclusions: Although definitive pathogenesis of CaChPV-1 remains undetermined, this study provides evidence supporting that CaChPV-1 localizes in canine cells and could play a potential role as an enteric pathogen.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Veterinary Science",Veterinary (all)

Among patients who had success in primary haemostasis, 2/46 (4.35%) patients in the OTSC arm and 9/48 (18.75%) patients in the conventional arm developed 30-day rebleeding (p=0.03). However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference in rebleeding within 30 days (5/50 (10%) OTSC vs 9/50 (18%) standard, p=0.23) or all-cause mortality (2/50 (4%) OTSC vs 4/50 (8%) standard, p=0.68; OR=2.09, 95% CI 0.37 to 11.95). There was also no difference in transfusion requirement, hospital stay, intensive care unit admission and further interventions. Conclusion The routine use of OTSC as primary haemostasis in large bleeding peptic ulcers was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-day rebleeding.",medical,Gastroenterology
Reverse cholesterol transport and lipid peroxidation biomarkers in major depression and bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Almulla A.F., Thipakorn Y., Algon A.A.A., Tunvirachaisakul C., Al-Hakeim H.K., Maes M.",2023-10-01,"Aldehydes, Antioxidants, Biomarkers, Bipolar Disorder, Cholesterol, Depression, Depressive Disorder, Major, Humans, Lipid Peroxidation, Lipids, Affective disorders, Antioxidants, Autoimmunity, Depression, Neuro-immune, Oxidative and nitrosative stress","Background: Major depression (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are linked to immune activation, increased oxidative stress, and lower antioxidant defenses. Objectives: To systematically review and meta-analyze all data concerning biomarkers of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), lipid-associated antioxidants, lipid peroxidation products, and autoimmune responses to oxidatively modified lipid epitopes in MDD and BD. Methods: Databases including PubMed, Google scholar and SciFinder were searched to identify eligible studies from inception to January 10th, 2023. Guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: The current meta-analysis included 176 studies (60 BD and 116 MDD) and examined 34,051 participants, namely 17,094 with affective disorders and 16,957 healthy controls. Patients with MDD and BD showed a) significantly decreased RCT (mainly lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and paraoxonase 1); b) lowered lipid soluble vitamins (including vitamin A, D, and coenzyme Q10); c) increased lipid peroxidation and aldehyde formation, mainly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal, peroxides, and 8-isoprostanes; and d) Immunoglobulin (Ig)G responses to oxidized low-density lipoprotein and IgM responses to MDA. The ratio of all lipid peroxidation biomarkers/all lipid-associated antioxidant defenses was significantly increased in MDD (standardized mean difference or SMD = 0.433; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.312; 0.554) and BD (SMD = 0.653; CI: 0.501–0.806). This ratio was significantly greater in BD than MDD (p = 0.027). Conclusion: In MDD/BD, lowered RCT, a key antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathway, may drive increased lipid peroxidation, aldehyde formation, and autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes, which all together cause increased immune-inflammatory responses and neuro-affective toxicity.","Immunology, neuroscience","Immunology, Endocrine and Autonomic Systems, Behavioral Neuroscience"

Computer-Aided Screening for Potential Coronavirus 3-Chymotrypsin-like Protease (3CLpro) Inhibitory Peptides from Putative Hemp Seed Trypsinized Peptidome,"Prasertsuk K., Prongfa K., Suttiwanich P., Harnkit N., Sangkhawasi M., Promta P., Chumnanpuen P.",2023-01-01,"Amino Acids, Antiviral Agents, Cannabis, Chymases, COVID-19, Humans, Molecular Docking Simulation, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Pandemics, Peptides, Protease Inhibitors, SARS-CoV-2, antiviral, hemp, molecular docking, peptide, SARS-CoV-2 main protease","To control the COVID-19 pandemic, antivirals that specifically target the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently required. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a promising drug target since it functions as a catalytic dyad in hydrolyzing polyprotein during the viral life cycle. Bioactive peptides, especially food-derived peptides, have a variety of functional activities, including antiviral activity, and also have a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19. In this study, the hemp seed trypsinized peptidome was subjected to computer-aided screening against the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Using predictive trypsinized products of the five major proteins in hemp seed (i.e., edestin 1, edestin 2, edestin 3, albumin, and vicilin), the putative hydrolyzed peptidome was established and used as the input dataset. To select the Cannabis sativa antiviral peptides (csAVPs), a predictive bioinformatic analysis was performed by three webserver screening programs: iAMPpred, AVPpred, and Meta-iAVP. The amino acid composition profile comparison was performed by COPid to screen for the non-toxic and non-allergenic candidates, ToxinPred and AllerTOP and AllergenFP, respectively. GalaxyPepDock and HPEPDOCK were employed to perform the molecular docking of all selected csAVPs to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Only the top docking-scored candidate (csAVP4) was further analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation for 150 nanoseconds. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics revealed the potential ability and stability of csAVP4 to inhibit the 3CLpro catalytic domain with hydrogen bond formation in domain 2 with short bonding distances. In addition, these top ten candidate bioactive peptides contained hydrophilic amino acid residues and exhibited a positive net charge. We hope that our results may guide the future development of alternative therapeutics against COVID-19.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Enabling high dielectric constant and low loss tangent in BaTiO3–epoxy composites through a 3D interconnected network structure of ceramic phase,"Panomsuwan G., Manuspiya H.",2023-08-25,"3–3 connectivity, BaTiO 3, Ceramic-polymer composites, Dielectrics property, Epoxy, Epoxy composite, High dielectric constants, Loss tangent, Low-loss, Network structures, 3–3 connectivity, BaTiO3, Ceramic–polymer composite, Dielectric properties, Epoxy","Constructing ceramic–polymer composites with a 3–3 connectivity is an effective strategy to achieve a notable increase in the dielectric constant at low ceramic contents. However, the dielectric data of the 3–3 composites with a low ceramic content (<10 vol. %) are still limited, and further investigation is thus required. Herein, composites with a 3–3 connectivity, in which BaTiO3 (BTO) and epoxy are self-connected in three dimensions, were developed and constructed at low BTO contents (2.0–8.3 vol. %). A three-dimensional network structure of the BTO ceramic (3D-BTO) was constructed via the sacrificial template method using polyurethane foam as the template. The dielectric constant and loss tangent of the composites increased with increasing BTO content. At a BTO content of 8.3 vol. %, the dielectric constant of the composite considerably increased to 33.4 at 1 kHz, which was ∼10-fold higher than that of neat epoxy (3.5). The loss tangent had a low value of< 0.030. By comparing with several theoretical models, the dielectric constants of the composites were well fitted with the effective medium theory model at low fitting factors (n = 0.008–0.013). The considerable increase in the dielectric constant of the composites with a low loss tangent at a low BTO content was attributed to the strong interfacial polarization and continuous polarization pathways through the interconnected 3D-BTO network structure in the composites. This study fills the gap in the literature by providing missing data on the dielectric properties of 3–3 composites at low ceramic contents (<10 vol. %), as well as a theoretical prediction.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"
Gaining new insights into macroplastic transport ‘hotlines’ and fine-scale retention-remobilisation using small floating high-resolution satellite drifters in the Chao Phraya River estuary of Bangkok,"Mani T., Hawangchu Y., Khamdahsag P., Lohwacharin J., Phihusut D., Arsiranant I., Junchompoo C., Piemjaiswang R.",2023-03-01,"Bangkok, Fine-scale, GNSS and GPS, High resolution satellites, Hydrology and bathymetry, Macroplastic transport hotline, Remobilization, Retention and remobilization, Surface drifter, Surface drifter and tracker, Environmental Monitoring, Estuaries, Hotlines, Plastics, Rivers, Thailand, Water Pollutants, Chemical, GNSS and GPS, Hydrology and bathymetry, Macroplastic transport hotlines, Retention and remobilisation, River estuary, Surface drifters and trackers","In river plastic pollution research little is known about the detailed pathways and interruptions that occur during the journey of macroplastic debris (>5 cm) from land to sea. Data on fine-scale and high-accuracy transport trajectories and cycles of retention (when macroplastics are trapped, e.g. at a pier) and remobilisation is needed to inform global river plastic transport models as well as mechanical cleanup efforts. Though well established in the marine environment, the use of floating satellite drifters to understand macroplastic debris transport in tidal rivers and estuaries is in its infancy. Exploring the capacity to investigate fine-scale macroplastic debris-estuary interactions, this study brings together, on the one hand, a small, sensitive, floating satellite drifter with, on the other hand, the major riverine-marine habitat of the Chao Phraya River estuary at Bangkok, Thailand. The used grapefruit-sized drifters (n = 5) with minimal drogue (ρ ≈ 0.67 g/cm3) sent their positions at up to 4 m and 5 min spatiotemporal resolution via cellular GSM network for up to 48 days. This study indicates that river macroplastic debris transport ‘hotlines’ (positions where floating debris will likely pass by in a river) as well as retention-remobilisation cycles can be studied at fine scale. On their way through the river and gulf, covering between 9 and 600 km, drifters got stuck up to ten times, spending 80% of their lifetime in retention. Furthermore, it is outlined that the trajectories can be linked with environmental factors such as bathymetry and tides to more accurately model macroplastic debris behaviour in rivers. Finally, it is shown that trajectories crossing the riverine-marine continuum at the estuary can be accurately traced to support future investigations on the so far scarcely evidenced river mouth emissions of macroplastic debris.","pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

To improve dose management, a reference quality approach was tested in which phantom quality metrics of a clinical ALADA dose reference protocol were used to benchmark potential ALADA dose protocols for various scanner models. Methods: Spatial resolution, contrast resolution, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and subjective noise and sharpness were evaluated for a clinical ALADA dose reference protocol at 80 kV and 40 mA (CTDIvol 2.66 mGy) and compared with test protocols of two CT scanners at 100 kV and 35 mA (3.08–3.44 mGy), 80 kV and 54–61 mA (2.65 mGy), 80 kV and 40 mA (1.73–1.92 mGy), and 80 kV and 21–23 mA (1.00–1.03 mGy) using different kernels, filtered backprojection and iterative reconstructions. The test protocols with the lowest dose showing quality metrics non-inferior to the reference protocol were verified in a cadaver study by determining the diagnostic accuracy of detection of maxillofacial fractures and CNR of the optical nerve and rectus inferior muscle. Results: 36 different image series were analysed in the phantom study. Based on the phantom quality metrics, potential ALADA dose protocols at 1.73–1.92 mGy were selected. Compared with the reference images, the selected protocols showed non-inferiority in the detection and classification of maxillofacial fractures and non-inferior CNR of orbital soft tissues in the cadaver study. Conclusions: Reference quality metrics from clinical ALADA dose protocols may be used to guide selection of potential ALADA dose protocols of different CT scanners.",medical,Medicine (all)

Methods: This was a prospective case–control study enrolling two asymptomatic COVID-19 patient cohorts with vs. without OWF-PNS in the case–control ratio of 1:4. All subjects were treated in a German level 1 trauma center during a one-year interval. The main predictor variable was the presence of OWF-PNS (case/control); cases with preoperative conjunctival positivity of SARS-CoV-2 were excluded to rule out the possibility of viral dissemination via the lacrimal gland and/or the nasolacrimal system. The main outcome variable was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-OSC (yes/no). Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed with a statistically significant P ≤ 0.05. Results: The samples comprised 11 cases and 44 controls (overall: 27.3% females; mean age, 52.7 ± 20.3 years [range, 19–85]). There was a significant association between OWF-PNS and SARS-CoV-2-OSC (P = 0.0001; odds ratio = 20.8; 95% confidence interval = 4.11–105.2; R-squared = 0.38; accuracy = 85.5%), regardless of orbital fracture location (orbital floor vs. medial wall versus both; P = 1.0). Conclusions: Asymptomatic COVID-19 patients with OWF-PNS are associated with a considerable and almost 21-fold increase in the risk of SARS-CoV-2-OSC, in comparison with those without facial fracture. This could suggest that OWF-PNS is the viral source, requiring particular attention during manipulation of ocular/orbital tissue to prevent viral transmission.",medical,Ophthalmology

The modification of CACw with mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), forming MBT-CACw, which displayed maximum adsorption efficiency of 49.9 mg/g. The optimal pH for adsorption was found to be 7.5 at 40 °C with 0.2 mol/L (NH4)2S2O3. The adsorption was described by the pseudo-second-order model and the Freundlich isotherm, owing to the high affinity of MBT-CACw for the sulfur donor. Copper was eluted from the loaded MBT-CACw using 0.7 mol/L (NH4)2S2O3 followed by the gold elution with 40% v/v CH3OH. The two-step elution recovered 98.7% of copper and 97.6% of gold. These findings suggest that the oxygen-assisted extraction, combined with the adsorption conducted using low-cost, agriculture-based adsorbent and selective elution, is an eco-friendly approach to efficiently recovering gold from e-waste.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Metals and Alloys, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Digital interventions have been used to improve parents’ HL with high satisfaction. KhunLook is a Thai mobile app conceived using strategies to improve HL. It was developed to assist parents in assessing and keeping track of their child’s health in complement to the standard Maternal and Child Health Handbook (MCHH). Objective: This trial focuses on the effectiveness of using the KhunLook app with the MCHH and standard care (intervention) compared with the conventional MCHH and standard care (control) on parents’ HL. Data on accuracy of parents’ assessment of their child’s health and growth as well as convenience of use of the tool (app or MCHH) in the well-child clinic were collected at 2 visits (immediate=visit 1, and intermediate=visit 2). Methods: Parents of children under 3 years of age who (1) had a smartphone or tablet and the MCHH and (2) could participate in 2 visits, 2-6 months apart at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, were enrolled in this 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial between April 2020 and May 2021. Parents were randomized 1:1 to 2 groups. At visit 1, data on demographics and baseline HL (Thailand Health Literacy Scales) were collected. Parents in the app group used the KhunLook app and the control group used their child’s handbook to assess their child’s growth, development, nutrition and feeding, immunization status and rated the convenience of the tool they used. At visit 2, they repeated the assessments and completed the HL questionnaire. Results: A total of 358 parents completed the study (358/408, 87.7%). After the intervention, the number of parents with high total HL significantly increased from 94/182 (51.6%) to 109/182 (59.9%; 15/182; Δ 8.2%; P=.04), specifically in the health management (30/182; Δ 16.4%; P<.001) and child health management (18/182; Δ 9.9%; P=.01) domains in the app group, but not in the control group. Parents in the app group could correctly assess their child’s head circumference (172/182, 94.5% vs 124/176, 70.5%; P<.001) and development (173/182, 95.1% vs 139/176, 79.0%; P<.001) better than those in the control group at both visits. A higher proportion of parents in the app group rated their tool as very easy or easy to use (174-181/182, 95.6%-99.5% vs 141-166/176, 80.1%-94.3%; P<.001) on every item since the first visit. Conclusions: Our results suggest the potential of a smartphone app (KhunLook) to improve parents’ HL as well as to promote superior accuracy of parents’ assessment of their child’s head circumference and development, with a similar effect on weight, height, nutrition and feeding, and immunization as in traditional interventions. Using the KhunLook app is useful and more convenient for parents in promoting a healthy child preventive care during early childhood.",medical,Health Informatics

We evaluated potential biological risk factors for HIV acquisition in TGW at the sites of viral entry by assessing immune parameters of the neovaginal surface and gut mucosa. The neovagina in TGW, compared with the vagina in cisgender women (CW), shows distinct cell composition and may pose a more inflammatory environment, evidenced by increased CD4+ T cell activation and higher levels of soluble markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, soluble CD30). Increased inflammation may be driven by microbiome composition, as shown by a greater abundance of Prevotella and a higher Shannon Diversity Index. In addition, we have observed higher frequency of CD4+CCR5+ target cells and decreased DNA methylation of the CCR5 gene in the gut mucosa of TGW compared with CW and men who have sex with men, which was inversely correlated with testosterone levels. The rectal microbiome composition in TGW appears to favor a proinflammatory milieu as well as mucosal barrier disruption. Thus, it is possible that increased inflammation and higher frequencies of CCR5-expressing target cells at sites of mucosal viral entry may contribute to increased risk of HIV acquisition in TGW, with further validation in larger studies warranted.",medical,Medicine (all)
Insights into the influence of Pd loading on CeO2 catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol,"Pothu R., Mitta H., Banerjee P., Boddula R., Srivastava R.K., Kalambate P.K., Naik R., Bahgat Radwan A., Al-Qahtani N.",2023-01-01,"Carbon neutrals, CO2 hydrogenation, Future energies, Industrial processs, Metal loadings, Methanol synthesis, Pd loadings, Pd/CeO2 nanorod, Tuning metal loading, ]+ catalyst, Carbon neutral, CO2 hydrogenation, Methanol, Pd/CeO2 nanorods, Tuning metal loading","One of the most significant industrial processes is the catalytic methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide because methanol is a future energy carrier for producing fuels and high-value-added commodities, the so-called “methanol economy” is carbon neutral. As a solution to climate change, the widespread belief that carbon dioxide can be recycled by hydrogenation into methanol has motivated the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. Efficient 2 wt% Pd/CeO2 catalysts for thermochemical CO2 hydrogenation have recently been investigated. However, the rationale behind the low Pd loading (2 wt%) in CeO2 needs to be clarified, and comprehensive research into Pd tuning is lacking. In this article, we describe the synthesis ofvarious palladium contents (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 wt%) supported on ceria nanorods (Pd/CeO2) for selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol under vapor-phase. The impact of Pd on the physicochemical properties of CeO2 was examined using various characterization techniques. The enhanced catalytic activity was caused by the 2 wt% Pd/CeO2 catalyst's most significant level of metallic Pd species, strong interactions between Pd and CeO2, uniform Pd dispersion on CeO2, increased reducibility, oxygen mobility, and weak basic sites. This study reveals that changing the percentage of metal in the catalyst supports a valuable technique for designing efficient oxides-supported metal-based catalysts for CO2 conversions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, energy, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Fuel Technology"

HDPE was then blended with P811 at various ratios of 80/20, 90/10 and 95/5 percent by weight. The mechanical, chemical, morphological, and water contact angle properties were investigated in this study. The mechanical properties of HDPE/P811 blends tend to decrease with increasing P811 content up to 20 wt% due to incompatibility between HDPE and P881. However, HDPE/P811 shows good performance in tensile strength but other performance declines, such as an elongation at break and Young’s modulus including impact strength. Therefore, this study finds that the optimum ratio of HDPE/P811 blending is 90/10. The water contact angle measurement reveals the wetting property of the blends compared to neat polymer. The thermal properties of HDPE/P811 indicate that the melting temperature (Tm) shifts to a higher degree compared to neat HDPE, while the crystallinity percent of polymer blends tend to decrease with higher P881 content. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and infrared spectrum show well-dispersed particles and incompatibility in the chemical interactions between HDPE and P811, respectively.","mixing and separation, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Our proposed method replaces the existing system, based on barcode technology, with shortage usage and low reliability. In addition, tube-tagged barcode has not eliminated the lost or incorrect delivery issues in many laboratories. In this solution, the passive RFID tag is attached to the surface of the specimen tube and stores information such as patient records, required tests, and receiver laboratory location. This information can be written and read multiple times using an RFID device. While delivering the specimen tubes via our proposed smart specimen transport box from one clinical laboratory to another, the NB-IoT attached to the box monitors the temperature and humidity values inside the box and tracks the box’s GPS location to check whether the box arrives at the destination. The environmental condition inside the specimen transport box is sent to the cloud and can be monitored by doctors. The experimental results have proven the innovation of our solution and opened a new dimension for integrating RFID and IoT technologies into the specimen logistic system in the hospital.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Materials and Methods: Fourteen participants who required two-stage maxillary sinus augmentation were randomly assigned to DBB and FDBA bone grafting groups. Six months after the sinus augmentation procedure, bone samples were collected before implant placement with a trephine bur. Gene expression of Runx2, Opn, Ocn, Col1a1, Rankl, and Tnf-α of the bone samples was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction as a primary outcome. Histological analysis of H&E-stained sections, immunohistochemistry for OPN quantification, and CBCT-based bone tissue examination were performed to investigate the bone healing effects of DBB and FDBA substitutes. Results: The FDBA treated group showed higher gene expression when compared with the DBB treated group in Opn (2.83 ± 1.23 vs. 1.40 ± 0.69; p = 0.04), Runx2 (1.49 ± 0.44 vs. 0.67 ± 0.14; p = 0.01), and Rankl (2.34 ± 0.85 vs. 0.69 ± 0.39; p = 0.03). In the DBB treated group a downregulated expression was found of Ocn relative to maxillary edentulous bone (1.18 ± 0.40 vs. 2.51 ± 0.78; p = 0.02). Conclusion: Two-stage maxillary sinus augmentation with FDBA upregulated specific bone remodeling genes when compared to DBB. The outcome of gene expression matched with the ones for OPN immunoreactivity, being higher in the FDBA group. FDBA had an expression pattern similar to native bone and showed stronger expression of bone forming related-genes suggesting it may be clinically preferable over DBB.

The placenta plays a crucial role in protecting the fetus from environmental insults and safeguarding proper fetal development including neurodevelopment. The aim of our study is to evaluate changes in the placental transcriptome associated with prenatal OP exposure. Methods: Pregnant farm workers from two agricultural districts in northern Thailand were recruited for the Study of Asian Women and Offspring's Development and Environmental Exposures (SAWASDEE) from 2017 to 2019. For 254 participants, we measured maternal urinary concentrations of six nonspecific dialkyl phosphates (DAP) metabolites in early, middle, and late pregnancy. In parallel, we profiled the term placental transcriptome from the same participants using RNA-Sequencing and performed Weighted Gene co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Generalized linear regression modeling was used to examine associations of urinary OP metabolites and placental co-expression module eigenvalues. Results: We identified 21 gene co-expression modules in the placenta. From the six DAP metabolites assayed, diethylphosphate (DEP) and diethylthiophosphate (DETP) were detected in more than 70% of the urine samples. Significant associations between DEP at multiple time points and two specific placental gene modules were observed. The ‘black’ module, enriched in genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and hypoxia, was negatively associated with DEP in early (p = 0.034), and late pregnancies (p = 0.016). The ‘lightgreen’ module, enriched in genes involved in myogenesis and EMT, was negatively associated with DEP in late pregnancy (p = 0.010). We observed 2 hub genes (CELSR1 and PYCR1) of the ‘black’ module to be negatively associated with DEP in early and late pregnancies. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prenatal OP exposure may disrupt placental gene networks in a time-dependent manner. Such transcriptomic effects may lead to down-stream changes in placental function that ultimately affect the developing fetus.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning With Progressive Negative Reward for Cryptocurrency Trading,"Kumlungmak K., Vateekul P.",2023-01-01,"Cryptocurrency trading, Deep learning, Multi agent, Multi-agent reinforcement learning, Optimisations, Performance, Policy optimization, Portfolio, Portfolio managements, Reinforcement learnings, Cryptocurrency trading, multi-agent reinforcement learning, portfolio management","Recently, reinforcement learning has been applied to cryptocurrencies to make profitable trades. However, cryptocurrency trading is a very challenging task due to the volatility of the market, especially during bearish periods. In addressing this problem, the existing literature employs single-agent techniques such as deep Q-network (DQN), advantage actor-critic (A2C), and proximal policy optimization (PPO), or their ensembles. Moreover, in the context of cryptocurrencies, the mechanisms for restricting losses during a bearish market are insufficiently robust. Consequently, the performance of reinforcement learning methods for cryptocurrency trading in the existing literature is constrained. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel cryptocurrency trading method based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with a collaborative multi-agent scheme and a local-global reward function to optimize both the individual and collective performance of the agents. Both a multi-objective optimization technique and a multi-scale continuous loss (MSCL) reward are used to train agents using a progressive penalty to avoid consecutive losses of portfolio value. For evaluation, we compared our method to multiple baselines. As a result, better cumulative returns are achieved than when baseline methods are used. In addition, the superiority of our method is emphasized by the result of the bearish test set, where only our method can make a profit. Specifically, our method obtains a 2.36% cumulative return, whereas the baseline methods result in negative cumulative returns. In comparison to FinRL-Ensemble, a reinforcement learning-based method, our method achieves a 46.05% greater cumulative return in the bullish test set.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The use of a three-dimensional (3D) mapping system or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is useful in localizing the fossa ovalis and reducing fluoroscopy use. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy between 3D mapping system-guided TSP and ICE-guided TSP techniques. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients undergoing TSP for left atrial catheter ablation procedures (mostly atrial fibrillation ablation). Propensity scoring was used to match patients undergoing 3D-guided TSP with patients undergoing ICE-guided TSP. Logistic regression was used to compare the clinical data, procedural data, fluoroscopy time, success rate, and complications between the groups. Results: Sixty-five patients underwent 3D-guided TSP, and 151 propensity score-matched patients underwent ICE-guided TSP. The TSP success rate was 100% in both the 3D-guided and ICE-guided groups. Median needle time was 4.00 min (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.57–5.08) in patients with 3D-guided TSP compared to 4.02 min (IQR: 2.83–6.95) in those with ICE-guided TSP (p =.22). Mean fluoroscopy time was 0.2 min (IQR: 0.1–0.4) in patients with 3D-guided TSP compared to 1.2 min (IQR: 0.7–2.2) in those with ICE-guided TSP (p <.001). There were no complications related to TSP in both group. Conclusions: Three-dimensional mapping-guided TSP is as safe and effective as ICE-guided TSP without additional cost.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

Cassava starch is produced by wet-milling cassava, a good method for eliminating cyanogens. Nonetheless, the operation consumes considerable water and generates highly organic and acidic wastewater. For a more sustainable technique, dry milling can be used to conserve water and reduce waste. An alternative method for removing cyanogen must be investigated. This study aimed to determine the effect of incubation and drying temperatures on the concentration of free cyanide in cassava flour. Incubation for four hours increased the amount of free cyanide in fresh cassava cubes, which decreased thereafter. A 24-hour incubation lowered free cyanide by 30.5–53.7%. During the initial forty minutes of drying at varied temperatures (60, 70, and 80 °C), the free cyanide concentration increased dramatically before decreasing. Drying for four hours caused 53.6–78.5% reduction in HCN from the initial concentration before drying. The reduction rate and concentration of free cyanide in dry-milled cassava flour were not significantly changed by drying at different temperatures. Dry processing allows 70–90% reduction in water requirement.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Food Science, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering (all)"

Many constructions do not possess the permanent fire protection system, and only rely on the fire extinguisher or water tank to extinguish the fire. Moreover, a construction site has numerous features that make its uncommon and unanticipated structure. In a construction environment, changing is one of the characteristics that make it unique compared to others. Due to the dynamic nature of construction, the fire safety plan in construction needed to be reviewed and updated according to construction progress. The convention approach or manual process to develop the fire safety plan for a construction project can be a time-consuming and enormous labour-intensive task. BIM technology and Game engine can present the object in 3D and provide programming for the rule-based modelling. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to assess the fire extinguisher installation plan (FEIP) and recommend the locations of fire extinguisher by considering the dynamic nature of construction. This research develops the prototype that enables the users to define the parameters for the fire extinguisher installation plan such as finished and unfinished building objects (walls, stairs and slabs), exists, the locations of fire extinguishers (FE) and flammable substances (FS). This prototype provides the appropriate locations of fire extinguishers and shows the unsafe area. To validate the proposed approach, the case study using the sample BIM model is executed. The proposed system is expected to have the capability of assisting the safety engineers in developing and assessing the fire extinguisher installation plan.","water engineeringneering, engineering, computer science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Computer Science Applications"

Sophisticated theoretical frameworks underpin the study of various primate social systems. Single-file movements, defined as serially ordered patterns of animals, reflect intra-group social relationships and provide a key to understanding social structures. Here, we analysed automated camera-trapping data on the order of progression of single-file movements in a free-ranging group of stump-tailed macaques to estimate the social structure of the group. The sequence of single file movements showed some regularities, particularly for adult males. Social network analysis identified four community clusters (subgroups) corresponding to the social structures reported for these stumptailed macaques, i.e. males that had copulated more frequently with females were spatially clustered with females, but males that had copulated less frequently were spatially isolated from females. Our results suggest that stumptailed macaques move in regular, socially determined patterns that reflect the spatial positions of adult males and are related to the social organisation of the species.","animal ecology; mammals; autecology and behaviour, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Animal Science and Zoology

Cyano group and carbonyl group linked in the apex of heptazine unit were loaded into g-C3N4 framework, endowing g-C3N4 with extended light response range, tunable band structure and fast charge separation. By experiments analysis and theoretical calculations, the such a defect assemblage can attract photo-charge from other parts of heptazine unit and serve as active sites in photocatalytic process.

This now submerged region is known as Sundaland and played a key role in the expansion of flora, fauna, and humans during the Quaternary. However, information regarding past environmental conditions is sparse as post-glacial sea-level rise submerged and eroded most sedimentary archives. In this study, a combination of geomorphological mapping, investigating sedimentary features, and optically stimulated luminescence dating is used to decipher the evolution of sand ridges found in the coastal zone of the Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, southern Thailand. The two main ridges (eastern and western) are composed of moderately to poorly sorted medium to coarse, structureless massive sands. The eastern ridge deposited between ca. 8.3 ka and 0.16 ka and formed by coastal processes related to sea-level change and storm surge during the Holocene. Surprisingly, the western ridge yields a minimum depositional age of ca. 82 ka, and further deposition dates to different periods of the Late Pleistocene. We suggest that the initial formation of the western ridge possibly occurred during the Last Interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5e). During periods of low global sea level, when the region was far away from the coast, the ridge accumulated further sand, most likely due to aeolian activity. This would imply a rather limited vegetation cover in the interior of Sundaland and support previous assumptions of savannah-like conditions during global-scale glacial periods.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

In this study, we designed a sequential cross-flow filtration by the combination of a microfiltration membrane with a pore size of 0.2 micrometers, followed by an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 and 2 kilodaltons (kDa), respectively, and finished with diafiltration of the 10 and 2 kDa retentate fractions. The results show that the microfiltration membrane eliminated host cell impurities and significantly reduced the green pigment, which was measured using the 1976 CIE LAB system, while the 10 and 2 kDa membranes allowed the yellow pigment to pass through. The diafiltration steps also significantly reduced the yellow pigment. The host cell proteins were removed by recirculating in the retentate fraction of the 10 kDa membrane, while the 4.1 kDa target peptide, the candidate cell-penetrating antimicrobial peptide, was recovered by recirculation in the retentate fraction of the 2 kDa membrane.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, coastal engineering","Biotechnology, Food Science, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering (all)"
"Role of anharmonicity in phonon-mediated superconductivity of quasi- van der Waals layered XP2 (X = As, Sb, Bi) structures: Insight from first-principles calculations","Tsuppayakorn-aek P., Pluengphon P., Sukmas W., Sakulkalavek A., Inceesungvorn B., Luo W., Bovornratanaraks T.",2023-10-10,"Anharmonicities, Condensed-matter physics, First principle calculations, First principles, Layered Structures, Metallic state, Phonon, Stable Configuration, Superconducting properties, Van der Waal, Anharmonicity, First-principles calculations, Phonon, Superconductivity","It is of utmost importance to prioritize the undertaking of investigating superconductivity, as it represents one of the most intriguing and significant phenomena in the field of condensed matter physics. Our research endeavors to shed light on the metallic state of van der Waals layered XP2 (X = As, Sb, Bi) structures, which is crucial in predicting their superconducting properties. Employing a first-principle evolutionary algorithm, we predicted the structures of phosphides, including AsP2, SbP2, and BiP2, and determined their energetically stable configurations under atmospheric pressure. To investigate the potential for superconductivity in these structures, we conducted a thorough examination of relevant electronic properties. One of the crucial factors we addressed was the role of anharmonic phonon properties in determining the superconducting state in van der Waals layered structures. Our findings suggest that the introduction of anharmonicity can significantly suppress the superconducting abilities of such structures. Hence, the anharmonicity present in AsP2, SbP2, and BiP2 could be held accountable for the lower observed superconducting critical temperature in these van der Waals layered structures.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

The W-I method based on the synthesis of M-TiO2 powders (DP25 decorated with metal) followed by the sono-deposition on PET sheets. The W-II method begins with the sono-deposition of DP25 onto PET sheets, followed by the sono-deposition of M-TiO2 solution (DP25 +Metal+H2O). Under visible light, the Cu-DP25/PET and Au-DP25/PET films via W-II exhibited superior photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity was studied by analyzing the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. The materials were characterized with the employing of scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–vis DRS (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL). The interactions between catalysts/environment were studied through molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and binding energies (Ebinding). The superior photodegradation of Au-DP25/PET films towards MB was attributed to the combination of two effects: LSPR (localized surface plasmon resonance) and Au-TiO2/environment affinities. The aim of the experimental/theoretical analysis was to provide a deep understanding of the medium/surface interactions on decorated TiO2 materials and how these interactions influence the overall degradation behavior.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Materials Chemistry"

Energy demand has been increasing due to the continuous rise in the global population and basic needs. Energy integration is one of the promising ideas for alleviating energy shortages. Energy integration is performed by using the equipment and recirculating the heat back to the system via heat exchange between the heat source and the coolant. Conventional coolants have limited potential due to their low thermal conductivities. Nanoparticles, nanometer-sized solids with relatively high thermal conductivity, have been used to enhance the thermal properties of coolants, and the mixtures are called nanofluids. Nevertheless, the experiment consumes a lot of cost and time; using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a non-linear statistical data correlation model builder, is now considered acceptable and appropriate for correlating the complex relationship between inputs and outputs. This study describes a novel combination of ANN and conventional process simulation for heat transfer using nanofluid in a heat exchanger. In addition, the sensitivity of parameters for heat exchanger design and rating were investigated. The ANN development includes 2723 datasets with various nanofluid types and properties. The predictions of the new ANN nanofluid predictive model are closer to reality than other numerical methods, as shown in the simulation. The maximum error from the result was only 4.1%. The work reproduces the conventional simulation for better adaptability and great performance with acceptable error. Finally, the study combines ANN and conventional process simulation methods that effectively examine nanofluid enhancement's performance on heat exchangers. The parameter sensitivity test is discussed based on a plate heat exchanger, including an increase in heat transfer coefficient (around 7%), maintained pressure drop, and performance efficiency coefficient.","physics, engineering","Condensed Matter Physics, Engineering (all)"

At present, most of railway signaling labs rely on physical models and devices which require large space and regular maintenance. Emerging of Virtual Reality (VR) offers more flexibility to many applications including education, training, and testing since its operations are based on software and visualization. Using VR allows installation, updating, adjustment and maintenance to be performed more easily and effectively with effective cost, time, and space requirement. This paper aims to develop a virtual reality lab for training in railway signaling and control. The VR lab of railway signaling simulation consists of two stations, trains, tracks, a virtual dashboard and signaling posts including point machines.

Objective: The objective of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms and glomerular filtration rate, inflammatory biomarkers, and Wnt/catenin-pathway proteins. Methods: The Wnt-pathway related proteins β-catenin, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), R-spondin-1, and sclerostin were measured by ELISA technique in 60 ESRD patients and 30 controls. The Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of FF symptoms. Results: ESRD is characterized by a significant increase in the total FF score, muscle tension, fatigue, sadness, sleep disorders, gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, and a flu-like malaise. The total-FF score was significantly correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, and copper (positively), and β-catenin, eGFR, hemoglobin, albumin, and zinc (inversely). The total-FF score was associated with the number of total dialysis and weekly dialysis sessions, and these dialysis characteristics were more important in predicting FF scores than eGFR measurements. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the FF score comprised two factors that are differently associated with biomarkers: a) 43.0% of the variance in fatigue, GI symptoms, muscle tension, sadness, and insomnia is explained by hemo-globin, albumin, zinc, β-catenin, and R-spondin-1; and b) 22.3% of the variance in irritability, concentration and memory impairments by increased copper and cations/chloride ratio, and male sex. Conclusion: ESRD patients show high levels of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms associated with hemodialysis and mediated by dialysis-induced changes in inflammatory pathways, the Wnt/catenin pathway, and copper.","neuroscience, pharmacology","Neuroscience (all), Pharmacology"

The investigated volumetric properties included the density, excess molar volume, partial molar volume, and the investigated viscometric properties included the viscosity, viscosity deviation, free energy for activation of viscous flow, excess free energy for activation of viscous flow, and excess entropy for activation of viscous flow. The results indicated that there are strong intermolecular interactions and suitable molecular packing in the binary DEEDA–water mixture. Hence, the mixture was found to deviate from a real mixture according to the calculated excess properties.

Several mutagenesis methods are used to overcome the restriction of gene regulations when genetic information is absent. Atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) is a powerful technique to initiate random mutagenesis for microbial strain improvement. This study utilized an argon-based ARTP to conduct the mutations on SPR20. The positive mutants of 40% occurred. The M27 mutant exhibited an increase in anti-MRSA activity when compared to the wild-type strain, with the MIC values of 250–500 and 500 μg/mL, respectively. M27 had genetic stability because it exhibited constant activity throughout fifteen generations. This mutant had similar morphology and antibiotic susceptibility to the wild type. Comparative proteomic analysis identified some specific proteins that were upregulated in M27. These proteins were involved in the metabolism of amino acids, cell structure and movement, and catalytic enzymes. These might result in the enhancement of the anti-MRSA activity of the ARTP-treated SPR20 mutant.

However, achieving stable and uniform zinc electrodeposition, particularly at high current densities, remains a significant challenge. Herein, the mechanism of charging zinc-air flow batteries under high current density conditions is investigated in detail. Through a combination of experimental and computational methods, both the individual and combined effects of current density and electrolyte flow rate on zinc electrodeposition are studied. Critical aspects of zinc electrodeposition, including ion concentration gradients, overpotential, mass transfer impedance, and gas evolution are scrutinized. Findings demonstrate that flow velocity profoundly affects current density regulation and mass transfer, while bubble formation at high current densities has implications for induced overpotential and overall charging performance. The surface morphology of electrodeposited zinc, as well as the formation and motion of bubbles, are evaluated using both in-situ and ex-situ microscopic imaging techniques. Optimal uniformity of zinc deposition is achieved by combining a current density of 60 mA cm−2 with a flow rate of 0.021 m s−1. Applying these conditions to a zinc-air battery results in excellent durability, maintaining commendable performance throughout 78 h of charge/discharge cycling. This research provides valuable insights into the correlation between operating parameters and surface properties of zinc electrodeposition, thus supporting the development of high-performance rechargeable zinc-based energy storage devices incorporating flow systems.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, geobase; related topics, engineering, energy, environmental","Building and Construction, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

However, studies of landslides related to hydrological models in Thailand were still limited. Therefore, this study applied the hydrological model to evaluate occurrences of landslides in Thailand. The study area was Huai Nam Phung Subbasin, where there were 63 shallow landslides found during 2016–2017. A temporal change of groundwater level was calculated from meteorological data by TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL). After that, slope stability safety factors at different times and locations were calculated from the groundwater levels and physical characteristics of the area. The results reveal that the landslides occurred in 2017 rather than 2016 due to high volume of water in that year. The slopes became unstable in steep slope areas, and this instability extended to gentler slope areas when more water accumulated. According to the slope stability on 30 October 2017, the day with most unstable areas during the study, all of the 63 found landslides were in the unstable areas. On that day, there were 7 mountainous sub-catchments where more than 80% of the slopes were unstable. Most of the unstable areas were in the western part of the study area. Both consecutive heavy downpours over a long period of time and individual heavy downpours can cause slopes to become unstable. The finding of this study suggests that landslide early warning systems are required for the steep slope areas in the Huai Nam Phung Subbasin and the hydrological data should be monitored for the warning.","water engineeringneering, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

The effects of porous clay heterostructure from mixed CTAB:CTAC surfactant in the mole ratio of 1:2 (B1C2-PCH) were also investigated. The elongation at break of the blends reached 38%, which was eight times that of neat PLA. The cryo-fractured surface demonstrated the interfacial adhesion caused by the interaction of the epoxy group of the reactive compatibilizer with the terminal carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of PLA and PBAT. Moreover, PBAT reduced the crystallization rate and percent crystallinity of the PLA matrix and further decreased when compatibilizer was used. Alternatively, B1C2-PCH accelerated the heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of the nanocomposite films. After adding small amount of B1C2-PCH, the nanocomposite films demonstrated excellent dielectric properties.

The major surface proteins (MSPs), encoded by msp1 to msp5 genes of Anaplasma marginale, play an important role in host-pathogen and tick-pathogen interactions. These markers have been used for genetic characterization and phylogenetic studies. Despite domestic reports concerning suspected outbreaks of anaplasmosis in Thailand, genetic analysis of A. marginale in the country remains largely limited. Therefore, we aim to investigate the infection rate of the rickettsia organism in the Anaplasmataceae family throughout five regions of Thailand and to further characterize the key genetic markers: msp1a, msp2, and msp5 of A. marginale. From 2016 to 2021, we collected a total of 384 cattle blood samples across 18 provinces. Overall, the infection rate of the rickettsia organism in the Anaplasmataceae family was 46.1%. Over 65% of the positive samples were confirmed as A. marginale. We successfully obtained a total of 138 A. marginale msp1a (38), msp2 (79), and msp5 (21) sequences from all regions of the country. The msp1a and msp2 genes exhibit a high degree of genetic diversity, while the msp5 gene is highly conserved among the Thai isolates. Our findings regarding msp1a corroborated the genetic heterogeneity of A. marginale strains in endemic regions worldwide. Additionally, we found multiple novel variants for the first time in the current nationwide survey. We found 45 tandem repeat characters of the msp1a sequence. Among them, 24 characters were not shared with other countries. Collectively, we expanded the extent of genetic diversity in key markers; msp1a and msp2 genes, and further confirmed the previous finding that msp5 was highly conserved. The msp1a and msp2 genes could be useful for the surveillance of newly introduced strains. The current data may also be useful in designing a vaccine containing potential epitopes of different antigens in the future.","Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Microbiology, Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

Results: For the detection of anti-dsDNA antibody, ELISA had a substantial agreement with CLIF (κ = 0.74) but LIA had a fair agreement with ELISA and CLIF (κ = 0.37, and 0.35 respectively). For the detection of anti-nucleosome, anti-nRNP/Sm, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies, LIA had a substantial to perfect agreement with ELISA (κ = 0.64, 0.78, 0.68, 0.91, and 0.74, respectively). Anti-dsDNA-NcX ELISA and anti-dsDNA CLIF had equally diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 66% vs. 68%, and specificity, 96% vs. 94%, respectively) whereas, anti-dsDNA LIA has low sensitivity (22%) but high specificity (100%). Conclusion: LIA, ELISA, and CLIF demonstrated comparable performance for the detection of specific antinuclear-antibodies. However, there were some discrepancy between assays particularly in the detection of anti-dsDNA antibody.",medical,Medicine (all)
Immunosuppressive Polymeric Nanoparticles Targeting Dendritic Cells Alleviate Lupus Disease in Fcgr2b-/- Mice by Mediating Antigen-Specific Immune Tolerance,"Khiewkamrop P., Kaewraemruaen C., Manipuntee C., Saengruengrit C., Insin N., Leelahavanichkul A., Kaewduangduen W., Sonpoung O., Ariya-anandech K., Hirankarn N., Ritprajak P.",2023-05-01,"Animals, Antigens, Dendritic Cells, Dexamethasone, Immune Tolerance, Immunosuppressive Agents, Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic, Mice, Nanoparticles, Receptors, IgG, dexamethasone, immune tolerance, lupus disease, PDMAEMA-PLGA nanoparticles, tolerogenic dendritic cells","Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells that have multifaceted functions in the control of immune activation and tolerance. Hyperresponsiveness and altered tolerogenicity of DCs contribute to the development and pathogenesis of system lupus erythematosus (SLE); therefore, DC-targeted therapies aimed at inducing specific immune tolerance have become of great importance for the treatment of SLE. This study developed a new nanoparticle (NP) containing a biodegradable PDMAEMA-PLGA copolymer for target-oriented delivery to DCs in situ. PDMAEMA-PLGA NPs provided sustained drug release and exhibited immunosuppressive activity in FLT3L and GM-CSF-derived bone marrow in conventional DCs (BM-cDCs). PDMAEMA-PLGA NPs improved dexamethasone capability to convert wild-type and Fcgr2b-/- BM-cDCs from an immunogenic to tolerogenic state, and BM-cDCs treated with dexamethasone-incorporated PDMAEMA-PLGA NPs (Dex-NPs) efficiently mediated regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion in vitro. Dex-NP therapy potentially alleviated lupus disease in Fcgr2b-/- mice by mediating Foxp3+ Treg expansion in an antigen-specific manner. Our findings substantiate the superior efficacy of DC-targeted therapy using the PDMAEMA-PLGA NP delivery system and provide further support for clinical development as a potential therapy for SLE. Furthermore, PDMAEMA-PLGA NP may be a versatile platform for DC-targeted therapy to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance to unwanted immune responses that occur in autoimmune disease, allergy, and transplant rejection.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Formal teaching, learning, and examination were also affected. The online learning assessment system is a highly complex system because it must be able to handle a mass of students taking exams simultaneously, especially during the midterm and the final exam week. Therefore, the system must have an acceptable response time and high reliability. Our assessment system had been developed utilizing MySQL as a database, but the response time was unsatisfactory for actual usage. This paper proposes methods to improve the system's efficiency during high traffic by utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) DynamoDB as a cache of MySQL since it has a higher read-and-write efficiency than MySQL database. The read operation will be conducted in the Viewing exam session operation. At the same time, the write policy used for Managing exam sessions is write-through, while the policy for Saving examinees' answers is write-back. Choosing between write-through and write-back policies should take into account the acceptable response time and required instant consistency validation. The evaluation results with JMeter reveal that the method can double the efficiency of the read operation. On the other hand, the write operation is less than 3 seconds, which is still within an acceptable limit. For improving the DynamoDB efficiency, further suggestions have also been given in this paper.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

Asiatic acid (AA), an active compound in Centella asiatica L, exhibit neuroprotective properties in previous studies. Due to its low bioavailability, the nose-to-brain delivery technique was used to enhance AA penetration in the brain. In this study, AA was also loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a strategy to increase its absorption in the nasal cavity. Methods: Memory impairment was induced via direct intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 oligomer into mouse brain. The neuroprotective effect and potential underlying mechanisms were investigated using several memory behavioral examinations and molecular techniques. Results: The intranasal administration of AA in SLNs attenuated learning and memory impairment induced by Aβ1-42 in Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. AA significantly inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation of pTau-S396 and pTau-T231 and prevented astrocyte reactivity and microglial activation in the hippocampus of Aβ1-42-treated mice. It is also decreased the high levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse brain. Conclusions: These results suggested that nose-to-brain delivery of AA in SLNs could be a promising strategy to treat the early stage of AD.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Here, the cellular polyglucan content was determined in 27 cyanobacterial strains from 25 genera. The polyglucan contents were significantly enhanced in 20 and 23 strains under nitrogen (–N) and phosphate (–P) deprivation, respectively. High polyglucan accumulation was not associated with particular evolutionary groups but was strain specific. The highest polyglucan accumulations of 46.2% and 52.5% (w/w dry weight; DW) were obtained under –N in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) and Chroococcus limneticus, respectively. In Synechocystis, 80–97% (w/w) of the polyglucan was glycogen. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses during glycogen accumulation under –N were determined in Synechocystis. The genes responsible for the supply of the substrates for glycogen synthesis: glycerate-1,3-phosphate and fructose-1,6-phosphate, were significantly up-regulated. The genes encoding the enzymes converting succinate to malate in TCA cycle, were significantly down-regulated. The genes encoding the regulator proteins which inhibits metabolism at lower part of glycolysis pathway, were also significantly up-regulated. The transcript levels of PII protein and the level of 2-oxoglutarate, which form a complex that inhibits lower part of glycolysis pathway, were significantly increased. Thus, the increased Synechocystis glycogen accumulation under –N was likely to be mediated by the increased supply of glycogen synthesis substrates and metabolic inhibitions at lower part of glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Physiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing recycled FM fibers in cement mortar. For this, FMs were used by removing the inner nose wires and ear loops and cutting them into two different sizes: 10 mm × 5 mm and 20 mm × 5 mm. The FMs were then introduced into five mixtures at 0 (control), 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 % by volume. The following mechanical properties of the mixtures were then tested: workability, density, porosity, water absorption, and the related strengths (compressive, direct tensile, and flexural). In addition, the microstructures of the mixtures were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that introducing FM fibers, particularly an FM with a 5 mm diameter and 10 mm length, in the mortar increased both the tensile and flexural strengths. Among the various combinations of FMs studied, a mixture containing 0.15 % FMs exhibited the best performance. The findings of this research reveal that FMs can be reused as fibers to enhance the tensile and flexural strengths of cement mortar.","mixing and separation, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

Golden Syrian hamsters are mostly used to study acute leptospirosis. However, the immunopathogenic mechanism is poorly understood because immunological reagents for hamsters are limited. This study aimed to establish C3H/HeNJ mice as an animal model for leptospirosis. Five-week-old C3H/HeNJ mice were infected with either low (103 cells) or high (106 cells) inoculum dose of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. All mice were investigated for survival rate, leptospiral load and histopathology of target organs, antibody levels, and cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10) at day 28 post-infection. All infected mice survived and did not develop acute lethal infection. However, C3H/HeNJ mice infected with 106 cells of leptospires showed kidney colonization of leptospires and pathological changes in the lung and kidney including renal fibrosis. The glomerular size in PAS-D stained kidney tissues of C3H/HeNJ mice infected with 106 cells of leptospires was significantly reduced compared to that of mice infected with 103 cells of leptospires and non-infected mice. High-dose leptospires induced significantly greater levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 than low-dose leptospires, but IL-10 level was not significantly different. Moreover, 106 leptospiral cells induced predominant IgG2a isotype suggesting Th1-like response.

Histomorphometric analysis confirmed a decrease in cancellous bone volume due to increased osteoclast number and decreased osteoblast number. Primary osteoblasts showed decreased ALP and mineralization. Constitutive TβRI activation increased osteoclast differentiation. qPCR analysis showed that Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio, Ctsk, Sufu, and Csf1 were increased whereas Runx2, Ptch1, and Ptch2 were decreased in Mx1;TβRICA femurs. Interestingly, Gli1, Wnt3a, Sp7, Alpl, Ptch1, Ptch2, and Shh mRNA expression were reduced whereas Tnfsf11/Tnfrsf11b ratio was increased in Mx1;TβRICA mandibles.

Methods: We assessed constipation in patients across 22 facilities participating in the Thailand Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS) from 2014 to 2017. Constipation diagnosis utilized objective assessment tools such as the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) and a self-reported questionnaire known as the constipation severity score (CSS). The BSFS is a 7-level scale that visually inspects feces based on texture and morphology, while the CSS measures constipation duration and severity using a 5-point Likert scale for various factors. We employed Cox proportional hazards model regression to determine the associations between constipation and clinical outcomes, including mortality, hemodialysis (HD) transfer and peritonitis. Results: Among 975 randomly selected PD patients from 22 facilities, 845 provided written informed consent, and 729 completed CSS questionnaire.

Twenty-seven percent of which experiencing symptoms of constipation for over a year. Notably, self-reported constipation at baseline was significantly associated with a shorter time to first peritonitis and higher rates of peritonitis and death. However, no significant association was found between constipation and HD transfer after adjusting for various factors, including age, gender, PD vintage, comorbidities, shared frailty by study sites and serum albumin. Conclusion: Patient-reported constipation independently correlated with increased risks of peritonitis and all-cause mortality, though no such correlation was observed with HD transfer.

Poor adherence to treatment is extremely common in clinical practice, leading to uncontrolled hypertension. However, some patients with resistant hypertension still have uncontrolled blood pressure despite good medical compliance. A specific group of patients also develop adverse reactions to many blood pressure-lowering medications. These scenarios indicate that innovative strategies to lower blood pressure in challenging cases of hypertension are needed. The blood pressure-lowering efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation therapy to decrease sympathetic tone has been confirmed in many publications in recent years. Apart from both the invasiveness and the expensiveness of this technology, appropriate case selection to undergo this procedure is still developing. The utilization of renal denervation therapy for hypertension treatment in Thailand has lasted for 10 years with a good response in most cases. Currently, only certain interventionists at a few medical schools in Thailand can perform this procedure. However, more physicians are now interested in applying this technology to their patients. The Thai Hypertension Society Committee has reviewed updated information to provide principles for the appropriate utilization of renal denervation therapy.

"Possible role of Lipoptena fortisetosa (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) as a potential vector for Theileria spp. in captive Eld's deer in Khao Kheow open zoo, Thailand","Tiawsirisup S., Yurayart N., Thongmeesee K., Sri-in C., Akarapas C., Rittisornthanoo G., Bunphungbaramee N., Sipraya N., Maikaew U., Kongmakee P., Saedan A.",2023-01-01,"Animals, Babesia, Deer, Diptera, Disease Vectors, Humans, Phylogeny, Thailand, Theileria, Deer ked, Eld's deer, Lipoptena fortisetosa, Thailand, Theileria, Vector","Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii thamin) is an endangered species endemic to South Asia. Various ectoparasites (hematophagous insects and ticks) and blood parasites (e.g., piroplasms such as Babesia and Theileria) have been reported in this deer. Deer keds of the genus Lipoptena (L.) are wingless hematophagous insects acting as ectoparasites and potential vectors, thereby transmitting diseases to animals and humans. Many Lipoptena species have been reported, including L. fortisetosa; the latter may be a potential vector of several pathogens such as Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. However, the available data regarding Lipoptena in domestic animals and wildlife in Thailand is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of L. fortisetosa in Eld's deer as well as the role of this insect as a disease vector in Thailand by employing molecular analysis. A total of 91 wingless insects were collected and morphologically identified as L. fortisetosa. A partial fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was amplified and successfully sequenced from twelve insects, and the COI nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool results revealed a 94.28%−94.45% identity to L. fortisetosa (accession number: OL850869/China). The undertaken phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. fortisetosa samples from Thailand belong to a clade that is distinct from the previously deposited (in GenBank®) L. fortisetosa. As far as the pathogen detection is concerned, 46.2% (42/91) of the deer keds were positive for Theileria, while no Lipoptena was found to be positive for Babesia. Twenty-one sequences of Theileria were obtained and exhibited a 98.84%−100% identity to the Theileria sp. from several hosts. The phylogenetic analysis of Theileria revealed that Theileria capreoli and Theileria cervi were present in our L. fortisetosa samples. It can be implied that L. fortisetosa may serve as a vector of Theileria spp. in the Eld's deers of Thailand. We believe that the particular open zoo (from where the sampling took place) should implement preventive and control strategies for deer keds, other vectors, and vector-borne diseases.","geobase; related topics, Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"

The effects of plasma treatment time (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 s) on tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EAB), colour, water vapour permeability (WVP), oxygen transmission rate (OTR), contact angle and antimicrobial activity of films were investigated. Depending on the plasma treatment time, the TS values of plasma-treated film increased, but there were no significant differences between the EAB of control and treated films. The formation of the oxygen-containing groups and the occurrence of etching affected the WVP, contact angle, roughness and antimicrobial activity of plasma-treated film. Chitosan film treated with 60 s of DBD plasma had good OTR (<0.05 cc m−2 day−1), hydrophilicity and antimicrobial activity against various kinds of bacteria. However, it may need longer than 60 s of the treatment time to increase the WVP of the films. Overall, these results implied that plasma treatment can be used as an alternative non-thermal approach for improving the characteristics of film packaging.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, engineering","Food Science, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

One of the key challenges in speech emotion recognition is to extract the emotional features effectively from a speech utterance. Despite the promising results of recent studies, they generally do not leverage advanced fusion algorithms for the generation of effective representations of emotional features in speech utterances. To address this problem, we describe the fusion of spatial and temporal feature representations of speech emotion by parallelizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a Transformer encoder for SER. We stack two parallel CNNs for spatial feature representation in parallel to a Transformer encoder for temporal feature representation, thereby simultaneously expanding the filter depth and reducing the feature map with an expressive hierarchical feature representation at a lower computational cost. We use the RAVDESS dataset to recognize eight different speech emotions. We augment and intensify the variations in the dataset to minimize model overfitting. Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is used to augment the RAVDESS dataset. With the spatial and sequential feature representations of CNNs and the Transformer, the SER model achieves 82.31% accuracy for eight emotions on a hold-out dataset. In addition, the SER system is evaluated with the IEMOCAP dataset and achieves 79.42% recognition accuracy for five emotions. Experimental results on the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets show the success of the presented SER system and demonstrate an absolute performance improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Moreover, this study examined that the factors influence the adsorption process, such as catalyst concentration, pH and temperature, using kinetic models. Additionally, the composite characterization was achieved by several analysis, such as UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis and field effect scanning electron microscopy. The study shown that the optimized concentration of PS-CSNC catalyst (3.0 g L−1), below neutral pH (6.5) of the solution and temperature 60 °C achieved excellent removal of both dyes. Initial sorption process involved the removal mechanism of both RhB and MG followed by photocatalytic adsorption. The process of adsorption was well adapted with pseudo second-order kinetics.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and outcomes of influenza-related neurological complications among hospitalized children. Methods: All medical records of hospitalized children aged <18 years old diagnosed with influenza at a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok were retrospectively reviewed. Influenza infection was confirmed by rapid antigen or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Neurological characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale. Results: From 2013 to 2018, 397 hospitalized children with a median age of 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.6–6.9) were included. The prevalence of neurological complications, including seizure or acute encephalopathy, was 16.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.3–20.9). Influenza A and B were identified in 73.1% and 26.9% of the patients, respectively. Among 39 (58.2%) acute symptomatic seizure cases, 25 (37.3%) children had simple febrile seizures, 7 (10.4%) had repetitive seizures, and 7 (10.4%) had provoked seizures with pre-existing epilepsy. For 28 (41.8%) encephalopathy cases, the clinical courses were benign in 20 (29.9%) cases and severe in 8 (11.9%) cases. Ten (14.9%) children needed intensive care monitoring, and 62 (93.5%) fully recovered to their baselines at hospital discharge.

However, the commercialization of Zn anodes is hindered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and water-induced side reactions. Herein, a spontaneous reconstruction of a honeycomb-structural hopeite layer (ZPO) on a Zn metal anode (Zn@ZPO) is rationally developed as a functional protection interface by the liquid-phase deposition strategy. The formed ZPO layer not only promotes ion/charge transport and restrains Zn corrosion but also modulates the preferred deposition orientation of the Zn(002) nanosheet for the dendrite-free Zn anode. Accordingly, the Zn@ZPO symmetric cell exhibits satisfactory cycle lifespans of 1500 h at 1 mA·cm-2/1 mAh·cm-2 and 1400 h at 5 mA m-2/1 mAh·cm-2. When assembled with the (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O (NVO) cathode, the Zn@ZPO||NVO full cell delivers an ultrastable cycling lifespan for 25 000 cycles with a discharge capacity retention of 86.6% at 5 A·g-1.

Therefore, exploring catalysts exhibiting strong H2O adsorption energy (Eads) is crucial. Also, high-entropy alloys (HEA) are promising materials utilized as catalysts, including in WGSR. The PtPd-based HEA catalysts are explored via density functional theory (DFT) and Gaussian process regression. The input features are based on the microstructure data and electronic properties: d-band center (εd) and Bader net atomic charge (δ). The DFT calculation reveals that the εd and δ of each active site of all HEA surfaces are broadly scattered, indicating that the electronic properties of each atom on HEA are non-uniform and influenced by neighboring atoms. The strong H2O-active-site interaction determined by a highly negative Eads is used as a criterion to explore good PtPd-based WGSR catalyst candidates.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare preoperative NLR of uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) with leiomyoma and secondary objective aimed to identify the clinical characteristics to distinguish between uterine LMS and uterine leiomyoma including the appropriate NLR cut off value to differentiate LMS from leiomyoma. Methods: This was a matched case-controlled study with 1:4 ratio. We collected data of patients with uterine LMS and leiomyoma from 2011 to 2020 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Patients with uterine LMS (case group) and leiomyoma (control group) were matched in terms of year of the surgery and size of the uterine mass. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22.0 and STATA version 17. Conditional logistic regression analysis with a p-value of <0.05 was used. Results: Twenty-seven patients who were diagnosed with uterine LMS met the inclusion criteria; 13 patients who had incomplete data and one patient who was had concurrent breast cancer were excluded. Thirteen patients were included in the final analysis. From 2,587 patients in control group; 52 patients were matched. The baseline characteristics in both groups were comparable except for menopausal status Women with uterine LMS had a higher NLR than those with leiomyoma (mean, 4.56 ± 2.5 and 2.4 ± 1.15 in the case and control groups, respectively). Conditional logistic regression determined that the NLR cut-off value of 2.8 was a statistically significant factor for determining uterine LMS (OR = 3.24; 95% CI 1.01–10.43). No significant difference was found in the other factors. Conclusions: Patients who were diagnosed with uterine LMS had a significantly higher NLR than those diagnosed with leiomyoma. The NLR is a simple and effective method for predicting the presence of a uterine LMS in patients who are pre-operatively diagnosed with a uterine mass.","medical, biochemistryistry","Epidemiology, Oncology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Cancer Research"

Researchers have sought to recover dropout information using various techniques to address this issue. Nevertheless, determining the optimal method requires a benchmarking process. Although some benchmarking results have been reported, reproducing them can be challenging due to the multiple factors involved.

Increased serum levels of neurofilament protein (NFP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) are biomarkers of neuronal injury. This investigation delineates whether elevated IgA/IgG reactivity against those self-antigens is associated with delirium severity and IRS activation. Methods: We measured peak Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) scores on days 2 and 3 following surgery in 59 hip fractured older adults, and IgA and IgG antibody levels against MBP, NFP, GFAP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluRs 1 and 5, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GLU1 (NR1) and GLU2 (NR2), APQ4 and HSP60. Results: The IgA antibody levels against those self-antigens, especially GFAP, MBP and HSP60, strongly predict peak DRS scores on days 2 and 3 post-surgery. IgA reactivity against NMDAR and baseline DRS scores explained 40.6% of the variance in peak DRS scores, while IgA against NMDAR, IgG against MBP and age explained 29.1% of the variance in the IRS/CIRS ratio. There was no correlation between DRS scores and IgG directed against other self-antigens. Conclusions: Increased IgA levels against neuronal self-antigens, AQP4 and HSP60 are risk factors for delirium. Polyreactive antibody-associated breakdown of immune tolerance, IRS activation and injuries in the neuronal cytoskeleton, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, glial cells, and myelin sheath are involved in the pathophysiology of delirium.","Nursing, medical","Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

However, the utilization of PDAs for sensing ultraviolet-B light (UVB) is rare. This contribution introduces a facile method for enhancing the UVB-responsive property of PDAs by incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO) quantum dots (QDs). We explore the size effects of ZnO QDs/nanoparticles and diacetylene (DA) monomers on the sensitivity of the resultant nanocomposites to UVB light. Interestingly, the sensitivity of nanocomposites to UV light with different wavelengths can be controlled by adjusting the size of ZnO nanoparticles. We have found that the incorporation of ZnO QDs with diameters ranging from 2.2 to 3.8 nm drastically increases the sensitivity to UVB light. In addition, fine-tuning of the UVB sensitivity can be achieved by varying alkyl chain lengths of the DA monomers. The colorimetric response of nanocomposites to specific UVB regions can be obtained by adjusting the band gap of ZnO QDs. This property allows their utilization as colorimetric sensors for detecting UVB doses in sunlight and other sources. Colorimetric UVB sensors can be fabricated in different forms including smart ink sensors, free-standing flexible sensors, paper-based sensors, and hydrogel-based sensors.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

In this work, a feasibility study for installing a neutral beam injection (NBI) heating system in TT-1 is carried out. This work is motivated to characterize beam ion's orbits in different injection angles and to explore a condition suitable in terms of higher heating efficiency. In this work, we assume that a hydrogen beam will be launched into the TT-1 plasma with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. The orbit simulations using the gyromotion following code LORBIT are performed in various magnetic field equilibria, i.e., different plasma current (Ip), toroidal magnetic field strength (Bt), and the magnetic axis (Rax). Furthermore, beam ions are injected in different directions, i.e., tangential co-injection and tangential counter-injection. In the case of co-injection, beam ion loss is not significant, by about 6%, whereas beam ion loss fraction is evaluated to be 26–34% in the case of counter-injection. Also, it is found that the number of lost beam ions is significantly affected by changing Ip and Rax.

This study aimed to assess the processability of the solid and structurally porous scaffolds of Ta through laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) AM. It will further characterize and evaluate microstructure of LPBF processed Ta, with emphasis on assessing the mechanism of the process-induced defects. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and microstructural investigation confirmed the presence of BCC Ta phase containing columnar, equiaxed and fine grains with roughness between 3.88 nm to 10.40 nm. The presence of oxygen resulted in the formation of some oxide phases such as Ta2O5 and Ta2O3. Numerous process-induced defects, including solidification-induced micropores, pores-induced and solidification-induced microcracks were identified. The dislodge unmelted or partially fused Ta powder resulted in other form of defects including micro-concaves and microgrooves.

Three different membrane bioreactor systems — R1: AnBB-MBR (without microaeration); R2: AnBB-MBR with microaeration; and R3: AnBB-MBR with integrated microaeration and sludge recirculation — were operated in parallel at the same hydraulic retention time of 20 h and sludge retention time of 100 d. The microaeration promoted greater microbial richness and diversity, which could significantly enhance the removal of acetic acid and dissolved methane in the R2 and R3 systems. Moreover, the partial nitrification and the ability of anammox (Candidatus Brocadia) to thrive in R2 enabled NH4+-N removal to be enhanced by up to 57.8 %. The worst membrane fouling was found in R1 due to high amount of protein as well as fine particles (0.5–5.0 μm) acting as foulants that contributed to pore blocking. While the integration of sludge recirculation with microaeration in R3 was able to improve the membrane permeate flux slightly as compared to R2. Therefore, the AnBB-MBR integrated with a microaeration system (R2) can be considered as promising technology for building wastewater treatment when considering VFA and nutrient removal and an energy-saving approach with low aeration intensity.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Therefore, deep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing approaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying the locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for refining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to inconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality of the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions between the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network (ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the aforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was used to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the detection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep learning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data selection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce the mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two large-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8% percentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and 44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction. Techniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object detection pipeline and should contribute to improving the performances of deep learning models in broad digital pathology applications.","process equipment, medical, computer science","Medicine (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence"
Estimation of premature death attributed to short- and long-term PM2.5 exposure in Thailand,"Hermayurisca F., Taneepanichskul N.",2023-10-01,"Air Q+, Gold standards, Health impact, Health impact assessment, Pm2.5, PM2.5 concentration, Premature death, Premature mortality, Thailand, World Health Organization, Air pollution, Air Q+, Health impact assessment, PM2.5, Premature mortality, Thailand","Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) has been identified as a global health concern in recent decades. Indeed, PM2.5 exposure causes detrimental health problems in the general population. Estimating the short- and long-term health impacts of PM2.5 exposure should help to shape public health policy concerning air pollution. Hence, this study sought to estimate the rate of premature death attributable to PM2.5 exposure among the Thai population if the PM2.5 concentration met the applied counterfactual factor. The PM2.5 concentration, population numbers, and numbers of health incidences were collected from secondary data sources in 2019. A health impact analysis was performed using AirQ+ software to estimate the incidences of premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 exposure. More specifically, the analysis provided the estimated proportion of attributable cases and the rate of premature death per 100,000 population aged ≥ 30 years. The annual average PM2.5 concentration in Thailand was found to be 24.15 µg per cubic meter (μg/m3) in 2019, while the natural mortality rate was around 1,107 per 100,000 population nationwide. With regard to short-term PM2.5 exposure, it was determined that 8 premature deaths per 100,000 population could be prevented if the PM2.5 concentration met the World Health Organization (WHO) short-term gold standard of 15 μg/m3. Moreover, 159 premature deaths per 100,000 population could be avoided if the PM2.5 concentration met the WHO’s long-term gold standard of 5 μg/m3. This estimation of premature deaths due to the short- and long-term impacts of PM2.5 exposure can support policymakers and stakeholders in creating a roadmap to combating the adverse impacts of PM2.5 exposure and protect the health of the Thai population.","air pollution, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Science (all), Pollution, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"
Clinical Evaluation of Toothbrushes for Elderly Patients: A Crossover Study,"Nitipong V., Laiteerapong A., Lochaiwatana Y., Arunyanak S.P.",2023-02-01,"Aged, Cross-Over Studies, Dental Plaque, Dental Plaque Index, Equipment Design, Female, Gingivitis, Humans, Inflammation, Male, Middle Aged, Periodontal Index, Single-Blind Method, Sodium Fluoride, Toothbrushing, Crossover design, Elderly, Gingivitis, Plaque, Toothbrush","Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 newly designed toothbrushes used by elderly individuals based on plaque removal and gingival inflammation reduction compared with 2 commercially available toothbrushes. Materials and methods: This was a randomised, controlled, single-blind, 4-period crossover clinical trial. Thirty elderly participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated into 4 groups, which determined the sequence of the 4 toothbrushes: CUdent/extra soft, CUdent/soft, GoodAge, and Colgate. The participants’ baseline bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index (PI) were assessed by one blinded calibrated examiner, then their teeth were professionally cleaned. The participants were assigned to use the tested toothbrush and were recalled for postbrushing examination 2 weeks later to evaluate their BOP and PI. At the end of each test period, the participants used their own toothbrush during the 2-week washout period before using the next tested toothbrush. Results: The mean age of the 30 participants was 63.2 years. The mean baseline BOP score was 44.4%, and mean baseline PI was 2.7. Three participants dropped out; thus, 27 participants (15 females and 12 males) provided data throughout the study period. The participant characteristics and baseline data between the groups were similar. CUdent/extra soft and CUdent/soft demonstrated significantly better PI scores at the buccal surfaces than GoodAge (P < .05). CUdent/soft had the lowest PI scores and Colgate presented the lowest BOP score in every comparison for other areas; however, the differences were not significant. No signs of tissue trauma or abrasion were observed. Conclusions: The newly designed toothbrushes were comparable to the commercially available toothbrushes in plaque removal efficacy and reducing gingival inflammation. CUdent/extra soft and soft were significantly more effective in plaque removal in the buccal regions than GoodAge.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The first objective is to propose a practical prediction of the attenuation rate of vibration for risk management of the monuments located along roadsides in the city. The attenuation of vibration waves traveling from traffic sources and the intensity of ground vibrations were determined by in situ vibration measurement. The results from the investigations in the Ayutthaya area were compared with those obtained from other sites having different characteristics of subsoil classified by the average shear wave velocity (Vs). It was found that the attenuation rates at a long distance from the source tend to be dependent on soil property in terms of Vs of subsoils. The attenuation curves derived from the regression analysis are proposed for risk management from the vibration of the heritage site. The second objective is to assess the effects of traffic vibrations on historic structures. The highest amplitude observed in Ayutthaya was within the recommended vibration criteria for historic buildings. In addition, finite element analysis of a 3D stupa model revealed that the stresses resulting from the ground vibration records induced by traffic was lower than the strength of ancient brick and mortar.",arts,Conservation

Generally, wastewater treatment involves filtration followed by acidified de-emulsification through photocatalytic reduction. The aim of the present study is to reduce the use of nanoparticles in wastewater treatment and also to find an appropriate alternative to replace cotton fiber filters used in water treatment plant. The cotton fiber filters are highly prone to bacterial film development leading to bactericidal degradation of the fibers. We developed a ZnO-chitosan nanocomposite coated fiber for wastewater treatment to enhance its photocatalytic activity under acidic condition. The fiber showed high degree of photocatalytic degradation activity, reducing rhodamine B dye, chemical oxygen demand and chromium levels in the synthetic wastewater to 37, 79 and 51% respectively under highly acidic condition. Additionally, ZnO-chitosan nanocomposite did not cause mortality on Danio rerio embryo after 72 h incubation. The ZnO-chitosan nanocomposite coated fiber showed strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a reduction of 96% and 99% respectively.

The diagnosis of MAS is challenging, requiring the expertise of multiple specialists, and treatments for MAS can be associated with catastrophic complications. Clinical features: We describe the case of a 31-yr-old Vietnamese student who was diagnosed with cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in November 2020 and was initiated on treatment with low-dose corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine as an outpatient. Ten days later, she presented to hospital with decreased consciousness, fever, periorbital swelling, and hypotension necessitating intubation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and lumbar puncture did not show a stroke or central nervous system infection. Serology and clinical presentation were consistent with MAS. She was initially treated with 4.5 g pulse methylprednisolone and subsequently with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, and maintenance corticosteroids because of persistently elevated inflammatory markers. Her intensive care unit stay was complicated by aspiration, airway obstruction due to fungal tracheobronchitis necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and ring-enhancing cerebral lesions, and, ultimately, massive hemoptysis resulting in death. Conclusions: Four features of this case merit discussion, including the: 1) infrequent association of SLE with MAS; 2) short interval between SLE diagnosis and critical illness; 3) manifestation of fungal tracheobronchitis with airway obstruction; and 4) lack of response to antifungal treatment while receiving ECMO.",medical,Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine

In this study, we aimed to present our multicenter series of MEC and SMECE and integrated our data with published literature to further investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of these tumors. We found 2 MECs and 4 SMECEs in our multicenter archives. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the MAML2 gene rearrangement. We screened for mutations in BRAF, TERT promoter, and RAS mutations using Sanger sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction. Histopathologically, MECs and SMECEs were composed of two main cell types including epidermoid and mucin-secreting cells, arranged in cords, nests, and tubules. SMECEs were characterized by a densely sclerotic stroma with abundant eosinophils. We did not detect any MAML2 fusion in any of our cases. Two MEC cases harbored concomitant BRAF p.V600E and TERT C228T mutations. RAS mutations were absent in all cases. Concurrent foci of another thyroid malignancy were more commonly seen in MECs (p < 0.001), whereas SMECEs were associated with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (p < 0.001). MECs and SMECEs had equivalent recurrence-free survival (RFS) but MECs conferred significantly dismal disease-specific survival (DSS) as compared to SMECEs (p = 0.007). In conclusion, MECs and SMECEs not only shared some similarities but also demonstrated differences in clinicopathological characteristics, prognoses, and molecular profiles. SMECEs had a superior DSS in comparison to MECs, suggesting that they are low-grade cancers. This could help clinicians better evaluate patient outcomes and decide appropriate treatment plans.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"
Anxiety-like behavior and GABAergic system in ovariectomized rats exposed to chronic mild stress,"Tongta S., Daendee S., Kalandakanond-Thongsong S.",2023-01-01,"Animals, Anxiety, Behavior, Animal, Disease Models, Animal, Estrogens, Female, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Rats, RNA, Messenger, Stress, Psychological, Anxiety-like behavior, Chronic mild stress, Depressive-like behavior, Estrogen, GABAergic system","Stress or low level of estrogen could promote anxiety and depression; thus, it is of interest to investigate the combined effect of mild stress and the lack of estrogen on mental disorders by utilizing an animal model. This study was conducted to assess anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) and determine the alteration in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related transmission. Ovx rats were randomly assigned into four groups: (1) estrogen replacement (E2-NoCMS), (2) estrogen replacement and exposure to CMS (E2-CMS), (3) vehicle (VEH-NoCMS), and (4) vehicle and exposure to CMS (VEH-CMS). Following 4-week CMS, VEH groups (VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS) showed a similar level of anxiety-like behavior in elevated T-maze, whereas E2-CMS, VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS showed anxiety-like behavior in open field. The depressive-like behavior in the force swimming test tended to be affected by estrogen deprivation than CMS. The alteration of the GABAergic system as determined from the GABA level and mRNA expression of GABA-related transmission (i.e., glutamic acid decarboxylase, GABA transporter and GABAA subunits) showed that the GABA level in the amygdala and frontal cortex was affected by CMS. For mRNA expression, the mRNA profile in the amygdala and hippocampus of VEH-NoCMS and E2-CMS was the same but different from those of VEH-NoCMS and E2-CMS. In addition, compared with E2-NoCMS, the mRNA profile in the frontal cortex was similar in VEH-NoCMS, E2-CMS, and VEH-CMS. These findings indicated that the underlying mechanism of the GABAergic system was differently modified, although VEH-NoCMS and VEH-CMS showed anxiety-like behavior. The findings of this study may provide a comprehensive understanding of the modulation of the GABAergic system during estrogen deprivation under CMS, as observed in menopausal women who were daily exposed to stress.","psychology, neuroscience","Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience"
Accuracy of Intra-Oral Radiography and Cone Beam Computed Tomography in the Diagnosis of Buccal Bone Loss,"Christiaens V., Pauwels R., Mowafey B., Jacobs R.",2023-08-01,"'Dry' [, Bone defect, Bone loss, Buccal bone level, Computed tomography scan, Cone-beam computed tomography, Dental practice, Diagnostics tools, Intra-oral radiography, Treatment planning, buccal bone level, cone beam CT, diagnosis, intra-oral radiography","Background: The use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in dentistry started in the maxillofacial field, where it was used for complex and comprehensive treatment planning. Due to the use of reduced radiation dose compared to a computed tomography (CT) scan, CBCT has become a frequently used diagnostic tool in dental practice. However, published data on the accuracy of CBCT in the diagnosis of buccal bone level is lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of intra-oral radiography (IOR) and CBCT in the diagnosis of the extent of buccal bone loss. Methods: A dry skull was used to create a buccal bone defect at the most coronal level of a first premolar; the defect was enlarged apically in steps of 1 mm. After each step, IOR and CBCT were taken. Based on the CBCT data, two observers jointly selected three axial slices at different levels of the buccal bone, as well as one transverse slice. Six dentists participated in the radiographic observations. First, all observers received the 10 intra-oral radiographs, and each observer was asked to rank the intra-oral radiographs on the extent of the buccal bone defect. Afterwards, the procedure was repeated with the CBCT scans based on a combination of axial and transverse information. For the second part of the study, each observer was asked to evaluate the axial and transverse CBCT slices on the presence or absence of a buccal bone defect. Results: The percentage of buccal bone defect progression rankings that were within 1 of the true rank was 32% for IOR and 42% for CBCT. On average, kappa values increased by 0.384 for CBCT compared to intra-oral radiography. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CBCT in the diagnosis of the presence or absence of a buccal bone defect was 0.89 and 0.85, respectively. The average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) was 0.892 for all observers. Conclusion: When CBCT images are available for justified indications, other than bone level assessment, such 3D images are more accurate and thus preferred to 2D images to assess periodontal buccal bone. For other clinical applications, intra-oral radiography remains the standard method for radiographic evaluation.","fluidex; related topics, medical, computer science, engineering","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

In 2010, the major causes of hospital admissions and deaths in Thai adolescents were related to preventable causes, specifically engagement in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sexual intercourse, substance use and unsafe driving. We retrieved data from 1,761,667 adolescent (10–17 years) hospital admissions and 6362 deaths between 2015 and 2019 from the National Health Security Office database. Trends of hospital admissions and deaths, length of stay and medical expenses by sex, age: early (10–13 years) and middle adolescents (14–17 years), and geographical regions were analyzed by ICD-10 disease group and single diagnosis. Hospital admissions increased in relation to the same age population from 2015 to 2019. Trends of the top 3 diagnoses shifted between disease groups from 2015 to 2019. Pregnancy retreated from the first (17.8%) to the third rank (12.2%), and arthropod-borne viral fevers advanced from the third (13.1%) to the first rank (17.1%). Injury and poisoning remained at the second rank (14.5–14.4%). Females were admitted more than males, but males had significantly longer hospital stays. Early adolescents were admitted less than middle adolescents and their hospital stay was significantly shorter. Trends of the top 3 diagnoses for deaths by disease groups remained stable: injury and poisoning (41.2%), neoplasms (10.2%), and respiratory infections (9.5%). The average direct health care cost utilized on adolescent health care was 3813 million Baht (115.54 million US Dollars) per year. Considering the top 3 disease groups, injury and poisoning had the highest average cost per hospital admission and net cost per year consuming 26.4% of the total cost.

To date, however, there have been no descriptions of STAT6 gain-of-function variants leading to allergies in humans. Objective: We report a STAT6 gain-of-function variant associated with early-onset multiorgan allergies in a family with 3 affected members. Methods: Exome sequencing and immunophenotyping of T-helper cell subsets were conducted. The function of the STAT6 protein was analyzed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and luciferase assays. Gastric organoids obtained from the index patient were used to study downstream effector cytokines. Results: We identified a heterozygous missense variant (c.1129G>A;p.Glu377Lys) in the DNA binding domain of STAT6 that was de novo in the index patient's father and was inherited by 2 of his 3 children. Severe atopic dermatitis and food allergy were key presentations. Clinical heterogeneity was observed among the affected individuals. Higher levels of peripheral blood TH2 lymphocytes were detected. The mutant STAT6 displayed a strong preference for nuclear localization, increased DNA binding affinity, and spontaneous transcriptional activity. Moreover, gastric organoids showed constitutive activation of STAT6 downstream signaling molecules. Conclusions: A germline STAT6 gain-of-function variant results in spontaneous activation of the STAT6 signaling pathway and is associated with an early-onset and severe allergic phenotype in humans. These observations enhance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying allergic diseases and will potentially contribute to novel therapeutic interventions.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
A novel traffic load balancing approach for scheduling of optical transparent antennas (OTAs) on mobile terminals,"Raykar N., Khedkar G., Kaur M., Viriyasitavat W.",2023-11-01,"Advanced optical technology, Clusterings, Load-Balancing, Mobile terminal, Optical antennas, Optical technology, Optical transparent, Scheduling, Signal strengths, Traffic loads, Advanced optical technologies, Clustering, Load balancing, Optical antennas, Scheduling","Optical transparent antennas (OTAs) are a relatively new technology that allows for high-speed wireless communication using a transparent antenna placed on the surface of a mobile device. However, scheduling OTA transmissions can be challenging due to several factors that must be considered. One critical consideration when developing a scheduling plan for OTAs is bandwidth. OTA-based mobile terminals require a significant amount of bandwidth to transmit and receive data, which means it's essential to ensure that enough bandwidth is available for OTA transmissions. This can be achieved by monitoring network traffic patterns and allocating sufficient bandwidth for OTA transmissions. Another important factor to consider is the signal strength of OTA transmissions. The strength of these signals can be affected by factors such as weather conditions, interference from other sources, and the location of the mobile terminal. Scheduling of OTAs can be planned successfully when the signal strength is optimal to ensure that transmissions can take place without any hurdles. Developing a scheduling plan for OTAs in mobile terminals is a complicated process, requiring consideration of several factors. These include ensuring sufficient bandwidth for OTA transmissions due to their high bandwidth requirements, signal strength should be optimal and OTA usage should be minimal when battery levels are low to conserve power. Additionally, network congestion and user preferences should also be considered when scheduling the OTAs. The smart scheduling mechanisms are required to handle the mobile applications while handling OTAs on mobile terminals. This study is proposing a modified traffic load clustering (MTLC) scheduling mechanism for scheduling OTAs on mobile terminals. The proposed MTLC method offers better spectrum efficiency above 90%, time-slot utilization between 88 and 95%, and channel utilization between 80 and 90% during scheduling of optical antennas. It also optimizes the latency time, throughput, and outperforms other algorithms.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
In-situ transesterification of microalgae using carbon-based catalyst under pulsed microwave irradiation,"Kam Y.L., Agutaya J.K.C.N., Quitain A.T., Ogasawara Y., Sasaki M., Lam M.K., Yusup S., Assabumrungrat S., Kida T.",2023-01-01,"Carbon based catalysts, Fatty acids methyl esters, Graphene oxides, In-situ transesterification, Micro-algae, Microwave- irradiations, Pulsed microwaves, Situ transesterification, ]+ catalyst, Biodiesel, Graphene oxide, In-situ transesterification, Microalgae, Microwave","In the production of biofuels, microalgae represent an emerging class of renewable feedstock that can address the problems associated with the use of the traditional land-based lignocellulosic biomass. The high lipid content of microalgae makes them ideal in producing fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), the main components of biodiesel. In this study, the transesterification of the lipids in Chlorella vulgaris with methanol was performed in-situ using graphene oxide (GO) under microwave irradiation. From FTIR measurements and titration experiments, GO was shown to possess oxygen functional groups that can serve as catalysts in transesterification. Moreover, the catalytic performance of GO in terms of FAME yield was found to be better than conventional metal-based catalysts. Microwave irradiation, on the other hand, was found to offer a more efficient heating than conventional methods by taking advantage of the excellent microwave absorptivity of methanol and the local heating induced on the surface of GO. Furthermore, irradiation of microwave in pulses rather than in a continuous mode was shown to be more cost-effective. It is proposed that the high energy introduced into the biomass at short time intervals facilitated the release of more lipids by more effectively disrupting the algal cell wall. Lastly, operating with a methanol reflux allowed the microwave-irradiated system to be operated at the boiling point of methanol (Tb = 64.7 °C) while providing a higher FAME yield than an operation at 160 °C without reflux. This study presents graphene oxide under microwave irradiation as a green, carbon-based, and sustainable catalyst in the production of biodiesel from microalgae.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"

Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify effective therapeutic strategies that can improve patient outcomes. Flavonoids, such as quercetin and kaempferol, are naturally occurring compounds that have attracted significant attention for their potential in cancer therapy by targeting multiple genes. In this study, we employed network pharmacology and bioinformatic analysis to identify potential targets of quercetin and kaempferol. The results revealed that the target genes of these flavonoids were enriched in G2/M-related genes, and higher expression of G2/M signature genes was significantly associated with shorter survival in CCA patients. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using CCA cells demonstrated that quercetin or kaempferol induced cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Additionally, when combined with a Smac mimetic LCL-161, an IAP antagonist, quercetin or kaempferol synergistically induced RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis in CCA cells while sparing non-tumor cholangiocyte cells. These findings shed light on an innovative therapeutic combination of flavonoids, particularly quercetin and kaempferol, with Smac mimetics, suggesting great promise as a necroptosis-based approach for treating CCA and potentially other types of cancer.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

This ignorance can lead to an inaccurate system model, affecting the performance of the closed-loop system. The motor dynamics can be modeled as an input-delay in actuator model. In this paper, the motor dynamics is modeled as the input time-delay for an AVSA for the first time. The stiffness of AVSA is a nonlinear function of system states; thus, stiffness tracking for an AVSA is a challenging task. Specifically, many of the existing delay compensation controllers cannot be used for stiffness tracking when the model contains input delay. To handle this issue, a nonlinear transformation is introduced and a super-twisting sliding mode control is then utilized to reach position and stiffness tracking simultaneously. Prediction-based feedback is involved together with some disturbance observers for estimating the external disturbance to compensate for the input time-delay. Simulation results show that the proposed design approach is successful in position and stiffness tracking and simultaneously in attenuating the external disturbance effect.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Ocean Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

However, neuropathy is a major side effect and has no effective treatment so far. Emerging evidence suggests that cisplatin might damage nerve capillaries leading to impaired blood-nerve barrier (BNB). This study aimed to investigate the ultrastructural changes of the BNB in the sciatic nerves and dorsal root ganglia of rats with cisplatin neuropathy and the effects of B1-6-12. Materials and methods and Results: The results showed that cisplatin 2 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally twice a week for 5 consecutive weeks caused thermal hypoalgesia and structural abnormalities of nerves and ganglia. Co-treatment with oral B1-6-12 (100:100:1) 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks reduced the sensory deficit and structural alterations. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated the higher frequencies and wider distances of pericyte detachment in the capillaries of cisplatin than control groups. Vitamin B1, B6 and B12 especially the medium dose, reversed these abnormalities. Culture of endothelial cells and pericytes with cisplatin demonstrated reduced cell viability, increased caspase-3 activity, lower transendothelial electrical resistance and decreased expression of tight junction proteins, occludin and zonula occluden-2. Conclusions: Vitamin B1, B6 and B12 could correct these toxic effects of cisplatin. These data confirm that cisplatin causes pathological alterations in the components of BNB which correlate with the severity of neuropathy. Furthermore, B1-6-12 is effective against these abnormalities and deserves further investigations as potential treatment for cisplatin-induced neuropathy.",medical,Medicine (all)

All of these classes of medical conditions are associated with alterations in mitochondrial function across an array of diverse cell types. Accumulating data indicate the presence of the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway in possibly all body cells, with important consequences for pathways crucial in driving CD8+ T cell and B-cell ‘autoimmune’-linked processes. Melatonin suppression coupled with the upregulation of oxidative stress suppress PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/parkin-driven mitophagy, raising the levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1, which underpins the chemoattraction of CD8+ T cells and the activation of antibody-producing B-cells. Many factors and processes closely associated with autoimmunity, including gut microbiome/permeability, circadian rhythms, aging, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) all interact with the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. A number of future research directions and novel treatment implications are indicated for this wide collection of poorly conceptualized and treated medical presentations.

Additionally, the virus has yet to be successfully cultivated in vitro in the process of develop viral envelope glycoproteins for vaccine design. The present study aims to investigate and evaluate EEHV1A glycoprotein B (gB) antigenic epitopes as potential candidates for further vaccine development. Epitopes of EEHV1A-gB were employed in in silico predictions and designed by using online antigenic predicting tools. Candidate genes were then constructed, transformed and expressed in the E. coli vectors prior to examine their potential for acceleration elephant immune responses in vitro. Elephant peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from 16 healthy juvenile Asian elephants were investigated for their proliferative capability and cytokine responses after being stimulated with EEHV1A-gB epitopes. Exposure of elephant PBMCs to 20 µg/mL of gB for 72 h resulted in a significant proliferation of CD3 + cells when compared with the control group. Furthermore, proliferation of CD3 + cells was associated with a marked up-regulation of cytokine mRNA expression, involving IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12 and IFN-γ. It remains to be determined whether these candidate EEHV1A-gB epitopes could activate immune responses in animal models or elephants in vivo.

In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in stress mechanisms of salt-tolerant (a.k.a. halotolerant) cyanobacteria. Omics approaches have been extensively employed in recent years to decipher mechanisms of halotolerance and to understand the relevance of halotolerance-associated gene regulatory networks. The vast knowledge from genome mining disclosed that halotolerant cyanobacteria possess extended gene families and/or clusters, encoding enzymes that synthesize unique osmoprotectants, including glycine betaine (GB), betaine derivatives, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses were conducted using Halothece sp. PCC7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece), a cyanobacterium that exhibits remarkable halotolerance. These studies revealed a specific transcriptional response when Halothece was subjected to salt stress, whereas salt and osmotic stresses were found to share a common transcriptomic response. Transcriptome and metabolite analyses of Halothece illustrated a complex dynamic relationship between the biosyntheses of osmoprotectants, as well as corresponding and ancillary pathways. Lastly, novel insights highlight the relationship between the molecular regulation of the circadian rhythm and salt stress tolerance. Since the circadian rhythm of gene expression was distorted under salt stress, halotolerant cyanobacteria may prioritize the adaptation to salt stress by attenuation of circadian rhythmicity. Key points: • Recent advancements in the understanding of stress mechanisms in halotolerant cyanobacteria are described based on omics analyses. • Transcriptome and metabolite analyses of Halothece illustrated a complex dynamic relationship between the biosyntheses of osmoprotectants, as well as corresponding and ancillary pathways. • Since salt stress affects the molecular regulation among clock-related proteins, salt stress may attenuate circadian rhythmicity.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Many researchers have developed heat recovery processes by designing suitable waste heat recovery units (WRU), such as heat exchangers, using water as a coolants to receive heat from the waste heat fluid in the production process. The conventional heat exchanger has limitations such as its equipment size, space for installation, and flexibility. The microchannel heat exchanger is one of many ideas for resolving these limitations. Moreover, the coolant on the cold side can be upgraded by adding nanometer-sized solid particles which is called “Nanofluid”. To reduce the high investigation cost and time, a new efficient and cost-effective simulation method was selected to use for investigating the performance of a microchannel heat exchanger with nanofluids in this study. To analyze the heat recovery at low temperature, i.e. around 100–200 °C, nanofluid property predictive models were developed using an artificial neural network (ANN). Then, the predictive models were embedded and integrated into computational fluid dynamics to design a microchannel heat exchanger. It is found that the use of nanofluids improved the heat transfer efficiency of this heat exchanger.

Methods: Prospectively collected data from a single institution between October 2015 and December 2020 were analyzed. Our primary endpoint was the number of patients experiencing at least one recurrent stone during the follow-up period. Results: Of 1566 patients analyzed, 603 (39%) reported at least one family member with a history of stones. The percentage of patients experiencing at least one recurrent stone event was higher in patients with a family history of stones (38%) compared to those without a family history of stones (28%) over a median follow-up period of 8 months (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the presence of any family history of urolithiasis increased risk of recurrent stone events (odds ratio [OR] 1.62, p < 0.001). The presence of both a first- and a second-degree relative with urolithiasis was associated with higher odds for a recurrent stone event (OR 2.17; p = 0.003) and a younger age of onset for stones, (OR 3.32; < 0.001). A maternal-side relative with stones conferred a higher odds ratio for younger age of first onset of stones (OR 2.93; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Any family history of kidney stone disease imparts an increased risk of recurrent stone event and an earlier age of onset for urolithiasis. The presence of both first- and second-degree relatives or a maternal-side relative with kidney stones may be a predictor for an earlier age of onset for urolithiasis.",medical,Urology

No study has explored peripheral indicators of neuroaxis damage in MDD in relation to serum inflammatory and insulin resistance (IR) biomarkers, calcium, and the physio-affective phenome consisting of depressive, anxious, chronic fatigue, and physiosomatic symptoms. Methods: Serum levels of phosphorylated tau protein 217 (P-tau217), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR), neurofilament light chain (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium and the HOMA2-insulin resistance (IR) index were measured in 94 MDD patients and 47 controls. Results: 61.1 % of the variance in the physio-affective phenome (conceptualized as a factor extracted from depression, anxiety, fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms) is explained by the regression on GFAP, NF-L, P-tau2017, PDGFRβ and HOMA2-IR (all positively associated), and decreased calcium. In addition, CRP and HOMA2-IR predicted 28.9 % of the variance in the neuroaxis index. We observed significant indirect effects of CRP and calcium on the physio-affective phenome which were partly mediated by the four neuroaxis biomarkers. Annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that the enlarged GFAP, P-tau217, PDGFR, and NF-L network was enriched in glial cell and neuronal projections, the cytoskeleton and axonal transport, including a mitochondrion.

Vulcanization is a chemical process that creates crosslinking points between rubber molecules, transforming it into a thermosetting material. This study aimed to prepare vulcanized natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package by irradiating it with electron beams at doses of 1–30 kGy. The crosslink density increased with increasing electron doses. Additionally, electron beam irradiation increased the entanglement of rubber molecules, resulting in superior mechanical properties such as modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength in the natural rubber latex. However, when high electron doses (>10 kGy) were applied, the crosslink density reduced owing to polymer degradation or chain scission, leading to inferior mechanical properties. To evaluate the potential of using irradiation as a replacement for conventional vulcanization processes, the properties of natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package vulcanized by electron beam irradiation were compared with those vulcanized by heat (conventional process). The mechanical properties of the natural rubber latex vulcanized by electron beam irradiation were superior to those of the rubber vulcanized by heat, with a 40% increase in modulus, 80% increase in tensile strength, 14% increase in elongation at break, and 36% increase in tear strength. According to these findings, electron beam irradiation, which offers high productivity and shorter processing time, is a suitable vulcanization process for natural rubber latex containing a sulfur curing package, with electron doses of 5 and 10 kGy providing superior overall balanced properties.","radiology, fluidex; related topics, physics",Radiation

Results: Movement disorders began 12.6 days on average after the initial onset of COVID-19. 92% of patients required hospital admission (mean duration 23 days). In a fraction of patients (6 of 27; 22%; 4 males/2 females, mean age 66.8 years) the movement disorder (ataxia, myoclonus, tremor, parkinsonism) was still present after a follow-up period of 7.5 ± 3 weeks. Severe COVID-19 in general and development of encephalopathy were risk factors, albeit not strong predictors, for the persistence. Conclusions: The prognosis of new-onset COVID-19-associated movement disorder appears to be generally good. The majority recovered without residual symptoms within several weeks or months. Permanent cases may be due to unmasking of a previous subclinical movement disorder or due to vascular/demyelinating damage.

Starch Chemical Composition and Molecular Structure in Relation to Physicochemical Characteristics and Resistant Starch Content of Four Thai Commercial Rice Cultivars Differing in Pasting Properties,"Sangwongchai W., Tananuwong K., Krusong K., Natee S., Thitisaksakul M.",2023-02-01,"Functional properties, Physicochemical property, Resistant starch, Rice (oryza sativa L), Rice (Oryza sativa L.), Rice cultivars, Rice starch, Starch functional property, Starch molecular structure, Starch physicochemical property, resistant starch, rice (Oryza sativa L.), rice starch, starch functional properties, starch molecular structure, starch physicochemical properties","Variations in starch pasting properties, considered an alternative potential quality classification parameter for rice starches, are directly controlled by the diverse starch molecular composition and structural features. Here, the starch characteristics of four rice cultivars (i.e., RD57, RD29, KDML105, and RD6) differing in pasting properties were assessed, and their relationship was determined. The results revealed that protein and moisture contents and their crystalline type were similar among the four rice starches. However, their molecular compositions and structures (i.e., reducing sugar and amylose contents, amylopectin branch chain-length distributions, granule size and size distribution, and degree of crystallinity) significantly varied among different genotypes, which resulted in distinct swelling, solubility, gelatinization, retrogradation, and hydrolytic resistance properties. The swelling power and gelatinization enthalpy (∆H) were positively correlated with C-type granule and relative crystallinity, but were negatively correlated with amylose content, B-type granule and median particle size (d(0.5)). Conversely, the water solubility and resistant starch content negatively correlated with C-type granule, but positively correlated with amylose content, B-type granule, and d(0.5). The gelatinization onset temperature (To(g)), and retrogradation concluding temperatures (Tc(r)), enthalpy (∆H(r)), and percentage (R%) were positively impacted by the amount of protein, amylose, and B1 chains (DP 13–24), while they were negatively correlated with short A chains (DP 6–12). Collectively, the starch physicochemical and functional properties of these Thai rice starches are attributed to an interplay between compositional and structural features. These results provide decisive and crucial information on rice cultivars’ suitability for consumption as cooked rice and for specific industrial applications.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Pivoting to protein: the immunogenicity and safety of protein-based NVX-CoV2373 as a heterologous booster for inactivated and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines,"Marchese A.M., Kalkeri R., Vadivale M., Suntronwong N., Toback S., Poovorawan Y.",2023-01-01,"Antibodies, Viral, COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccines, Humans, Immunogenicity, Vaccine, SARS-CoV-2, Vaccines, Inactivated, Viral Vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, heterologous booster, inactivated, NVX-CoV2373, protein-based, viral vector","Introduction: Approximately half of the 13.4 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses administered globally were inactivated or viral vector platforms. The harmonization and optimization of vaccine regimens has become a key focus of policymakers and health-care providers and presents an opportunity to reassess the continued use of pandemic-era vaccines. Areas covered: Immunological evidence from studies of various homologous and heterologous regimens has been rapidly published; however, interpretation of these data is complicated by the many vaccine types and highly variable participant viral exposure and vaccination histories. Recent studies demonstrate that after primary series doses of inactivated (i.e. BBV152, and BBIBP-CorV), and viral vector (ChAdOx1 nCov-2019) vaccines, a heterologous boost with protein-based NVX-CoV2373 elicits more potent ancestral strain and omicron-specific antibody responses compared to homologous and heterologous inactivated and viral vector boosts. Expert opinion: While mRNA vaccines likely yield similar performance to protein-based heterologous booster doses, the latter offers notable advantages to countries with high uptake of inactivated and viral vector vaccines in terms of transportation and storage logistics and can potentially appeal to vaccine hesitant individuals. Moving forward, vaccine-mediated protection in inactivated and viral vector recipients may be optimized with the use of a heterologous protein-based booster such as NVX-CoV2373. Pivoting to Protein: The Immunogenicity and Safety of Protein-based NVX-CoV2373 as a Heterologous Booster for Inactivated and Viral Vector COVID-19 Vaccines. Inactivated or viral vector primary series following a booster dose with homologous or heterologous inactivated vaccines (i.e., BBV152, BBIBP-CorV), and homologous or heterologous viral vector vaccines (i.e., ChAd-Ox1 nCov-19) induces suboptimal immunogenicity compared to the enhanced immunogenicity of heterologous protein-based vaccine NVX-CoV2373.","Immunology, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Immunology, Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"

Once daily Candida gavage with or without probiotics (different times of administration) for 1 week prior to bilateral nephrectomy (Bil Nep) in 8-week-old C57BL6 mice as the possible models more resemble human conditions were performed. Candida-administered Bil Nep mice demonstrated more severe conditions than Bil Nep alone as indicated by mortality (n = 10/group) and other 48 h parameters (n = 6-8/group), including serum cytokines, leaky gut (FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, serum beta-glucan, and loss of Zona-occludens-1), and dysbiosis (increased Enterobacteriaceae with decreased diversity in microbiome analysis) (n = 3/group for fecal microbiome) without the difference in uremia (serum creatinine). With nuclear magnetic resonance metabolome analysis (n = 3-5/group), Bil Nep reduced fecal butyric (and propionic) acid and blood 3-hydroxy butyrate compared with sham and Candida-Bil Nep altered metabolomic patterns compared with Bil Nep alone. Then, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus dfa1 (SCFA-producing Lacticaseibacilli) (n = 8/group) attenuated the model severity (mortality, leaky gut, serum cytokines, and increased fecal butyrate) of Bil Nep mice (n = 6/group) (regardless of Candida).

Its pathophysiological mechanisms are thought be multifactorial and complicated, resulting in difficult management. Currently, the most effective medication, when used in parallel with toilet training, is osmotic laxatives. Children’s adherence to medication and parental concern regarding long-term laxative use are the main contributors to treatment failure. Recently, novel therapies with a high safety profile have been developed, such as probiotics, synbiotics, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonists, chloride channel activators, and herbal and transitional medicines; nonetheless, well-designed research to support the use of these therapies is needed. This review aims to focus on multiple aspects of FC in children, including global prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, tools, as well as conventional and novel treatment options, such as non-pharmacological management, including adequate fiber and fluid intake, physiotherapy, or neuromodulators.

Effects of load and SiCp addition on friction coefficient, specific wear rate and wear mechanisms were investigated. Injection moulding of 5–20 vol.% SiCp—aluminium feedstocks, prepared at 55% solid loading, was carried out prior to sintering at 645–660 °C/2 h followed by precipitation-hardening at 160 °C/6 h. Effects of loading over 5–65 N range was investigated following the ball—on—flat wear test without lubrication. It was found that SiCp addition promoted wear resistance, providing the lowest specific wear rate at 9.6 × 10–5 mm3/Nm and the friction coefficient of 0.04. Abrasive wear was found to dominate at higher SiCp content. Increasing load resulted in greater wear severity, resulting in greater material loss. Wear test towards high load and high SiCp addition caused mutual materials transfer and the formation of mechanically mixed layer (MML), being composed of crushed SiCp in the hardened and re-oxidized aluminium matrix via comminution under reciprocal sliding wear action. Subsequent fatigue crack resulted in delamination of the MML causing wear debris. In addition, fatigue wear could be prolonged, which was attributable to precipitation hardening of the aluminium matrix.","lubrication, engineering, coastal engineering","Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

We examined the association between ownership of cats and dogs and the incidence of peritonitis among PD patients participating in the prospective, observational Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study. A total of 3655 PD patients from eight different countries was included, with a median follow-up of 14 months and a total exposure time of 55,475 patient-months. There were 1347 peritonitis episodes with an overall peritonitis rate of 0.29 episodes per patient year. There was no significant increased risk of peritonitis with any type of pet ownership, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.09 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.96–1.25). However, patients who owned both cats and dogs had an increased risk of peritonitis compared to patients without pets, HR = 1.45 (95% CI: 1.14–1.86). These results suggest that there is no increased risk of peritonitis with pet ownership except for those with both cats and dogs.

METHODS: From January 2022 to April 2022, 500 women participated in this cross-sectional multicenter study; 494 had complete data and valid specimen results. The participants were women who attended any one of the 10 participating institutes' colposcopy clinics due to abnormal cytology, positive high-risk HPV testing, or for follow-up. Participants used a self-sampling Aptima Multitest Swab specimen collection kit to self-collect vaginal samples before physicians biopsied the cervix during the colposcopic examination. The self- and physician-collected specimens were tested for high-risk HPV messenger RNA using Aptima nucleic acid amplification assays. Cervical tissues were collected during colposcopic-directed biopsy from the most severe lesion or a random biopsy and endocervical curettage specimen if no lesion was detected. RESULTS: We detected high-risk HPV messenger RNA in 75.4% of self-collected specimens and 70.6% of physician-collected specimens. The prevalence of histological grade 2 or higher CIN from cervical histology was 25.1% (n=124). For self-collected specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of high-risk HPV messenger RNA for grade 2 or higher CIN were 87.0% (95% CI 79.7% to 92.4%; n=108) and 28.5% (95% CI 24.0% to 33.4%).

Due to their high durability, biomarker compounds (e.g. hopanes, steranes) are widely used for oil fingerprinting. Some sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds e.g. alkylated dibenzothiophenes are also considered to be highly resistant. In this study, the use of Gas Chromatography with Sulfur Chemiluminescence Detection was investigated as a means of oil fingerprinting using the distribution the sulfur compounds in five different fresh and weathered crude oils. Chemometric analysis was also performed. The results indicate that the sulfur compounds distribution is unique for each crude oil. The distributions of the heavy sulfur compounds (i.e., C2DBTs and C3DBTs) are unchanged after weathering. Therefore, the GC-SCD technique can be considered to support the oil spill identification.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, pollution control and remedicalation, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"

The Academic Research Consortium (ARC) have identified a set of clinical criteria to standardize the definition of a high bleeding risk (HBR). Current study sought to externally validate the ARC definition for HBR patients in a contemporary real-world cohort. Method: This post hoc analysis included 22,741 patients undergoing PCI between May 2018 and August 2019 enrolled in Thai PCI Registry. The primary endpoint was the incidence of major bleeding at 12 months post index PCI. Results: In total, 8678 (38.2%) and 14,063 (61.8%) patients were stratified to the ARC-HBR and non-ARC-HBR groups, respectively. Incidence of major bleeding was 3.3 and 1.1 per 1000 patients per month in the ARC-HBR group and the non-ARC-HBR group (HR 2.84 [95% CI: 2.39–3.38]; p < 0.001). Advanced age and heart failure met the 1-year major criteria performance goal of ≥4% major bleeding. The impact of HBR risk factors was incremental. HBR patients also experienced significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality (19.1% versus 5.2%, HR 4.00 [95% CI: 3.67–4.37]; p < 0.001) and myocardial infarction. The ARC-HBR score fairly performed in discriminating bleeding with C-statistic (95% CI) of 0.674 (0.649, 0.698). Updating the ARC-HBR by adding heart failure, prior myocardial infarction, non-radial access, female in the model significantly improved C-statistic of 0.714 (0.691, 0.737). Conclusions: The ARC-HBR definition could identify patients at increased risk not only for bleeding but also for thrombotic events, including all-cause mortality.

One important issue in a classification is a class imbalanced problem which typically finds in a classification where the proportion of the target class is significantly smaller than others. A traditional classifier normally misclassifies an instance from this target class, called the minority class, as noise due to the small number of instances. Modification of the classification algorithm to handle a class imbalanced problem is a challenging task, especially for a random forest. In the random forest algorithm, the bootstrapping step is used to generate several subsets from a training data by random sampling uniformly with replacement. Most bootstrapping subsets may not even contain instances from the minority class which guarantee decision tree components to misclassify instances from the minority class. A random tree algorithm that needs to generate the bootstrapping subsets for each decision tree must assure the distribution of minority instances. This paper proposes a random forest algorithm using quartile-pattern bootstrapping by leveraging mass-ratio-variance outlier factor and minority condensation decision tree to handle this problem. The mass-ratio-variance outlier factor is a score assigned to each instance that will give a large value to an outlier and give a low value to instances surrounded by other instances in the same class. To evaluate the performance of this proposed algorithm, two synthesized datasets are used in the experiments. The experimental results show significant improvement when a dataset is imbalanced. The performance from the test dataset via F1 with the proposed algorithm is better than the performance from the traditional random forest algorithm.","heat exchange, computer science","Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

There is still no cure to help patients completely recover from the sickness. Drug repurposing can help to discover a new drug by repositioning existing drugs for new medications. Prior attempts, however, to resolve this issue are found to be limited. Performance relied on a single representation without any improvement being achieved. To surmount this task, a deep learning approach is applied. Link prediction using graph neural networks is used. Our model's architecture is based on a 'transformer': a recent and popular deep learning network. For our link prediction in the graph, each entity is embedded by using both: (1) structural information sourced from a node and its neighbor's nodes, and (2) semantic information extracted from its name and description. The experiment is conducted via type 2 diabetes data that we extracted and prepared from PubMed and UMLS Metathesaurus. Results demonstrate that our combined model, by showing an increase of 77.17% on the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score for the drug discovery task, can outperform other models that only have a single module i.e. StAR and HittER.

The models that were used in this study are logistic regression, kNN, SVM, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LSTM (bag-of-words), LSTM (w2v), BERT-based, and LSTM+CNN (BERT embedding). The models were evaluated by six metrics, including accuracy, Quadratic weighted kappa, precision, recall, and F1-score along with 10-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that XGBoost outperforms other models considering the majority of best metric scores in each set. For deep learning models with automatically extracted features from the text, the LSTM with word2vec features model yielded better performance than other deep learning models.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

Highly immunogenic vaccines containing genetically inactivated pertussis toxin (PTgen) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) may generate comparable anti-PT antibody concentrations, even at lower doses, to chemically inactivated acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdapchem) shown effective for maternal immunization. Methods: This phase 2 randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled non-inferiority trial was conducted in healthy Thai pregnant women randomly assigned to receive one dose of low-dose recombinant pertussis-only vaccine containing 1 µg PTgen and 1 µg FHA (ap1gen), or tetanus, reduced-dose diphtheria combined with ap1gen (Tdap1gen), or combined with 2 µg PTgen and 5 µg FHA (Tdap2gen), or with 5 µg PTgen and 5 µg FHA (TdaP5gen, Boostagen®) or comparator containing 8 µg of chemically inactivated pertussis toxoid, 8 µg FHA, and 2.5 µg pertactin (Boostrix™, Tdap8chem). Blood was collected at Day 0 and Day 28 post-vaccination. The non-inferiority of the study vaccines was assessed based on anti-PT IgG antibody levels on Day 28 pooled with results from a similarly structured previous trial in non-pregnant women. Results: 400 healthy pregnant women received one dose of vaccine. Combined with data from 250 non-pregnant women, all study vaccines containing PTgen were non-inferior to comparator vaccine (Tdap8chem). Both ap1gen and TdaP5gen vaccines could be considered to have superior immunogenicity to Tdap8chem. Local and systemic solicited reactions were similar among all vaccine groups. Conclusions: Vaccine formulations containing PTgen were safe and immunogenic in pregnant women. The ap1gen vaccine, with the lowest cost and reactogenicity, may be suitable for use in pregnant women when diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are not needed. This study is registered in the Thai Clinical Trial Registry (www.clinicaltrials.in.th), number TCTR20180725004.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, Veterinary Science, medical","Molecular Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Veterinary (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

Exposure to PM2.5 can cause acute health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as an increased risk of premature death. In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal model based on a deep learning approach for PM2.5 concentration prediction via an image-like approach at a country-wide level. Our model: SimVP-CFLL-ML is based on a video prediction model, called 'SimVP'. To enhance its performance when attempting to predict high PM2.5 concentration, SimVP includes two major improvements i.e. a cross-feature learning layer (CFLL) using 1× 1 convolution layer to learn feature correlation and a masking layer (ML) to calculate loss in specific locations. The experiment is conducted on data collected from the pollution control department (PCD) of Thailand and sensor for all (SFA). Results show that our model outperforms all baselines. Our model's F1 perforance is 3.51% better than the best baseline model for classifying high PM2.5 concentration class.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The undrained shear strength of clays is considered to be anisotropic and linearly increased with depth. The anisotropic undrained shear strength (AUS) model is employed to demonstrate the anisotropic behaviour of the undrained clays. The FLEA solutions of this problem based on lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) solutions are presented. The variations of bearing capacity factor (N) and the failure patterns of ring footings are examined by considering the changes in the geometric ratio of the internal radius and external radius (ri/ro), the embedment ratio (D/ro), the rates of increase of undrained shear with depth (ρro/suTC0), and the ratio of anisotropic (re). The results of the paper are presented in the simple dimensionless design charts and tables that show the relationships between N and all investigated parameters which will be beneficial to practitioners. Furthermore, the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is adopted to do sensitivity analysis and build an empirical equation for the complex relationship between the input variables and output bearing capacity factor. As the results, the radius ratio ri/ro is the most important variable on bearing capacity factor and the lower importance parameters are D/ro, ρro/suTC0, and re with relative importance 37.01, 30.37; 21.59; 11.03%, respectively. The proposed empirical equation is also proved to be an efficient method as evidenced by the high agreement between its predicted values and those from FELA with R2 of 99.95%.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Software, Artificial Intelligence"

Very high-power short-duration (vHPSD) AF ablation is a novel method using >50 W to obtain more durable AF ablation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vHPSD ablation compared with HPSD ablation and conventional power ablation. Methods: A literature search for studies that reported AF ablation outcomes, including short-term freedom from atrial arrhythmia, first-pass isolation (FPI) rate, procedure time, and major complications, was conducted utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All relevant studies were included in this analysis. A random-effects model of network meta-analysis and surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) were used to rank the treatment for all outcomes. Results: A total of 29 studies with 9721 patients were included in the analysis. According to the SUCRA analysis, HPSD ablation had the highest probability of maintaining sinus rhythm. Point estimation showed an odds ratio of 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–1.9) between HPSD ablation and conventional power ablation and an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.78–2.2) between vHPSD ablation and conventional power ablation. While the odds ratio of FPI between HPSD ablation and conventional power ablation was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.5–8.9), the odds ratio between vHPSD ablation and conventional power ablation was 2.2 (95% CI: 0.61–8.6). The procedure times of vHPSD and HPSD ablations were comparable and, therefore, shorter than that of conventional power ablation. Major complications were low in all techniques. Conclusion: vHPSD ablation did not yield higher efficacy than HPSD ablation and conventional power ablation. With the safety concern, vHPSD ablation outcomes were comparable with those of other techniques.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

Ultrasound-guidance periradicular cervical nerve root intervention raises concern about the neuromodulatory effect. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and duration of pain relief between PRF treatment and steroid injection on the cervical nerve roots. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency for cervical radicular pain. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent ultrasound-guided periradicular cervical nerve root PRF or steroid injection from January 2020 to May 2021 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH), Bangkok, Thailand. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pain score at 3 months postprocedure. The secondary outcomes were the duration of pain relief of at least 50%, pain scores at other time points after pain intervention, the amount of rescue pain medications, procedural time, and complications. METHOD: Forty-two patients who presented with chronic cervical radicular pain were prospectively randomized into the PRF and steroid groups. Patients in the PRF group received PRF treatment at 42°C for 4 minutes, followed by the injection of 2% lidocaine 1.5 mL and dexamethasone 10 mg to the targeted cervical nerve root. The steroid group received the same injectate. Patients and pain assessors were blinded. The numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaires were used for pain intensity and neck functional assessment before and after the procedure. Pain reduction was recorded up to a 9-month follow-up. RESULTS: Data analysis was obtained from 20 and 21 patients receiving PRF and steroid treatment, respectively. At 3-month postprocedure, there were 70% of patients in the PRF group reported 50% pain reduction compared with 23.8% of patients in the steroid group (p<.01). Moreover, patients in the PRF group had significantly less pain (NRS 2.8±2.7) compared with patients in the steroid group (NRS 5.5±2.6) (p=.01). The neck disability index demonstrated significant improvement at 3 and 6 months (p<.01) after PRF treatment compared with steroid injection alone. The duration, in which pain relief was at least 50%, was significantly longer in patients who received PRF treatment (6.0±4.1 months) compared with those in the steroid group (2.3±2.1 months) (p<.01). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided periradicular cervical nerve root PRF exhibited a neuromodulatory effect and was considered effective for patients with cervical radicular pain.

Deep learning-based image reconstruction is a relatively new technique that uses deep convolutional neural networks to improve image quality. Objective: To evaluate and compare 1.25 mm thin-section abdominal CT images reconstructed with deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) with 5 mm thick images reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR-V). Methods: This retrospective study included 52 patients (31 F; 56.9±16.9 years) who underwent abdominal CT scans between August-October 2019. Image reconstruction was performed to generate 5 mm images at 40% ASIR-V and 1.25 mm DLIR images at three strengths (low [DLIR-L], medium [DLIR-M], and high [DLIR-H]). Qualitative assessment was performed to determine image noise, contrast, visibility of small structures, sharpness, and artifact based on a 5-point-scale. Image preference determination was based on a 3-point-scale. Quantitative assessment included measurement of attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). Results: Thin-section images reconstructed with DLIR-M and DLIR-H yielded better image quality scores than 5 mm ASIR-V reconstructed images. Mean qualitative scores of DLIR-H for noise (1.77 ± 0.71), contrast (1.6 ± 0.68), small structure visibility (1.42 ± 0.66), sharpness (1.34 ± 0.55), and image preference (1.11 ± 0.34) were the best (p<0.05). DLIR-M yielded intermediate scores. All DLIR reconstructions showed superior ratings for artifacts compared to ASIR-V (p<0.05), whereas each DLIR group performed comparably (p>0.05, 0.405-0.763). In the quantitative assessment, there were no significant differences in attenuation values between all reconstructions (p>0.05). However, DLIR-H demonstrated the lowest noise (9.17 ± 3.11) and the highest CNR (CNRliver = 26.88 ± 6.54 and CNRportal vein = 7.92 ± 3.85) (all p<0.001). Conclusion: DLIR allows generation of thin-section (1.25 mm) abdominal CT images, which provide improved image quality with higher inter-reader agreement compared to 5 mm thick images reconstructed with ASIR-V. Clinical Impact: Improved image quality of thin-section CT images reconstructed with DLIR has several benefits in clinical practice, such as improved diagnostic performance without radiation dose penalties.

This study aims to determine the functional amino acid positions of Corynebacterium glutamicum amylomaltase (CgAM) involved in LR-CD synthesis by site-directed mutagenesis approach and molecular dynamic simulation. Mutants named Δ167, Y23A, P228Y, E231Y, A413F and G417F were constructed, purified, and characterized. The truncated CgAM, Δ167 exhibited no starch transglycosylation activity, indicating that the N-terminal domain of CgAM is necessary for enzyme activity. The P228Y, A413F and G417F produced larger LR-CDs from CD36-CD40 as compared to CD29 by WT. A413F and G417F mutants produced significantly low LR-CD yield compared to the WT. The A413F mutation affected all tested enzyme activities (starch tranglycosylation, disproportionation and cyclization), while the G417F mutation hindered the cyclization activity. P228Y mutation significantly lowered the kcat of disproportionation activity, while E231Y mutant exhibited much higher kcat and Km values for starch transglycosylation, compared to that of the WT. In addition, Y23A mutation affected the kinetic parameters of starch transglycosylation and cyclization. Molecular dynamic simulation further confirmed these mutations’ impacts on the CgAM and LR-CD interactions.

Globally, around 8.9 million premature casualties related to exposure to PM2.5 were reported. Face masks are the only option that may restrict exposure to PM2.5. In this study, a PM2.5 dust filter was developed via the electrospinning technique using the poly (3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) biopolymer. Smooth and continuous fibers without beads were formed. The PHB membrane was further characterized, and the effects of the polymer solution concentration, applied voltage, and needle-to-collector distance were analyzed via the design of experiments technique, with three factors and three levels. The concentration of the polymer solution had the most significant effect on the fiber size and the porosity. The fiber diameter increased with increasing concentration, but decreases the porosity. The sample with a fiber diameter of ∼600 nm exhibited a higher PM2.5 filtration efficiency than the samples with a diameter of 900 nm, according to an ASTM F2299-based test. The PHB fiber mats fabricated at a concentration of 10%w/v, applied voltage of 15 kV, and needle tip-to-collector distance of 20 cm exhibited a high filtration efficiency of 95% and a pressure drop of <5 mmH2O/cm2. The tensile strength of the developed membranes ranged from 2.4 to 5.01 MPa, higher than those of the mask filters available in the market. Therefore, the prepared electrospun PHB fiber mats have great potential for the manufacture of PM2.5 filtration membranes.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

However, the detection of these biomarkers has seldom been reported. Herein, we first present a dual-label electrochemical vertical flow-based immunosensor (DL-eVFIS) for the simultaneous detection of HBsAg and HBeAg. DL-eVFIS was engineered to integrate multiple time-sequenced detection procedures into a single device, thus considerably shortening the overall assaying time to 6 min. To enable simultaneous determination, thionine (Th) and ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc) were employed as signal tags, as they demonstrate nonoverlapping specific reduction peaks. The appearance of target antigens resulted in a substantial increase in the electrochemical signal response of the redox tags. While requiring only a miniscule sample volume (5 µL), superior performance was achieved in terms of their limits of detection (LODs) at 1.66 pg/mL for HBsAg and 5.32 pg/mL for HBeAg. DL-eVFIS further demonstrates excellent specificity and selectivity in clinical sample analysis compared with the conventional method. This study contributes to next-generation point-of-care (POC) testing devices for HBV diagnosis and a wide range of biosensing applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

The transcriptomic profiling of epigenetic enzymes from wild-type macrophages after single and double LPS stimulation, representing acute inflammation and LPS tolerance, respectively, was performed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of mgmt in the macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) and mgmt null (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) macrophages demonstrated lower secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 and lower expression of pro-inflammatory genes (iNOS and IL-1β) compared with the control. Macrophage injury after a single LPS dose and LPS tolerance was demonstrated by reduced cell viability and increased oxidative stress (dihydroethidium) compared with the activated macrophages from littermate control mice (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Cre−/−). Additionally, a single LPS dose and LPS tolerance also caused mitochondrial toxicity, as indicated by reduced maximal respiratory capacity (extracellular flux analysis) in the macrophages of both mgmt null and control mice. However, LPS upregulated mgmt only in LPS-tolerant macrophages but not after the single LPS stimulation. In mice, the mgmt null group demonstrated lower serum TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 than control mice after either single or double LPS stimulation. Suppressed cytokine production resulting from an absence of mgmt in macrophages caused less severe LPS-induced inflammation but might worsen LPS tolerance.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Results demonstrate that mercury can be successfully removed from petroleum condensate feed by the synergistic mixture solution of HCl and thiourea as extractant. Under equal circulating flow rates of 1.67 cm3 s−1 of feed and the synergistic extractant (0.5 mol dm−3 HCl and 1.5 mol dm−3 thiourea) at 323.15 K, the percentage of mercury removal reached 98.4%. The values of ∆H° (120 kJ mol−1), ∆S° (0.37 kJ mol−1) and ∆G° (−1.15 kJ mol−1) indicate that the reaction is endothermic, irreversible and spontaneous at 323.15 K, respectively. The results of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirm that mercury has been removed and is consistent with the obtained reaction mechanism from density functional theory (DFT). To describe the mass transport through HFMC, two mass transport mathematical models corresponding to reaction flux and diffusion flux are considered. The reaction flux model is seen to fit in well with the experimental results. The mass transfer coefficients in the membrane phase (km) and shell side (ks) are 7.45 × 10−6 cm s−1 and 2.09 × 10−5 cm s−1, respectively indicating that the mass transfer in the membrane phase is the controlling step.","Materials Science, engineering","Metals and Alloys, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Combining magnet-assisted soil washing and soil amendment with zero-valent iron to restore safe rice cultivation in real cadmium-contaminated paddy fields,"Khum-in V., Suk-in J., In-ai P., Piaowan K., Praimeesub Y., Rintachai K., Supanpaiboon W., Phenrat T.",2023-11-01,"Cadmium contamination, Food-safety, Magnet-assisted soil washing, Rice cultivation, Rice grains, Run-off, Soil amendment, Soil washing, Soils remediation, Zero-valent iron, Cadmium contamination, Food safety, Magnet-assisted soil washing, Soil remediation, Zero-valent iron","Local villagers in Mae Sot District, Tak Province, Thailand are at risk of diseases related to cadmium (Cd) due to excessive consumption of rice contaminated with Cd due to zinc mining. This study verifies the hypothesis that to achieve safe rice cultivation, magnet-assisted soil washing followed by soil amendment using zero-valent iron (ZVI) is required not only for rapid remediation of the existing Cd contamination but also for the prevention of Cd recontamination caused by contaminated run-off from an upgradient contaminated paddy. Accordingly, this study conducted a pilot-scale demonstration of the combined technique to restore a real Cd-contaminated paddy (41.02 ± 5.47 mg/kg−1) and compared it with remediation using only soil amendment with ZVI or only magnet-assisted soil washing. The Cd concentration in rice grains from the contaminated rice field without treatment was 0.86 ± 0.01 mg/kg−1, and thus higher than the acceptable level of 0.4 mg/kg−1. Even though the use of magnet-assisted soil washing without amendment initially removed all the bioavailable Cd from the soil, it failed to reduce Cd uptake by the rice plants. This failure was caused by heavy off-season rain, which flooded and re-contaminated the experimental fields with Cd-contaminated run-off from an upgradient contaminated field, leading to a Cd concentration in rice grains of 1.21 ± 0.01 mg/kg−1. Similarly, the use of ZVI as a soil amendment without magnet-assisted soil washing could not ensure safe rice cultivation during the off-season flood, as Cd concentration in the rice grains was still 0.60 mg/kg−1. However, magnet-assisted soil washing followed by soil amendment using ZVI successfully removed Cd from soil and sequestered Cd from Cd-contaminated run-off, resulting in protection against Cd re-contamination in soil and the reduction of Cd content in rice grains to 0.33 mg/kg−1, representing a 60% removal efficacy. Also, this combined technique remained positive for rice growth compared to non-treatment.","water engineeringneering, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Role of Lifshitz transition stabilized carbon hexagon structure from biaxial strain: A case of sodium carbide with superconducting condition,"Tsuppayakorn-aek P., Pluengphon P., Sukmas W., Sukserm A., Kotmool K., Sakulkalavek A., Inceesungvorn B., Bovornratanaraks T., Luo W.",2023-06-15,"Biaxial strains, Biaxial tensile strain, Carbon hexagon, Carbon structures, Condition, Density-functional-theory, Eliashberg theory, First principle calculations, Lifshitz transition, Sodium carbide, Biaxial strain, Eliashberg theory, First-principles calculations, Lifshitz transition, Sodium carbide, Superconductivity, Thermodynamic stability","We theoretically report on an investigation of sodium carbide system by means of first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Herein, the diverse sodium–carbon structures are predicted by taking carbon-rich compositions of NaC2 with a carbon hexagon structure as a starting point. Metallic phases of NaC2 at a pressure of 100 GPa are predicted to be stabilized by biaxial strain, culminating in the strain-induced electronic topological transitions, also known as the Lifshitz transitions. We found that the flat band accommodates localized electrons around the Fermi level, originating from the effect of biaxial strain, which results in low-velocity electrons forming up to at least 20% of Cooper pairs. According to the respective phonon-mediated superconductivity, NaC2 is dynamically stable not only without the influence of biaxial strain but also with that of the biaxial tensile strain, indicating possible enhancement of the critical temperature superconductor (Tc). Furthermore, the estimated Tc reaches 29.5 K, slightly higher than 24.7 K for the case without biaxial strain. These findings suggest that the possibility of superconductivity is promoted by the applied biaxial tensile strain. Our findings pave the way for future investigation of high superconductivity in carbon-based materials and suggest the possibility of metal-carbides being synthesisable and exhibiting quite a high Tc superconductivity.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Ceramics and Composites, Process Chemistry and Technology, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

To date, there are scarce standard measurement tools for assessing self-management practices. This study aimed to develop and validate a Thai version of the Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (Thai-ESMS) for Thai people with epilepsy. Methods: The translation of the Thai-ESMS was created using the adaptation of Brislin's translation model. Content validity of the developed Thai-ESMS was independently assessed by 6 neurology experts and reported as item content validity index (I-CVI) and scale-CVI (S-CVI). We consecutively invited epilepsy patients at our outpatient epilepsy clinic to participate in the study from November to December 2021. Participants were asked to complete our 38-item Thai-ESMS. Based on the participant's responses, construct validity was evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was employed to evaluate internal consistency reliability. Results: Overall, our 38-item Thai ESMS scale showed high content validity (S-CVI = 0.89), assessed by neurology experts. Responses from 216 patients were then used for the assessment of construct validity and internal consistency. The results showed good construct validity of 5 domains (5 factors with Eigenvalue > 1 upon EFA and good fitness index upon CFA) meaning that the developed scale is an adequate measure of the concept it was designed to evaluate and had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.819), which both values were comparable to the original English version. However, some items or domains had poorer validity and reliability than the overall scale. Conclusions: We developed a robust 38-item Thai ESMS with high validity and good reliability to be used to help assess the magnitude of self-management skills in Thai PWE. However, more work on this measure is needed before distribution to a wider population.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Behavioral Neuroscience"

Though particularly suited for shape memory, the LCEs however have some drawbacks such as low shape fixity (Rf) and slow recovery time. To overcome these limitations, new lignin-filled elastomeric liquid crystalline (ELC) composite materials were fabricated. The lignin used is a by-product of Kraft pulping process, which was obtained from renewable resources abundant in nature. Here, we show that the aromatic structure of lignin increases the netpoints density at the micro-scopic level in the ELC composite systems. Shape memory effects are enhanced by incorporating up to only 7 wt% of lignin, resulting in an Rf of 97% for the composites. Concurrently, these composites were able to maintain their shape recovery (Rr) of nearly 100%. The recovery time of the composites reduces with increasing lignin content due to the higher elastic energy released from the netpoints based on the lignin structure. The ELC composites with 7 wt% lignin could fully recover within 70 s, while the neat LCE counterpart took 100 s. Morphological features of dispersed lignin shows that even without surface modification and only a moderate quality of dispersion in LCE matrix, both shape memory and dynamic mechanical properties of the resultant composites can be significantly improved.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

The latter aberrations, which point to increased gut permeability (leaky gut), are linked to activated neuro-immune and oxidative pathways in MDD. To delineate the profile and composition of the gut microbiome in Thai patients with MDD, we examined fecal samples of 32 MDD patients and 37 controls using 16S rDNA sequencing, analyzed α- (Chao1 and Shannon indices) and β-diversity (Bray–Curtis dissimilarity), and conducted linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis. Neither α- nor β-diversity differed significantly between MDD and controls. Rhodospirillaceae, Hungatella, Clostridium bolteae, Hungatella hathewayi, and Clostridium propionicum were significantly enriched in MDD, while Gracillibacteraceae family, Lutispora, and Ruminococcus genus, Ruminococcus callidus, Desulfovibrio piger, Coprococcus comes, and Gemmiger were enriched in controls. Contradictory results have been reported for all these taxa, with the exception of Ruminococcus, which is depleted in six different MDD studies (one study showed increased abundance), many medical disorders that show comorbidities with MDD, and animal MDD models. Our results may suggest a specific profile of compositional gut dysbiosis in Thai MDD patients, with increases in some pathobionts and depletion of some beneficial microbiota. The results suggest that depletion of Ruminococcus may be a more universal biomarker of MDD that may contribute to increased enteral LPS load, LPS translocation, and gut–brain axis abnormalities.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

However, CTS exhibits undesirable brittle behavior because the CTS can break suddenly after the applied stresses reach their peak strength. CTS reinforced by natural fibers is called CTSF. This paper aims to study the influence of palm fiber on the flexural performance and microscopic characterization of CTSF specimens. Palm fiber contents of 0.5, 1, and 2% by volume and fiber lengths of 10,20, and 40 mm were utilized. The four performances of CTSF are peak strength, residual strength, toughness, and equivalent flexural strength. The interaction mechanism of the CTSF fiber was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the palm fibers change the behavior of CTS from brittle to semi-ductile or ductile. The 1% fiber content and 40-mm-long fiber improve the flexural of unreinforced samples by a factor of 2.7. The best residual strength at a deflection of 2 mm is obtained from the specimen with a 2.0% fiber content and a 40 mm fiber length exhibiting the residual-peak flexural strength ratio of 1.0. All palm fiber-reinforced samples show softening behavior because an equivalent strength ratio is less than 100%. The 2% fiber content and 40 mm fiber length provide the best equivalent strength ratio since the equivalent strength ratios are enhanced by a factor of 20. The fiber content and length mainly affect the equivalent strength ratios. A single failure plane is seen for CTS and CTSF samples with low fiber content, whereas numerous cracks are observed for CTSF samples. Regarding failure mode and flexural performances, palm fiber inclusion is suitable as the base and subbase for the bound pavement structure in civil and pavement engineering works.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

To date, the innate cellular and molecular mechanism(s) orchestrating the HDM-induced allergic inflammation remains partially deciphered. Understanding the kaleidoscope of HDM-induced innate immune responses is hampered by (1) the large complexity of the HDM allergome with very diverse functional bioreactivities, (2) the perpetual presence of microbial compounds (at least LPS, β-glucan, chitin) promoting as well pro-Th2 innate signaling pathways and (3) multiple cross-talks involving structural, neuronal and immune cells. The present review provides an update on the innate immune properties, identified so far, of multiple HDM allergen groups. Experimental evidence highlights the importance of HDM allergens displaying protease or lipid-binding activities on the initiation of the allergic responses. Specifically, group 1 HDM cysteine proteases are considered as the key initiators of the allergic response through their capacities to impair the epithelial barrier integrity, to stimulate the release of pro-Th2 danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in epithelial cells, to produce super-active forms of IL-33 alarmin and to mature thrombin leading to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Remarkably, the recently evidenced primary sensing of cysteine protease allergens by nociceptive neurons confirms the critical role of this HDM allergen group in the early events leading to Th2 differentiation.","Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology, Molecular Biology"

M. suis infection can be diagnosed using several methods, including molecular diagnosis such as conventional PCR (cPCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). In these cases, the common target is the 16S rRNA gene; however, this genetic marker cannot distinguish hemoplasma at the species level owing to high sequence identity. Therefore, the 23S rRNA gene has emerged as another target gene. Other than PCR, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method can be applied for M. suis. The objective of the present study was to establish cPCR, TaqMan qPCR, and LAMP assays in which the 23S rRNA gene is used to detect M. suis infection in Thai domestic pigs. The analytical sensitivity of cPCR was determined as 7.46 × 104 copies/μl of plasmid DNA, whereas those of qPCR and LAMP were 7.46 × 102 copies/μl. There was no cross reaction with other pathogens in any of the assays. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the assays, they were tested using 173 samples of genomic DNA. The detection percentage of M. suis infection was 24.86% (43/173; 95% CI: 18.61%–31.89%), 28.32% (49/173; 95% CI: 21.75%–35.66%), and 29.48% (51/173; 95% CI: 22.80%–36.88%) using cPCR, qPCR, and LAMP, respectively. Using qPCR as a reference assay, cPCR showed 81.63% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, and an almost perfect level of agreement (kappa = 0.823). In comparison, LAMP showed 77.55% sensitivity, 89.52% specificity, and a substantial level of agreement (kappa = 0.662). All assays tested here could be applied in veterinary diagnostic laboratories for monitoring porcine health in the herds. Furthermore, the LAMP assay could be used as a screening test in farm practice without the need for any special equipment.","Immunology, Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, medical","Parasitology, Veterinary (miscellaneous), Insect Science, Infectious Diseases"
Characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells from supracrestal gingival connective tissue,"Srithanyarat S.S., Choosiri M., Sa-Ard-Iam N., Petcharat P., Osathanon T.",2023-03-01,"Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Connective Tissue, Gingiva, Humans, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Periodontal Ligament, mesenchymal stem cell, periodontitis, periodontium, sequence analysis, tissue engineering, transcriptome","Background: Although periodontal ligament-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PDL-MSCs) have been recognized as the best MSC choice for periodontal regeneration, using PDL-MSCs requires tooth extraction for cell isolation. The supracrestal gingival (SG) connective tissue is a part of the gingiva which is located close to the PDL. SG-MSCs might have similar characteristic to the PDL-MSCs and serve as a good MSC candidate for periodontal regeneration. This study aimed to investigate and compare the characteristics of human MSCs isolated from SG tissue (hSG-MSCs), marginal gingival tissue (hMG-MSCs), and PDL (hPDL-MSCs) in terms of MSCs properties and differential gene expression profile. Methods: Human periodontal tissue from five healthy subjects, including SG, MG, and PDL, was harvested. The primary cells of the hSG-MSCs, hMG-MSCs, and hPDL-MSCs were isolated and expanded to assess MSCs markers by flow cytometry, colony-forming ability, differentiation potential, RNA sequencing, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Of the three cell types, the hSG-MSCs demonstrated the highest colony-forming ability. The number of alizarin red S positive colonies produced by the hSG-MSCs was higher than the hMG-MSCs but lower than the hPDL-MSCs. RNA sequencing revealed that the hSG-MSCs had a more similar gene expression profile to the hPDL-MSCs than the hMG-MSCs. Pathway enrichment analysis found no significant differences in the differentially expressed genes between the hSG-MSCs and hPDL-MSCs; however, there were significantly enriched pathways between the hPDL-MSCs and hMG-MSCs for the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a close relationship between hSG-MSCs and hPDL-MSCs. hSG-MSCs could be a potential MSC source for periodontal tissue engineering.",dentistry,Periodontics
Undersampling artifact reduction for free-breathing 3D stack-of-radial MRI based on a deep adversarial learning network,"Gao C., Ghodrati V., Shih S.-F., Wu H.H., Liu Y., Nickel M.D., Vahle T., Dale B., Sai V., Felker E., Surawech C., Miao Q., Finn J.P., Zhong X., Hu P.",2023-01-01,"Artifacts, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Motion, Respiration, Abdominal MRI, Artifact suppression, Deep adversarial network, Deep learning, Radial acquisition","Purpose: Stack-of-radial MRI allows free-breathing abdominal scans, however, it requires relatively long acquisition time. Undersampling reduces scan time but can cause streaking artifacts and degrade image quality. This study developed deep learning networks with adversarial loss and evaluated the performance of reducing streaking artifacts and preserving perceptual image sharpness. Methods: A 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) was developed for reducing streaking artifacts in stack-of-radial abdominal scans. Training and validation datasets were self-gated to 5 respiratory states to reduce motion artifacts and to effectively augment the data. The network used a combination of three loss functions to constrain the anatomy and preserve image quality: adversarial loss, mean-squared-error loss and structural similarity index loss. The performance of the network was investigated for 3–5 times undersampled data from 2 institutions. The performance of the GAN for 5 times accelerated images was compared with a 3D U-Net and evaluated using quantitative NMSE, SSIM and region of interest (ROI) measurements as well as qualitative scores of radiologists. Results: The 3D GAN showed similar NMSE (0.0657 vs. 0.0559, p = 0.5217) and significantly higher SSIM (0.841 vs. 0.798, p < 0.0001) compared to U-Net. ROI analysis showed GAN removed streaks in both the background air and the tissue and was not significantly different from the reference mean and variations. Radiologists' scores showed GAN had a significant improvement of 1.6 point (p = 0.004) on a 4-point scale in streaking score while no significant difference in sharpness score compared to the input. Conclusion: 3D GAN removes streaking artifacts and preserves perceptual image details.","biochemistryistry, engineering, medical","Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

This research prepared CBO nanoemulsion (CBON) and studied its effects on the volatile profile and sensory properties of Asian seabass fillets. Changes in volatile profile, colour and odour scores, and overall likeness scores of CBON-treated fillets were determined during storage in comparison to the control (CTRL) and bulk cinnamon bark oil (BCBO)-treated ones. After treatment, CBON and BCBO were able to mask the natural odour of fish fillets. However, CBON did not change the fillets' colour. During storage, CBON-treated fillets contained relatively higher cinnamaldehyde content and higher colour score but less cinnamon oil-like odour score than those of BCBO-treated ones. CBON-treated fillets also had higher acceptance scores than those of CTRL and BCBO-treated fillets after storage. These results demonstrated the efficiency of the nanoemulsion system to minimise undesirable effects of CBO and maintain sensory acceptance of the fillets during storage.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, engineering","Food Science, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The characterization results reveal that the face-centered cubic crystalline (fcc)-structured NiPd bimetallic alloy nanoparticles are encased by thin carbon nanotubes. The bimetallic synergism of NiPd nanoparticles actuates the outer CNT layers and accelerates the electrical conductivity, stimulating the electrochemical activity toward an effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By virtue of the collective individualities of highly conductive aligned carbon walls and bimetallic active sites, the NiPd@CNT-equipped HER delivers a minimum overpotential of 87 mV and a Tafel slope value of 95 mV dec−1. The existing intact contact between NiPd and CNT facilitates continuous electron and ion transportation and firm stability toward long-term hydrogen production in HER. Notably, the NiPd@CNT reported here produces excellent electrochemical activity with minimal charge transference resistance, substantiating the efficacy of NiPd@CNT for futuristic green hydrogen production.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

In this approach, user requirements are captured and expressed through user stories and scenarios, which serve as examples and acceptance criteria. Employing small iterations, this process reduces both time and cost of software development. Nonetheless, frequent small iterations pose a significant challenge for testing, especially regression testing. To mitigate the problem, automation testing has been adopted; however, manually composing test scripts can be error-prone and inefficient. This can result in the essential regression tests being deferred to later iterations, rendering it too late to identify errors. This paper proposes an approach to address this issue by generating Robot test scripts automatically from user stories and scenarios. Using XML to lay out the UI structures of the web page, test scripts can be created during the design phase. In addition to the examples provided in scenarios, the XML Schema Definition (XSD) is utilized to produce augmented test datasets automatically. Parameterizing test scripts also enables multiple test scripts with shared test steps but different test datasets, to be consolidated into a single script, thus drastically reducing maintenance effort.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Signal Processing"

Herein, we reported a cost-effective, green, and simple approach to synthesizing mass production exfoliated graphene (EG) flakes employing electrochemical exfoliation of pencil graphite in neutral aqueous electrolytes. Pencil graphite cores of different grades were applied as anode and cathode electrodes and exposed to the electrolyte solution at a different voltage. Several parameters were examined and optimized, including pencil grade (2,4,6,8 B), applied voltage (10, 15, 20, 30 V), different inorganic electrolytes ((NH4)2SO4, Na2SO4, NaNO3, NaCl, and CH3COONa), and the concentration of electrolytes. The optimal condition was chosen by considering the mass of produced graphene and the conductivity of the graphene solution. The optimal conditions were as follow: pencil grade: 6B; applied voltage: 10 V; electrolyte type: Na2SO4; electrolyte concentration: 0.1 M. Under these conditions, the production yield was > 95% within 3 h and 9 min. The EG was characterized by utilizing FT-IR, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM, Cyclic Voltammetry, and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Characterization indicates that the synthesized EG had an XRD peak at 2θ = 26.6° and an ID/IG ratio of 0.36. Furthermore, the EG showed good conductivity when tested by cyclic voltammetry and EIS whereas the R2 values were 985.8 and 76.3 Ω for bare GCE and EG/GCE, respectively. In addition, EG effectively removed cadmium (Cd(II)) with an adsorption level of 8.72 mg/g. The results from this study suggest that EG can be scaled up and commercialized in an environmentally friendly and low-cost manner, especially in low-income countries, and using it to rectify metal ions.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, energy, coastal engineering, chemistry","Ceramics and Composites, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Process Chemistry and Technology, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

It is possible to detect postural stability using an integrated accelerometer (ACC) sensor in a smartphone. Therefore, a novel ACC-based smartphone application running on the Android operating system called BalanceLab was created and tested. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a novel ACC-based Android smartphone application for assessing balance in older adults. Methods: Using BalanceLab, 20 older adults completed three balance assessments: the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (MCTSIB), a single-leg stance test (SLST), and a limit of stability test (LOS). The validity of this mobile application was investigated using a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis system and the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale. The test-retest reliability of this mobile application was determined on two separate occasions within one day, at least two hours apart. Results: The two static balance assessments (the MCTSIB and SLST) demonstrated moderate to excellent correlation with the 3D motion analysis system (r = 0.70–0.91) and the FAB scale (r = 0.67–0.80). However, the majority of the dynamic balance tests (the LOS tests) did not demonstrate any correlation with the 3D motion analysis system or the FAB scale. This novel ACC-based application demonstrated good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.76–0.91). Conclusion: A static, but not dynamic, balance assessment tool that uses a novel ACC-based application for Android can be used to measure balance in older adults.

With EAc-bioaugmentation, PLA films (5–30% w/w) had complete disintegration (35 d), 77–82% molecular weight reduction (16 d), and higher CO2 liberation and mineralization than non-bioaugmented composting. Bacterial community analyses showed that EAc-bioaugmentation increased the relative abundance of Schlegelella, a known polymer degrader, and interacted positively with beneficial indigenous microbes like Bacillus, Schlegelella and Thermopolyspora. The bioaugmentation also decreased compost phytotoxicity. Hence, consortium EAc shows potential in PLA-waste treatment applications, such as backyard and small-scale composting.","fluidex; related topics, genergyal microbial ecology, coastal engineering, environmental, energy","Bioengineering, Environmental Engineering, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

This study aims to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of “Kerra™”, a natural extract derived from a mixture of nine medicinal plants mentioned in the ancient Thai scripture named the Takxila Scripture, on HCT116 cells. Materials and Methods: In this study, the effect of the Kerra™ extract on cancer cells was assessed through cell viability assays. Apoptotic activity was evaluated by examining the apoptosis characteristic features. A proteomics analysis was conducted to identify proteins and pathways associated with the extract’s mechanism of action. The expression levels of apoptotic protein markers were measured to validate the extract’s efficacy. Results: The Kerra™ extract demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the cells, with higher concentrations leading to decreased cell viability. Treatment with the extract for 72 h induced characteristic features of early and late apoptosis, as well as cell death. An LC-MS/MS analysis identified a total of 3406 proteins. The pathway analysis revealed that the Kerra™ extract stimulated apoptosis and cell death in colorectal cancer cell lines and suppressed cell proliferation in adenocarcinoma cell lines through the EIF2 signaling pathway. Upstream regulatory proteins, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) and MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC), were identified. The expressions of caspase-8 and caspase-9 were significantly elevated by the Kerra™ extract compared to the chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin (Dox).

However, the limited cathode options still hinder the development of ZIBs, which always delivers poor rate capacities and cycling stability. Herein, Monoclinic phase H3.78V6O13 microspheres with a stable internal framework and intrinsic metallic properties as a high-performance cathode for ZIBs are proposed and utilized. The reversible Zn2+insertion/de-insertion mechanism in H3.78V6O13through ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and in situ Raman involves the enlargement/shrink of interplanar distance, the decrease/increase of the V valance, and the open/recombine of V─O/V─V bonds. Further, experiments and theoretical calculations elucidate the superior electrochemical performance and extraordinary reaction kinetics in H3.78V6O13. The as-prepared H3.78V6O13 cathode delivers high specific capacity of 406 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1, excellent structure stability with 100% manifested after 120 cycles at 0.5 A g–1, 72.9% retained after 15 000 cycles at 10 A g–1.

Moreover, this infection now becomes the world’s most severe kind of virus among all Hepatitis as out of 12 individuals; one is resulted as positive for Hepatitis B disease globally. Hepatitis B is a short-term disease for few individuals. But, sometimes, for few patients, it will become a chronic as well as long-term disease. This severe infection will lead to various deadly diseases that can infect the liver of an individual completely. The most life-threatening disease caused by it is a chronic liver disease which further leads to cancer as well as cirrhosis, and as a result, the life of a patient will put at significant risk. Therefore, it is very crucial and become a necessity to detect or identify this Hepatitis B virus at the very first stage or at an introductory stage. By doing so, the life of an individual can be saved for good. The biomarkers are also used to identify this deadly infection of the liver. If this infection is not cured until six months, then it will become chronic.

A rapidly growing number of younger pediatric patients in Thailand necessitated the formulation of favipiravir, the most locally accessible antiviral agent against COVID-19, into a child-friendly dosage form as a safer alternative to a dispersion of crushed tablets in simple syrup. While striving to quickly develop a liquid formulation that is feasible for any local hospital production units, an oral solution was chosen due to its simplicity. Despite the large dose and poor aqueous solubility of favipiravir, a combination of pH control and use of poloxamer as a solubilizing agent has enabled us to streamline the manufacturing process of a 200 mg/15 mL oral solution for hospital compounding. To ensure its efficacy and safety, a specification for quality control was also established in accordance with the ICH quality guidelines and USP. The finished product stability was subsequently demonstrated under the conditions of 5°C ± 3°C, 25°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH, 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH, and 40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH. The results indicated that our formulation can be stored at 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH for 30 days, which will very well serve the need to allow drug distribution and patient use during the crisis, while the shelf-life can be extended to 60 days when stored at 5°C ± 3°C.

Design and setting We conducted a cross-sectional study in Thailand's north and northeast region from March 2020 to November 2022. Participants This study involved 405 women aged 30-70 years old. Variables and outcomes Demographic information, health status and BSE were collected using a modified questionnaire based on the Champion Health Belief Model. The outcomes were ever-practising BSE, BSE practice within the last 6 months, continuity of BSE and confidence in doing BSE. Logistic regression and decision tree analysis identified the associated factors. Results 75.55% of participants ever performed BSE. Around 74.18% did BSE within the last 6 months.

Frequent high-fat diet, high awareness of breast cancer, lower knowledge of BSE and lower attitude toward BSE were associated with not practising BSE within 6 months and BSE discontinuation. Only high knowledge of BSE was associated with absolute confidence in BSE (p<0.05). Conclusion Despite having a higher percentage than other studies in different countries prior to the pandemic, it is still crucial to improve knowledge of BSE to encourage BSE practice, confidence and continuity of BSE in Thai women.

Herein, the optical property of carboxymethyl cellulose stabilized silver nanoparticles (CMC-AgNPs), supported with ascorbic acid, is exploited as a colorimetric probe for the detection of toxic Au3+ ion in solution. The as-synthesized CMC-AgNPs showed sharp absorption maximum at 403 nm, with sparkling yellow color and average particles size distribution less than 10 nm. It was further characterized using ATR-FTIR, TEM, FESEM/EDS, XRD and DLS/zeta potential analyzer. Au3+ ion detection strategy involves the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) to a pH adjusted CMC-AgNPs, followed by the analyte addition. AA would facilitate the reduction of Au3+ on CMC-AgNPs (seed), with resultant color perturbations from light yellow to yellow, orange, ruby red and purple red, under 8 min incubation, at room temperature (RT). The CMC-AgNPs could also serve as a catalyst, by promoting AA mediated reduction of Au3+, in-situ. Moreover, we propose, that the color and the absorption spectra change is attributed to the deposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), on the CMC-AgNPs/AA probe, to form (CMC-Ag@Au) nanostructures, depending on the analyte concentration. Absorbance ratio (A540/A403) showed good linearity with Au3+ concentration from 0.25 to 100.0 µM, and an estimated LOD of 0.061 µM. The assay was applied to Au3+ detection in environmental wastewater sample, showing satisfactory real sample detection potentiality.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

However, the usage of SCMs to lower the alkalinity of Vegetation Porous Concrete (VPC) is limited. The present study examined the effects of Fly Ash (FA) and Silica Fume (SF) on the alkalinity, strength and planting properties of VPC. Since the Coarse Aggregate Size Ratio (CASR) has a substantial impact on the VPC strength, the current-study also examines the influence of CASR on the void content, strength and planting properties of VPC. The blending of cement with FA and SF reduced the alkalinity of the VPC, and that increasing the dose rate of FA and SF lowered the alkalinity of the VPC even more. The pozzolonic reaction of FA and SF in the VPC consumes CH crystals to form C–S–H gels, and the reduction in the quantity of CH crystals causes the pH of the VPC to decrease. Consequently, the plant's root length growth and LRWC improved by 7.91% and 4.95%, respectively. The inclusion of FA decreased the compressive strength due to the lower activity of the FA with the cement matrix; however, the accelerated pozzolanic reaction between Ca(OH)2 and SiO2 in the SF enhanced VPC strength. Despite an increase in CASR improves the aggregate interlocking property and the strength, it also reduces the void content of the VPC. The reduction in VPC pores hampered root mobility through the concrete, delaying root development and reducing the availability of water and nutrients.","mixing and separation, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

SDMA is almost completely excreted by the kidneys, hence in renal dysfunction, the excretion is decreased, resulting in accumulation in plasma. Reference values for plasma or serum have already been established in small animal practice. Values < 15 μg/dL are considered normal, 15–19 μg/dL are values of concern, and at values > 20 μg/dL kidney disease is likely. The proposed electrochemical paper-based sensing platform uses anti-SDMA antibodies for targeted detection of SDMA. Quantification is related to a decrease in the signal of a redox indicator due to the formation of an immunocomplex that interferes with electron transfer. Square wave voltammetry measurements showed a linear correlation of the peak decline for 50 nM - 1 μM SDMA with a detection limit of 15 nM. The influence of common physiological interferences caused no significant peak reduction, indicating excellent selectivity. The proposed immunosensor was successfully applied for the quantification of SDMA in human urine of healthy individuals. Surveillance of SDMA concentration in urine could prove to be very valuable in the diagnosis or monitoring of renal disease.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, chemistry","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Electrochemistry"

In this study, Beijing and Yuncheng were chosen as two representative northern cities of China that mainly relied on natural gas and coal respectively as the energy source for domestic heating in winter. The pollution characteristics and exposure risks of EPFRs in PM2.5 around the heating season of 2020 were investigated and compared between the two cities. Through laboratory simulation experiments, the decay kinetics and secondary formation of EPFRs in PM2.5 collected in both cities were also studied. EPFRs in PM2.5 collected in Yuncheng in the heating period showed longer lifetime and lower reactivity, suggesting that EPFRs originated from coal combustion were more stable in the atmosphere. However, the generation rate of hydroxyl radical (·OH) by the newly formed EPFRs in PM2.5 in Beijing under ambient conditions was 4.4 times of that in Yuncheng, suggesting higher oxidative potential of EPFRs from the atmospheric secondary processes. Accordingly, the control strategies of EPFRs and their health risks were raised for the two cities, which would also have direct implication for the control of EPFRs in other areas of similar atmospheric emission and reaction patterns.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, the current map matching method requires GPS high frequency data for adjustment and it does not perform well in GPS low frequency data. So, the study explores the idea to improve the map matching method based on a kind of machine learning technology by using the classification method to adjust the low frequency GPS location. This research uses features such as speed, heading and location of the previous GPS point for a training machine learning the model and adjust points of the GPS location. The objective of this study is to develop accuracy of the map matching method and the speed of map matching method for low frequency GPS data. After processing data, we found that Random Forest is the machine learning model that contains highest precision, recall and F1-Score. Moreover, this model is a low sensitivity model when frequency of data changes, but Decision Tree is the fastest model in prediction time and it takes lower time for training than Random Forest model.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Business, decision sciences, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Strategy and Management, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

In this study, the mechanical behavior of CNTs concrete reinforced with hooked-end steel fiber (HSF) and milled steel fiber (MSF) with respective volume fractions of 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% were examined regarding compressive (cubic and axial), splitting tensile and flexural strengths at 28 days. Meanwhile, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to quantify the crack propagation on specimen surface under varied flexural loads. The results confirmed CNTs' ability to improve the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength of plain concrete, but the inability to refine brittle failure. Include SFs further enhanced CNTs concrete's strength and reduced its brittleness. In terms of fiber type, HSF-reinforced CNTs concrete outperformed MSF-reinforced in compressive, splitting tensile strength, and reducing the brittleness of CNTs concrete, whereas surrendered the latter in flexural strength. Crack propagation observed by DIC demonstrated the reinforced specimens’ good ductility due to the ability of SFs to restrict crack propagation and improve deforms of the whole specimen. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation of CNTs-compacted concrete microstructure revealed the excellent synergistic effect of CNTs and SFs in bonding with cement matrix. Macroscopically, CNTs and SFs together could improve the mechanical properties and ductility of cement materials, and even structure durability.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

This recent work focuses only on the third process, which involves the treatment of wastewater from biogas effluent and the production of L. punctata with high starch content. L. punctata showed a significantly higher TKN removal and biomass production than Lemna aequinoctialis. After nine days of wastewater treatment and five days of starch accumulation, L. punctata grew by 4.3 g/m2/day, with 44.4% starch content. NH3, NH4+, and PO43− in the biogas effluent were rapidly utilized in the first three days for L. punctata's growth. The upregulation of AGPase genes in the starch biosynthesis pathway was observed when the environmental conditions changed in both nutrient starvation and population reduction. Production of starch-rich L. punctata using biogas effluent is a sustainable feedstock for the bioethanol process. Moreover, L. punctata-based stabilization pond is a promising technique for biogas effluent treatment.","environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Science (all), Soil Science, Plant Science"

Methodology: Stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth were cultured in media with Wnt3a (50–200 ng/ml). Wnt activation was confirmed by β-catenin immunocytochemistry. Colony-forming unit assay (normalized percentage area), osteogenic gene expression analysis by real-time polymerase chain reaction and mineralization assays measured by the absorption at 540 nm were performed. Tertiary dentine formation in vivo was evaluated using 8-week-old, male Wistar rats. Cavities with pinpoint pulp exposure by a sharp instrument were prepared at the mesial surface of the first molars. Teeth were divided into (n = 6): (1) distilled water (negative control), (2) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (3) lithium chloride in DI (20 μM), and (4) Wnt3a in PBS (200 ng/ml). Collagen sponge was used as a scaffold. The cavity was sealed with glass ionomer restoration. Four weeks later, animals were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg body weight). Hard tissue formation was evaluated using micro-computerized tomography. Sixty consecutive slides from the initial plane were analysed and calculated as bone/dentine volume per total tissue volume. Paraffin sections (2 μm) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome for morphological evaluation. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error. Mann–Whitney U test was used for two-group comparison. Kruskal Wallis followed by pairwise comparison was employed for three or more group comparisons. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7. Differences were considered significant at p <.05. Results: Wnt3a decreased SHEDs colony formation and increased OSX, BMP2, and DMP1 expression, corresponding to an increase in mineralization. Additionally, a significant increase in dentine/bone volume per total tissue volume was observed in Wnt3a treated defects. Dentine bridge formation at the exposure sites treated with Wnt3a demonstrated, while fibrous tissues were observed in the control. Conclusions: Wnt3a suppressed proliferation, increased osteogenic differentiation of SHEDs and promotes tertiary dentine formation. Wnt3a could be utilized as biological molecule for vital pulp therapy.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Thus, GAP adopters as farmer groups are seen as viable AWD adopters in the initial stages of scaling out the adoption in Thailand. However, the understanding of integrating AWD as water-saving management among GAP adopters remains scant. Using the case of rice GAP farmers in Thailand, the study found a higher probability of adoption intention among GAP compared to non-GAP. AWD perceived advantage, knowledge, and the suitability of rice farms for AWD adoption trials are positively associated with higher adoption intention. While higher fixed cost lowers the probability of adoption, variable cost is positively associated with higher adoption intention in the short-run production decision. In order to scale out the adoption of AWD, farmers’ understanding of the safe and proper application of AWD, together with assistance for crop insurance in the case of crop failure, will be crucial. Risks connected with the adoption decision continue to be the biggest barrier to adoption, especially among small-scale farmers.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

The review involved peer-reviewed papers that appeared in the Scopus and the Web of Science databases and included the most recently published articles in the past 10 years (2013–2022). PM0.1 mainly originate from combustion processes such as in motor vehicles. The highest mass concentration of PM0.1 occurs during the dry season, in which open fires occur in some regions of Thailand. The northern area of the country has higher PM0.1 mass concentrations, followed by the central and southern areas. Carbonaceous nanoaerosols are produced during normal periods, and the proportions of organic to elemental carbon and char to soot suggest that these originate from motor vehicles. However, in haze periods, biomass fires can also produce carbon-containing particles. PM0.1 pollution from local and cross-border countries also needs to be considered. The overall conclusions reached will likely have a beneficial long-term impact on achieving a blue sky over Thailand through the development of coherent policies and managing new air pollution challenges and sharing knowledge with a broader audience.","fluidex; related topics, aerosols, environmental",Environmental Science (miscellaneous)

From the optimization experiments, it was found that the extraction using the MW irradiation at 300 W for 3 min produced the extract with high and reproducible brazilin content which could be readily used for the synthesis of AuNPs. Under the optimal synthesis conditions, roughly spherical CS-AuNPs with an average diameter size of 49.6 nm and acceptable 28-day stability were obtained within only 1 min. The resulting CS-AuNPs were capable of selective binding to Fe2+, Fe3+, and Al3+, leading to particle aggregation as well as noticeable change of color and shift of UV-Vis absorption maxima. From these results, CS-AuNPs could be fabricated via this fast, green, and efficient route. Furthermore, their potential application for colorimetric sensing of certain metal ions was preliminarily explored and proposed in this work.","mixing and separation, environmental, coastal engineering, energy, engineering","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

There are well documented motor and non-motor fluctuations, however, that occur almost inevitably once levodopa is started after a variable period in people with PD. Whilst brain neurodegenerative processes play a part in the pathogenesis of these fluctuations, a range of barriers across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can alter levodopa pharmacokinetics, ultimately contributing to non-optimal levodopa response and symptoms fluctuations. GI barriers to levodopa transport and absorption include dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, constipation, Helicobacter pylori infection, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gut dysbiosis. In addition, a protein-rich diet and concomitant medication intake can further alter levodopa pharmacokinetics. This can result in unpredictable or sub-optimal levodopa response, ‘delayed on’ or ‘no on’ phenomena. In this narrative review, we provided an overview on the plethora of GI obstacles to levodopa transport and absorption in PD and their implications on levodopa pharmacokinetics and development of motor fluctuations.

Lipopolysaccharide Tolerance Enhances Murine Norovirus Reactivation: An Impact of Macrophages Mainly Evaluated by Proteomic Analysis,"Makjaroen J., Phuengmaung P., Saisorn W., Udomkarnjananun S., Pisitkun T., Leelahavanichkul A.",2023-02-01,"Animals, Lipopolysaccharides, Liver, Macrophages, Mice, Norovirus, Proteomics, lipopolysaccharide tolerance, macrophages, murine norovirus, sepsis immune exhaustion, viral reactivation","Because of endotoxemia during sepsis (a severe life-threatening infection), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance (the reduced responses to the repeated LPS stimulation) might be one of the causes of sepsis-induced immune exhaustion (the increased susceptibility to secondary infection and/or viral reactivation). In LPS tolerance macrophage (twice-stimulated LPS, LPS/LPS) compared with a single LPS stimulation (N/LPS), there was (i) reduced energy of the cell in both glycolysis and mitochondrial activities (extracellular flux analysis), (ii) decreased abundance of the following proteins (proteomic analysis): (a) complex I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, (b) most of the glycolysis enzymes, (c) anti-viral responses with Myxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1) and Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (Isg15), (d) antigen presentation pathways, and (iii) the down-regulated anti-viral genes, such as Mx1 and Isg15 (polymerase chain reaction). To test the correlation between LPS tolerance and viral reactivation, asymptomatic mice with and without murine norovirus (MNV) infection as determined in feces were tested. In MNV-positive mice, MNV abundance in the cecum, but not in feces, of LPS/LPS mice was higher than that in N/LPS and control groups, while MNV abundance of N/LPS and control were similar. Additionally, the down-regulated Mx1 and Isg15 were also demonstrated in the cecum, liver, and spleen in LPS/LPS-activated mice, regardless of MNV infection, while N/LPS more prominently upregulated these genes in the cecum of MNV-positive mice compared with the MNV-negative group. In conclusion, defects in anti-viral responses after LPS tolerance, perhaps through the reduced energy status of macrophages, might partly be responsible for the viral reactivation. More studies on patients are of interest.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Material and Methods: Thirty-four OLP patients were randomized into two groups: Control (clobetasol propionate 0.05%) and PBM (660 nm, 100 mW, 177 J/cm2, 5 s, 0.5 J per point). Serum and saliva were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment (after 30 days) and evaluated using ELISA. The cytokine results were correlated with pain, clinical subtypes, and clinical scores of OLP. Results: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-α, and IL-4 levels were higher in saliva in relation to serum. IL-1β was the most concentrated cytokine in saliva, and a positive correlation with the severity of OLP was noticed. After treatment with corticosteroid, IL-1β in saliva decreased significantly. No modulation of all cytokines was observed after PBM. Conclusion: IL-1β appears to be an important cytokine involved in OLP pathogenesis. In addition, the mechanisms of action of PBM do not seem to be linked to the modulation of pro or anti-inflammatory cytokines at the end of treatment. It is possible that this events occurred early during treatment.","medical, dentistry","Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"
Structural modification of resveratrol analogue exhibits anticancer activity against lung cancer stem cells via suppression of Akt signaling pathway,"Thongsom S., Racha S., Petsri K., Ei Z.Z., Visuttijai K., Moriue S., Yokoya M., Chanvorachote P.",2023-12-01,"Cell Line, Tumor, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms, Molecular Docking Simulation, Neoplastic Stem Cells, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Reactive Oxygen Species, Resveratrol, Signal Transduction, Akt pathway, CSCs, Lung cancer, Molecular docking, Molecular dynamics simulations, Moscatilin, Resveratrol","Background: Compound with cancer stem cell (CSC)-suppressing activity is promising for the improvement of lung cancer clinical outcomes. Toward this goal, we discovered the CSC-targeting activity of resveratrol (RES) analog moscatilin (MOS). With slight structural modification from RES, MOS shows dominant cytotoxicity and CSC-suppressive effect. Methods: Three human lung cancer cell lines, namely H23, H292, and A549, were used to compare the effects of RES and MOS. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by the MTT assay and Hoechst33342/PI double staining. Anti-proliferative activity was determined by colony formation assay and cell cycle analysis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by fluorescence microscopy using DCFH2-DA staining. CSC-rich populations of A549 cells were generated, and CSC markers, and Akt signaling were determined by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to predict the possible binding of the compound to Akt protein. Results: In this study, we evaluated the effects of RES and MOS on lung cancer and its anti-CSC potential. Compared with RES, its analog MOS more effectively inhibited cell viability, colony formation, and induced apoptosis in all lung cancer cell lines (H23, H292, and A549). We further investigated the anti-CSC effects on A549 CSC-rich populations and cancer adherent cells (A549 and H23). MOS possesses the ability to suppress CSC-like phenotype of lung cancer cells more potent than RES. Both MOS and RES repressed lung CSCs by inhibiting the viability, proliferation, and lung CSC-related marker CD133. However, only MOS inhibits the CSC marker CD133 in both CSC-rich population and adherent cells. Mechanistically, MOS exerted its anti-CSC effects by inhibiting Akt and consequently restored the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and decreased the pluripotent transcription factors (Sox2 and c-Myc). Thus, MOS inhibits CSC-like properties through the repression of the Akt/GSK-3β/c-Myc pathway. Moreover, the superior inhibitory effects of MOS compared to RES were associated with the improved activation of various mechanism, such as cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, production of ROS-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of Akt activation. Notably, the computational analysis confirmed the strong interaction between MOS and Akt protein. MD simulations revealed that the binding between MOS and Akt1 was more stable than RES, with MM/GBSA binding free energy of − 32.8245 kcal/mol at its allosteric site. In addition, MOS interacts with Trp80 and Tyr272, which was a key residue in allosteric inhibitor binding and can potentially alter Akt activity. Conclusions: Knowledge about the effect of MOS as a CSC-targeting compound and its interaction with Akt is important for the development of drugs for the treatment of CSC-driven cancer including lung cancer.",medical,Complementary and Alternative Medicine

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatments, and clinical outcomes of Thai APL patients dominantly treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with a chemotherapy-based therapy. Methods: This was an eight-year prospective, observational study from nine academic hospitals in the Thai Acute Leukemia Working Group (TALWG) of the Thai Society of Hematology, which included newly diagnosed Thai APL patients, aged 18 years or older. The web-based registration collected baseline charateristic, and clinical outcomes. Results: From 992 newly diagnosed AML patients, 79 APL patients were enrolled in this study. Almost all subjects were de novo APL (94.9%), while the others were therapy-related APL. The commonest clinical presentation was disseminated intravascular coagulation (38%). One-third of the patients were categorized as high risk according to the initial WBC. Almost all patients received ATRA combined with idarubicin regimen. The complete response rate was as high as 95.7%, which translated into excellent four-year overall survival (OS) (75.6%) and four-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) (75.4%). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the older age and WBC count >20 × 109/L conferred a significantly unfavorable OS with the hazard ratios of 3.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–8.05) and 4.18 (95%CI: 1.69–10.35), respectively. Similarly, these two parameters remained independent of the poor prognosis factors for LFS. Conclusion: This report confirmed that APL had a favorable prognosis. However, advanced age and high WBC count >20 × 109/L contributed to a worse outcome.

Reactive drug administration (RDA), or presumptive treatment without testing, is an alternative approach, but better understanding regarding community acceptability and operational feasibility are needed. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted as part of a two-arm cluster randomized-controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of RDA targeting high-risk villages and forest workers for reducing Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum malaria in Thailand. Key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted virtually among key public health staff, village health volunteers (VHVs), and household members that implemented or received RDA activities. Transcriptions were reviewed, coded, and managed manually using Dedoose qualitative data analysis software, then underwent qualitative content analysis to identify key themes. Results: RDA was well accepted by household members and public health staff that implemented it. RDA participation was driven by fear of contracting malaria, eagerness to receive protection provided by malaria medicines, and the increased access to health care. Concerns were raised about the safety of taking malaria medicines without having an illness, particularly if underlying health conditions existed. Health promotion hospital (HPH) staff implementing RDA noted its operational feasibility, but highlighted difficulty in traveling to remote areas, and requested additional travel resources and hiring more VHVs. Other challenges were highlighted including the need for additional training for VHVs on malaria activities and the inability of HPH staff to conduct RDA due to other health priorities (e.g., Covid-19). More training and practice for VHVs were noted as ways to improve implementation of RDA. Conclusions: To maximize uptake of RDA, regular education and sensitization campaigns in collaboration with village leaders on the purpose and rationale of RDA will be critical. To alleviate safety concerns and increase participant safety, a rigorous pharmacovigilance program will be important. To accelerate uptake of RDA, trust between HPH staff and VHVs and the communities they serve must continue to be strengthened to ensure acceptance of the intervention. Trial registration: This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California San Francisco (19–28,060) and the local Ethics Committee for Research in Human Subjects at Tak Provincial Health office (009/63) and Kanchanaburi Provincial health office (Kor Chor 0032.002/2185).

Tregs play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The effects of VD3 on Treg-associated immune function were investigated in Thai patients in the early stages of CRC. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight patients were randomized to one of two groups: Untreated or treatment with VD3 for 3 months. Whole blood samples were collected at baseline, and at 1 and 3 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and the populations of forkhead box P3-positive Treg cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of Treg-associated cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Serum VD3 levels of the VD3treated group were significantly increased at 1 (p=0.017) and 3 months (p<0.001) compared to the untreated control group. The mean percentage of Tregs was maintained between 1 and 3 months in the VD3-treated group. At 3 months, the untreated group had significantly lower Treg levels than the VD3-treated group (p=0.043). Serum IL-10 levels of the VD3-treated group were statistically increased at 1 month compared to the control group (p=0.032). No significant difference in serum TGF-β1 levels was observed between the two groups. However, the TGF-β1 level in the VD3-treated group at 1 month was lower than that of the control. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that VD3 supplementation can maintain immune responses in the early stages of CRC, helping to control Treg function. Therefore, VD3 should be supplemented to maintain immune homeostasis, especially in patients with vitamin D deficiency.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Cancer Research"

The study is to evaluate the outcomes of primary prevention patients followed in centers with high and low concordance with the 2015 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement and 2019 focused update on optimal ICD programming and testing guidelines. Methods: Consecutive patients with primary prevention ICD implantation from two centers between 2014 and 2016 were included. One center was classified as high guideline concordance center (HGC) with 47% (146/310) of patients with initial ICD concordant with the guidelines, and the other center was classified as low guideline concordance center (LGC) with only 1% (2/178) of patients with guideline-concordant initial ICD programming. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess risk of first ICD therapy (ATP or shock), first ICD shock, and mortality. Results: A total of 488 patients were included (mean age, 66 ± 13 years). During a mean follow-up of 1.9 ± 0.9 years, patients followed at HGC were 63% less likely to receive any ICD therapy (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.42–0.99). There were no significant differences in the rate of first ICD shock (aHR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34–1.52) or mortality (aHR 1.19, 95% CI, 0.47–3.05). Conclusions: Compared to primary prevention patients followed at LGC, primary prevention ICD patients followed at HGC received a significantly lower rate of ICD therapy, mainly from ATP reduction, without a difference in mortality during follow-up.

This work implemented LSTM model, CNN model, BERT model and WangchanBERTa model to compare the effectiveness of checking the quality of Thai essay writing. Our experimental result shows that classification analysis compiled with WangchanBERTa can achieve high accuracy up to 90%. However, CNN model compiled with classification analysis can achieve high accuracy up to 87% while compiled with regression analysis can achieve high accuracy in the range 90%. In conclusion, the system that we proposed can predict the quality of Thai essays with high accuracy. Therefore, we recommended Wangchanberta model for classification problem and CNN model for regression problem.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

Medical abortion is significant because it has revolutionized access to safe abortion care—abortion medicine can now be safely and effectively administered outside of a healthcare facility to women in early pregnancy. This contribution supports the pharmacists’ role in interprofessional safe abortion teamwork. Adequate knowledge of the current laws regarding safe abortion services will increase pharmacists’ competence in providing services. However, safe abortions as a subject have not been formally incorporated into the curriculum for Thai pharmacy students. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and intended practice of fifth-year pharmacy students at Chulalongkorn University. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic self-administered questionnaire adapted from previously published studies to evaluate participants’ knowledge of the recently amended Thai abortion law, attitude toward abortion, and intended practices. The invitations were sent to all fifth-year pharmacy students at Chulalongkorn University. Results: Among all invitations sent, 104/150 (69.3%) participants responded to the survey. Only a third of the participants (31.7%) had good knowledge scores. Based on five questions regarding the gestational age limit for legal abortion, most participants (52.7%) answered questions incorrectly. Although more than half of the participants (52.5%) disagreed with two pro-choice statements, an overwhelming majority (87.5%) agreed that abortion was a woman’s right. Safe abortion services were mostly agreed upon with serious fetal defects (91.9%), non-HIV maternal health conditions (82.2%), and sexual assaults (77.4%). A positive attitude toward abortion affects the intention to perform an abortion under socioeconomic conditions. Conclusion: Most participants lacked knowledge on the amended abortion law, especially on the gestational limits of abortion.

Herein, we report the successful preparation of chitin nanofibers (ChNFs) from shrimp shell waste using a partial deacetylation process with NaOH and high-speed blending. The effects of the deacetylation reaction with NaOH concentrations (0–40 wt%) on the degree of acetylation (DA), crystallinity, zeta potential, thermal stability, and morphology of the ChNFs were investigated. With the more aggressive deacetylation reaction (higher NaOH concentration), ChNFs had the lower DA, crystallinity degree, and thermal stability, and their widths and lengths became smaller and shorter. The presence of amino groups in the chitin molecule caused by deacetylation generated repulsive forces with aids of acetic acid, efficiently leading to the individualization of ChNFs using high-speed blending. The individualized ChNFs deacetylated with 30 wt% NaOH had an average width of 8.07 ± 1.80 nm and length of less than 500 nm, whereas bundles of aggregated fibers with widths in the range of 30–100 nm and lengths of up to several μm were extracted from chitin without deacetylation. Additionally, the deacetylation with 40 wt% NaOH completely converted chitin to chitosan. The ChNFs could be efficiently used for composites, biomaterials, and packaging applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)
Cross-Border Capacity Planning in Air Traffic Management Under Uncertainty,"Kunnen J.-R., Strauss A.K., Ivanov N., Jovanovic R., Fichert F., Starita S.",2023-07-01,"Air Traffic Management, Capacity planning, Capacity sharing, Cross-border capacities, European air traffic managements, Network costs, Routings, Simulation optimization, Uncertainty, Uncertainty in demand, air traffic management, capacity planning, simulation optimization","In European air traffic management (ATM), it is an important decision how much capacity to provide for each airspace, and it has to be made weeks or even months in advance of the day of operation. Given the uncertainty in demand that may materialize until then along with variability in capacity provision (e.g., due to weather), Airspace Users could face high costs of displacements (i.e., delays and reroutings) if capacity is not provided where and when needed. We propose a new capacity sharing scheme in which some proportion of overall capacities can be flexibly deployed in any of the airspaces of the same alliance (at an increased unit cost). This allows us to hedge against the risk of capacity underprovision. Given this scheme, we seek to determine the optimum budget for capacities provided both locally and in cross-border sharing that results in the lowest expected network costs (i.e., capacity and displacement costs). To determine optimum capacity levels, we need to solve a two-stage newsvendor problem: We first decide on capacities to be provided for each airspace, and after uncertain demand and capacity provision disruptions have materialized, we need to decide on the routings of flights (including delays) as well as the sector opening scheme of each airspace to minimize costs. We propose a simulation optimization approach for searching the most cost-efficient capacity levels (in the first stage), and a heuristic to solve the routing and sector opening problem (in the second stage), which is N P-hard. We test our approach in a large-sized simulation study based on real data covering around 3,000 flights across Western European airspace. We find that our stochastic approach significantly reduces network costs against a deterministic benchmark while using less computational resources. Experiments on different setups for capacity sharing show that total variable costs can be reduced by more than 8% if capacity is shared across borders: even though we require that no airspace can operate lower capacities under capacity sharing than without (this is to avoid substitution of expensive air traffic controllers with those in countries with a lower wage level). We also find that the use of different technology providers is a major obstacle to reap the benefits from capacity sharing and that sharing capacities across airspaces of the same country may instead be preferred.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, sociology","Civil and Structural Engineering, Transportation"

Although many of the introduced bone grafting materials have not been clinically evaluated, the use of the periosteum for bone regeneration has been documented in several clinical situations. Recently, the Micrograft concept, which was initially used to treat burn patients, where the tissue sample is cut into smaller pieces to expand the area that they can cover, has been applied to oral periosteal tissue for inclusion in scaffolds for bone defect healing, and was evaluated in various clinical bone augmentation procedures.

However, its role or that of its receptor [minieralocorticoid receptor (MR)] in other cardiovascular (CV) disease are less well described. To identify their potential roles in six CV conditions (heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, stroke, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis), we assessed these associations in the following four areas: (i) mechanistic studies in rodents and humans; (ii) pre-clinical studies of MR antagonists; (iii) clinical trials of MR antagonists; and (iv) genetics. The data were acquired from an online search of the National Library of Medicine using the PubMed search engine from January 2011 through June 2021. There were 3702 publications identified with 200 publications meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data strongly supported an association between heart failure and dysregulated aldosterone/MR. This association is not surprising given aldosterone/MR’s prominent role in regulating sodium/volume homeostasis. Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction are also associated with dysregulated aldosterone/MR, but less strongly. For the most part, the data were insufficient to determine whether there was a relationship between atherosclerosis, stroke, or thrombosis and aldosterone/MR dysregulation. This review clearly documented an expanding role for aldosterone/MR’s dysregulation in CV diseases beyond hypertension. How expansive it might be is limited by the currently available data. It is anticipated that with an increased focus on aldosterone/MR’s potential roles in these diseases, additional clinical and pre-clinical data will clarify these relationships, thereby, opening approaches to use modulators of aldosterone/MR’s action to more precisely treat these CV conditions.",medical,Medicine (all)

The wet biomass was utilized for direct transesterification using potassium carbonate as catalyst. The reaction parameters such as solvent to algae ratio, water addition, catalyst concentration, temperature, and reaction time parameters were optimized. Under optimized conditions (20 ml/g solvent to algae ratio, 40% water addition, 4% catalyst, 60 °C and 60 min), a yield of 93% methyl ester yield was achieved. The obtained methyl ester showed satisfactory fuel properties. The spent biomass after transesterification was further subjected to hydrolysis using H2SO4 combined with ultrasound. The sugar content in the hydrolysate accounted for 92% sugar recovery which was further used for the itaconic acid production using Aspergillus sp. The itaconic acid production was improved by altering the MgSO4 concentration in the medium. Addition of TCA cycle metabolites further enhanced the itaconic acid production. Under optimized conditions (50 g/l sugar, 5 ml inoculum, 0.4 g/l MgSO4, 4 mM citric acid, 37 °C for 7 days with 120 rpm), a maximum itaconic production yield of 0.0692 g/g of Scenedesmus sp. was achieved when 4 mM citric acid was added to the medium which suggested an important role of TCA cycle to supply intermediates for the synthesis of itaconic acid.","petroleum substitutes; other fuels; non-fossil fuels, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

However, studies of concern about fever in Asian countries are still limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore caregivers' attitudes, management of their child's fever, factors associated with their high concern, and expectation from medical services. METHODS: A cross-sectional 26-item self-administered questionnaire was used to survey caregivers of 1-month to 15-year-old febrile infants/children/teenagers visiting outpatient clinics in 9 government hospitals from July 2018 to August 2019. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and six caregivers (67% response rate) completed self-administered questionnaire. The median age of the caregivers and the pediatric patients were 34 years (interquartile range [IQR] 28-40) and 3.3 years (IQR 1.8-6.1), respectively. Approximately 70% of them believed that fever could harm a child, resulting in brain damage or death. Also, 2% managed high doses of acetaminophen and overdosed the child. The high level of concern was significantly associated with acetaminophen overdose (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Caregivers of nonhealth care providers and children's history of febrile seizure were factors related to higher score of concern. Most caregivers expected definite diagnosis (70.7%), antipyretic drugs (67.4%), and blood tests (48.9%). CONCLUSION: Caregivers' high concern of fever existed in Thailand. This may lead to unnecessary high doses of antipyretics. In clinical practice, the high concern of fever is a challenge for caregivers and pediatric health care providers. A better understanding of fever and its consequence should be advocated for proper management of the child's fever.",medical,Medicine (all)

Calcium carbonate, which is manufactured from limestone, is one of the substrates of tricalcium silicate. To avoid the environmental impact of mining, calcium carbonate can be obtained from biological sources, such as shelled mollusks, one of which is cockle shell. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the chemical, physical, and biological properties of a newly developed bioceramic cement derived from cockle shell (BioCement) with those of a commercial tricalcium silicate cement (Biodentine). Methods: BioCement was prepared from cockle shells and rice husk ash and its chemical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The physical properties were evaluated following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9917-1;2007 and 6876;2012. The pH was tested after 3 h to 8 weeks. The biological properties were assessed using extraction medium from BioCement and Biodentine on human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro. The 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay was used to evaluate cell cytotoxicity following ISO 10993-5;2009. Cell migration was examined using a wound healing assay. Alizarin red staining was performed to detect osteogenic differentiation. The data were tested for a normal distribution. Once confirmed, the physical properties and pH data were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the biological property data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. Results: The main components of BioCement and Biodentine were calcium and silicon. BioCement’s and Biodentine’s setting time and compressive strength were not different. The radiopacity of BioCement and Biodentine was 5.00 and 3.92 mmAl, respectively (p < 0.05). BioCement’s solubility was significantly higher than Biodentine. Both materials exhibited alkalinity (pH ranged from 9 to 12) and demonstrated > 90% cell viability with cell proliferation. The highest mineralization was found in the BioCement group at 7 days (p < 0.05). Conclusions: BioCement exhibited acceptable chemical and physical properties and was biocompatible to human dental pulp cells.

The polymer was characterized by NMR, and the inclusion complex between curcumin and β-cyclodextrin was confirmed by FTIR. The potential of this PNCDHA polymer complex as a drug delivery vehicle was supported by a curcumin encapsulation efficiency of 93.14 ± 5.6% and the release of encapsulated curcumin at 37 °C. At a concentration of 0.5% w/v in water, PNCDHA nanogels were biocompatible with fibroblast cell line (L929) up to a curcumin concentration of 50 µM. There was a direct concentration between curcumin loading and cellular internalization. A more detailed study of the cellular internalization of PNCDHA nanogel should be considered in order to clarify cellular delivery mechanisms and to assess how its viability as a carrier may be optimized.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The study aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective potentiality of Artabotrys odoratissimus, an important medicinal shrub from the family Annonaceae. The phenolic compounds from bark ethanol extract (BEE) were detected using RP-HPLC. The in vitro hepatoprotective activity against ethanol-induced damage was studied in HepG2 cells with cell viability assays, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, double staining assay and western blotting. The in vivo mice model was used to evaluate the alcohol-induced stress with liver function enzymes, lipid profile and histopathology. All the thirteen phenolic compounds detected with HPLC were docked onto protein targets such as aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NO). The RP-HPLC detected the presence of various phenolics including rutin, chlorogenic acid and catechin, amongst others. Co-administration of BEE with ethanol alleviated cell death, ROS and MMP in HepG2 cells compared to the negative control. The extract also modulated the MAP kinase/caspase-3 pathway, thereby showing protective effects in HepG2 cells. Also, pre-treatment for 14 days with the extract in the mice model before a single toxic dose (5 g/kg body weight) reduced the liver injury by bringing the levels of liver function enzymes, lipid profile and bilirubin to near normal. In silico analysis revealed that rutin showed the best binding affinity with all the target proteins in the study. These results provide evidence that BEE possesses significant hepatoprotective effects against ethanol-induced oxidative stress in hepatic cells and in vivo models, which is further validated with in silico analysis.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Immunology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Molecular Biology"

But we believe that each person has a different sleeping pattern. So, in this paper, we presented a classification of sleep behavior based on a cluster of sleep quality. We first clustered people who have similar sleep patterns using the Principal Component Analysis technique and K-means algorithm. Then, we used Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithm to classify sleep behavior. We performed models from the analysis with Leave-one-out cross-validation.

Epigenetic Gene-Regulatory Loci in Alu Elements Associated with Autism Susceptibility in the Prefrontal Cortex of ASD,"Saeliw T., Kanlayaprasit S., Thongkorn S., Songsritaya K., Sanannam B., Sae-Lee C., Jindatip D., Hu V.W., Sarachana T.",2023-04-01,"Alu Elements, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, DNA Methylation, DNA Transposable Elements, Epigenesis, Genetic, Humans, Prefrontal Cortex, Alu elements, autism spectrum disorder, DNA methylation, epigenetic mechanism, retrotransposons, transposable elements","Alu elements are transposable elements that can influence gene regulation through several mechanisms; nevertheless, it remains unclear whether dysregulation of Alu elements contributes to the neuropathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, we characterized transposable element expression profiles and their sequence characteristics in the prefrontal cortex tissues of ASD and unaffected individuals using RNA-sequencing data. Our results showed that most of the differentially expressed transposable elements belong to the Alu family, with 659 loci of Alu elements corresponding to 456 differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of ASD individuals. We predicted cis- and trans-regulation of Alu elements to host/distant genes by conducting correlation analyses. The expression level of Alu elements correlated significantly with 133 host genes (cis-regulation, adjusted p < 0.05) associated with ASD as well as the cell survival and cell death of neuronal cells. Transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of differentially expressed Alu elements are conserved and associated with autism candidate genes, including RORA. COBRA analyses of postmortem brain tissues showed significant hypomethylation in global methylation analyses of Alu elements in ASD subphenotypes as well as DNA methylation of Alu elements located near the RNF-135 gene (p < 0.05). In addition, we found that neuronal cell density, which was significantly increased (p = 0.042), correlated with the expression of genes associated with Alu elements in the prefrontal cortex of ASD. Finally, we determined a relationship between these findings and the ASD severity (i.e., ADI-R scores) of individuals with ASD. Our findings provide a better understanding of the impact of Alu elements on gene regulation and molecular neuropathology in the brain tissues of ASD individuals, which deserves further investigation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (combi-CLEAs) derived from levansucrase and variant inulosucrase are highly efficient catalysts for the synthesis of levan-type fructooligosaccharides,"Charoenwongpaiboon T., Wangpaiboon K., Field R.A., Prousoontorn M., Pichyangkura R.",2023-01-15,"Bioactive oligosaccharides, Chains length, Cross-linked enzyme aggregates, Efficient catalysts, Fructans, Fructo-oligosaccharides, High molecular weight, Inulosucrase, Levansucrase, Synthesised, Fructooligosaccharide, Inulosucrase, Levansucrase","Efficient and convenient access to short to medium chain length levan-type fructooligosaccharides (LFOS) is needed in order realise the nutritional potential of this class of bioactive oligosaccharides. While LFOS are synthesised by fructansucrase enzymes, these reactions are routinely associated with high molecular weight fructan polymer formation. Recent studies have shown that FOS production can be enhanced by the combination of levansucrase and inulosucrase in a one-pot reaction. In the present study, the novel mixed enzyme cross-linked enzyme aggregates (combi-CLEAs) based on levansucrase (Lev) and N543A variant inulosucrase (Inu) were prepared by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The effect of Lev and Inu ratio on the activity of combi-CLEAs was explored. The results showed that >70% of total sucrase activity was recovered after immobilization and that the combi-CLEAs produced high amounts of LFOS (degree of polymerisation 3 to 21), while high molecular weight polysaccharide production was much reduced. Biochemical characterisation indicated that the optimum pH and temperature of combi-CLEAs (pH 5.5 and 50ᵒC, respectively) were comparable to those of free enzyme; however, the stability of the enzyme was improved. In addition, these combi-CLEAs have operational stability for several reaction cycles, which makes them very attractive for biotechnology applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Degradation of DEHP by bacteria from several environments have been studied, but little is known about marine sediment bacteria that can degrade DEHP and other phthalate plasticizers. Therefore, in this study, we enriched a bacterial consortium C10 that can degrade four phthalate plasticizers of varying alkyl chain lengths (DEHP, dibutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, and dimethyl phthalate) from marine sediment. The major bacterial genera in C10 during degradation of the phthalate plasticizers were Glutamicibacter, Ochrobactrum, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Methylophaga. Growth of C10 on DEHP intermediates (mono-ethylhexyl phthalate, 2-ethylhexanol, phthalic acid, and protocatechuic acid) was studied and these intermediates enhanced the Brevibacterium, Ochrobactrum, Achromobacter, Bacillus, Sporosarcina, and Microbacterium populations. Using a network-based approach, we predicted that Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Microbacterium interacted cooperatively and were the main degraders of phthalate plasticizers. Through selective isolation techniques, we obtained twenty isolates belonging to Bacillus, Microbacterium, Sporosarcina, Micrococcus, Ochrobactrum, Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes, and Cytobacillus. The best DEHP-degraders were Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila OR13, Microbacterium esteraromaticum OR16, Sporosarcina sp.

This is the first report of DEHP degradation by all four bacteria and, thus, our findings reveal as yet unknown PAE-degradation capabilities of marine sediment bacteria. This study provides insights into how bacterial communities adapt to degrade or resist the toxicities of different PAEs and demonstrates a simple approach for the prediction and isolation of potential pollutant degraders from complex and dynamic bacterial communities.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

We compared sensitivities of the ISEs to determine the best material for the fabrication process of the ISEs. The electrode surfaces were modified with various carbon nanomaterials including multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black, and their mixed suspensions as the intermediate layer to enhance sensitivities of the electrodes. An automated 3D-printed robot was used for the drop-cast procedure during ISE fabrication to eliminate manual steps.

However, bleeding, the main side effect, is associated with prolonged hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, assessment of the incidence of bleeding and associated risk factors is crucial in developing an appropriate treatment plan to prevent bleeding. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with ACS admitted to a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand between 2011 and 2015 and received enoxaparin. To estimate the incidence of bleeding events, patients were followed up for 30 days from the first enoxaparin dose. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with bleeding events. Results: From a total of 602 patients, the incidence of bleeding was 15.8%, of which 5.7% involved major bleeding. The risk factors for any form of bleeding were aged at least 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 3.36), history of bleeding (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.24 to 11.55), and history of oral anticoagulant exposure (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.74 to 12.86).

Hence, we have attempted to introduce new imidazole appended bithiophene benzothiazole-based fluorescent sensor 2-(5′-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-[2,2-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[d]thiazole (DIBT), for the fluorescence ratiometric recognition of Al3+ ions in an aqueous medium (acetonitrile/water 8:2 v/v). We employed Job's plot experiments to study the mode of complexation of the sensor DIBT with Al3+ ions. The ratio of binding stoichiometry of the DIBT + Al3+ complex was found to be 1:1. The mode of binding was further verified using the 1H NMR titration experiments and HRMS analysis. The detection limit of DIBT with Al3+ was found to be 13.7 nM. We performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations to get in-depth insights into the mechanical aspects. The chelation-enhanced fluorescence type sensor DIBT was analyzed for its practical application in real water and pharmaceutical samples. The sensor DIBT can effectively track Al3+ ions in live Escherichia coli (E-coli) bacterial cells.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
End-to-End Smart EV Charging Framework: Demand Forecasting and Profit Maximization With Causal Information Enhancement,"Udomparichatr P., Vateekul P., Rojviboonchai K.",2023-01-01,"Causal information, Charging station, Demand forecasting, Electric vehicle charging, End to end, Machine-learning, Model-predictive control, Smart charging, Uncertainty, Vehicle users, causal information, machine learning, model predictive control, Smart charging, uncertainty","Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles (EV) is a method of optimizing the EV charging schedule. As a result, it can provide more profit for EV charging stations. This profit usually comes from reducing the peak demand charge cost while still satisfying the EV user demand. Most charging stations let EV users input their demand. However, users can intentionally or unintentionally poorly estimate their demand, leading to lower profit for EV charging stations. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework of Smart Charging that aims to maximize the profit of charging stations while satisfying EV user demand. Our framework consists of two main modules. First, the demand forecasting module focuses on predicting the EV user's energy demand and session duration using various machine learning techniques, e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and TabNet. Second, the EV charging schedule optimization based on model predictive control (MPC) has been employed to optimize the charging schedule. The optimization module has been further improved by using the feedback from causal information and behavior of EV charging profiles called Constant Current Constant Voltage (CC-CV). The experiment was conducted on simulation with real EV charging data. The results show that our framework outperforms the baseline with higher profits of 616.28 a month, a 27.18% improvement. In addition, our forecasting module can avoid user biases from user inputs and predicts more accurately-the winning model is XGBoost with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 10.72% and 11.85% for session duration and energy demand, respectively.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, energy, engineering, physics","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation, Artificial Intelligence"

The anti-solvent precipitation method was applied to fabricate a zein-sodium alginate (SA) binary complexes delivery system with the loading of RF, which was aimed to enhance the delivery efficiency, stability, and controlled release of RF in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The formation mechanism, physicochemical properties as well as the digestion behaviors were investigated. The incorporation of SA significantly increased the diameter and decreased the surface positive charge of the nanoparticles. The surface morphology of the nanoparticles was characterized using the scanning electron microscope. The FTIR analysis revealed that the electrostatic attraction was the dominant binding force in the formation of the zein-SA binary complexes nanoparticles. In addition, the study on the in vitro release process showed that the zein-SA nanoparticles could delay the release of the RF under the simulated GI tract conditions, which improved their oral bioavailability.

However, its toxicological profile is still limited, especially regarding embryotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the developmental toxicity of sesamin in zebrafish embryos. After 72 h exposure, sesamin did not affect the survival and hatching rates, nor did it cause malformation in zebrafish embryos. Cardiotoxicity was also evaluated by monitoring embryo heartbeats and erythrocyte staining using o-dianisidine. The results showed that sesamin did not affect heart morphology, heart rate, or cardiac output in zebrafish embryos. The present study also evaluated sesamin's anti-angiogenesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities. Sesamin significantly decreased the sub-intestinal vessel plexus as revealed by alkaline phosphatase staining indicating the compound exhibited anti-angiogenesis activity. For the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assays, oxidative stress and inflammation in zebrafish embryos were induced by hydrogen peroxide and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production were detected using a fluorescent dye. Sesamin significantly decreased ROS and NO production in zebrafish embryos. In addition, the transcription examination by qRT-PCR of oxidative- and inflammation-related genes showed that sesamin affected the genes in a manner that correlated with results from the efficacy assays. In conclusion, the present study revealed that sesamin did not cause embryotoxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos.

Two models, one conducted in the rural USA (5-year period) and another in China (35-year period), found artificial intelligence to be more cost-effective than without screening for diabetic retinopathy. Two additional models, which compared artificial intelligence with human screeners in Brazil and Thailand for the lifetime of patients, found artificial intelligence to be more expensive from a healthcare system perspective. In the Thailand analysis, however, artificial intelligence was less expensive when opportunity loss from blindness was included. An artificial intelligence model for screening retinopathy of prematurity was cost-effective in the USA. A model for screening age-related macular degeneration in Japan and another for primary angle close in China did not find artificial intelligence to be cost-effective, compared with no screening. The costs of artificial intelligence varied widely in these models.SummaryLike other medical fields, there is limited evidence in assessing the value of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology and more appropriate HEE models are needed.",medical,Ophthalmology

The current work employed a reducing agent derived from turmeric extract to design an environmentally friendly and cost-effective plant-mediated method for producing silver-doped titanium dioxide (Ag-TiO2) for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). The green synthesis of Ag-TiO2 was carried out utilizing a dry and wet ball milling sol-gel method with turmeric extract. The effect of varying Ag concentrations in Ag-TiO2 on MB degradation was investigated. According to our findings, the optimal amount of Ag on TiO2 modification resulted in an increase in surface area, an improvement in visible light absorption, and a decrease in the TiO2 bandgap. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results showed the presence of Ag+ in the TiO2 structure, indicating Ag substitution and oxygen vacancy formation in TiO2. Ag NPs could considerably increase the electron–hole separation and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of the Ag-TiO2. The 3 %Ag-TiO2 provided the highest photocatalytic activity for 80 % MB degradation under visible light for 9 h. The method presented here leads to a straightforward and environmentally benign route to make visible-light-active Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles and can be used for treatment of wastewater.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

However, a head-to-head comparison between both sugars on health impact is still lacking, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum dfa1 has never been tested, and has recently been isolated from healthy volunteers. The mice were administered with the high glucose or fructose preparation in standard mouse chaw with or without L. plantarum dfa1 gavage, on alternate days, and in vitro experiments were performed using enterocyte cell lines (Caco2) and hepatocytes (HepG2). After 12 weeks of experiments, both glucose and fructose induced a similar severity of obesity (weight gain, lipid profiles, and fat deposition at several sites) and prediabetes condition (fasting glucose, insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA score)). However, fructose administration induced more severe liver damage (serum alanine transaminase, liver weight, histology score, fat components, and oxidative stress) than the glucose group, while glucose caused more prominent intestinal permeability damage (FITC-dextran assay) and serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) compared to the fructose group. Interestingly, all of these parameters were attenuated by L. plantarum dfa1 administration. Because there was a subtle change in the analysis of the fecal microbiome of mice with glucose or fructose administration compared to control mice, the probiotics altered only some microbiome parameters (Chao1 and Lactobacilli abundance). For in vitro experiments, glucose induced more damage to high-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 µg/mL) to enterocytes (Caco2 cell) than fructose, as indicated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), supernatant cytokines (TNF-α and IL-8), and glycolysis capacity (by extracellular flux analysis). Meanwhile, both glucose and fructose similarly facilitated LPS injury in hepatocytes (HepG2 cell) as evaluated by supernatant cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) and extracellular flux analysis. In conclusion, glucose possibly induced a more severe intestinal injury (perhaps due to LPS-glucose synergy) and fructose caused a more prominent liver injury (possibly due to liver fructose metabolism), despite a similar effect on obesity and prediabetes. Prevention of obesity and prediabetes with probiotics was encouraged.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed at 30 °C and the pressure was varied from 1 to 40 bar. The results showed that the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume showed a correlation trend indicating the increase with increasing silica templates up to 40 % and the carbon samples contained nitrogen functionalities on the surface (pyrrolic and pyridonic nitrogen, pyridinic nitrogen, and oxidized nitrogen). After CO2 activation, the nitrogen functionalities are still present on the surface of the porous carbon and the sample based on 40 wt% of silica (AC40%Si-800) exhibited the greatest SSA (1,391 m2/g) with extremely large pore volume (3.77 cm3/g). This led to the largest amount of CO2 uptake (25.07 mmol/g at 40 bar) recorded to date. For the first time, the computational study revealed that only pyridinic nitrogen (N-6) is capable of chemically adsorbing CO2 molecules via Lewis acid-base interaction, which synergistically enhanced the adsorption capability.","mixing and separation, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

LHH calculations posited that rc-EAMOWFR was 34 times more likely to prevent LE than to cause RH, regardless of fracture symptoms. Our results conformed to those of other 15 studies. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that all IMOWFs be treated. rc-EAMOWFR performed in every 68 IMOWFs would be at risk of one RH event, but prevent 34 eyes from LE due to untreated fractures. Nearly 72% of untreated IMOWFs develop LE after 9 months.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

A systematic review of the literature to develop an algorithm formulated by key opinion leaders. Objective. This study aimed to analyze currently available data and propose a decision-making algorithm for full-endoscopic lumbar discectomy for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH) to help surgeons choose the most appropriate approach [transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TELD) or interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy (IELD)] for patients. Summary of Background Data. Full-endoscopic discectomy has gained popularity in recent decades. To our knowledge, an algorithm for choosing the proper surgical approach has never been proposed. Materials and Methods. A systematic review of the literature using PubMed and MeSH terms was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Patient samples included patients with LDH treated with full-endoscopic discectomy. The inclusion criteria were interventional research (randomized and nonrandomized trials) and observation research (cohort, case-control, case series). Exclusion criteria were case series and technical reports. The criteria used for selecting patients were grouped and analyzed. Then, an algorithm was generated based on these findings with support and reconfirmation from key expert opinions. Data on overall complications were collected. Outcome measures included zone of herniation, level of herniation, and approach (TELD or IELD). Results. In total, 474 articles met the initial screening criteria. The detailed analysis identified the 80 best-matching articles; after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 53 articles remained for this review. Conclusions. The proposed algorithm suggests a TELD for LDH located in the foraminal or extraforaminal zones at upper and lower levels and for central and subarticular discs at the upper levels considering the anatomic foraminal features and the craniocaudal pathology location. An IELD is preferred for LDH in the central or subarticular zones at L4/L5 and L5/S1, especially if a high iliac crest or high-grade migration is found.","orthopedic surgery, medical","Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Neurology (clinical)"
Repurposing Disposable Bamboo Chopsticks Waste as Biochar for Agronomical Application,Wijitkosum S.,2023-01-01,"Biochar, Circular economy, Disposable bamboo chopstick, Disposables, Physicochemical property, Pyrolysis temperature, Soil supplementary, Urban waste upcycling, Urban wastes, Wooden biochar, circular economy, disposable bamboo chopsticks (DBCs), soil supplementary, urban waste upcycling, wooden biochar","Disposable bamboo chopsticks (DBCs) are rarely recycled, and there are not many options for recycling them. Some treatment processes use high technology and complex processes that are not convenient for production at the local level, resulting in practical difficulties in upcycling DBC waste. DBC is lignocellulosic biomass; therefore, DBC has the potential to be recycled and upcycled. The waste management of wood that transforms it into a sustainable material as a biochar with a pyrolysis process accords well with the circular economy model. This research effort aims to upcycle DBC to convert it into biochar with different pyrolysis temperature ranges set at 400 °C (DBC-400), 450 °C (DBC-450), and 500 °C (DBC-500), with a holding time of 60 min. The morphology and essential physicochemical properties of the biochar were analyzed. The research found that all biochar had physicochemical properties and structures appropriate to the agricultural and environmental purposes. Based on the molar ratio of the O/C and H/C, it was indicated that all DBC biochar could persist in the soil for 100 to 1000 years. The DBC-500 had the least hydrophilic surface of biochar, while the DBC-400 had a lower degree of carbonization and aromaticity of biochar. The research concluded that biochar produced at 450 °C had the best properties for supplementary soil and soil treatment, given the cation exchange capacity, specific surface area, average pore diameter, and nutrient content. For future research on the practical application of DBC biochar for agronomical purposes, the results of the properties of DBC biochar with appropriate pyrolysis temperature will lead to the development of a biochar furnace with appropriate technology that is suitable for the local area to be able to produce large amounts of biochar that is effectively DBC. In addition, determining the absorption and release rate of the macronutrients of biochar can predict the frequency of biochar applied in agricultural areas.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Since systemic metabolic dysfunction underlies its pathogenesis, the term metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed for this condition. MAFLD is closely intertwined with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherogenic dyslipidemia, which are established cardiovascular risk factors. Unlike CVD, which has received attention in the literature on fatty liver disease, the CVD risk associated with MAFLD is often underestimated, especially among Cardiologists. Methods and results: A multidisciplinary panel of fifty-two international experts comprising Hepatologists, Endocrinologists, Diabetologists, Cardiologists and Family Physicians from six continents (Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Oceania) participated in a formal Delphi survey and developed consensus statements on the association between MAFLD and the risk of CVD. Statements were developed on different aspects of CVD risk, ranging from epidemiology to mechanisms, screening, and management. Conculsions: The expert panel identified important clinical associations between MAFLD and the risk of CVD that could serve to increase awareness of the adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes of MAFLD. Finally, the expert panel also suggests potential areas for future research.",medical,Hepatology

The tetragonal structure with the space group of P4/nmm is demonstrated thermodynamically stable within the harmonic level. Arising particularly from the relative enthalpy, hafnium dioxide allotrope is taken into account in appraising the dynamic stability. Following this, the phonon calculations display that hafnium dioxide allotrope is dynamically stable under compressed conditions. Along with electronic properties, the band structure and density of states demonstrate that hafnium dioxide allotrope is semiconductor. Besides, the more significant change in the shape of density of states is observed when the increase in pressure, by adopting an effect of this electronic topological transition, resulting in the energy gap decreased monotonically. By inspecting their elastic constants and Vicker's hardness, the P4/nmm structure displayed the Vicker's hardness of 26.1 GPa at a pressure of 200 GPa. These findings suggest HfO2 is more likely to be attained experimentally and theoretically in metal oxides family.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Placenta-derived EVs can be detected in maternal circulation at as early as six weeks of gestation, and their release can be triggered by the oxygen level and glucose concentration. Placental-associated complications such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and gestational diabetes have alterations in placenta-derived EVs in maternal plasma, and this can be used as a liquid biopsy for the diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring of such pregnancy complications. Alpha-thalassemia major (“homozygous alpha-thalassemia-1”) or hemoglobin Bart’s disease is the most severe form of thalassemia disease, and this condition is lethal for the fetus. Women with Bart’s hydrops fetalis demonstrate signs of placental hypoxia and placentomegaly, thereby placenta-derived EVs provide an opportunity for a non-invasive liquid biopsy of this lethal condition. In this article, we introduced clinical features and current diagnostic markers of Bart’s hydrops fetalis, extensively summarize the characteristics and biology of placenta-derived EVs, and discuss the challenges and opportunities of placenta-derived EVs as part of diagnostic tests for placental complications focusing on Bart’s hydrop fetalis.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Most current methods require sophisticated laboratory instruments and specialists to provide reliable, cost-effective, specific, and sensitive POC testing for COVID-19 diagnosis. Here, a smartphone-assisted Sensit Smart potentiostat (PalmSens) was integrated with a paper-based electrochemical sensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A disposable paper-based device was fabricated, and the working electrode directly modified with a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) as the biological recognition element to capture the target complementary DNA (cDNA). In the presence of the target cDNA, hybridization with acpcPNA probe blocks the redox conversion of a redox reporter, leading to a decrease in electrochemical response correlating to SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.1 to 200 nM and a detection limit of 1.0 pM were obtained. The PNA-based electrochemical paper-based analytical device (PNA-based ePAD) offers high specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 N gene because of the highly selective PNA-DNA binding. The developed sensor was used for amplification-free SARS-CoV-2 detection in 10 nasopharyngeal swab samples (7 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 3 SARS-CoV-2 negative), giving a 100% agreement result with RT-PCR.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry
Can 210Pb be used as a paleo-storm proxy?,"Burnett W.C., Bidorn B., Wang Y.",2023-09-01,"210pb, Decadal timescale, Overwash, Scientific community, Shoreline erosion, Storm deposits, Thailand, Time-scales, Tropical cyclone, Tropical cyclone records, 210Pb, Decadal time scale, Shoreline erosion, Thailand, Tropical cyclones","There is increasing interest within the scientific community, as well as the public, to determine if tropical cyclones are increasing in frequency and/or magnitude because of climate change. Unfortunately, the instrumental weather record only extends over the last 100–150 years depending upon location. It is thus desirable to develop paleo-storm proxies to extend the tropical cyclone record to hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Overwash sand deposits, sediment grain size, and various geochemical parameters (e.g., δ13C, δ15N, C/N) have been applied successfully for coastal lake sediments. We present here another potential proxy candidate, the natural radionuclide 210Pb. With a 22.2-year half-life, 210Pb age dating is often used to calibrate other proxies over essentially the same period as the instrumental storm record. We hypothesize here that trends in the 210Pb profiles, in addition to providing chronological information, can provide independent records of storm deposits in some situations. To illustrate how 210Pb may serve as an additional storm proxy, we present data from sediment cores collected from the Chao Phraya Delta (Upper Gulf of Thailand), an area characterized by a rapidly retreating shoreline. Some of the 210Pb profiles mark sedimentary layers with anomalously low excess 210Pb activities interspersed between layers with significant excess activities. We suggest that these layers may result from rapid deposition offshore of older storm-eroded shoreline material. The estimated ages of these 210Pb-deficient layers match, within estimated uncertainties, years when typhoons or tropical storms are reported to have severely eroded the nearby Thai coastline. The matching of the time scales of 210Pb and recorded tropical cyclones, both about 100–150 years, allows this approach to be used to explore for storm deposits and tune geochemical and other proxies for extended study over time scales of several decades or longer.","environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, arts, sociology, earth sciences","Global and Planetary Change, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Archeology (arts and humanities), Archeology, Geology"

Herein, the electrochemical reduction of acetic acid using in-situ electrodeposited Ag/Cu to nanocrystalline carbon products was investigated as a function of AgNO3 concentrations in the presence of water and [BMIM]+[BF4]- ionic liquid. Under the conditions used, the deposited Ag clusters could become negatively charged and were responsible for the reduction of acetic acid and the consequent crystalline carbon growth. Increasing Ag concentrations did not only result in higher amounts of Ag being deposited but also created significant local pressure on the atomistic level, where the crystalline carbon was formed, resulting in the re-ordering of carbon atoms into nanodiamond structure. The presence of nanodiamond with average crystallite size 27 nm was clearly evidenced by XRD, Raman, XPS, and TEM-EDX-SAED. The in-situ electrochemical reduction has shown to be an effective ultra-low energy strategy to produce crystalline solid carbon under ambient conditions.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

It is characterized by low shear stress resistance, poor aqueous/organic solubility and gastrointestinal digestibility which limit its ease of processing and functionality display as an oral drug delivery vehicle. Modulation of starch composition through genetic engineering primarily alters amylose-to-amylopectin ratio. Greater molecular properties changes require chemical and enzymatic modifications of starch. Acetylation reduces water solubility and enzymatic digestibility of starch. Carboxymethylation turns starch acid-insoluble and aggregative at low pHs. The summative effects are sustaining drug release in the upper gut. Acid-insoluble carboxymethylated starch can be aminated to provide an ionic character essential for hydrogel formation which further reduces its drug release. Ionic starch can coacervate with oppositely charged starch, non-starch polyelectrolyte or drug into insoluble, controlled-release complexes. Enzymatically debranched and resistant starch has a small molecular size which confers chain aggregation into a helical hydrogel network that traps the drug molecules, protecting them from biodegradation.

Qualitative research can contribute to a better understanding of the lived experiences of dissociation. This study focused on the experiences of dissociation in the context of CSA. In all, 22 female incest survivors, all diagnosed with different dissociative disorders, provided narratives about their experiences of dissociation. The narratives were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The narrative analysis revealed four central themes. The first theme deals with reliving the experience of the abuse. The second theme refers to the experience of disconnection from the body, the self, and the surroundings. The third theme covers the lack of coherence in the narrative, and the fourth theme describes the bridge between voluntary controlled and nonvoluntary uncontrolled use of dissociation. The data are discussed in light of several traumagenic constructs, including a lack of self-sense, being entrapped in a victim–aggressor relationship, and distorted time perception. It is suggested that the extent to which participants can control their dissociation and the coherency of their narratives reflects the severity of their dissociation.

At the same time WLO can converted to synthesis gas using steam reforming. In this study, catalytic steam reforming of WLO was performed in a micro fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Ni and Fe metals were loaded in a ratio of 5% and 10% on dolomite and olivine catalysts through impregnation method. The effects of equivalent ratio (ER) and metal (Ni and Fe) loadings on dolomite and olivine supported catalysts were investigated. Carbon-hydrogen conversions were significantly affected by ER with the optimum data at 0.88, which resulted in low CH4, and high H2 and CO. Nonetheless, the 5%Ni/dolomite exhibited superior overall activity with the highest overall conversion and hydrogen yield. In this case, hydrogen and carbon conversions were 65.71% and 66.38%, respectively, while H2 to CO molar ratio was 1.05 and the lower heating value was 6.76 MJ/m3. Hence, this suggests that the surface-active site of Ni on dolomite has high activity for C–C cleavage and water gas shift reaction. The conversion to H2 and CO was improved through methane and hydrocarbon steam reforming on the catalyst surface. Catalytic reforming of WLO not only enhanced synthesis gas generation which can be readily used as energy, a partial source of H2 or chemical feedstock but also as an appealing, sustainable, and economical waste management alternative.","process equipment, chemistry, energy","Analytical Chemistry, Fuel Technology"

Although mangiferin has been reported to inhibit many targets, none of the studies have investigated the inhibition of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), an attractive target for antimalarial and anticancer drugs. SHMT, one of the key enzymes in the deoxythymidylate synthesis cycle, catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-serine and (6S)-tetrahydrofolate (THF) into glycine and 5,10-methylene THF. Here, in vitro and in silico studies were used to probe how mangiferin isolated from mango leaves inhibits Plasmodium falciparum and human cytosolic SHMTs. The inhibition kinetics at pH 7.5 revealed that mangiferin is a competitive inhibitor against THF for enzymes from both organisms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations demonstrated the inhibitory effects of the deprotonated forms of mangiferin, specifically the C6-O- species and its resonance C9-O- species appearing at pH 7.5, combined with two docked poses, either a xanthone or glucose moiety, placed inside the THF-binding pocket. The MD analysis revealed that both C6-O- and its resonance-stabilized C9-O- species can favorably bind to SHMT in a similar fashion to THF, supporting the THF competitive inhibition of mangiferin. In addition, characterization of the proton dissociation equilibria of isolated mangiferin revealed that only three hydroxy groups of the xanthone moiety, C6-OH, C3-OH, and C7-OH, underwent varying degrees of deprotonation with pKa values of 6.38 ± 0.11, 8.21 ± 0.35, and 12.37 ± 0.30, respectively, while C1-OH remained protonated.

Generalizing a Small Facial Image Dataset Using Facial Generative Adversarial Networks for Stroke's Facial Weakness Screening,"Phienphanich P., Lerthirunvibul N., Charnnarong E., Munthuli A., Tantibundhit C., Suwanwela N.C.",2023-01-01,"Facial generative adversarial network, Facial images, Facial weakness, FAST, Image datasets, Medical conditions, Small data set, Stroke (medical condition), Stroke-screening, Video, Facial generative adversarial networks, facial weakness, FAST, small dataset, stroke-screening","Stroke is a medical emergency resulting from disruption of blood supply to different parts of the brain which leads to facial weakness and paralysis as the brain is the control center. Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability which significantly changes the patient's life. This paper introduces the use of facial image dataset containing neutral and smiling expressions to classify facial weakness which is a common sign of stroke. Our 'real facial image dataset' comprises of face images of normal subjects and stroke patients. However, to increase the dataset, we added another dataset known as 'FaceGAN dataset'. This additional dataset contains a pair of neutral and smiling facial image synthesized from public datasets which were augmented to generate two additional smiling images at eight different age groups. The faces were divided into left and right side using facial landmark detection technique and corrected for geometric distortions through affine transformation matrix from Delaunay triangulation. An autoencoder model composed of ConvNeXt encoder and ConvNet decoder was trained and used to fine-tune a facial weakness classification model from our proposed architecture. Results from four-fold cross validation showed that the model validation was less prone to overfitting when used with the FaceGAN dataset, with an average AUC of 0.76 and F1-score of 71.19%, compared to without FaceGAN data which only achieved an F1-score of 61.54%. This study shows that the FaceGAN can efficiently generalize models for programs with a small dataset for use with stroke detection. This work can be further improved and optimized for clinical application in the future.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Discovery of Novel EGFR Inhibitor Targeting Wild-Type and Mutant Forms of EGFR: In Silico and In Vitro Study,"Todsaporn D., Zubenko A., Kartsev V., Aiebchun T., Mahalapbutr P., Petrou A., Geronikaki A., Divaeva L., Chekrisheva V., Yildiz I., Choowongkomon K., Rungrotmongkol T.",2023-04-01,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, ErbB Receptors, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Molecular Docking Simulation, Mutation, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, cytotoxicity, drug screening, EGFR-TK, furopyridine, molecular dynamics","Targeting L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/C797S mutant EGFR is a critical challenge in developing EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors to overcome drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The discovery of next-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is therefore necessary. To this end, a series of furopyridine derivatives were evaluated for their EGFR-based inhibition and antiproliferative activities using computational and biological approaches. We found that several compounds derived from virtual screening based on a molecular docking and solvated interaction energy (SIE) method showed the potential to suppress wild-type and mutant EGFR. The most promising PD13 displayed strong inhibitory activity against wild-type (IC50 of 11.64 ± 1.30 nM), L858R/T790M (IC50 of 10.51 ± 0.71 nM), which are more significant than known drugs. In addition, PD13 revealed a potent cytotoxic effect on A549 and H1975 cell lines with IC50 values of 18.09 ± 1.57 and 33.87 ± 0.86 µM, respectively. The 500-ns MD simulations indicated that PD13 formed a hydrogen bond with Met793 at the hinge region, thus creating excellent EGFR inhibitory activity. Moreover, the binding of PD13 in the hinge region of EGFR was the major determining factor in stabilizing the interactions via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals (vdW). Altogether, PD13 is a promising novel EGFR inhibitor that could be further clinically developed as fourth-generation EGFR-TKIs.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Gal-3 mRNA and protein levels in synoviocytes, synovium, synovial fluid, and plasma of knee OA patients were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Signaling mechanism underlying inflammatory effect of Gal-3 was further elucidated in human knee OA synoviocytes. Clinical study uncovered significant increases in plasma and synovial fluid Gal-3 levels in knee OA patients, particularly those with advanced-stage. In knee OA patients, plasma Gal-3 was significantly associated with radiographic severity and indicators of body composition, physical performance, and knee pain and disability. In the inflamed synovium of knee OA patients, further analysis depicted a marked up-regulation of Gal-3 mRNA expression, consistent with immunohistochemical analysis showing localization of Gal-3 protein in the lining and sublining layers of the inflamed synovium. An in vitro study unveiled that aberrant Gal-3 mRNA expression was regulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in knee OA synoviocytes. Gal-3 significantly enhanced production of NO and IL-6, up-regulated mRNA expressions of IL-6, NF-κB, and MMP-13, and down-regulated mRNA expressions of ACAN and SOX-9 via stimulating Akt phosphorylation in knee OA synoviocytes.

This study aimed to investigate the enhancement of H2 production under nutrient deprivation. The results showed that nitrogen and potassium deprivation induced dark fermentative H2 production by A. halophytica, while no differences in H2 production were found under sulfur and phosphorus deprivation. In addition, deprivation of nitrogen and potassium resulted in the highest H2 production in A. halophytica due to the stimulation of hydrogenase activity. The effect of adaptation time under nitrogen and potassium deprivation on H2 production was investigated. The results showed that the highest H2 accumulation of 1,261.96 ± 96.99 µmol H2 g dry wt−1 and maximum hydrogenase activity of 179.39 ± 8.18 µmol H2 g dry wt−1 min−1 were obtained from A. halophytica cells adapted in the nitrogen- and potassium-deprived BG11 medium supplemented with Turk Island salt solution (BG110-K) for 48 h. An increase in hydrogenase activity was attributed to the decreased O2 concentration in the system, due to a reduction of photosynthetic O2 evolution rate and a promotion of dark respiration rate. Moreover, nitrogen and potassium deprivation stimulated glycogen accumulation and decreased specific activity of pyruvate kinase. Transcriptional analysis of genes involved in H2 metabolism using RNA-seq confirmed the above results. Several genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis (glgA, glgB, and glgP) were upregulated under both nitrogen and potassium deprivation, but genes regulating enzymes in the glycolytic pathway were downregulated, especially pyk encoding pyruvate kinase. Interestingly, genes involved in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPP) were upregulated. Thus, OPP became the favored pathway for glycogen catabolism and the generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which resulted in an increase in H2 production under dark anaerobic condition in both nitrogen- and potassium-deprived cells.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, medical, engineering","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Histology, Biomedical Engineering"

However, the pharmaceutical applications of BrCN are limited by its poor aqueous solubility. Methods: Molecular encapsulation of BrCN with beta-cyclodextrin (βCD) and its derivatives—2,6-di-O-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DMβCD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD)—was performed to enhance its water solubility, and the resulting inclusion complexes were characterized theoretically and experimentally. Significant findings: Molecular docking showed that BrCN adopted two possible orientations, namely chromone ring insertion (C-form) and phenyl ring insertion (P-form) inside the lipophilic cavities of βCD, DMβCD, and HPβCD. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM-GBSA) method suggested that βCD derivatives show better BrCN-encapsulating potential as evidenced by their lower binding free energy values. Phase solubility study indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry between BrCN and the hosts (AL type). The resulting inclusion complexes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. We noted that encapsulation with βCD, DMβCD, and HPβCD resulted in an approximately 27-fold, 92-fold and 104-fold increase in the aqueous solubility of BrCN, respectively and enhanced its anticancer activity against A549 and H1975 cancer cells.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

However, real-world data on Pola-based regimens in R/R DLBCL patients, especially in Thailand, are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pola-based salvage treatment in R/R DLBCL patients in Thailand. Thirty-five patients who received Pola-based treatment were included in the study, and their data were compared to 180 matched patients who received non-Pola-based therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) in the Pola group was 62.8%, with complete remission and partial remission rates of 17.1% and 45.7%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10.6 months and 12.8 months, respectively.

Vaccination is a very effective method for protecting fish against disease in aquaculture. Oral vaccination is an interesting route for vaccine delivery as it mimics the pathogenesis of S. agalactiae and provides convenient administration for mass vaccination of fish. Moreover, gut mucosal immunity is associated with a mucus layer on the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel cationic-based nanoemulsion vaccine containing bile salts (NEB) coated by chitosan (CS) and determined its physicochemical characterization, morphology, in vitro mucoadhesive property, permeability, and acid-base tolerance. In addition, the efficacy of NEB-CS as an oral vaccination for Nile tilapia was evaluated in order to investigate the innate immune response and protection against S. agalactiae. The groups of fish consisted of: (1) deionized water as a non-vaccinated control (Control); (2) an inactivated vaccine formulated from formalin-killed bacteria (IB); and (3) a novel cationic-based nanoemulsion vaccine containing bile salts (NEB) coated by chitosan (CS). The control, IB, and NEB-CS were incorporated into commercial feed pellets and fed to Nile tilapia. In addition, we evaluated the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for 14 days post-vaccination (dpv) and protective efficacy for 10 days post-challenge, respectively. The mucoadhesiveness, permeability, and absorption within the tilapia intestine were also assessed in vivo. The NEB-CS vaccine appeared spherical, with the nanoparticles having a size of 454.37 nm and a positive charge (+47.6 mV). The NEB-CS vaccine had higher levels of mucoadhesiveness and permeability than the NEB (p < 0.05). The relative percent survival (RPS) of IB and NEB-CS, when administered orally to fish, was 48% and 96%, respectively. Enhanced SBA was noted in the NEB-CS and IB vaccine groups compared to the control group. The results demonstrate that a feed-based NEB-CS can improve the mucoadhesiveness, permeability, and protective efficacy of the vaccine, and appear to be a promising approach to protecting tilapia in aquaculture against streptococcosis.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The study estimated that the vehicle fleet size of Nakhon Ratchasima (NR) province of Thailand will grow to 2 million vehicles by 2030, which was 1.36 million in 2021. In NR, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations already surpassed both WHO and NAAQS guidelines in 2019–2021. Using Pollution Control Department (PCD) approved Tier I and II Methodology of EMEP/EEA, this research estimated that the total tailpipe emission load will be 1039 tons of PM2.5, 16,630 tons of NO₂, 20,623 tons of CO, 195 tons NH₃, and 249 tons of SO₂ in NR during 2030. The emission load will increase to 1752 tons of PM2.5, 21,126 tons of NO2, 25,559 tons of CO, 361 tons of NH3 and 9344 tons of SO₂ during 2030 if upstream emissions are considered. This study has developed five control scenarios in line with the directives of PCD to mitigate the adverse health from vehicle-led air pollution in NR and implementation during 2024–2030. According to the study, different control scenarios to be implemented during 2024–2030, will be able to keep the fleet size of vehicles in the NR under control. The results show that the control scenarios will keep the annual tailpipe emission of PM2.5 at 604 tons in 2030, a 42 % reduction over the 2030 Business-As-Usual scenario (BAU). The health damage in the range of 6941 to 11,625 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) under the 2030 BAU scenario in NR due to tailpipe and upstream emissions can be reduced to 4162–7318 DALYs with the implementation of different control scenarios. The control scenarios will also provide significant economic benefits ranging from 4465 to 6718 million THB during 2024–2030 through reduced DALYs and associated costs.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, atmospheric pollution, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"
Should Social Pensions be Universal or Targeted? Older Persons’ Preferences over the Old-Age Allowance System in Thailand,"Suwanrada W., Sukontamarn P.",2023-01-01,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging, Humans, Income, Middle Aged, Pensions, Poverty, Social Security, Thailand, old-age allowance, older persons, preference, Social pension, targeted, Thailand, universal","There are continued debates on whether social pensions should be universal or targeted. This paper investigates this issue from the perspectives of Thai older persons regarding the old-age allowance system. The paper uses data from the 2016 Population Change and Well-being in the Context of Aging Society Project with the final sample of 6,040 individuals aged 60 and older. The study employs probit regression analysis, where the dependent variable is whether the respondent thinks that the old-age allowance should be universal or targeted. Independent variables include individual, household, social, and economic characteristics. The paper finds that those with high or low education and those with high or low economic well-being tend to prefer the targeted system compared to the middle group. Family status, individual values, and social norms also influence the preferences. The two main mechanisms explaining the preferences of older persons are self-interest and altruism. The findings suggest that the old-age allowance system should continue to provide basic income security for all older persons. Separate poverty relief programs can be implemented to support individuals in need.","sociology, Nursing","Demography, Gerontology, Life-span and Life-course Studies"
Prediction of Future Caries in 1-Year-Old Children via the Salivary Microbiome,"Raksakmanut R., Thanyasrisung P., Sritangsirikul S., Kitsahawong K., Seminario A.L., Pitiphat W., Matangkasombut O.",2023-06-01,"Biomarkers, Child, Child, Preschool, Dental Caries, Humans, Infant, Microbiota, Prospective Studies, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Saliva, biomarkers, dental caries, infant, machine learning, microbiota, saliva","Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children that causes negative effects on their health, development, and well-being. Early preventive interventions are key to reduce early childhood caries prevalence. An efficient strategy is to provide risk-based targeted prevention; however, this requires an accurate caries risk predictor, which is still lacking for infants before caries onset. We aimed to develop a caries prediction model based on the salivary microbiome of caries-free 1-y-old children. Using a nested case-control design within a prospective cohort study, we selected 30 children based on their caries status at 1-y follow-up (at 2 y old): 10 children who remained caries-free, 10 who developed noncavitated caries, and 10 who developed cavitated caries. Saliva samples collected at baseline before caries onset were analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results of β diversity analysis showed a significant difference in salivary microbiome composition between children who remained caries-free and those who developed cavitated caries at 2 y old (analysis of similarities, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected, P = 0.042). The relative abundance of Prevotella nanceiensis, Leptotrichia sp. HMT 215, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Campylobacter concisus in children who remained caries-free was significantly higher than in children who developed cavitated caries (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.024, 0.040, 0.049, and 0.049, respectively). These taxa were also identified as biomarkers for children who remained caries-free (linear discriminant analysis effect size, linear discriminant analysis score = 3.69, 3.74, 3.53, and 3.46). A machine learning model based on these 4 species distinguished between 1-y-old children who did and did not develop cavitated caries at 2 y old, with an accuracy of 80%, sensitivity of 80%, and specificity of 80% (area under the curve, 0.8; 95% CI, 44.4 to 97.5). Our findings suggest that these salivary microbial biomarkers could assist in predicting future caries in caries-free 1-y-old children and, upon validation, are promising for development into an adjunctive tool for caries risk prediction for prevention and monitoring.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Materials and methods: One hundred and ninety-six patients with dental implants functioning more than 1 year were provided with a 13-question questionnaire to report their satisfaction regarding the functional aspects, aesthetic outcome, cleansing ability, general satisfaction, treatment cost, and overall satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was reported using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The association of these variables and each aspect of satisfaction were investigated by multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: One hundred forty-four of 196 patients reported high overall satisfaction (VAS > 80%). All aspects of patient satisfaction levels were very high (mean VAS > 80%), except for satisfaction in cleansing ability and treatment cost (mean VAS < 75%). The patients with a history of implant failure had significantly lower satisfaction in the functional aspects, aesthetic outcome, and general satisfaction than patients without implant failure (p ≤ 0.001). The subjects who experienced mechanical complication were less satisfied with treatment cost (p = 0.002). Sinus augmentation negatively affected functional satisfaction compared with individuals without sinus augmentation (p = 0.041). The subjects with a higher income or a posterior implant had significantly higher overall satisfaction (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, restoration by specialists positively affected general satisfaction compared with being restored by post-graduate students (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Patients restored with a dental implant-supported single crown or fixed prosthesis had very high patient satisfaction. Implant failure, mechanical complication, and sinus augmentation negatively affected patient satisfaction in multiple aspects. In contrast, the factors positively affecting patient satisfaction were a posterior implant, patient's monthly income, and restoration by specialists. These results have to be interpreted with care due to the cross-sectional study design.",dentistry,"Oral Surgery, Dentistry (all)"

Hence, there is a need to develop a novel material with antibacterial properties and smart functions. In this study, the effects of silver nanoparticles content (AgNPs) on properties of photothermal and pH-responsive nanocomposite hydrogels were investigated. The nanocomposite hydrogel samples were prepared using cassava starch waste modified by carboxymethylation (CMS), and mixed with poly vinly alcohol (PVA) and tannic acid (TA). The presence of AgNPs in the hydrogel samples enhanced antibacterial activities and photothermal conversion ability. The use of as-prepared hydrogel using 200 mM silver nitrate (H-AgNPs-200) combined with near infrared (NIR) radiation produced 100 % antibacterial efficiency for Escherichia coli (E.coli) and 98.2 % for Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). Furthermore, the H-AgNPs-200 also provided the highest storage modulus at 8.78 kPa. The obtained nanocomposite hydrogel was shown to exhibit pH-responsive release of TA. Under NIR radiation, higher release of TA at different pH was observed. The cytotoxicity study indicated that the nanocomposite hydrogels had good biocompatibility. Hence, the development of nanocomposite hydrogel-based CMS from cassava starch waste/PVA/AgNPs is a promising and sustainable approach where agro-waste product is used as the base material for medical application in wound dressing.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

As such, analysis of cellular and secreted protein (proteome and secretome) after a single LPS activation and LPS tolerance in macrophages from Ezh2 null (Ezh2flox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) mice (Ezh2 null) and the littermate control mice (Ezh2fl/fl; LysM-Cre−/−) (Ezh2 control) compared with the unstimulated cells from each group indicated fewer activities in Ezh2 null macrophages, especially by the volcano plot analysis. Indeed, supernatant IL-1β and expression of genes in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization (IL-1β and iNOS), TNF-α, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) were lower in Ezh2 null macrophages compared with the control. In LPS tolerance, downregulated NF-κB compared with the control was also demonstrated in Ezh2 null cells. In CLP sepsis mice, those with CLP alone and CLP at 2 days after twice receiving LPS injection, representing sepsis and sepsis after endotoxemia, respectively, symptoms were less severe in Ezh2 null mice, as indicated by survival analysis and other biomarkers. However, the Ezh2 inhibitor improved survival only in CLP, but not LPS with CLP. In conclusion, an absence of Ezh2 in macrophages resulted in less severe sepsis, and the use of an Ezh2 inhibitor might be beneficial in sepsis.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

At the same time, the CAF in pipe with hydraulic fittings and the problem of unstable CAF are the part of some big issues in using CAF techniques. This study intended to investigate the energy saving of CAF in horizontal T-pipe with symmetrical flow and diameter of 50 mm for oil and water system using CFD approach. Pressure reduction and power consumption were computed as the parameters to measure the energy saving of the flow system. The result of this study showed significant energy reduction of CAF with 94% of pressure drop reduction, for transporting the same amount of oil, when comparing to the traditional single phase oil flow. On the other hand, the intersection of the T-pipe was considered as critical region that promoting the change of flow direction and disturbing the existing CAF pattern. Thus, this study also proposed the strategy for returning the CAF during the process of oil transportation without stopping or restarting the flow operation. The geometry of the T-pipe was modified to facilitate the additional water injection at the intersection as a strategy to get back the CAF pattern. Consequently, the modified T-pipe with certain velocity of additional water injection was recorded to give important improvement of CAF application in terms of more stable CAF and higher pressure drop reduction (98%) compared to oil transportation without lubrication. This study also recorded the values of power reduction factor that indicating the cost of power consumption to transport the oil could be saved more than 80% than single phase oil transportation.",energy,Energy (all)

The purpose of this research was to find new antifungal candidates or leads of secondary metabolites derived from natural sources that could effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of Candida albicans lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase (CYP51) while also having good pharmacokinetics. In silico prediction of the drug-likeness, chemo-informatics and enzyme inhibition indicate that the 46 compounds derived from fungi, sponges, plants, bacteria and algae sources have a high novelty to meet all five requirements of Lipinski's rules and impede enzymatic function. Among the 15 candidate molecules with strong binding affinity to CYP51 investigated by molecular docking simulation, didymellamide A-E compounds demonstrated the strongest binding energy against the target protein at −11.14, −11.46, −11.98, −11.98, and −11.50 kcal/mol, respectively.

A significant risk of arsenic toxicity remains for many rural populations due to inadequate public awareness campaigns regarding the health impacts of consuming arsenic-contaminated water. As a result, inexpensive techniques are essential to eliminate arsenic from water. The feasibility of iron oxide coated biosand filtration for eliminating As5+ from aqueous solutions was examined in this study through batch and semi-continuous tests. An iron oxide coated biosand filter showed the best arsenate removal efficiency, with up to 99.8% removal over 120 days. The adsorption rate tended to increase with the adsorbent dosage. Experiments at different iron oxide dosages confirmed that the adsorption of arsenate onto iron oxide particles followed a pseudo second-order model. Langmuir and Freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption capacity, and both models showed a good fit (R2 >0.90) to the adsorption of arsenate at different levels of water hardness. After filtration, a leachability test was performed on the spent iron and sand particles. The results indicated that the leachate contained low arsenate concentrations, and should be carefully treated as hazardous waste.","coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

In this research, we explored the immune responses of Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) at the stages of 35- and 42- days post-hatching (dph) to an immersive heat-killed Streptococcus iniae (Si) vaccine to determine whether fish can produce specific antibodies against the pathogen. The vaccinated fish of each stage (V35 and V42) were immersed with the Si vaccine at 107 CFU/ml for 3 h, whereas the control groups (C35 and C42) were immersed with tryptic soy broth (TSB) in the same manner. Specific antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before and post-immunization (i.e., 0, 7, and 14 days post-immunization, dpi). Expression of innate (TNFα and IL-1β) and adaptive (MHCI, MHCII, CD4, CD8, IgM-like, IgT-like, and IgD-like) immune-related genes were evaluated at the same time points with the addition of 1 dpi. The results showed that a subset of immunized fish from both V35 and V42 fry could elicit specific antibodies (IgM) against Si at 14 dpi. All tested innate and adaptive immune genes upregulated at 7 dpi among fish in V35 group. Interestingly, 42 dph fish appeared to respond to the Si vaccine faster than that of 35 dph, as a significant increase in transcripts was observed in CD4, IL-1β, IgM-like, and IgD-like at 1 dpi; and specific antibody titers of some fish, although not all, were higher than a threshold (p = 0.05) since 7 dpi. In conclusion, this study reveals that 35–42 dph Asian seabass fry can elicit specific immunity to Si immersion vaccine, suggesting that early vaccination of 35 dph fry Asian seabass is feasible.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

The previously collected experimental data, including enzyme activities, immobilization yields, product yields, and material balances, were used to estimate the capital and operating costs of fructooligosaccharides production using (a) immobilized enzyme in a stirred-tank reactor, (b) immobilized enzyme in a packed-bed reactor, and (c) free enzyme in a stirred-tank reactor. The technical issues in reactor design and operation were also evaluated. The results showed that, in terms of minimum product selling prices, the process using immobilized enzyme had more economic advantages than the process using free enzyme because the cost savings from enzyme purchasing could compensate the additional equipment and chemical costs in the enzyme immobilization process. The results could be a guideline for selecting suitable reactor types for fructooligosaccharides production and provide directions for further reactor design and development.","process equipment, coastal engineering, energy, environmental","Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Waste Management and Disposal"

In this study, 413 SUPs randomly collected from 4 Asian countries between 2020 and 2021 were analyzed to obtain specific polymer and organic additive profiles. Polyethylene (PE), coupled with external polymers, was prominent in the inside of the SUPs, whereas polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were prevalent in both the insides and outsides of the SUPs. The use of different polymers in the insides and outsides of PE SUPs implies specific and complicated recycling systems are required to maintain the purity of the products. Phthalate plasticizers including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were prevalent in the SUPs (n = 68). High concentrations of DEHP were detected in PE bags from Myanmar (820,000 ng/g) and Indonesia (420,000 ng/g), which were an order of magnitude greater than the concentrations in PE bags collected in Japan. SUPs containing high concentrations of organic additives may be the primary source of harmful chemicals in the environment, and should be responsible for their ubiquitous distribution in ecosystems.","fluidex; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"
Antihyperglycemic Properties of Extracts and Isolated Compounds from Australian Acacia saligna on 3T3-L1 Adipocytes,"Asmara A.P., Prasansuklab A., Chiabchalard A., Chen H., Ung A.T.",2023-05-01,"3T3-L1 Cells, Acacia, Adipocytes, AMP-Activated Protein Kinases, Animals, Australia, Australians, Catechin, Glucose, Hypoglycemic Agents, Mice, Plant Extracts, Reactive Oxygen Species, (−)-epicatechin, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Acacia saligna, AMPK-α, glucose uptake, GLUT-4, mitochondrial membrane potential, mt-ROS, naringenin-7-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside, ROS","Our early work indicated that methanolic extracts from the flowers, leaves, bark, and isolated compounds of Acacia saligna exhibited significant antioxidant activities in vitro. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria (mt-ROS) interfered with glucose uptake, metabolism, and its AMPK-dependent pathway, contributing to hyperglycemia and diabetes. This study aimed to screen the ability of these extracts and isolated compounds to attenuate the production of ROS and maintain mitochondrial function via the restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Downstream effects were investigated via an immunoblot analysis of the AMPK signalling pathway and glucose uptake assays. All methanolic extracts effectively reduced cellular ROS and mt-ROS levels, restored the MMP, activated AMPK-α, and enhanced cellular glucose uptake. At 10 µM, (−)-epicatechin-6 (from methanolic leaf and bark extracts) markedly reduced ROS and mt-ROS levels by almost 30% and 50%, respectively, with an MMP potential ratio 2.2-fold higher compared to the vehicle control. (−)-Epicatechin 6 increased the phosphorylation of AMPK-α by 43%, with an 88% higher glucose uptake than the control. Other isolated compounds include naringenin 1, naringenin-7-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside 2, isosalipurposide 3, D-(+)-pinitol 5a, and (−)-pinitol 5b, which also performed relatively well across all assays. Australian A. saligna active extracts and compounds can reduce ROS oxidative stress, improve mitochondrial function, and enhance glucose uptake through AMPK-α activation in adipocytes, supporting its potential antidiabetic application.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Methods: We conducted the pre-planned analyses of mortality, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using EuroQol (EQ)-5D-5L index values and EQ visual analogue scale (VAS), and cognitive function using Mini Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Mini MoCA) test at 1 year. Deceased patients were assigned numerical zero for HRQoL as a state equal to death and zero for cognitive function outcomes as worst possible score, and we used multiple imputation for missing data on HRQoL and cognitive function. Results: Among 1554 randomized patients, we obtained 1-year data on mortality in 97.9% of patients, HRQoL in 91.3%, and cognitive function in 86.3%. One-year mortality was 385/746 (51.3%) in the restrictive-fluid group versus 383/767 (49.9%) in the standard-fluid group, absolute risk difference 1.5%-points [99% confidence interval (CI) − 4.8 to 7.8].

Their long evolutionary history reveals that cyanobacteria have a remarkable capacity and strong adaptive tendencies to thrive in a variety of conditions. Thus, they can survive successfully, especially in harsh environmental conditions such as salty environments, high radiation, or extreme temperatures. Among others, salt stress because of excessive salt accumulation in salty environments, is the most common abiotic stress in nature and hampers agricultural growth and productivity worldwide. These detrimental effects point to the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the salt stress response. While it is generally accepted that the stress response mechanism is a complex network, fewer efforts have been made to represent it as a network. Substantial evidence revealed that salt-tolerant cyanobacteria have evolved genomic specific mechanisms and high adaptability in response to environmental changes. For example, extended gene families and/or clusters of genes encoding proteins involved in the adaptation to high salinity have been collectively reported. This chapter focuses on recent advances and provides an overview of the molecular basis of halotolerance mechanisms in salt‑tolerant cyanobacteria as well as multiple regulatory pathways. We elaborate on the major protective mechanisms, molecular mechanisms associated with halotolerance, and the global transcriptional landscape to provide a gateway to uncover gene regulation principles. Both knowledge and omics approaches are utilized in this chapter to decipher the mechanistic insights into halotolerance. Collectively, this chapter would have a profound impact on providing a comprehensive understanding of halotolerance in salt‑tolerant cyanobacteria.",Immunology,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology

DRB contains several bioactive compounds, including dietary fiber and phytochemicals. The supplementation with DRB manifests chemopreventive effects in terms of anti-chronic inflammation, anti-cell proliferation, and anti-tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) model in rats. However, little is known about its effect on gut microbiota. Herein, we investigated the effect of DRB on gut microbiota and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, colonic goblet cell loss, and mucus layer thickness in the AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated CRC rat model. The results suggested that DRB enhanced the production of beneficial bacteria (Alloprevotella, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, Ruminococcus, Roseburia, Butyricicoccus) and lessened the production of harmful bacteria (Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Escherichia–Shigella, Citrobacter) present in colonic feces, mucosa, and tumors. In addition, DRB also assisted the cecal SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate) production. Furthermore, DRB restored goblet cell loss and improved the thickness of the mucus layer in colonic tissue. These findings suggested that DRB could be used as a prebiotic supplement to modulate gut microbiota dysbiosis, which decreases the risks of CRC, therefore encouraging further research on the utilization of DRB in various nutritional health products to promote the health-beneficial bacteria in the colon.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

A system of BIEs governing unknown data on the boundary and crack-face displacement is developed in a broad framework, allowing for the treatment of material anisotropy, finite boundaries, cracks of arbitrary shape, and general loading conditions. To alleviate the requirement on handling all involved singular integrals, a regularization approach is also used to finally obtain BIEs containing only weakly singular kernels. An efficient solution procedure based on a symmetric Galerkin boundary element method and a Galerkin-based approach is implemented to solve the resulting governing BIEs. The near-front field’s structure is used to enhance the approximation of crack-face displacement and to provide accurate and direct means for calculating the T-stresses from solved sum of the crack-face displacement. The results of a comprehensive numerical study show that the proposed technique is not only accurate but also capable of handling finite cracked bodies under various scenarios.","vessels and marine engineeringneering, engineering, Mathematics","Computational Mechanics, Modeling and Simulation, Mechanics of Materials"

However, evidence of the association between BF duration and adiposity remains inconclusive. Few studies have been conducted among Southeast Asian infants that have measured body composition during infancy using the gold standard stable isotope method. This study aimed to evaluate the association between BF duration and body composition during infancy. Healthy full-term Thai infants aged 6–8 months (n = 60) receiving exclusive or predominant BF for at least 3 months were recruited. Skinfold thickness (SFT) was measured by well-trained investigators. Body composition was assessed by the deuterium dilution technique. Infants with longer BF duration (>6 months; mean 7.5 ± 0.5 months, n = 29) had a higher subscapular SFT z-score than those with shorter BF duration (≤6 months; mean 5.3± 0.9 months, n = 31) by 0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01–0.94). After adjustment for age and sex, BF duration and age at introduction of complementary feeding (CF) were positively associated with fat mass and fat mass index at 6–8 months. One month increase in BF duration and CF age was associated with a 0.37 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.69) kg/m2 and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.18, 1.34) kg/m2 increase in the fat mass index, respectively. After adjusting for infant body mass index (BMI) during the earlier infancy period, the strength of the association was attenuated. This finding may reflect reverse causality where infants with lower BMI received formula or CF earlier. A longitudinal study with follow-up into childhood is warranted to confirm the effects of BF on adiposity in infancy and childhood.","medical, Nursing","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Nutrition and Dietetics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

Numerous constrained evolutionary optimization strategies are known to address these problems. This study proposes a broader definition of differential evolution (DE) that uses a quick adaptation strategy and an optimization-based design. It combines DE with a unique mutation approach to broaden the range of viable answers. This research also suggests a novel fitness function for energy harvesting in IoT-based applications.

The derived fine black powder was impregnated by 10–50 wt% polyethyleneimine (PEI) to produce porous carbon material (PEI-PCM) for evaluation of the performance of CO2 adsorption under TGA (micro-scale system). To observe the PEI loading and relevant CO2 capture selectivity characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) were carried out. The XRD pattern showed the main phase of amorphous carbon, graphite, and some impurities (ZnS). Type II adsorption isotherm is related with reducing of the specific surface area and pore volume from 78 m2·g−1 to 25.26 m2·g−1, 0.45 cm3·g−1 to 0.23 cm3·g−1, respectively. The FT-IR spectra indicated the bending of primary and secondary amine which belonged to PEI molecule. It can be concluded that PEI-PCM properties such as, pore-size distribution, pore volume and surface functional groups supported CO2 adsorption capability following surface structure modification. The 50 wt% PEI-PCM-P showed good adsorption capacity of 53.81 mg·g−1 at temperatures of 75 °C. As a result, the PEI-PCM was successfully developed for CO2 absorption application.

Accordingly, the Chinese government has implemented the “National Fitness Program”, which aims to enhance people’s health by popularizing exercise and a healthy lifestyle. However, women are less physically active than men, and how to appeal to women to devote themselves to fitness activities has become a social concern. Based on the expanded theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study explores the impact of the perceived policy effectiveness and health awareness on physical activity among working women. This study adopted a repeated cross-sectional study method, and each respondent was asked to complete a two-stage survey. The structural model of the extended TPB was tested using sample data from 376 working women in Changsha, China. The results show that perceived policy effectiveness and health awareness positively affect actual behavioral control and implementation intention. Among them, perceived policy effectiveness has the most significant impact on implementation intention, followed by health awareness. Furthermore, actual behavioral control and implementation intention mediate the relationship between perceived policy effectiveness/health awareness and physical activity. The findings suggest that to promote physical activity among working women, the Chinese government should deepen the implementation of the “National Fitness Program” and raise the public’s health awareness.","environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Consequently, we focused on investigating the bionomics and genetic characterizations of anopheline mosquitoes in goat malaria-endemic regions. We also attempted to screen for ungulate malaria potential vectors. A total of 1019 female anopheline mosquitoes were collected from six goat farms in four provinces of Thailand from 2020 to 2021. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified and subsequently confirmed using the mitochondrial DNA barcoding region-cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (MtDNA-COI), mitochondrial DNA-cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MtDNA-COII), and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (rDNA-ITS2) sequences. The current study reveals the genetic characteristics and distribution of nine mosquito species within the Anopheles and Cellia subgenera. Four dominant species, including Anopheles peditaeniatus, Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles vagus, and Anopheles aconitus exhibited significant intraspecific gene flow within their corresponding species. Although malaria parasites were not found in 126 mosquito pools, meaning more investigation is necessary, the current study adds to the existing DNA barcoding data collection and improves the current understanding of the genetic structure and distribution of anopheline mosquito species, which could be useful for effective control of mosquito-borne diseases.","diseases, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Parasitology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Veterinary (all), Insect Science"

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 40 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups, of which one received 0.2 mg intrathecal morphine plus 0.25% Marcaine in a total volume of 4 mL and the other received intravenous morphine intraoperatively. Pain relief and patient satisfaction were evaluated using the visual analog scale. Intraoperative blood loss was measured at the end of the surgery while morphine consumption was measured by monitoring intravenous patient-controlled morphine at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively. Treatment efficacy and complications were documented. Results: Morphine consumption was significantly different in both groups at all time points, although the pain score did not show any difference. Shoulder pain, a common adverse effect of laparoscopic surgery, was significantly lower in the intrathecal group (25% vs. 75%). Blood loss and patient satisfaction were not different between the groups. However, the intrathecal group showed a significantly higher incidence of intraoperative hypotension.

Here, we successfully prepared CNF-reinforced ENR nanocomposites with superior mechanical performance. CNFs were disintegrated from water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) using high-pressure homogenization, and ENR nanocomposites with CNFs were fabricated by initial mixing and hot pressing. The crosslink densities of the nanocomposites with CNFs were higher than that of the neat ENR. Due to stronger interfacial interactions between the hydroxyl groups of the CNFs and the functional groups of the ENR, stress could be efficiently transferred from the ENR matrix to the stiff CNFs, resulting in a significant increase in the mechanical properties. Compared with those of the neat ENR, the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the ENR nanocomposites were improved by 80 and 39 %, respectively, with the incorporation of 2 parts per hundred rubber (phr) CNFs, whereas no loss in elongation at break was observed. The introduction of CNFs also improved the oil resistance of the nanocomposites.

Recently, Bangkok has faced rapid growth and the expanded neighborhoods require convenient public transport to be linked with central Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. Monorails can be an exceptional alternative to conventional skylines and subways thankfully to their excellent climbing abilities, lower noise, shorter constructions periods, and their capabilities to be adapted within limited spaces. Recently, Mass Rapid Transit Authority adopted monorail system to facilitate public in Bangkok's expanding neighborhoods. A four-span continuous posttensioned girder system has been proposed for the straddle monorail system. Current study focuses on the structural response of full-scale precast posttensioned (FPP) end girders in the proposed monorail system. Results suggested that the girder remained undamaged under service load while exhibiting a linear load versus vertical deflection response. Failure under ultimate load was accompanied by crushing of concrete, buckling of compression longitudinal bars and posttension tendons at the midspan. Further, experimental rosette strains suggested that concrete strains remained well below the ultimate of strains in the vicinity of high shear zones of the girder. Therefore, these results augment that the proposed design practice is safe against shear and the proposed girder can safely be used as the end girder in four-span straddle monorail system. Nonlinear analysis of the girder was performed using advanced tool for engineering nonlinear analysis by adopting its built-in constitutive laws for concrete and steel reinforcement. Predicted analytical response of FPP was in good agreement with experimental results in terms of load-deflection curves, crack patterns, and failure mode.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"
Remediation of arsenic-contaminated water by green zero-valent iron nanoparticles,"Deewan R., Yan D.Y.-S., Khamdahsag P., Tanboonchuy V.",2023-08-01,"Adsorption, Arsenates, Arsenic, Iron, Nanoparticles, Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared, Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Arsenate, Arsenic, Green synthesis, Nanoparticles, Sustainable, Zero-valent ions","The optimal conditions for the green synthesis of nano zero-valent iron (G-NZVI) using mango peel extract were investigated using a Box-Behnken design approach. Three factors were considered, namely the ratio of iron solution to mango peel extract ratio (1:1–1:3), feeding rate of mango peel extract (1–5 mL min−1), and agitation speed (300–350 rpm). The results showed that the optimal conditions for the synthesis of G-NZVI for arsenate removal were a 1:1 ratio of iron solution to mango peel extract, a mango peel extract feeding rate of 5 mL min−1, and an agitation speed of 300 rpm. Under these conditions, nearly 100% arsenate removal was achieved. X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) methods were used to characterize the properties of the G-NZVI. Finally, the arsenate removal efficiency of the G-NZVI was compared against that of commercial nano zero-valent iron (C-NZVI). The results revealed that the G-NZVI was roughly five times more efficient at arsenate removal than the C-NZVI. The influence of background species such as chloride (Cl−), phosphate (PO43−), calcium (Ca2+), and sulfate (SO42−) was studied to evaluate their effects on arsenate removal. As a result, Cl− and Ca2+ were shown to play a role in promoting arsenate removal, whereas SO42− and PO43− were observed to play an inhibiting role.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Genome sequences and functional analysis of Levilactobacillus brevis LSF9-1 and Pediococcus acidilactici LSF1-1 from fermented fish cake (Som-fak) with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production,"Phuengjayaem S., Pakdeeto A., Kingkaew E., Tunvongvinis T., Somphong A., Tanasupawat S.",2023-06-01,"gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Levilactobacillus brevis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) genes, Levilactobacillus brevis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Som-fak","Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a crucial inhibitory neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system that exerts regulatory effects on the blood, immune, and nervous systems. GABA production in som-fak, a traditional fermented fish of Thailand, has been attributed to the activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The present study aims to characterize the LAB isolates and compare the genomes and GABA synthesis genes of selected isolates capable of GABA production. Thirteen isolates demonstrating GABA synthesis capability were identified based on their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Seven isolates (group I: LSF3-3, LSF8-3, LSF9-1, LSF9-3, LSF9-6, LSF9-7, and LSF10-14) were identified as Levilactobacillus brevis with 99.78–100% similarity. LSF2-1, LSF3-2, LSF5-4, and LSF6-5 (group II) were identified as Lactiplantibacillus pentosus with 99.86–100% similarity. Strain LSF1-1 (group III) was identified as Pediococcus acidilactici (99.47%), and LSF10-4 (group IV) was identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus with 99.93% similarity. The GABA production of isolates ranged from 0.087 to 16.935 g/L. The maximum production of 16.935 g/L from 3% monosodium glutamate was obtained from strain LSF9-1. Gene and genome analysis revealed that L. brevis LSF9-1 has multiple gad genes in the genome, such as gadB1, gadB2, gadC1, and gadC2, making it the potential strain for GABA production. Additionally, the genome analysis of P. acidilactici LSF1-1 consists of gadA, gadB, and gadC, which respond to controlling GABA production and export. Furthermore, strain LSF1-1 was considered safe, containing no virulence factors. Thus, Levilactobacillus brevis LSF9-1 and Pediococcus acidilactici LSF1-1 have the potential for GABA production and probiotic use in future studies.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, biochemistryistry",Genetics

Resin-composite inlays directly fabricated from Class V cavities of extracted human molars/premolars and mini-dumbbell-shaped specimens of bonded enamel-dentin were prepared for microleakage and tensile tests, respectively. Four adhesive systems were used: primerless-wet (1-1 etching for 10-, 30-, or 60-s, and 4-META/MMA-TBB), primer-moist (All-Bond2 + Duolink or Single-Bond2 + RelyX ARC), self-etch (AQ-Bond + Metafil FLO), and dry (Super-Bond C&B) bonding. Dye penetration distance and TBS data were recorded. Failure modes and characteristics of the tooth-resin interface were examined on the fractured specimens. All specimens in 10-, 30-, and 60-s etching primerless-wet, Super-Bond, and AQ-Bond had a microleakage-free tooth-resin interface. Primer-moist groups showed microleakage at the cementum/dentin-resin margin/interface. Significantly higher TBSs (p < 0.05) were recorded in primer-less-wet and Super-Bond groups with the consistent hybridized biopolymer layer after the chemical challenge and mixed failure in tooth structure, luting-resin, and at the PMMA-rod interface. There was no correlation between microleakage and TBS data (p = −0.148). A 1–3 µm hybrid layer created in the 10–60 s primerless-wet technique, producing complete micro-seal and higher tensile strength than enamel and cured 4-META/MMA-TBB, may enhance clinical performances like Super-Bond C&B, the sustainable luting resin.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The shell segments consist of a functionally graded graphene-platelet-reinforced composite (FG-GPLRC). The effective material properties of the composite were calculated using the modified Halpin–Tsai model and the mixture rule. The governing equations of motion for the shell were formulated within the novel four-unknown refined shell theory framework. The effects of centrifugal and Coriolis forces and the initial hoop tension resulting from rotation were all included. The Rayleigh–Ritz procedure and smeared stiffener technique were subsequently used to determine the natural frequencies of the shells with stiffeners. The advantages of the adopted shell theory result directly from the reduction of key unknowns without the need for the shear correction factor, and it can predict better results for FG-GPLRC structures. Finally, numerical examples were provided to validate the proposed solution and demonstrate the effects of four-unknown refined theories, material distribution patterns, boundary conditions, rotating speed, and temperature rise on the natural frequencies of toroidal shell segments.","Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Extracted collagen is commonly used as a biomaterial-scaffold due to its biocompatibility/biodegradability and mimics the natural extracellular matrix. Adding biomolecules into a collagen-scaffold enhanced pulp regeneration. Acemannan, β-(1-4)-acetylated-polymannose, is a polysaccharide extracted from aloe vera. Acemannan is a regenerative biomaterial. Therefore, acemannan could be a biomolecule in a collagen-scaffold. Here, acemannan and native collagen were obtained and characterized. The AceCol-scaffold's physical properties were investigated using FTIR, SEM, contact angle, swelling, pore size, porosity, compressive modulus, and degradation assays. The AceCol-scaffold's biocompatibility, growth factor secretion, osteogenic protein expression, and calcification were evaluated in vitro. The AceCol-scaffolds demonstrated higher hydrophilicity, swelling, porosity, and larger pore size than the collagen scaffolds (p < 0.05). Better cell-cell and cell-scaffold adhesion, and dentin extracellular matrix protein (BSP/OPN/DSPP) expression were observed in the AceCol-scaffold, however, DSPP expression was not detected in the collagen group. Significantly increased cellular proliferation, VEGF and BMP2 expression, and mineralization were detected in the AceCol-scaffold compared with the collagen-scaffold (p < 0.05). Computer simulation revealed that acemannan's 3D structure changes to bind with collagen. In conclusion, the AceCol-scaffold synergistically provides better physical and biological properties than collagen.

Nevertheless, as installing several base stations (BSs) may require high power consumption, cooperative CF networks integrated with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)/metasurface can avoid this problem. In such cooperative RIS-aided MIMO networks, efficient beamforming schemes are essential to boost their spectral and energy efficiency. However, most of the existing available beamforming schemes to maximize spectral and energy efficiency are complex and entail high complexity due to the matrix inversions. To this end, in this work we present a computationally efficient stochastic optimization-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to amplify the spectral efficiency of the cooperative RIS-aided CF MIMO system. In the proposed PSO algorithm, several swarms are generated, while the direction of each swarm is tuned in each iteration based on the sum-rate performance to obtain the best solution. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme can approximate the performance of the existing solutions for both the performance metrics, i.e., spectral and energy efficiency, at a very low complexity.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The α-Klotho protein is predominantly expressed in tissues that are involved in calcium homeostasis, and lowered levels are associated with bone disease. The aim of the study is to examine the associations between low α-Klotho status and calcium metabolism in relation to iron status in children with TDT. Methods: Calcium, α-Klotho, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcyphosin, vitamin D3, phosphorous, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), as well as iron and erythron biomarkers were measured in 60 children with TDT and 30 healthy control children. Results: A meaningful part of TDT patients showed lowered α-Klotho levels, and those children also showed low serum total and ionized calcium concentrations. TDT patients showed increased PTH, FGFR2, and calcyphosin and lowered vitamin D3 as compared with healthy children. The α-Klotho levels were significantly correlated with total and ionized calcium (positively) and with iron overload and transfusions biomarkers (inversely). Partial Least Squares path analysis showed that 40.1% of the variance in serum total calcium could be explained by the regression on α-Klotho, vitamin D3 (both positively), and calcyphosin (inversely) and that the effects of the latter are mediated by iron overload and the number of blood transfusions. Conclusion: In conclusion, the iron overload in TDT and its consequences may induce lowered levels of α-Klotho which in turn may lead to lower calcium thereby explaining at least in part the effects of TDT on bone metabolism including spontaneous pathological fractures, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and skeletal deformities.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology"

T-Hg in the river mouth core ranged 44.49–52.76 µg/kg and higher than the cores from the middle of GOT (18.26–36.68 µg/kg). The age span obtained from the cores dated back to the 1940s with the sediment accumulation rates of 0.15–0.76 cm/year. The preindustrial levels of T-Hg showed an initial slow increase followed by a rapid elevation since the 1960s which marked the start of the industrialized period in the country. To this end, we posit that T-Hg in the GOT sediment can be attributed to not only land-based sources but also offshore activities including petroleum exploration and frequent accidental oil spills.","environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

Methods: This study recruited 122 patients with AIS and 40 healthy controls and assessed the Q192R gene variants, arylesterase (AREase) and chloromethyl phenylacetate (CMPAase) activities, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) in baseline conditions. AREase and CMPAase were measured 3 months later. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin score (mRS) were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months later. Results: Reduced CMPAase and increased AREase activities are significantly associated with AIS and mRS and NIHSS scores (baseline and 3 and 6 months later). The best predictor of AIS/disabilities was a decrease in the z-unit-based composite zCMPAase-zAREase score. Serum high density lipoprotein cholsterol (HDLc) was significantly correlated with CMPAase, but not AREase, activity and a lowered zCMPAase + zHDLc score was the second best predictor of AIS/disabilities. Regression analysis showed that 34.7% of the variance in baseline NIHSS was explained by zCMPAase-zAREase and zCMPAase + zHDLc composites, HDLc, and hypertension. Neural network analysis showed that stroke was differentiated from controls with an area under the ROC curve of 0.975 using both new composite scores, PON1 status, hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous stroke as body mass index. The PON1 Q192R genotype has many significant direct and mediated effects on AIS/disabilities, however, its overall effect was not significant.

Surrogate is one of the accelerating ways in engineering tolerance quantification to analyze uncertainty with an acceptable computational burden rather than costly traditional methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Compared with more complicated surrogates such as the Gaussian process, or Radial Basis Function (RBF), the Polynomial Regression (PR) provides simpler formulations yet acceptable outcomes. However, PR with the common least-squares method needs to be more accurate and flexible for approximating nonlinear and nonconvex models. In this study, a new approach is proposed to enhance the accuracy and approximation power of PR in dealing with uncertainty quantification in engineering tolerances. For this purpose, first, by computing the differences between training sample points and a reference point (e.g., nominal design), we employ certain linear and exponential basis functions to transform an original variable design into new transformed variables. A second adjustment is made to calculate the bias between the true simulation model and the surrogate’s approximated response. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PR approach, we provide comparison results between conventional and proposed surrogates employing four practical problems with geometric fabrication tolerances such as three-bar truss design, welded beam design, and trajectory planning of two-link and three-link (two and three degrees of freedom) robot manipulator. The obtained results prove the preference of the proposed approach over conventional PR by improving the approximation accuracy of the model with significantly lower prediction errors.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, Mathematics","Software, Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design"

Summary: This ""intermediate""phenotype has been reported in a sizable portion of individuals regardless of their hypertensive status; hypertensives (27-51%), normotensives (18-47%). Further, in epidemiological studies, this phenotype is associated with increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes, risk factors, and reduced survival rates. Herein, we review the challenges in the assessment of SSBP, heterogeneity in the assessment method and protocols, and how these differences could affect the results. Further, we review how to identify individuals with SSBP in the clinic by using clinical and genetic data. No clinical approach has yet provided sufficient sensitivity and specificity to identify those with SSBP. Thus, SSBP is not routinely identified in the clinic. Current genetic data suggest that genotyping may support such an office approach. To date, studies in 18 genes have provided sufficient evidence and reproducible data to identify potential mechanisms involved in subsets of subjects with hypertension and SSBP. Key Message: Proof-of-concept clinical trials using genetic biomarkers to determine and treat individuals with SSBP are ongoing. Their results will provide critical evidence to support genetic-focused, mechanistically driven algorithms to identify and treat, specifically, individuals with SSBP - personalized medicine.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical",Nephrology

Chemiluminescence immunoassay is a typical diagnostic method utilized to assess the risk development of sepsis. However, due to its high-cost, delayed, and complicated procedure, the practical utilization is therefore undoubtedly limited, especially for point-of-care test. Herein, we fabricated for the first time an immunosensor based on dendritic copper nanostructures (CuNSs) combined with 4-aminobenzoic acid (4-AB, the diazonium salt) as antibody linker modified on a screen-printed graphene electrode for the early detection of the sepsis biomarker interleukin-6 (IL-6). The electrode fabrication is made by electrodeposition, thus eliminating the multistep of nanomaterial synthesis and time wasting. The resulting dendritic CuNSs significantly increase the effective surface area (1.2 times) and the sensor’s performance. The morphology of this combination was characterized using CV, EIS, SEM, EDX, and FTIR techniques. In the detection process, the appearance of IL-6 suppresses the current response of the redox probe indicator measured by differential pulse voltammetry due to the antibody-antigen complex. The subtraction of signal (ΔI) was interpreted as IL-6 concentration. This sensor exhibited a linear range from 0.05 to 500 pg mL−1 with low detection limit of 0.02 pg mL−1, proving a possibility for early sepsis screening. In addition, the established immunosensor can successfully quantify IL-6 in human serum sample, in which the results agreed well with those achieved using the standard approach, further showing high practical applicability of this developed immunosensor.

Three angles were defined: MEA, Deep Angle (DA) and Total Angle (TA) and measured at six sites for each implant. Results: There was a significant correlation between MEA and Bleeding on Probing for all sites with an overall odds ratio of odd ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.09, p < 0.001). Sites with MEA ≥ 30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70° had a higher risk for bleeding with an odds ratio of 3.1, 5, 7.5, 11.4 and 33.55, respectively. When all 6 sites of an implant prostheses had MEA ≥ 40°, the risk of having bleeding at all 6 sites was 9.5 times higher (95% CI 1.70–52.97, p = 0.010).

This study investigated the efficacy of different molecular weights PPS (1,500–7,000 Da) on the phenotype regulatory and chondrogenic properties of canine articular chondrocytes. The cytotoxicity of PPS on chondrocytes was assessed using flow cytometry and 3-(4,5-dimehylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. After 72 hr of exposure, PPS did not induce chondrocyte apoptosis, regardless of molecular weight. In addition, chondrogenic properties were determined according to the mRNA and protein levels in micromass-cultured chondrocytes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that PPS promotes a chondrogenic phenotype in chondrocytes in a molecular weight-dependent manner, with significant upregulation of collagen type II alpha 1 chain, aggrecan, and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) mRNA levels relative to those in the control. However, the collagen type I alpha 2 chain mRNA level simultaneously increased after 7,000 Da PPS treatment. PPS exposure also increased collagen type II and SOX9 protein production in a molecular weight-dependent manner and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in chondrocytes. Alcian blue staining indicated that PPS treatment enhanced proteoglycan deposition in micromass cultures, with stronger effects observed in 5,000 and 7,000 Da groups. Overall, these results indicate that PPS exerts protective effects on the chondrocyte phenotype and may represent a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.

Two discretization schemes are available, namely discretization of local displacements and discretization of global displacements. In the case of linear static analysis, it has been shown that discretization of local displacements fails to accurately represent rigid transformations, whereas discretization of global displacements does not. Consequently, numerical instability is observed in analysis using discretization of local displacements. This paper investigates the effects of the two discretization schemes on free vibration analysis of planar beam structures using isogeometric Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam formulations.

The Regulatory Roles of Ezh2 in Response to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Macrophages and Mice with Conditional Ezh2 Deletion with LysM-Cre System,"Kunanopparat A., Leelahavanichkul A., Visitchanakun P., Kueanjinda P., Phuengmaung P., Sae-khow K., Boonmee A., Benjaskulluecha S., Palaga T., Hirankarn N.",2023-03-01,"Animals, Cytokines, Epigenesis, Genetic, Inflammation, Interleukin-6, Lipopolysaccharides, Macrophages, Mice, Mice, Knockout, Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, epigenetics, Ezh2, lipopolysaccharide, macrophages, sepsis","The responses of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) might determine the direction of clinical manifestations of sepsis, which is the immune response against severe infection. Meanwhile, the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Ezh2), a histone lysine methyltransferase of epigenetic regulation, might interfere with LPS response. Transcriptomic analysis on LPS-activated wild-type macrophages demonstrated an alteration of several epigenetic enzymes. Although the Ezh2-silencing macrophages (RAW264.7), using small interfering RNA (siRNA), indicated a non-different response to the control cells after a single LPS stimulation, the Ezh2-reducing cells demonstrated a less severe LPS tolerance, after two LPS stimulations, as determined by the higher supernatant TNF-α. With a single LPS stimulation, Ezh2 null (Ezh2flox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) macrophages demonstrated lower supernatant TNF-α than Ezh2 control (Ezh2fl/fl; LysM-Cre−/−), perhaps due to an upregulation of Socs3, which is a suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, due to the loss of the Ezh2 gene. In LPS tolerance, Ezh2 null macrophages indicated higher supernatant TNF-α and IL-6 than the control, supporting an impact of the loss of the Ezh2 inhibitory gene. In parallel, Ezh2 null mice demonstrated lower serum TNF-α and IL-6 than the control mice after an LPS injection, indicating a less severe LPS-induced hyper-inflammation in Ezh2 null mice. On the other hand, there were similar serum cytokines after LPS tolerance and the non-reduction of serum cytokines after the second dose of LPS, indicating less severe LPS tolerance in Ezh2 null mice compared with control mice. In conclusion, an absence of Ezh2 in macrophages resulted in less severe LPS-induced inflammation, as indicated by low serum cytokines, with less severe LPS tolerance, as demonstrated by higher cytokine production, partly through the upregulated Socs3.","Immunologynology, serology and transplantation, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
The Prognostic Predictors of Airway Stenting in Malignant Airway Involvement From Esophageal Carcinoma,"Leelayuwatanakul N., Thanthitaweewat V., Wongsrichanalai V., Lertbutsayanukul C., Prayongrat A., Kitpanit S., Sriprasart T.",2023-07-28,"Esophageal Neoplasms, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Retrospective Studies, Stents, Treatment Outcome, airway stent, esophageal carcinoma, prognostic predictor, survival, tracheobronchial stent","Background: In locoregional esophageal carcinoma (EC), airway involvement is the most common route of extraesophageal metastasis. The prognosis remains poor even with a multimodality approach. Although airway stenting is well known for restoration of the airway, the survival benefit is still lacking. Methods: A total of 37 of patients with airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting at a single institution from 2015 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Survival curves after stent placement among different groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 37 patients, 34 were male, and the mean age was 58.9 years (42 to 80). EC was commonly located at midesophagus (51.4%). The site of airway involvement was left main bronchus (48.6%), trachea (32.4%), multiple sites (16.2%), and right main bronchus (2.7%). The nature of airway involvement was tumor invasion (91.9%), compression (62.2%), and fistula (37.8%). Twenty-three patients (62.2%) had airway involvement at the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis. Only 4 patients underwent esophageal stenting. The median survival time after stent placement was 97 days (5 to 539). Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were given before stent placement in 18 patients (48.6%). Treatment-naive before airway stenting and diagnosis of airway involvement at the same time of EC diagnosis were independent predictors for the increased survival after stent placement (P<0.05). Poststent treatment was associated with improved survival (P=0.002). Conclusion: In patients with malignant airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting, the prognostic predictors for improved survival were treatment-naive status, receiving treatment after airway stenting, and early-onset of airway involvement.",medical,Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine
Primer application technique and remaining dentin thickness affected microtensile bond strength of contemporary dentin adhesives under simulated pulp pressure,"Somrit P., Tantilertanant Y., Srisawasdi S.",2023-01-01,"Adhesives, Dental Bonding, Dental Cements, Dentin, Dentin-Bonding Agents, Materials Testing, Resin Cements, Tensile Strength, Microtensile bond strength, Primer application technique, Remaining dentin thickness, Simulated pulp pressure","Objectives: To evaluate the effect of application techniques, type of adhesives and remaining dentin thicknesses on microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of 3 adhesive systems. Materials and methods: 112 flat occlusal dentinal surfaces of third molar were randomly allocated into 16 groups based on 2 remaining dentin thicknesses (RDT), 2 application techniques, and 3 adhesive systems (Optibond FL, OFL; Clearfil SE Bond, CSE; and Single Bond Universal, SB); SB was applied in either etch-and-rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE) mode. Simulated pulpal pressure was performed during restorative procedure and water storage. The stick-shaped specimens from each tooth underwent µTBS testing. The data were evaluated using a paired t test and ANOVA followed by a post hoc test. The fractured specimens were evaluated for mode of failure using a stereomicroscope. Results: The mean µTBS values were significantly affected by RDT, application technique, and types of adhesives. Neither RDT nor application technique affected µTBS of SB in ER mode, whereas application technique affected both conventional and universal self-etch adhesives. RDT also influenced µTBS of OFL. Conclusions: RDT and application technique differently affected the µTBS of dentin bonding which was product-related. Etch-and-rinse systems had higher bond strength to superficial than to deep dentin, whereas self-etch systems were more sensitive to both RDT and application technique. Clinical relevance: The universal adhesive is less sensitive to intrinsic wetness and can be used according to manufacturer’s instructions.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Each channel is also divided into several sub-channels so that it may affect the store's inventory management system. Some of the product types or quantities may not be sufficient to meet the needs of customers or some products may exceed the customer demand. These cause the cost of transportation, storage, labor, and most importantly, the store may lose its income and profit. To help those retailing stores to manage their inventory effectively, a method for forecasting customer demand by using machine learning to manage product inventory for multi-channel retailing stores is presented in this paper. We use the product sales data from one of the retail stores in Thailand as a reference. They are the daily sales report of each item in the year 2017 to 2021 retrieved from each branch of the store. The dataset comprises 178,548 rows, that are used to create the demand forecasting models for 7-day and 30-day periods. This paper mainly focuses on creating a demand forecasting model by using CatBoost algorithm. The performance is compared to the models that are generated by XGBoost algorithm and Linear Regression algorithm. According to the evaluation of the efficiency, the SMAPE of the 7-day demand forecasting is 24.13% and the SMAPE of the 30-day demand forecasting model is 24.47%.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics","Artificial Intelligence, Control and Optimization, Information Systems"

The structures of the undescribed compounds were elucidated by NMR combined with HRMS spectroscopy, while their absolute configurations were determined using ECD and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The isolated metabolites represent benzophenone derivatives containing a modified monoterpene unit, including tri- and tetracyclic skeletons, which are rarely found in genus Garcinia. The cytotoxic evaluation on three cancerous cell lines demonstrated that schomburginone G, schomburginone H, and 3-geranyl-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone were active against HeLa cells with IC50 values in the range of 12.2–15.7 μM, respectively, and selective compared to the non-cancerous L929 cells (SI > 3.5). In addition, the three cytotoxic compounds together with clusiacyclol A showed significant NO inhibitory activity in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells over 85% inhibition without obvious cytotoxicity at a final concentration of 100 μM. The promising activities of these compounds in cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory assays make them attractive for further study in the development of anticancer drugs.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Plant Science, Horticulture"

Although the contribution of inflammation to organ-mediated damage in lupus has been previously demonstrated, the mechanistic roles of alcohol consumption in lupus activation are not known. Herein, we tested the effects of 10-week lasting alcohol administration on organ damages and immune responses in 8-week-old lupus-prone Fc gamma receptor IIb–deficient (FcγRIIb−/−) mice. Our study endpoints were evaluation of systemic inflammation and assessment of fecal dysbiosis along with endotoxemia. In comparison with alcohol-administered wild-type mice, FcγRIIb−/− mice demonstrated more prominent liver damage (enzyme, histological score, apoptosis, malondialdehyde oxidant) and serum interleukin(IL)-6 levels, despite a similarity in leaky gut (fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran assay, endotoxemia and gut occludin-1 immunofluorescence), fecal dysbiosis (microbiome analysis) and endotoxemia. All alcohol-administered FcγRIIb−/− mice developed lupus-like characteristics (serum anti-dsDNA, proteinuria, serum creatinine and kidney injury score) with spleen apoptosis, whereas control FcγRIIb−/− mice showed only a subtle anti-dsDNA. Both alcohol and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) similarly impaired enterocyte integrity (transepithelial electrical resistance), and only LPS, but not alcohol, upregulated the IL-8 gene in Caco-2 cells. In macrophages, alcohol mildly activated supernatant cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6), but not M1 polarization–associated genes (IL-1β and iNOS), whereas LPS prominently induced both parameters (more prominent in FcγRIIb−/− macrophages than wild type). There was no synergy in LPS plus alcohol compared with LPS alone in both enterocytes and macrophages. In conclusion, alcohol might exacerbate lupus-like activity partly through a profound inflammation from the leaky gut in FcγRIIb−/− mice.","medical, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Cell Biology"
Effects of freeze-drying on the quality and fertilising ability of goat sperm recovered from different parts of the epididymis,"Thiangthientham P., Kallayanathum W., Anakkul N., Suwimonteerabutr J., Santiviparat S., Techakumphu M., Loi P., Tharasanit T.",2023-01-01,"Animals, Chromatin, Epididymis, Goats, Male, Semen, Spermatozoa, Epididymal sperm, Freeze-drying, Goat, Sperm quality","Lyophilisation is an alternative method for sperm preservation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of freeze-thawing (F/T) and freeze-drying (F/D) on the quality of epididymal goat sperm. Sperm from each region of the epididymis (caput, corpus and cauda) were collected and evaluated for the expression of phospholipase C zeta (PLC-ζ), protamine 1 (PRM1), transition protein 1 (TNP1) and 2 (TNP2). The effects of F/T and F/D on sperm quality in terms of PLC-ζ expression, chromatin stability (Chromomycin A3; CMA3) and DNA integrity were examined. The fertilising ability after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was also tested. Fresh sperm existed PLC-ζ, PRM1, TNP1 and TNP2, irrespective of the regions of the epididymis. However, different patterns of PLC-ζ expression were found. Although PRM1, TNP1, TNP2 were still expressed after F/T or F/D, only F/T could preserve the presence of PLC-ζ. For fresh sperm, caput epididymal sperm had the lowest evidence of chromatin stability when compared to sperm harvested from other regions of the epididymis. The F/T and F/D further increased the numbers of CMA3-positive sperm (P < 0.001). In all cases, no CMA3 staining was observed in caudal epididymal sperm. The caudal epididymal sperm had significantly greater proportions of sperm with intact DNA compared with caput and corpus epididymal sperm, especially when F/T and F/D were performed. The fertilisation rates of F/D sperm tended to decrease when compared with F/T sperm (4.2 ± 3.2 vs. 13.6 ± 9.0, P = 0.08). It is concluded that the sperm recovered from the caudal epididymis is suitable for freezing and lyophilisation. However, poor fertilisation rates of F/D sperm were coincidently observed, with a deficit demonstration of PLC-ζ.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"

However, the prevalence of sibling bullying, the factors that affect this condition, and its impact on depression and self-esteem are understudied, especially in Thailand. This study aims to examine the prevalence of sibling bullying, factors that affect sibling bullying, and its association with self-esteem and depression during the pandemic. From January to February 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted in grades 7–9 (age 12–15 years) who had at least one sibling. Demographic characteristics, sibling bullying, self-esteem, and depression were collected using the revised Olweus bully/victim questionnaire, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Binary logistic regression was analyzed to determine associations between sibling bullying and outcomes. Of 352 participants (30.4% female), 92 (26.1%) were victims and 49 (13.9%) were bullies of sibling bullying in the previous 6 months. Factors associated with an increased risk of being victims included female (OR = 2.46; 95%CI 1.34–4.53), peer victimization (OR = 12.99; 95%CI 5.27–32.04), domestic violence (OR = 4.48; 95%CI 1.68–11.95), and perpetrating sibling bullying (OR = 9.81; 95%CI 4.62–20.81). Factors associated with an increased risk of depression were female (OR = 2.59; 95%CI 1.57–4.26), sibling bullying victimization (OR = 2.08; 95%CI 1.22–3.56), physical abuse (OR = 9.50, 95%CI 1.13–79.71) and domestic violence (OR = 3.44; 95%CI 1.40–8.45). Conclusion: Sibling bullying was not uncommon in Thai young adolescents and was associated with female, peer bullying, domestic violence, and depression. Such associations should be identified early so preventive measures and management could be properly implemented. What is Known: • Sibling bullying increases the risk for engaging in peer bullying, aggressive behaviors, violence, and emotional difficulties during life course trajectories. • Victims of sibling bullying are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, mental distress, self-harm, and decreased well-being. What is New: • The rate of sibling bullying in Thai middle school students, even during the pandemic, was comparable to previous studies of different cultural backgrounds without the pandemic. • Victims of sibling bullying were associated with female sex, peer victimization, domestic violence, perpetrating sibling bullying, and depression. Perpetrating sibling bullying was also associated with bullies in cyberbullying.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health"

In this study, we report for the first time that under anaerobic or limited oxygen conditions, Prochlorococcus marinus (PmADO) can generate full-length fatty alcohols from fatty aldehydes without eliminating a carbon unit. In contrast to ADO's native activity, which requires electrons from the Fd/FNR electron transfer complex, ADO's aldehyde reduction activity requires only NAD(P)H. Our results demonstrated that the yield of alcohol products could be affected by oxygen concentration and the type of aldehyde. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, yields of octanol were up to 31%. Moreover, metal cofactors are not involved in the aldehyde reductase activity of PmADO because the yields of alcohols obtained from apoenzyme and holoenzyme treated with various metals were similar under anaerobic conditions. In addition, PmADO prefers medium-chain aldehydes, specifically octanal (kcat/Km around 15 × 10−3 μM−1min−1). The findings herein highlight a new activity of PmADO, which may be applied as a biocatalyst for the industrial synthesis of fatty alcohols.",biochemistryistry,"Biophysics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

However, with its well understood mechanism and developed preventive measures, the problem remains. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the FAC mechanism and contributing factors, preventive measures and FAC management strategies. In addition, FAC rate prediction models employed in CFD studies are compared. The model that includes the effect of time-dependent roughness showed promising results, with only 12% maximum relative error of FAC rate compared to experimental results for flow in a bend. Roles of process modelling software in FAC analysis are explored. The ability of the software to replicate a warm start-up behavior of a combined-cycle heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is demonstrated. Predictions from Apros are most accurate due to its heterogeneous mathematical models. Power Plant Simulator and Designer (PPSD) yields comparable results but takes the shortest calculation time of 30 min. Machine learning algorithms are also introduced. By applying them to predict FAC occurrence in a 90-degree bend, long-short term memory (LSTM) performed the best with 96% accurate results. Application of these algorithms and process modelling software proposes a promising methodology for FAC detection and monitoring system development. Moreover, a practical example of FAC in high-pressure (HP) economizer of HRSGs is presented. The damage occurs in tubes connecting to inlet headers where the flow cannot be evenly distributed. From preliminary investigation, the contributing factors include the geometry of the flow, turbulence, dissolved oxygen, susceptible material, and the operating temperature.","chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Materials and methods: We studied 29,726 survivors of critical illness and compared these outcomes stratified by AKI and recovery status at hospital discharge. Kidney recovery was defined as a return of serum creatinine to ≤150% of baseline without dialysis prior to hospital discharge. Results: Overall AKI occurred in 59.2% in which two thirds developed stage 2–3 AKI. Recovery rate of AKI at hospital discharge was 80.8%. Patients who did not recover experienced the worst 15-year mortality compared to those who recovered and those without AKI (57.8% vs 45.2% vs 30.3%, p < 0.001). This pattern was also found in subgroups of patients with suspected sepsis-associated (57.1% vs 47.9% vs 36.5%, p < 0.001) and cardiac surgery-associated AKI (60.1% vs 41.8% vs 25.9%, p < 0.001).

Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess whether frequent PVCs have an impact on right ventricular (RV) function. Methods: Serial cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies were performed in a series of 47 patients before and after ablation of frequent PVCs. Results: Patients with RV cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction [EF] <0.45) had more frequent PVCs than did patients without decreased RV function (23% ± 11% vs 15% ± 11%, P = 0.03). Likewise, patients with LV cardiomyopathy (EF <0.50) had more frequent PVCs than did patients without decreased LV function (23% ± 10% vs 14% ± 12%, P = 0.003). LV dysfunction was present in 21 patients (45%). In patients with LV dysfunction, 15 patients (32%) had biventricular dysfunction, and 6 patients (13%) had isolated LV dysfunction. A total of 19 patients (40%) had RV dysfunction, and 4 of the patients with RV dysfunction (9%) had isolated RV dysfunction. Cardiac magnetic resonance was repeated 1.9 ± 1.3 years after ablation. In patients with successful ablation, RV function improved, and in patients without successful ablation, RV function did not significantly change (before and after ablation RVEF 0.45 ± 0.09 and 0.52 ± 0.09; P < 0.001 vs. 0.46 ± 0.07 and 0.48 ± 0.04; P = 0.14, respectively). Conclusions: Frequent PVCs can cause RV cardiomyopathy that parallels LV cardiomyopathy and is reversible with successful ablation.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"

The multi-stakeholders and complex waste recycling loop of Rayong Province, Thailand, is herein analysed using an actor-network theory to identify key actors, roles, and responsibilities in the recycling scheme. The results depict the relative function of three-actor networks, namely policy, economy, and societal networks, which play different roles in PPW handling from its generation through various separations from municipal solid wastes to recycling. The policy network comprises mainly national authorities and committees responsible for targeting and policymaking for local implementation, while economic networks are formal and informal actors acting for PPW collection with a recycling contribution of 11.3–64.1%. A societal network supports this collaboration for knowledge, technology, or funds. Two waste recycling models are classified as community-based and municipality-based management, which functions differently by coverage areas, capabilities, and process efficiency. The economic reliability of each informal sorting activity is a crucial factor for sustainability, while empowering people in environmental awareness and sorting ability at the household level is also essential, as well as law enforcement that is effective in the long-term circularity of the PPW economy.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, engineering","Waste Management and Disposal, Mechanics of Materials"

In this work, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as a silica source, whereas cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was employed as a structure directing agent. The molar ratio of Silicon/metal was kept at 45. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, N2 physisorption, SEM, and UV-VIS techniques. It revealed that Fe, Mn, and Zn incorporated into the framework of MCM-48 resulted in increased thickness of the pore wall, leading to better thermal stability than pure MCM-48. In contrast, the agglomeration of metal oxides, and the nature of aluminum perhaps lead to the decreased thickness of the pore wall in MCM-48 and consequently lower thermal stability. Additionally, the findings indicate that when the thickness of the pore wall is approximately 1.3 nm onward, the thermal stability of metal-incorporated MCM-48 will be improved.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, chemistry, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials"

Herein, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to explore the effect of N-doping on the decomposition of formic acid. We designed a series of single Pd-atoms deposited in the single vacancy of N-doped graphene sheets, namely Pd-DGr, Pd–N1Gr, Pd–N2Gr, and Pd–N3Gr, as the proposed catalysts. Our findings show that H2 production from HCOOH dehydrogenation on these surfaces proceeds via the formate (HCOO) pathway (Path-I) rather than the carboxylate (COOH) pathway (Path-II). Furthermore, the Pd–N3Gr catalyst shows the greatest catalytic reactivity toward HCOOH dehydrogenation via Path-I, requiring an activation energy (Ea) of 0.38 eV. On the other hand, the undesirable dehydration of HCOOH to carbon monoxide (CO) through COOH (Path-IIIA) or formyl (HCO) (Path-IIIB) intermediates is unlikely to occur on Pd–N3Gr due to a large activation energy. We found that the active species on the catalyst surface increased with N-doping concentration. Additionally, microkinetic simulations of the HCOOH decomposition on these surfaces confirmed the high activity and selectivity of the Pd–N3Gr catalyst toward HCOOH dehydrogenation (Path-I). These calculated results highlight that the Pd–N3Gr catalyst is a promising candidate for the formic acid decomposition reaction to yield hydrogen.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Implants can be placed through conventional freehand, static computer-assisted implant surgery (CAIS), or dynamic CAIS protocols, but at present there is very limited clinical evidence on their accuracy in fully edentulous patients. This study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement using three protocols in fully edentulous patients. Thirteen patients received 60 implants with the freehand (n = 20), static CAIS (n = 20), or dynamic CAIS (n = 20) protocol. Postoperative cone beam computed tomography was utilized to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement in relation to the planned optimal position. The data were analysed by ANCOVA followed by Bonferroni analysis. The mean angular deviation (standard deviation) in the freehand, static CAIS, and dynamic CAIS groups was 10.09° (4.64°), 4.98° (2.16°), and 5.75° (2.09°), respectively. The mean three-dimensional deviation (standard deviation) at the implant platform in the freehand, static CAIS, and dynamic CAIS groups was 3.48 (2.00) mm, 1.40 (0.72) mm, and 1.73 (0.43) mm, while at the implant apex it was 3.60 (2.11) mm, 1.66 (0.61) mm, and 1.86 (0.82) mm, respectively.

This study compared KGav and CO2 removal efficiency of the highly concentrated ternary amines solvent at various concentrations with the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) in a laboratory scale CO2 absorption packed-column. The six blends of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), piperazine (PZ), and MEA are formulated as ternary solvents at high PZ/AMP molar ratio (1.25–3.75) and total amine concentration (6M and 7M). Be noted that the solvent precipitation was not observed in this study. The absorption experiment was operated at 303 K temperature, 12% CO2 by volume, and CO2 loading of 0.25 mol CO2/mol amine. The experimental results showed that KGav and CO2 removal efficiency for AMP-PZ-MEA and MEA solvents increased as total amine concentration increased. Also, KGav and CO2 removal efficiency of the PZ-AMP-MEA solvent are greater than those of 5M MEA. An increase of PZ/AMP molar ratio had a positive influence on the absorption performance for ternary amines. In comparison with the benchmark 5M MEA, all the studied AMP-PZ-MEA solvents showed an outperformance. The two suggested formulae, which are 0.95:3.55:1.5 (6M) and 0.95:3.55:2.5 (7M), possessed approximately 1.5 and 2.5 times higher KGav and 17.34% and 17.63% greater CO2 removal efficiency compared with the benchmark 5M MEA.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Potential production of carbon nanotubes from liquid aromatic hydrocarbons over Fe and Ni on alumina powder via catalytic chemical vapor deposition,"San M.T., Prachakittikul P., Chainarong K., Sripisarn T., Kerdnawee K., Suttiponparnit K., Charinpanitkul T., Koo-Amornpattana W., Srifa A., Ratchahat S., Chaiwat W.",2023-08-01,"Alumina powder, Alumina support, Catalytic Chemical Vapour Deposition, Liquid aromatic hydrocarbon, Metal catalyst, Potential production, Synthesised, Waste oil, Waste pyrolysis, ]+ catalyst, Alumina support, Carbon nanotubes, Catalytic chemical vapor deposition, Liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, Metal catalyst","In this study, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons of benzene C6H6, toluene C7H8, and xylene C8H10 (BTX), which can be abundantly found in industrial waste oil and pyrolysis products of waste plastics, were used as carbon sources to produce carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs were firstly synthesized from liquid benzene over powdered alumina (Al2O3) supported Fe and Ni catalysts at 700 to 850 °C via catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) method. It was found that, CNTs synthesized from Fe/Al2O3 resulted in significantly higher carbon yields at 1.0–5.6 wt% with relatively higher graphitization analyzed by Raman spectroscopy compared to those of Ni/Al2O3 with the yields only at 0.6–2.8 wt%. However, smaller sizes of CNTs at 20–29 nm could be produced from Ni/Al2O3 compared to 30–38 nm obtained from Fe/Al2O3 due to its smaller crystallite size of the initial catalyst confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. For both catalysts, with increasing CCVD temperature, the yields tended to increase with a slight increase in CNT diameter and graphitization degree. The temperature of 800 °C was then chosen for further preliminary investigation on potential mass production of CNTs from BTX. By doubling the amount of catalysts, the CNT yield could be approximately twice achieved by maintaining its uniformity and quality because of remaining active sites of the catalysts. In addition, increasing the carbon atoms of aromatic hydrocarbons resulted in improved yields without changing the quality of CNTs. Finally, kinetic mechanisms of CNT growth from BTX decomposition using Fe/Al2O3 catalyst were simply investigated by varying reaction time from 10 to 60 min. At feeding flow of 0.5 mL/min, optimum reaction time was achieved at 30 min in order to produce uniform CNTs at high yields without carbon loss, unreacted BTX, and undesired by-products, which possibly occurred by hydrogenation, catalyst deactivation, and/or side reactions of as-produced gaseous hydrocarbons during CCVD reaction.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry, engineering, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Chemistry (all), Mechanical Engineering, Physics and Astronomy (all), Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The goal was to identify the most beneficial implant attachment system design for mini-implant overdentures with a lower risk of implant fracture. Methods: Twelve 3D FE models simulating a mandible segment with one-and two-piece mini-implants with different attachment systems, diameters, and overdentures were created using three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) software. Vertical and oblique forces (45° to the longitudinal axis of the implant) of 100 N were applied to the dentures. The stress distribution was analyzed. A bending test was performed on a mini-implant (Locator, 2.4 mm) using a testing machine to quantify the load at yield stress. Results: One-piece mini-implants showed lower maximum stress compared to two-piece mini-implants. Among the three designs, the magnet attachment systems showed the maximum stress. The maximum von Mises stress occurred at the neck of the implants, which was surrounded by cortical bone in all models, and under both loading conditions. Conclusions: Focusing on the attachments and one-and two-piece designs of mini-implant overdentures using CAD models to reduce confounding factors affecting the stress distribution, we concluded that one-piece mini-implants tended to show lower stress compared to two-piece mini-implants.

However, its early cellular targets remain poorly characterized. We used a single-cell approach to retrieve the phenotype and TCR sequence of infected cells in blood and lymphoid tissue from individuals at the earliest stages of HIV infection. HIV initially targeted a few proliferating memory CD4+ T cells displaying high surface expression of CCR5. The phenotype of productively infected cells differed by Fiebig stage and between blood and lymph nodes. The TCR repertoire of productively infected cells was heavily biased, with preferential infection of previously expanded and disseminated clones, but composed almost exclusively of unique clonotypes, indicating that they were the product of independent infection events. Latent genetically intact proviruses were already archived early in infection. Hence, productive infection is initially established in a pool of phenotypically and clonotypically distinct T cells, and latently infected cells are generated simultaneously.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Infectious Diseases"

Cleaning of Ni foam substrate with a 2.5 M HCl acid solution showed an oxide layer with the uniform thickness (0.034 μm) of coating before detachment took place. The cycling behavior of Ni foam substrate cleaned with a 2.5 M HCl acid solution responded with supercapacitor characteristics such as redox peaks with a small potential difference (0.398 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1) and has the highest diffusion coefficient values for anodic (6.55 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) and cathodic (6.44 × 10−6 cm2 s − 1) peaks. The performance of Ni foam cleaned with a 2.5 M HCl acid solution also showed the highest areal discharge capacity (1758.2 F cm−2 at a current density of 8 mA cm−2). The effect in the electrochemical effect was supported by the impedance analysis. This finding indicates that the suitable concentration for Ni foam cleaning should be less than a 2.5 M HCl acid solution to avoid the detachment of the oxide layer.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, coastal engineering","Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

In Penaeus monodon, the PmKuSPI gene has been found to be highly expressed in the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected shrimp and is predicted to be regulated by a conserved microRNA, pmo-miR-bantam. We reported that, despite being upregulated at the transcriptional level, the PmKuSPI protein was also upregulated after WSSV infection. Silencing the PmKuSPI gene in healthy shrimp had no effect on phenoloxidase activity or apoptosis but resulted in a delay in the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp as well as a reduction in the total hemocyte number and WSSV copies. According to an in vitro luciferase reporter assay, the pmo-miR-bantam bound to the 3′UTR of the PmKuSPI gene as predicted. In accordance with the loss of function studies using dsRNA-mediated RNA interference, the administration of the pmo-miR-bantam mimic into WSSV-infected shrimp lowered the expression of the PmKuSPI transcript and the PmKuSPI protein, as well as the WSSV copy number. According to these results, the protease inhibitor PmKuSPI is posttranscriptionally controlled by pmo-miR-bantam and plays a role in hemocyte homeostasis, which in turn affects shrimp susceptibility to WSSV infection.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

Age >60 years was identified as a risk factor for patients with CPKP (P < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio = 11.500, 95% confidence interval = 3.223–41.034). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed genetic diversity of CPKP isolates; however, clonal spread has been observed. ST70 (n = 4) was common, followed by ST147 (n = 3). blaNDM-1 from all isolates were transferable and mainly resided on IncA/C plasmid (80%). All blaNDM-1 plasmids remained stable in bacterial host for at least 10 days in antibiotic-free environments, regardless of replicon types. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the prevalence of CPE among outpatients in Thailand remains low and the spread of blaNDM-1-positive CPKP may be driven by IncA/C plasmid. Our results emphasize the need for a large-scale surveillance study to limit further spread of CPE in community.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"
Enhanced charge carrier density of a p-n BiOCl/BiVO4 heterostructure by Ni doping for photoelectrochemical applications,"Somdee A., Wannapop S., Pijarn N., Bovornratanaraks T.",2023-03-15,"Bismuth oxychloride, Bismuth vanadates, Charge carrier density, Density-functional-theory, Ni content, Ni-doping, Photo-anodes, Photocurrent density, Photoelectrochemical applications, Water splitting, Bismuth oxychloride, Bismuth vanadate, Density functional theory, Hydrogen, Photoelectrochemical cell, Water splitting","Pure and doped p-n BiOCl/BiVO4 heterostructures with various Ni contents were studied for photoanode applications in photoelectrochemical cells. All materials were synthesized by the coprecipitation method. The properties of the pure and doped materials were characterized by various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV[sbnd]visible spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, density function theory calculations were employed to investigate the underlying physical mechanism of the Ni substitution. The materials were applied as the photoanode at an applied bias voltage of +1.9 V (vs. RHE) and irradiated over 4200 s under the solar light simulator. The pure p-n BiOCl/BiVO4 heterostructure showed the highest photocurrent of 1 mA/cm2. After 1% Ni doping, the photocurrent density was enhanced, and the highest photocurrent density was approximately 1.7 mA/cm2. From the theoretical calculation aspect, the role of Ni substitution into the parent p-n BiVO4 and BiOCl materials resulted in a surface state under the conduction band of both parent materials. The result was in agreement with the Mott-Schottky analysis, which showed that the charge carrier density increased as Ni atoms were added to the p-n BiOCl/BiVO4 heterostructure. Therefore, the additional state and the increase in the charge carrier density led to the improved photocatalytic activity of the Ni-doped p-n BiOCl/BiVO4 heterostructure.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

We previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system based on convolutional neural network for detection of focal liver lesions (FLLs) in ultrasound. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether the AI system can assist non-expert operators to detect FLLs in real-time, during ultrasound examinations. Method: This single-center prospective randomized controlled study evaluated the AI system in assisting non-expert and expert operators. Patients with and without FLLs were enrolled and had ultrasound performed twice, with and without AI assistance. McNemar's test was used to compare paired FLL detection rates and false positives between groups with and without AI assistance. Results: 260 patients with 271 FLLs and 244 patients with 240 FLLs were enrolled into the groups of non-expert and expert operators, respectively. In non-experts, FLL detection rate in the AI assistance group was significantly higher than the no AI assistance group (36.9 % vs 21.4 %, p < 0.001). In experts, FLL detection rates were not significantly different between the groups with and without AI assistance (66.7 % vs 63.3 %, p = 0.32). False positive detection rates in the groups with and without AI assistance were not significantly different in both non-experts (14.2 % vs 9.2 %, p = 0.08) and experts (8.6 % vs 9.0 %, p = 0.85). Conclusions: The AI system resulted in significant increase in detection of FLLs during ultrasound examinations by non-experts. Our findings may support future use of the AI system in resource-limited settings where ultrasound examinations are performed by non-experts.

Methods: Dental implants were installed with surgical guides in the posterior hemiarches of 10 dry human mandibles: 0.5 mm above to the MC cortex (G1/n = 8) and 0.5 mm inside the MC (G2/n = 10). The experimental set-up was scanned with two CBCT equipment using 85 kV and 90 kV, MAR ON or OFF, and different tube currents (4 mA, 8 mA and 10 mA). Two dentomaxillofacial radiologists (DMFRs) and two dentists (DDS) scored the relation between the dental implant and MC. Descriptive statistics were used to observe the absolute frequency of scores. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated considering the known relation between the dental implant and the MC interior. McNemar's test (α =.05) was applied to compare the diagnostic efficacy of MAR ON versus MAR OFF. Results: Overall specificity was higher than sensitivity for both DDS and DMFR (97% vs. 50% and 92.0% vs. 78.0% respectively). There was a significant effect of MAR (p =.031) for DMFR in the case of contact between the dental implant with the MC interior, in which sensitivity decreased with MAR activation from 90% to 40%. DMFR observers showed a better diagnostic performance compared with the DDS observers (accuracy of 84.0% and 71.0%, respectively). Conclusions: Due to the limited efficacy of MAR, it should not be used when conducting CBCT scans for the evaluation of contact between the implant and the mandibular canal.",dentistry,Oral Surgery

Anthropological activities, including the expansion of human settlements and the subsequent land use conversion, are considered important factors that can trigger landslides. In this study, to evaluate landslide susceptibility, we carried out a 2D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) survey along a hilly slope of the mountains to identify the lithological types of the subsurface layers. The lithological condition becomes the primary location at which a slip surface could eventually form and degree of saturation is the principal factor controlling slip surface formation. The interpreted 2D ERT indicated a significant resistivity contrast between the sediments/weathered rock material and the resistant bedrock at various depths (from 3 to 10 m). The MATLAB code of spatial resistance change (SRC) was used to analyze the resistivity change in the subsurface layers. The results revealed a high contrast in the SRC at the boundary between the dominantly low and high resistivities of the bedrock and the fracture features. Therefore, SRC analysis can enhance the ERT results and help delineate and categorize susceptible landslide zones effectively. In our study, the susceptibility zones related to ground modifications were located in the clusters of lodges, campground sites, and cabbage fields. Generally, in terms of the infiltration of drained rainwater, the load of a building having a shallow foundation can increase the likelihood of landslides. The occurrence gullies of the back slope may be an initial sign of a landslide.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

This medical waste may include face masks, gloves, face shields, goggles, coverall suits, and other related wastes, such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant containers. To address this issue, the effect was investigated of gasification process parameters (type of COVID-19 medical mask based on the polypropylene ratio, pressure, steam ratio, and temperature) on hydrogen syngas and cold gas efficiency. The gasification model was developed using process modeling based on the Aspen Plus software. Response surface methodology with a 3k statistical factorial design was used to optimize the process aiming for the highest hydrogen yield and cold gas efficiency. Analysis of variance showed that both the steam ratio and temperature were significant parameters regarding the hydrogen yield and cold gas efficiency. Proposed models were constructed with very high accuracy based on their coefficient of determination (R2) values being greater than 0.97. The optimum conditions were: 65 % polypropylene in the mixture, a pressure of 1 bar, a steam ratio of 0.38, and a temperature of 900 °C, producing a maximum hydrogen yield of 40.61 % and cold gas efficiency of 81.43 %. These results supported the efficacy of the primary design for steam gasification using a mixture of plastic wastes as feedstock. The hydrogen could be utilized in chemical applications, whereas the efficiency could be used as a basis for further development of the process.","mixing and separation, engineering",Engineering (all)

To explore this limitation, in this research, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was selected as a sustainable process for producing green solid fuel or bio-coal with a rich of carbon content from palm shell and bamboo, remarkably as model biomass raw materials. The effect of biomass to water weight ratio (1:1 to 1:10), reaction temperatures (160 – 250 °C), and reaction times (1 – 6 h) were performed under autogenous pressure of promising aqueous media. The effect of organic and inorganic acid adding in the HTC of palm shell and bamboo was discussed. The obtained bio-coal was further well characterized with proximate and ultimate analysis and fuel properties. From the results, increasing reaction temperature and adding of acids led to increase carbon content, resulting to increase HHV of bio-coal. Effects of feedstocks (palm shell and bamboo), temperature, and types of acids revealed significantly results on the bio-coal yield accompanied with carbon content, the higher heating value (HHV), energy densification, and energy yield. The addition of inorganic acid in the HTC of biomass with high cellulose content provided higher HHV improvement than that of stony biomass. The highest HHV of 27.9 MJ/kg was obtained in bio-coal derived from palm shell feedstock with 1:1 water ratio and hydrothermally at 250 °C for 6 h. Surprisingly, this HHV is comparable to high-volatile bituminous coal. Moreover, an evaluating assessment for the utilization of this bio-coal instead of biomass feedstock to generate electricity in the thermal power plant with size of 9.9 MW capacity could reduce 34.4 % of fuel storage size, save nearly 29,709.36 USD/year in transportation costs and diminish CO2 emission during burning by approximately 56,732 tons/25 years.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulation by chalcones, a class of polyphenols abundantly found in plants, is proposed as a promising therapeutic approach for DM. This study aimed to identify novel chalcone derivatives with improved AMPK-stimulating activity in human podocytes and evaluate their mechanisms of action as well as in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of DN. Among 133 chalcone derivatives tested, the sulfonamide chalcone derivative IP-004 was identified as the most potent AMPK activator in human podocytes. Western blot analyses, intracellular calcium measurements and molecular docking simulation indicated that IP-004 activated AMPK by mechanisms involving direct binding at allosteric site of calcium-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) without affecting intracellular calcium levels. Interestingly, eight weeks of intraperitoneal administration of IP-004 (20 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased fasting blood glucose level, activated AMPK in the livers, muscles and glomeruli, and ameliorated albuminuria in db/db type II diabetic mice. Collectively, this study identifies a novel chalcone derivative capable of activating AMPK in vitro and in vivo and exhibiting efficacy against hyperglycemia and DN in mice.

The amperometric technique was used in monitoring the current response of the glucose sensor in the NaOH and PBS solutions. A notable and distinct observation emerged, wherein the negative current response was observed as the glucose concentration was increased. The negative current response can be attributed to a unique mechanism of the glucose sensor namely the selective adsorption of glucose molecules. The current responses with various glucose concentrations in the NaOH and PBS solutions were identified as power laws with the equations of I (µA) = 56.519 C−0.331 (mM) and I (µA) = 50.724 C−0.029, respectively. The sensitivity values are 672 mM−1 cm−2 and 21 mM−1 cm−2 in NaOH and PBS, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.5 mM for NaOH and 0.01 mM for PBS; the glucose sensor demonstrated superior sensitivity in NaOH because of the electrolyte strength. The numerous advantages of the present non-enzymatic glucose sensor modified with PEDOT: PSS on SPCE are the ease of fabrication, low cost, rapid monitoring, precise measurement, high sensitivity and selectivity, good reproducibility, and with long-term stability. The fabricated glucose sensor is suitable as a portable sensor for diabetes patients without utilizing elaborate and expensive laboratory protocols.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

SOEC can operate in both modes: water electrolysis for hydrogen production and water/carbon dioxide co-electrolysis for syngas production. The operating conditions and performance of the integrated systems between the methanation and SOECs with both modes are different. To study the direct and indirect utilization of CO2 in the methanation integrating SOEC with both modes, this study focuses on the comparative analysis of two integrated systems between the methanation and SOECs with water electrolysis mode and co-electrolysis mode for green natural gas production from fermentation waste in all aspects such as energy and economic analyses. Additionally, heat integration of both integrated systems with pinch analysis is studied. Results indicate that the methane yield of mixed CO and CO2 methanation is higher than that of CO2 methanation. The integrated system between the methanation and SOEC with co-electrolysis mode achieves a higher system efficiency, compared to that of a system using SOEC with water electrolysis mode. The efficiency of both systems can be improved by heat integration which increases by 4.60–6.09%.

Specifically, the control design is based on a two-layer hierarchical structure consisting of an upper layer and a lower layer. In the lower layer, each agent is represented by a linear time-invariant system and executes a local action. Moreover, each agent exchanges information with neighbouring agents in the upper layer through an undirected graph to achieve the global goal of stabilisation and disturbance attenuation for the MAS. We propose two robust control designs, namely, robust (Formula presented.) hierarchical control and robust (Formula presented.) hierarchical control. The design of local and global feedback control laws is formulated as a constrained optimisation over linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The LMI formulation can effectively incorporate the design objective to minimise disturbance attenuation. Numerical results show that the proposed robust controls ensure robust stability of MAS and outperform the existing nominal controls by improving the disturbance attenuation.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Computer Science Applications"

However, there are still very few systematic studies focusing on beach ridges available from the Gulf of Thailand. Along the east coast, satellite images provide evidence of beach ridges in the Chanthaburi Province, extending as far as 6 km inland, oriented parallel to the current coastline. These can be divided into a set of landward ridges (5.3-6.0 km inland) and seaward ridges (0.4-1.8 km inland) that are separated by an arm of the Chanthaburi estuary. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of 26 sand samples from 12 pits of ridge profiles suggests that the landward set of beach ridges formed ca. 3500 yr ago, while the seaward set of ridges formed between ca. 2100-1200 years ago, which also includes the modern active beach. It appears that the landward set of beach ridges developed during a period of relatively stable sea level followed by a rapid regression presently occupied by the arm of the Chanthaburi estuary. The seaward set of beach ridges apparently reflects a millennium of slowly retreating coastline until the modern beach ridge formed.","arts, earth sciences","Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Earth-Surface Processes, Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)"

Different amounts of melamine (25–100 wt% support) were loaded on activated carbon by impregnation and carbonization, while the Ni2P catalyst was fabricated by the co-impregnation of nickel nitrate and ammonium hydrogen phosphate. The interaction between nitrogen-containing functional groups on the carbon surface and Ni2P caused a uniform dispersion of small-sized crystalline Ni2P particles on the activated-carbon surface, reduced from 28.91 nm to 10.85 nm, as shown by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The Ni2P/CN catalyst exhibited high oxygen removal and alkylphenol selectivity (more than 63%) in the liquid product at 350 °C under atmospheric pressure.

Performance of electrokinetic remediation system for mercury contaminated marine sediment: Roles of electrode spacing and electrode configuration,"Bunditboondee C., Lohwacharin J., Khan E., Laohhasurayotin K.",2023-09-01,"Contaminated marine sediments, Electrode configurations, Electrode spacing, Electrokinetic remediation, Hg removals, Marine sediments, Mercury fraction, Performance, Remediation systems, Electrode configuration, Electrode spacing, Electrokinetic remediation (EK), Marine sediment, Mercury fraction","Understanding mercury (Hg) species existing after electrokinetic remediation (EK) for marine-sediment remediation is limited. Herein, the Hg fraction removal of EK from contaminated marine sediment was investigated appertaining to bipolar electrode settings along with the effects of electrode spacing and configuration considered. Based on the selective sequential Hg extractions (Hg SSE), much of the Hg in the sediment originated from F5 (i.e., HgS) and F4 (i.e., HgO). The F5 fraction removed by EK was about 30 %, while the F4 fraction had a slight increase of about 34 %. When it comes to electrode configuration, a hexagonal pattern has a higher Hg removal performance than that of a rectangular shape. The addition of anodes increases the remediation surface area, thus allowing superior Hg removal. This study indicates that the electrode spacing significantly affects the mercury removal and the remediation time. Determining suitable spacing enhances the electrical potentials in the migration flux.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, fluidex; related topics, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Oceanography, Aquatic Science, Pollution"
“Assessing exposure of printing factory workers in thailand to selected heavy metals using urine and hair as non-invasive matrices”,"Sirinara P., Patarapongsant Y., Nilyai S., Sooklert K., Dissayabutra T., Rojanathanes R., Sereemaspun A.",2023-12-01,"Arsenic, Cadmium, Environmental Monitoring, Hair, Humans, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Metals, Heavy, Nickel, Thailand, Hair, Heavy metals, Printing factory workers, Thailand, Urine","Background: There are few thorough studies on the extent and inter-element relationships of heavy metal contamination in printing factory workers, especially in developing countries. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of eight heavy metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and manganese (Mn), in urine and scalp hair of printing industry workers, and assess inter-element correlations. Methods: We examined a total of 85 urine samples and 85 scalp hair samples (3 cm hair segments taken from near the scalp) in 85 printing workers from a printing house in Bangkok, Thailand. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire about participants’ printing techniques, work characteristics, and work environment. Urine and scalp hair samples were analyzed for levels of each element using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) technique. Results: As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb were detected in urine with the geometric mean concentration range of 0.0028–0.0209 mg/L, and Hg, Pb, Ni, Cd, Co, Mn, Cr were detected in hair samples (0.4453–7.165 mg/kg dry weight) of printing workers. The geometric mean Ni level was significantly higher in the urine of production line workers than back-office personnel (0.0218 mg/L vs. 0.0132 mg/L; p = 0.0124). The other elements did not differ significantly between production line and back-office workers in either urine or hair. There was also a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between Ni and Co levels in hair samples of workers (r = 0.944, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Average concentrations of most of the metals in urine and hair of printing workers were found to be above the upper reference values. The significantly higher concentrations of Ni in production line workers might be due to more exposure to printed materials. A strong inter-element correlation between Ni and Co in hair samples can increase stronger health effects and should be further investigated. This study reveals possible dependencies and impact interactions of heavy metal exposure in printing factory workers.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The unique method involves a single-step pyrolysis process in an air atmosphere, eliminating the need for an inert atmosphere and pre-treatment procedures. It enables simultaneous self-templating and heteroatom doping, resulting in oxygen-rich functional groups embedded in the nitrogen-doped carbon structure. We also crafted a carbon structure without heteroatom doping, comparing its electrochemical performance in ORR and HER. Our findings indicate that carbon catalysts pyrolyzed at higher temperatures have more pyridinic N, functional groups, and active sites- factors conducive to electrochemical reactions. We tested the air-synthesized electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline electrolyte and employed the optimized nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, pyrolyzed at 700 °C in an air atmosphere, as cathode material in a zinc-air battery. This catalyst demonstrated ORR performance comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst and showed minimal overpotential in acidic HER. Our research establishes a pioneering technique for synthesizing porous, metal-free, nitrogen-doped carbon materials, paving the way for potential energy applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
High Catalytic Activity of a Nickel Phosphide Nanocatalyst Supported on Melamine-Doped Activated Carbon for Deoxygenation,"Pham L.K.H., Kongparakul S., Reubroycharoen P., Ding M., Guan G., Vo D.-V.N., Chanlek N., Van C.N., Samart C.",2023-01-01,"Catalysts support, Catalytic pyrolysis, Deoxygenation reactions, Deoxygenations, Doped carbons, Melamine-doped carbon, Nano-catalyst, Nickel-based catalyst, Palm kernel shells, ]+ catalyst, Catalytic pyrolysis, Deoxygenation, Melamine-doped carbon, Nickel phosphide, Palm kernel shell","Nickel-based catalysts are inexpensive and exhibit high catalytic activity; therefore, they have been extensively explored in deoxygenation reactions. Employing catalyst supports results in high product selectivity, and nitrogen-doped carbon has attracted significant interest as a catalyst support owing to the effect of nitrogen on the electronic properties. The present study demonstrated the synthesis of a Ni2P catalyst on melamine-doped carbon. The synthesized catalyst exhibited high deoxygenation activity, thereby facilitating the integrated catalytic upgradation and pyrolysis of palm kernel shells. Melamine-doped carbon was fabricated via carbonization of melamine-impregnated activated carbon. Subsequently, the Ni2P catalyst was loaded via sequential wet impregnation and temperature-programmed reduction. The presence of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) significantly affected the morphology and electronic properties of NixPy. Complexation between Ni and the N-containing functional groups on the carbon surface resulted in optimal distribution of the NixPy phase along the carbon support. Furthermore, electron transfer from the triazine structure to Ni substantially impacted the deoxygenation activity and the selectivity for aromatic and phenolic compounds. The outcomes of this study revealed that N-containing functional groups play a crucial role in optimizing the catalytic activity and the selective yield of alkylphenol products.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

However, its low water solubility has limited its potential use in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. One possible strategy for addressing this issue is the use of a supramolecular complex with large-ring cyclodextrins (LR-CDs). In this study, the phase solubility of the CD26/α-tocopherol complex was investigated to assess the possible ratios between host and guest in the solution phase. Next, the host–guest association of the CD26/α-tocopherol complex at different ratios of 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 2:1, 4:1, and 6:1 was studied by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. At 1:2 ratio, two α-tocopherol units interact spontaneously with CD26, forming an inclusion complex, as supported by the experimental data. In the 2:1 ratio, a single α-tocopherol unit was encapsulated by two CD26 molecules. In comparison, increasing the number of α-tocopherol or CD26 molecules above two led to self-aggregation and consequently limited the solubility of α-tocopherol. The computational and experimental results indicate that a 1:2 ratio could be the most suitable stoichiometry to use in the CD26/α-tocopherol complex to improve α-tocopherol solubility and stability in inclusion complex formation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Costs and benefits from both the provider and patients are presented. Methods: Cost-effectiveness and estimated net monetary benefit analysis of one to five visits for fluoride varnish application using a retro-prospective cohort study design. Cost and outcomes were estimated using dental personnel survey data, hospital procurement data and guardian survey. The primary outcomes were decayed (treatment needed), missing due to caries and filled teeth (dmft). Results: From the provider's perspective, one to three visits for fluoride varnish application decreased dmft and saved costs compared to no visits, one visit and two visit strategies (ICER = −468.36, −424.40 and −65.72, respectively). These strategies also showed an estimated net monetary benefit of 430.89, 216.44 and 7.23 THB, respectively. From the patient's perspective, the estimated net monetary benefits were positive for up to three visits (383.24, 212.45 and 45.82 THB, respectively); however, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were no different with these strategies (ICER = −416.56). The one and two visit strategies had a very high chance of showing cost saving in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (97.1% and 95.5%, respectively). Conclusions: The one to three visits fluoride varnish application program during well-child visits appears to be cost-effective with estimated net benefit interventions for dental caries prevention. These findings suggest that children between 9 and 30 months old should attend at least three visits of the fluoride varnish application program during well-child visits.","dentistry, medical","Dentistry (all), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

The present work aimed to determine the response of human alveolar bone cells to the diamond-like carbon (DLC) film and to evaluate the antibacterial effect of DLC-coated titanium. The alloys were deposited with different compositions, including C2H2 (DLC), carbon tetrafluoride (CF4:C2H2; F-DLC), and tetramethylsilane (Si(CH3)4:C2H2; Si-DLC). The surface morphology and wettability were measured using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) and a contact angle measurement. Titanium coated with DLC, F-DLC, or Si-DLC increased surface roughness and hydrophobicity. The ratio of spreading cells to initial rounded attaching cells at 20 min of all modified surfaces was higher than that of the control surfaces. F-DLC showed better cell spreading at 20 min compared to other conditions, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The DLC, F-DLC, and Si-DLC coating significantly promoted cell proliferation compared to the Ti-6Al-4V control surfaces. ALP mRNA expression was significantly reduced on DLC surfaces compared to the control on day 14. Additionally, ALP and BMP2 mRNA expression increased on F-DLC-coated surfaces, but there were no statistically significant differences. However, DLC surfaces promoted higher mineral deposition than the control. The lower Staphylococcus aureus colony was observed on the surface of the DLC and F-DLC. In conclusion, the DLC-modified Ti-6Al-4V surface modulates cell attachment, proliferation, osteogenic marker gene expression, and bacterial growth. Herein, DLC-coated titanium alloys are still needed for continued development as an alternative biomaterial in dental applications.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry, engineering, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Chemistry (all), Mechanical Engineering, Physics and Astronomy (all), Materials Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis indicated that full scalar invariance was upheld across all nations, languages, gender identities, and age groups, suggesting that the unidimensional BAS-2 model has widespread applicability. There were large differences across nations and languages in latent body appreciation, while differences across gender identities and age groups were negligible-to-small. Additionally, greater body appreciation was significantly associated with higher life satisfaction, being single (versus being married or in a committed relationship), and greater rurality (versus urbanicity). Across a subset of nations where nation-level data were available, greater body appreciation was also significantly associated with greater cultural distance from the United States and greater relative income inequality.

As the number of vehicles on the road continues to grow, managing and controlling traffic has become increasingly complex. Large cities in particular face significant challenges, including concerns around privacy and the consumption of resources. To address these issues, the development of automatic LPR technology within the IoV has emerged as a critical area of research. By detecting and recognizing license plates on roadways, LPR can significantly enhance management and control of the transportation system. However, implementing LPR within automated transportation systems requires careful consideration of privacy and trust issues, particularly in relation to the collection and use of sensitive data. This study recommends a blockchain-based approach for IoV privacy security that makes use of LPR. A system handles the registration of a user’s license plate directly on the blockchain, avoiding the gateway. The database controller may crash as the number of vehicles in the system rises. This paper proposes a privacy protection system for the IoV using license plate recognition based on blockchain. When a license plate is captured by the LPR system, the captured image is sent to the gateway responsible for managing all communications. When the user requires the license plate, the registration is done by a system connected directly to the blockchain, without going through the gateway. Moreover, in the traditional IoV system, the central authority has full authority to manage the binding of vehicle identity and public key. As the number of vehicles increases in the system, it may cause the central server to crash. Key revocation is the process in which the blockchain system analyses the behaviour of vehicles to judge malicious users and revoke their public keys.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

This modification allows activation with a 21-Watt light-emitting diode (LED) visible light source. The surface structure characteristics of the ZnO/CdS photocatalyst was analyzed using XRD, HRTEM, FESEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. UV-NIR was used for bandgap analysis and the DFT simulation method to compute the atomic properties of the materials. Catalytic evaluation showed that the ZnO/CdS photocatalyst completely degraded the model dye solution (100%) using 0.5 g of Z3C1 (3:1 M ratio) of 100 mg L−1 MB solution at pH 9 within only 90 min. A scavenger test confirmed that the hydroxyl OH• and superoxide •O2− radicals proved were the major active species responsible for degradation process. The reusability of Z3C1 was demonstrated over 4 reaction cycles, proving that CdS significantly enhances visible light absorption by extending the photo-response range and promoting superior formation of e− and h+. This delays their recombination due to the Z-scheme type, making it highly potential for wastewater treatment.","fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"
"Investigation on deactivation of Cu-Cr catalyst for direct ethanol dehydrogenation to ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, and hydrogen","Preedavijitkul S., Autthanit C., Jadsadajerm S., Srijaroen C., Praserthdam P., Jongsomjit B.",2023-06-01,"Active site, Bio-ethanols, Catalysts deactivation, Copper chromium, Cu-cr catalysts, Dehydrogenation reactions, Ethanol dehydrogenation, Ethyl-acetate, Oxidation state, Acetaldehyde, Catalyst deactivation, Cu-Cr catalyst, Ethanol dehydrogenation, Ethyl acetate, Hydrogen","Background: The utilization of bioethanol by converting it into additional high-value-added products including acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and hydrogen impresses as an appealing strategy at the present. The Cu-Cr catalysts improved product formation on ethanol dehydrogenation. This research was to assess the stability of the reaction and the deactivation of the catalyst over protracted ethanol dehydrogenation. Methods: The deactivation behaviors of 50 Cu-Cr catalyst on ethanol dehydrogenation reaction was investigated. The co-precipitation technique was used to synthesize the Cu-Cr catalyst, which was then reduced by a mixture of H2/N2 prior to the stability test in the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction. The fresh, reduced, and/or spent catalysts after being used in ethanol dehydrogenation were characterized using XRD, SEM-EDX, HR-TEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, XPS, TGA, and TPO. Significant finding: The proportion of CuCr2O4, Cu+, and Cu0 active sites on the catalyst sample influenced catalytic activity. Based on the results, the activity was related to the oxidation state of copper-chromium in the Cu-Cr catalyst. Fascinatingly, the results of the ethanol dehydrogenation showed that the catalyst deactivation was caused by the change in the copper-chromium oxidation state via the hydrogen self-reduction process and the soft coke formation on active sites after prolonged ethanol dehydrogenation resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"
Comparative Techno-Economic Evaluation of a Standalone Solar Power System for Scaled Implementation in Off-Grid Areas,"Sadiq M., Kokchang P., Kittipongvises S.",2023-09-01,"Cost of energies, Economy of scale, Grid community, Levelized costs, Off-grid electrification, Off-grids, Power generation capacities, Renewable energies, Solar PVs, Techno-Economic analysis, economy of scale, off-grid electrification, solar PV, techno-economic analysis","The increasing environmental concerns and dependence on fossil fuel-based energy sectors necessitate a shift towards renewable energy. Off-grid communities can particularly benefit from standalone, scaled renewable power plants. This study developed a comprehensive techno-economic framework, analyzed the objective metrics, and assessed the influence of economies of scale in solar PV power plants to electrify off-grid communities, taking Baluchistan, Pakistan, as a pilot case. Simulations and analyses were performed using the System Advisor Model (SAM). The results indicate a noteworthy reduction in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) with increased power generation capacity. It was observed that utilizing bi-facial modules with single-axis tracking leads to a more cost-effective LCOE compared to the relatively expensive dual-axis trackers. The main cost factors identified in the analysis were capital costs, installed balance of plant (BOP), mechanical, and electrical costs. Notably, the disparity between the highest and lowest LCOE values across the six different power generation pathways amounted to approximately 38.5%. The average LCOE was determined to be 2.14 USD/kWh for fixed-mounted plants, 1.79 USD/kWh for single-axis plants, and 1.74 USD/kWh for dual-axis plants across the examined power generation capacity range. The findings can serve as a valuable benchmark, specifically for regional key stakeholders, in making informed investment decisions, formulating effective policies, and devising appropriate strategies for off-grid electrification and the development of renewable energy value chains.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

JAK2 and JAK3 are associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia and common lymphoid-derived illnesses. JAK2/3 inhibitors could reduce the risk of various diseases by targeting this pathway. Herein, the naphthoquinones were experimentally and theoretically investigated to identify novel JAK2/3 inhibitors. Napabucasin and 2′-methyl napabucasin exhibited potent cell growth inhibition in TF1 (IC50 = 9.57 and 18.10 μM) and HEL (IC50 = 3.31 and 6.65 μM) erythroleukemia cell lines, and they significantly inhibited JAK2/3 kinase activity (in a nanomolar range) better than the known JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these two compounds induced apoptosis in TF1 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner. From the molecular dynamics study, both compounds formed hydrogen bonds with Y931 and L932 residues and hydrophobically contacted with the conserved hinge region, G loop, and catalytic loop of the JAK2. Our obtained results suggested that napabucasin and its methylated analog were potential candidates for further development of novel anticancer drug targeting JAKs.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

However, many power plants worldwide still use coal and natural gas as raw materials, which generates toxic gases, especially CO and CO2. To deal with this problem, transforming generated CO into another useful precursor before supplying it to the chemical process is a good idea. One of the most effective approaches is WGSR using a highly effective catalyst. In this work, we elucidate the insight information of PtPdRhFeCo HEA(1 1 1) surface improving the catalytic efficiency of Pt(1 1 1) surface. Interestingly, the homogenous form of electron distribution along Pt(1 1 1) surface is changed to heterogeneous forms creating unique electronic properties in which the electron donor and acceptor species exist simultaneously. The weakening interaction of CO corresponding to the strengthening interaction of CO2 on HEA(1 1 1) surface are advantages to preventing CO poison and trapping the CO2 after the WGSR. Moreover, the HEA(1 1 1) surface can thermodynamically promote the dissociation of H2O in pre-WGSR, creating active species of H*, O*, and OH* supplying to further the WGSR process. Nevertheless, consideration of PES along WGSR demonstrates that all possible pathways, including carboxyl, redox, and formate pathways along HEA(1 1 1) surface, are significantly improved by enhancing the thermodynamic driving force producing CO2.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Rice straw (RS) and medium density fiberboard (MDF) were used as feedstock for the torrefaction. Three input parameters were evaluated to determine the optimum conditions: rice straw ratio (RSR), torrefaction temperature and residence time. A response surface method based on a Box-Benhken design was used to achieve the optimum conditions (maximizing torrefied heating value and energy yield). Main and interaction effects for the independent variables on the responses were investigated based on analysis of variance (ANOVA). The findings revealed that temperature was the main effect and that there was no interaction effect between the inputs. Thus, a lower temperature optimized co-torrefaction. The optimum conditions for maximizing the heating value (22.13 MJ/kg) and energy yield (99.60%) were an RSR of 25%, a temperature of 208.10 °C and a residence time of 50 min. The experimental values were in good agreement with the corresponding predicted values. These findings should provide guidelines for the thermal pretreatment of mixed waste material for co-firing or co-gasification.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Engineering (all)

Calcium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Ca-EDTA) was used as a calcium source, which could release Ca2+ ions to crosslink with the alginate chain by adding acid. Effects of emulsification speed, Ca-EDTA concentration, and crosslinking time on morphology, mechanical properties, rheological properties were investigated. A high-speed homogenizer was used to reduce the W/O emulsion size in the emulsification method. The smooth surface morphology of alginate particles was found from internal gelation while particles from external gelation showed a rough surface. Mechanical and rheological measurements demonstrated that a higher Ca2+ provided denser particles. The crosslinking time played a significant role in rheological properties. Double-gelation which was internal gelation followed by external gelation resulted in even higher stiffness compared with the particles from only internal crosslinking. Using the microfluidics technique, we could generate monodisperse alginate particles with more uniformity and controllable size. Thus, alginate particles can be fabricated using a continuous process which can avoid batch-to-batch variation.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, chemistry, coastal engineering","Food Science, Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Cells were first grown under adequate nitrate supply (BG11) to increase biomass and subsequently transferred to nitrogen deprivation (-N) to stimulate glycogen accumulation. However, the two-stage method is time-consuming and requires extensive energy. Thus, one-stage cultivation that enables both cell growth and glycogen accumulation is advantageous. Such one-stage method could be achieved using a chemical triggering glycogen storage. However, there is a limited study on such chemicals. Here, nine compounds previously reported to affect cyanobacterial cellular functions were examined in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. 2-Phenylethanol, phenoxyethanol, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and methyl viologen can stimulate glycogen accumulation. The oxidative stress agent, methyl viologen significantly increased glycogen levels up to 57% and 69% [w/w dry weight (DW)] under BG11 and -N cultivation, respectively. One-stage cultivation where methyl viologen was directly added to the pre-grown culture enhanced glycogen storage to 53% (w/w DW), compared to the 10% (w/w DW) glycogen level of the control cells without methyl viologen. Methyl viologen treatment reduced the contents of total proteins (including phycobiliproteins) but caused increased transcript levels of glycogen synthetic genes and elevated levels of metabolite substrates for glycogen synthesis. Metabolomic results suggested that upon methyl viologen treatment, proteins degraded to amino acids, some of which could be used as a carbon source for glycogen synthesis. Results of oxygen evolution and metabolomic analysis suggested that photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not completely inhibited upon methyl viologen treatment, and these two processes may partially generate upstream metabolites required for glycogen synthesis.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Plant Science, Cell Biology"

In Pakistan, the rural population faces challenges in accessing reliable electricity, necessitating the exploration of alternative electrification methods. While previous studies have focused on single-user systems, no single RES fully meets all sustainability criteria. Moreover, the impacts of scaled RES differ significantly from those of single systems, encompassing technological, environmental, social, and economic aspects. This study assessed the sustainability of scaled RES for electrifying off-grid communities using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The assessment framework considered social, technical, environmental, and economic factors as key dimensions of sustainability. Pairwise comparison matrices were employed to determine priority vectors and weighted averages of indicators for fourteen sub-criteria. The results revealed that solar PV (29.82%) emerged as the most sustainable RES for scaled electrification in selected off-grid regions, followed by solar-thermal (26.79%), wind (23.86%), and biomass energy (19.53%). Each alternative has strengths in different categories, with solar-PV excelling in the environmental (42.30%), biomass in the social (36.18%), solar-thermal in the technical (41.53%), and wind energy in the economic category (39.40%). These findings provide valuable insights for implementers and policymakers seeking sustainable electrification solutions for off-grid communities. They emphasize the importance of aligning RES with the unique needs and goals and advocates for the widespread adoption of solar PV systems as a reliable source of electrification for off-grid areas.",energy,"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The study explored trends in cannabis use in Thailand before and after the recreational cannabis allowance was imposed. Methods: Cannabis and other variables of substance use, cannabis use disorder, and attitude towards cannabis of the Thai population aged 18 to 65 years in 2019 (n = 5,002), 2020 (n = 5,389) and 2021 (n = 5,669) were obtained from annual surveys conducted in the last two months of each year by the Centre for Addiction Studies. The surveys were repeat cross-sectional surveys of the general population of Thailand. Repeated variables from at least two annual surveys were included for analysis using the Chi-square test and the t-test. Results: The prevalence of cannabis use in the past year had increased from 2.2% in 2019 to 2.5% and 4.2% in 2020 and 2021 respectively, while those of methamphetamine, alcohol, and tobacco use had decreased. Trends in past-year drinking/eating cannabis products had increased, especially among the middle age group (40–49 years) from 2.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.1) in 2019 and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6, 1.9) in 2020 to 3.8% (95% CI: 2.8, 5.0) in 2021.

Sustainability issues have become even more challenging in a developing country because of greater economic inequalities and regulatory weaknesses. However, with the lack of empirical and holistic evidence in this specific context, this research aims to understand business and policy perspectives on sustainability transitions in Thailand's cosmetic industry where little has been investigated. This qualitative study conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with industry and policy stakeholders. A deductive content-analysis approach was utilized to extend the application of product life cycle thinking and circular economy to sustainability-related practices and policies. We found that multinational cosmetic companies pursue initiatives to improve sustainability dimensions more prominently and holistically as part of their corporate strategies. Meanwhile, local cosmetic companies still lack resources, a holistic understanding of life cycle impacts, and a full integration of sustainability into the core business. From a regulatory perspective, the lack of regulations for green cosmetics highlights the need for a total market approach in policy-making to encourage transparency in business practices and improve the role of trust in the relationship between producers and consumers. Policy recommendations include mandatory sustainability reporting, extended producer responsibility regulations for packaging, a directive on the communication of green claims, and financial incentives for green markets to facilitate sustainability transitions for the cosmetic industry.","chemistryical products genergyally, fluidex; related topics, environmental, energy, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

This work aimed at constructing a simple plasmonic Ag-nanocomposite (LBG/PRAg-NC) based on locust bean gum and Phyllanthus reticulatus anthocyanin in a sustainable manner for the optical detection of ferrous ions (Fe2+) in aqueous solution. LBG/PRAg-NC was prepared via a green chemistry route and thoroughly characterized for its physico-chemical and plasmonic attributes. Successful synthesis of LBG/PRAg-NC under room temperature with Phyllanthus reticulatus anthocyanin as reductant and locust bean gum as stabilizer was accomplished within 15 min. LBG/PRAg-NC exhibited small size (∼8.04 nm), spherically shaped nanosilver, with good colloidal dispersion, stability and prominent SPR absorption peak at 420 nm. XPS analysis revealed the existence of both Ag0 and Ag + species embedded in the biopolymer support. Furthermore, LBG/PRAg-NC was highly selective for Fe2+ as opposed to other interferents including Fe3+. The presence of Fe2+ engendered a redox oxidation of the analyte by the Ag+ species, prompting a rapid, concentration dependent increase in color and SPR absorption band intensity of LBG/PRAg-NC colloidal solution. In aqueous solution, the probe displayed a good linear range for Fe2+ (0.1–100 μM), and a low detection limit (LOD of 0.38 μM). The obtained detection limit is much lower than the guideline limit of Fe2+ content in drinking water, ∼5 μM. Additionally, the probe was successfully applied in determination of Fe2+ in aqueous solutions of apple juice, iron supplement tablet, and tap water, with commendable analytical performances. Therefore, our research findings demonstrate a facile, efficacious, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach for the sustainable synthesis of plasmonic Ag-nanocomposites based solely on locust bean gum and Phyllanthus reticulatus anthocyanin. Importantly, these results validate the capacity of plasmonic Ag-nanocomposite constructed via green chemistry route as a simple, rapid, and selective probe for effective monitoring of trace amounts of Fe2+ in aqueous environment.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been added to the Thai national standards of care for prevention of transmission of the hepatitis B virus during birth. To optimise national strategies in Thailand, we assessed TDF's effectiveness for prevention of mother-to-child transmission and conducted cost-effectiveness analyses of different TDF-based strategies. Research design and methods We retrospectively reviewed medical records of mother and infant pairs whose mothers were positive for hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) and received TDF to prevent maternal transmission of viral hepatitis B during 2018-2020. Based on the available data on transmission rate, we also applied a decision tree to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different TDF-based strategies to eligible mothers. These included: (1) HBIG for all hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposed infants; (2) HBIG for only infants of HBeAg-positive mothers ('HBIG for e-positive') and (3) without HBIG to infants ('HBIG-free'). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between the different strategies and baseline intervention without TDF was calculated. The one-way sensitivity analysis was used to adjust prevalence of HBeAg-positive mothers, cost of HBIG, cost of TDF and transmission rate. Results Of 223 infants enrolled, 212 (95.0%) received HBIG, while 11 (5.0%) did not. None of the infants had chronic HBV infection. The most cost-saving intervention was 'HBIG-free' followed by 'HBIG for e-positive'. The one-way sensitivity demonstrated that the results were reasonably robust to changes. The cost-saving was greater with a higher hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence. The HBIG-free strategy remained best at 0%-1.4% transmission rates, meeting the additional target for eliminations. Conclusion The study is the first cost-effectiveness analyses to provide evidence supporting an HBIG-free strategy in an antiviral era. This approach should be considered to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-constrained settings, particularly in countries with a high HBsAg prevalence.",medical,Medicine (all)

Then, the retained ligated cecal appendage (without gut obstruction) with or without oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus dfa1 (started at 4 days prior to the surgery) was used as a representative model. At 5 days post-surgery, the cecal-ligated mice demonstrated weight loss, soft stool, gut barrier defect (leaky gut using FITC-dextran assay), fecal dysbiosis (increased Proteobacteria with reduced bacterial diversity), bacteremia, elevated serum cytokines, and spleen apoptosis without kidney and liver damage. Interestingly, the probiotics attenuated disease severity as indicated by stool consistency index, FITC-dextran assay, serum cytokines, spleen apoptosis, fecal microbiota analysis (reduced Proteobacteria), and mortality. Additionally, impacts of anti-inflammatory substances from culture media of the probiotics were demonstrated by attenuation of starvation injury in the Caco-2 enterocyte cell line as indicated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), inflammatory markers (supernatant IL-8 with gene expression of TLR4 and NF-κB), cell energy status (extracellular flux analysis), and the reactive oxygen species (malondialdehyde).

Long-term exposure for each subject was defined as the 1-year average concentrations before the date of the physical examination in 2009, 2014, and 2019. We used linear mixed effects models to assess associations between air pollution and serum liver enzymes. Interquartile range increases in PM10 and O3 were related to decreased ALP [-2.4% (95%CI: -3.0, −1.9) and −6.6% (−7.3, −5.9), respectively] after potential confounders were adjusted. Positive associations between NO2, SO2, and CO with ALP were found [5.7% (4.8, 6.5), 4.5% (4.0, 5.0), and 0.8 (0.3, 1.4), respectively]. Elevated AST was also associated with higher PM10 [1.7% (0.8, 2.5)] and O3 [5.7% (4.5, 6.9)]. However, AST was negatively associated with NO2 [-2.9% (−4.0, −1.8)] and SO2 [-1.7% (−2.3, −1.1)]. In contrast to other air pollutants, we only observed a positive association between O3 and ALT [3.4% (1.5, 5.3)]. The alteration in liver enzyme levels was significantly associated with long-term exposure to air pollution, which may raise the possibility of hepatocellular damage.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Science (all), Atmospheric Science"
The NH-OSA score in prediction of clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea among the Thai population: derivation and validation studies,"Srichan S., Phannajit J., Tungsanga S., Jaimchariyatam N.",2023-06-01,"Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Mass Screening, Sensitivity and Specificity, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, Southeast Asian People, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thailand, Clinical score, Obstructive sleep apnea, OSA, Screening score","Background: Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea requires polysomnography which has limited availability. We aimed to develop and validate a risk score in predicting clinically significant OSA among the Thai population. Methods: We reviewed polysomnographic studies performed in adults diagnosed with OSA in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from 2017 to 2019. 1798 and 450 patients were randomly enrolled in development and validation cohorts, respectively. A risk score was developed using multiple factor analysis and logistic regression. The NH-OSA score was externally validated at the Bangkok Christian Hospital. We compared its performance to existing screening scores (STOP-BANG, Berlin Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and NoSAS score). Result: The NH-OSA score allocates 1 point for having neck circumference ≥ 13 inches (in women) or 15 inches (in men), 4 points for the presence of hypertension, 3 or 5 or 7 points for having a body mass index of 23–24.9, 25–30, ≥ 30 kg/m2, respectively, 9 points for the presence of moderate or severe snoring, and 5 points for age ≥ 40 years. With a cutoff value at 14 points, the sensitivity and specificity were 82.1% and 68.7%, respectively. The AUC was 0.75 (0.73–0.78). Both internal and external validation study revealed high AUC of 0.74 (0.68–0.80) and 0.75 (0.60–0.90), respectively. These were greater when compared to STOP-BANG, Berlin Questionnaire, ESS, and NoSAS score. Conclusion: NH-OSA is a newly developed tool which has good performance in predicting clinically significant OSA with high validity among the Thai population. It could help screen patients at risk of OSA for further investigation.",medical,"Otorhinolaryngology, Neurology (clinical)"

The experimental group received a communication program for three months, whereas the control group received no intervention. The study uses generalized estimating equations to assess the overall program between the experimental and control groups at baseline, intervention, and follow-up periods. The outcomes reveal that the communication program effectively reduced TB stigma (p-value < 0.05, CI = 4.962, −1.723) and increased knowledge about TB (p-value < 0.05, CI = 1.825, 2.537), attitudes toward TB (p-value < 0.05, CI = 4.493, 6.280), and self-efficacy on TB stigma and discrimination (p-value < 0.05, CI = 7.133, 9.483) compared with the control group.

Herein, α3β4 nAChR ligands were designed and synthesized to improve the binding affinity and selectivity of two lead compounds, (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2, for the development of an α3β4 nAChR tracer. The structural modification was achieved by retaining the key features and expanding the molecular structure with a benzyloxy group to increase the lipophilicity for blood-brain barrier penetration and to extend the ligand-receptor interaction. The preserved key features are a fluorine atom for radiotracer development and a p-hydroxyl motif for ligand-receptor binding affinity. Four (R)- and (S)-quinuclidine-triazole (AK1-AK4) were synthesized and the binding affinity, together with selectivity to α3β4 nAChR subtype, were determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using [3H]epibatidine as a radioligand. Among all modified compounds, AK3 showed the highest binding affinity and selectivity to α3β4 nAChR with a Ki value of 3.18 nM, comparable to (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 and 3069-fold higher affinity to α3β4 nAChR in comparison to α7 nAChR. The α3β4 nAChR selectivity of AK3 was considerably higher than those of (S)-QND8 (11.8-fold) and (S)-T2 (294-fold). AK3 was shown to be a promising α3β4 nAChR tracer for further development as a radiotracer for drug addiction.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Objective: To identify the gaps in recent clinical trials with cognitive outcomes in PD and consider areas for improvement. Methods: We examined recent clinical trials with cognitive outcomes in PD registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, excluding trials without cognitive outcomes, non-interventional studies, and in atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Included trials were categorized by treatment approach (investigational medicinal product, behavioral, physical activity, device-based). Details of trial design and outcomes were collected. Results: 178 trials at different stages of trial completion were considered. 46 trials were completed, 25 had available results. Mean follow-up duration was 29.9 weeks. Most common cognitive measure was Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Most were performed in North America or Europe. Majority of the participants identified as non-Hispanic and White. Only eight trials showed improvement in cognition, none showed improvement beyond four months. These included trials of international medicinal products, cognitive and physical interventions and devices. GRADE certainty levels ranged from Moderate to Very Low. Only mevidalen had a Moderate certainty for potential clinical effectiveness. Conclusions: Amongst a large number of trials for cognition in PD, only a small proportion were completed. Few showed significant improvement, with no proven long-lasting effects. Trial design, lack of enrichment for at-risk groups, short follow-up duration, insensitive outcome measures likely contribute to lack of detectable benefit and should be considered in future trials.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Geriatrics and Gerontology, Neurology (clinical)"

However, ATKs exhibit poor sensitivity and cannot detect low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we present a new, highly sensitive, and selective device obtained by combining the principle of ATKs with electrochemical detection for COVID-19 diagnosis, which can be quantitatively assessed using a smartphone. An electrochemical test strip (E-test strip) was constructed by attaching a screen-printed electrode inside a lateral-flow device to exploit the remarkable binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen to ACE2. The ferrocene carboxylic acid attached to SARS-CoV-2 antibody acts as an electroactive species when it binds to SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the sample before it flows continuously to the ACE2-immobilization region on the electrode. Electrochemical-assay signal intensity on smartphones increased proportionally to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (LOD = 2.98 pg/mL, under 12 min). Additionally, the application of the single-step E-test strip for COVID-19 screening was demonstrated using nasopharyngeal samples, and the results were consistent with those obtained using the gold standard (RT-PCR). Therefore, the sensor demonstrated excellent performance in assessing and screening COVID-19, and it can be used professionally to accurately verify diagnostic data while remaining rapid, simple, and inexpensive.","chest diseases, thoracic surgery and tuberculosis, fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, chemistry","Biophysics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Electrochemistry"

With the help of social media platforms, these networks have connected populations across the word and allowed people to view each other in close virtual proximity. Consequently, the Social Connectedness Index (SCI) is used to measure the strength of social connectivity across geographical regions through friendship ties on Facebook. The importance of social networks—and their relation to human connections—may correlate with the spread of COVID-19. Since these networks can have a potential effect on the spread of COVID-19, it is crucial to identify the factors that were associated with its spread during the pandemic. In order to analyze SCI data, a social network analysis was conducted to define the network parameters and perform calculations using graph theory. A correlation analysis was also performed to identify factors that correlated with the spread of COVID-19 cases using the data in the United States (US). Finally, the machine learning model was used to create a case prediction paradigm from the network parameters. The results showed that SCI can be used as a parameter to create a pandemic prediction model. Multiple linear regression also yielded satisfactory results that predicted the total number of positive cases measured by adjusted R2. In terms of the time frame, this study suggested that the parameters from the previous week can be used to predict the number of weekly infections. The findings showed that social networks had a greater impact on the prediction of current active cases than total positive cases. The social networks between counties within a state also held more importance than those across states.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Engineering (miscellaneous)"

However, studies concerning CT and the feline heart remain scarce. Aim: To create measuring techniques for the feline heart size on CT and to determine the relationships of feline heart size observed on CT with internal parameters including age, bodyweight (BW), and sex. Methods: Four parameters observed on CT including thoracic height/width ratio (THW), relative heart area (RHA), CT vertebral heart score (ctVHS), transverse vertebral heart score (tVHS) in 1.25 mm slice thickness, and both pre-and post-contrast enhanced images were examined. Additionally, radiographic vertebral heart score (rVHS) was also evaluated. Results: THW was significantly influenced by age (p < 0.05).

Methods: A total of 103 patients (metastatic hormone-sensitive PC, n = 57; castration-resistant PC, n = 46) underwent taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients had a minimum of 2 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans (at baseline and up to 3 mo after treatment). PSMA PET response was assessed by RECIST 1.1, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (using PSMA PET instead of bone scan), aPERCIST, and PSMA PET progression (PPP) criteria. Response by each criterion was stratified by either progressive disease (PD) or non-PD. For aPERCIST, stratification by PD, stable disease (SD), and partial/complete remission (PR/CR) was performed. Biochemical response was determined by a prostate-specific antigen decrease of at least 50%. Subgroup analyses were performed by castration status. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses including Harrell’s concordance indices were calculated to investigate the association of PD by response criteria and OS. Kaplan–Meier tests including log-rank statistics were calculated for survival analyses. Results: Twenty-six (25%) patients had unmeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1. PD by any response criterion was associated with an at least 2.5-fold increased risk of death and was highest for PD versus CR/PR by aPERCIST (hazard ratio, 11.4) on univariable regression. Stratified by castration status, a similar pattern was observed. PD by any criterion as associated with significantly shortened OS across overall and subgroup analyses. PR/CR by aPERCIST identified patients with lower risk of death and longer OS compared with patients with PD or SD. Conclusion: PSMA PET–based response criteria (PPP, aPERCIST, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) have high prognostic utility in men with metastatic PC undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. PPP is simple to use, identified most patients with PD, and showed best prognostic utility regarding OS.

It was also found that the blending of SR/NR at 90/10 provided the greatest tensile strength and elongation at break of 1.9 MPa and 1381%, respectively as well as good tear strength. The properties of this SR/NR blend and the corresponding interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) were compared and showed that the IPN provided higher tensile strength. However, the blend exhibited greater elongation at break and hardness, relatively close to human skin which are more important for a birthing model material. It can be concluded that the blending of SR/NR at 90/10 is the most promising material to substitute expensive currently used birthing model.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry"

However, previous investigations mainly focused on different metal oxides or pure metals as additives to modify Cu-based catalysts. The influence of non-metal oxide incorporation on the catalytic activity and stability of Cu/ZnO catalyst lacks a deep study. In this work, we prepared a series of boron oxide (B2O3) modified Cu/ZnO catalysts (CZB-R-x) with tunable boron content to disclose the role of B2O3. With the increase of B/Cu molar ratio (x) from 0 to 0.10, there exists a volcano-shaped correlation between catalytic activity and B/Cu molar ratio, revealing a balance between the promotional effect of B2O3 and the negative influence caused by excessive B2O3. CZB-R-0.05 catalyst can increase methanol space time yield (STY) by 7.5 times and total carbon turnover frequency (TOF) by 5.8 times at 170 °C, when compared to unmodified Cu/ZnO, and also stabilizes for 700 h at 200 °C without obvious deactivation. Kinetic studies indicate that the apparent activation energy required for low-temperature methanol synthesis is remarkably decreased from 217.2 kJ/mol over Cu/ZnO to 121.4 kJ/mol over CZB-R-0.05. Importantly, STY of methanol correlates linearly with Cu0 surface area and the number of strongly acidic sites, suggesting that higher Cu0 surface area and stronger surface acidity are key prerequisites for achieving outstanding performance for low-temperature methanol synthesis.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The procedure is covered by some healthcare plans, and paid out-of-pocket for others. We aim to determine if healthcare coverage and other socioeconomic factors affect the rate of postpartum sterilization in an urban, tertiary hospital. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort of 4482 postpartum women who delivered at our hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine if sterilization reimbursement affects immediate postpartum sterilization rate. Results: Overall immediate postpartum sterilization rate was 17.8%. Route of delivery and parity were similar in those who were reimbursed and those who were not. Women aged over 25 were more likely to have a healthcare plan that does not cover postpartum sterilization. Women whose healthcare plan reimbursed the procedure trended towards postpartum sterilization when compared to women who were not (aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86–1.28, p-value = 0.632).

PCC6803","The overexpression of the RuBisCO (rbc) gene has recently become an achievable strategy for increasing cyanobacterial biomass and overcoming the biocompound production restriction. We successfully constructed two rbc-overexpressing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains (OX), including a strain overexpressing a large subunit of RuBisCO (OXrbcL) and another strain overexpressing all large, chaperone, and small subunits of RuBisCO (OXrbcLXS), resulting in higher and faster growth than wild type under sodium bicarbonate supplementation. This increased biomass of OX strains significantly contributed to the higher polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production induced by nutrient-deprived conditions, in particular nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). As a result of higher PHB contents in OX strains occurring at days 7 and 9 of nutrient deprivation, this enhancement was apparently made possible by cells preferentially maintaining their internal lipids while accumulating less glycogen. The OXrbcLXS strain, with the highest level of PHB at about 39 %w/dry cell weight (DCW) during 7 days of BG11-NP treatment, contained a lower glycogen level (31.9 %w/DCW) than wild type control (40 %w/DCW). In contrast, the wild type control strain exposed to N- and NP-stresses tended to retain lipid levels and store more glycogen than PHB. In this model, we, for the first time, implemented a RuBisCO-overexpressing cyanobacterial factory for overproducing PHB, destined for biofuel and biomaterial biotechnology.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Intrahost Genetic Diversity of Dengue Virus in Human Hosts and Mosquito Vectors under Natural Conditions Which Impact Replicative Fitness In Vitro,"Nonyong P., Ekalaksananan T., Phanthanawiboon S., Overgaard H.J., Alexander N., Thaewnongiew K., Sawaswong V., Nimsamer P., Payungporn S., Phadungsombat J., Nakayama E.E., Shioda T., Pientong C.",2023-04-01,"Aedes, Animals, Dengue, Dengue Virus, Genetic Variation, Humans, Mosquito Vectors, Aedes aegypti, dengue virus, host switching, intrahost genetic diversity, replication kinetics, selection pressure","Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus whose transmission cycle involves disparate hosts: humans and mosquitoes. The error-prone nature of viral RNA replication drives the high mutation rates, and the consequently high genetic diversity affects viral fitness over this transmission cycle. A few studies have been performed to investigate the intrahost genetic diversity between hosts, although their mosquito infections were performed artificially in the laboratory setting. Here, we performed whole-genome deep sequencing of DENV-1 (n = 11) and DENV-4 (n = 13) derived from clinical samples and field-caught mosquitoes from the houses of naturally infected patients, in order to analyze the intrahost genetic diversity of DENV between host types. Prominent differences in DENV intrahost diversity were observed in the viral population structure between DENV-1 and DENV-4, which appear to be associated with differing selection pressures. Interestingly, three single amino acid substitutions in the NS2A (K81R), NS3 (K107R), and NS5 (I563V) proteins in DENV-4 appear to be specifically acquired during infection in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Our in vitro study shows that the NS2A (K81R) mutant replicates similarly to the wild-type infectious clone-derived virus, while the NS3 (K107R), and NS5 (I563V) mutants have prolonged replication kinetics in the early phase in both Vero and C6/36 cells. These findings suggest that DENV is subjected to selection pressure in both mosquito and human hosts. The NS3 and NS5 genes may be specific targets of diversifying selection that play essential roles in early processing, RNA replication, and infectious particle production, and they are potentially adaptive at the population level during host switching.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

The inclusion complex was prepared by the precipitation method and loaded within PVA semi-solid hydrogels which had various contents of CBD/β-CD inclusion complex (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% w/w). The obtained inclusion complexes and their corresponding hydrogels were characterized for their physicochemical properties and mechanical properties. The potential use as wound management of the obtained hydrogels in terms of their release profile, antioxidant activities, antibacterial capabilities, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory efficacy. The CBD/β-CD inclusion complex was successfully prepared, as confirmed by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, XRD, and SEM. The complexation efficiency was 84.73 ± 0.64% and the loading capacity was 32.70 ± 0.32%. The water solubility of CBD was significantly increased to 0.336, which was increased by 16-fold, as compared with that of raw CBD. The cumulatively released amount of CBD from the hydrogels increased with higher amounts of inclusion complex. The prepared hydrogels provided an antibacterial capability with S. aureus and MRSA, while no antibacterial capability was observed for E. coli. However, adding CBD to the hydrogel was beneficial for improving the antioxidant properties of the obtained hydrogels. All the hydrogels loaded with the CBD/β-CD inclusion complex at concentrations below 1.25 mg/mL for the extraction medium were non-cytotoxic towards RAW 264.7 cells and also provided the ability to suppress nitric oxide (NO) production by more than 75% compared with the LPS treated group. These findings suggest a new application for semi-solid PVA-borax hydrogels containing the CBD/β-CD inclusion complex in biomedical applications.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, Materials Science","Environmental Engineering, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

In particular, the contribution of each gas cannot be reasonably distributed when a binary mixture gas is co-adsorbed. In this paper, taking CO2 and N2 as an example, density functional theory is used to reveal the mechanism of selective adsorption of a transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu)-decorated InN monolayer. The results show that Ni decoration can improve the conductivity of the InN monolayer while at the same time demonstrating an unexpected affinity for binding N2 instead of CO2. Compared with the pristine InN monolayer, the adsorption energies of N2 and CO2 on the Ni-decorated InN are dramatically increased from −0.1 to −1.93 eV and from −0.2 to −0.66 eV, respectively. Interestingly, for the first time, the density of states demonstrates that the Ni-decorated InN monolayer achieves a single electrical response to N2, eliminating the interference of CO2. Furthermore, the d-band center theory explains the advantage of Ni decorated in gas adsorption over Fe, Co, and Cu atoms. We also highlight the necessity of thermodynamic calculations in evaluating practical applications. Our theoretical results provide new insights and opportunities for exploring N2-sensitive materials with high selectivity.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The electrocatalytic activity of materials strongly affects the water-splitting reaction. This present work describes the synthesis of a novel Ni-Mo2C/GA composite by hydrothermal and followed by a carbonization process. The dual role of CTAB in the synthesis of Mo2C acts as a surfactant and carbon source, resulting in improved morphology and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. The morphological images highlight the role of CTAB used for the synthesis of pure Mo2C and the characterization techniques demonstrate the carbon role of CTAB (carbon supplier) in Mo2C. The as-synthesized Mo2C was further incorporated with Ni and graphene aerogel (GA) to get a Ni-Mo2C/GA composite. The synthesized pure Mo2C, Ni-Mo2C, and Ni-Mo2C/GA composite were examined for the HER using a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The Ni-Mo2C/GA composite demonstrated improved current density and low overpotential (61 mV@10 mA/cm2), low Tafel slope (52 mV/dec), enhanced active surface area, and stunning stability up to 2000 cycles without deactivation. Our findings reveal the cost-effective synthesis of Ni-Mo2C/GA composite as an effective cathode material for HER applications.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"

To enhance the mechanical and electrical properties of nanocomposites for application as a strain sensor, we performed the homogenization of ENR/CNT suspension and fine dispersion of CNT in the ENR matrix. The effect of Alg on the properties of nanocomposites was estimated and compared with that of a common latex surfactant, that is, sodium dodecyl sulphate. The mechanical, electrical properties and strain sensitivity of ENR nanocomposites were improved with the use of Alg.

Specifically, this paper proposes using classification methods to create a prediction model from people's demography, behaviors, and other factors in order to analyze features that influence the risk of suicide deaths. Classification techniques employed include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. We have analyzed the data gathered by Thailand National Suicide Prevention Department from January 2018 to September 2021, which includes 49,417 suicidal cases, 30% of which resulted in fatalities. Two models are proposed: a general model to identify significant factors leading to suicide deaths and a practical model to predict suicide deaths given only available factors in practice.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications"

An integrated SSF-SmF process increased lipid production from 116.2 ± 0.1 mg/g-EFB under SSF and 60.1 ± 0.2 under SmF up to 124.9 ± 0.5 mg/g-EFB, possibly due to the combined benefits of dispersed mycelia forming during SSF and better mass transfer during SmF. As A. tubingensis lacks sufficient β-glucosidase, it was co-cultured with high β-glucosidase-producing Trichoderma reesei QM 9414. The co-cultures improved overall lipid yields likely due to synergistic interaction of the two fungi. After inoculum size was optimized and the co-cultures were performed in bioreactors, the lipid yield was increased up to 205.1 ± 1.1 mg/g-EFB. The fatty acid composition of fungal lipids indicated their potential use as biodiesel feedstocks. The fungal fermentation of EFB also provided cellulose pulp residues.

This work reports a simple pretreatment that allows OPW from all sections of the trunk having a thickness of up to 0.2 m to be severely kiln-dried up to the temperature of 200 °C without any drying defects and with relatively low drying shrinkage. Lightweight characteristics and mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties of the dried OPW are maintained. The pretreatment process involves water impregnation of fresh OPW followed by freezing the OPW below the eutectic temperature of sap (water–sugar) of about −10 °C before kiln drying. This strategy creates localized microcracks at the pit cavities that connect between the parenchyma cells. These microcracks allow the short-range flow of intercellular liquid at atmospheric pressure to compensate for the negative capillary pressure of the intracellular liquid inside the parenchyma cell cavity during drying. A fraction of the intercellular liquid plays a crucial role in the formation of microcracks during freezing and the reduction of cell collapse during drying. The technique is also found to be applicable to the drying of the porous trunk of other palm species.","coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

However, for its use in industry, LrInu’s thermostability is a crucial consideration. In this study, the computational program FireProt was used to predict the thermostable variants of LrInu. Using rational criteria, nine variants were selected for protein expression and characterization. The G237P variant was determined to be the greatest designed candidate due to its greatly enhanced stability and activity in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. The optimum temperature of G237P increased from 50 to 60°C, with an over 5-fold increase in the half-life. Spectroscopy studies revealed that the G237P mutation could prevent the structural change in LrInu caused by heat or urea treatment. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the enhanced thermostability of the G237P variant resulted from an increase in structural rigidity and the number of native contacts within the protein molecule. In addition, G237P variant synthesizes inulin with greater efficiency than WT. Key points: • Thermostable inulosucrase variant(s) were designed by Fireprot server. • G237P variant showed significantly improved thermostability compared to the wild type. • Inulin is synthesized more efficiently by G237P variant.

Objective To determine whether the routine use of spirometry alters clinical decisions and patient-related outcome measures for children managed by respiratory paediatricians. Methods We undertook a parallel open-label randomised controlled trial involving children (aged 4-18 years) able to perform spirometry in a specialist children's hospital in Australia. Children were randomised to either routine use of spirometry (intervention) or clinical review without use of spirometry (control) for one clinic visit. The primary outcomes were the (a) proportion of children with 'any change in clinical decisions' and (b) 'change score' in clinical decisions. Secondary outcomes were change in patient-related outcome measures assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Parent-Proxy QoL questionnaire for paediatric chronic cough (PC-QoL). Results Of 136 eligible children, 106 were randomised. Compared with controls, the intervention group had significantly higher proportion of children with 'any change in clinical decisions' (n=54/54 (100%) vs n=34/52 (65.4%), p<0.001) and higher clinical decision 'change score' (median=2 (IQR 1-4) vs 1 (0-2), p<0.001). Also, improvement was significantly greater in the intervention group for overall STAI score (median=-5 (IQR -10 to -2) vs -2.5 (-8.5, 0), p=0.021) and PC-QoL social domain (median=3 (IQR 0 to 5) vs 0 (-1, 1), p=0.017).

The assessment results showed that the CSR projects in the case study were conducive to the CE model, as most of the CE concepts evaluated by the performance indicators were already in place. This study aimed to support the implementation of CSR projects that contribute to adopting a CE business model and determine key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure and monitor CSR projects in terms of their CE concepts. The sustainability KPIs proposed in this study can serve as a set of guidelines to drive CE strategy adoption and allow for the identification of sustainable CSR projects that can simultaneously offer more value creation and satisfaction for all stakeholders, including society and the companies, while reducing environmental impacts.

In light of newer data, the objective of this updated systematic review was to determine whether a five-minute observation time was still adequate for death determination by circulatory criteria. Source: We searched four electronic databases from inception to 28 August 2021, for studies evaluating or describing autoresuscitation events after circulatory arrest. Citation screening and data abstraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. We assessed certainty in evidence using the GRADE framework. Principal findings: Eighteen new studies on autoresuscitation were identified, consisting of 14 case reports and four observational studies. Most studies evaluated adults (n = 15, 83%) and patients with unsuccessful resuscitation following cardiac arrest (n = 11, 61%). Overall, autoresuscitation was reported to occur between one and 20 min after circulatory arrest. Among all eligible studies identified by our reviews (n = 73), seven observational studies were identified. In observational studies of controlled withdrawal of life-sustaining measures with or without DCD (n = 6), 19 autoresuscitation events were reported in 1,049 patients (incidence 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8). All resumptions occurred within five minutes of circulatory arrest and all patients with autoresuscitation died. Conclusion: A five-minute observation time is sufficient for controlled DCD (moderate certainty). An observation time greater than five minutes may be needed for uncontrolled DCD (low certainty). The findings of this systematic review will be incorporated into a Canadian guideline on death determination.

Methods: In this randomized control study, 132 total knee arthroplasty patients were assigned to the iPACK, GNB, and iPACK + GNB groups. All patients received combined spinal anesthesia and continuous adductor canal block. The primary outcome was the 8-hour postoperative pain score during movement. Secondary outcomes were pain scores, posterior knee pain, intravenous morphine consumption, and tibial and common peroneal nerve sensorimotor function. All included patients completed the study. Results: The 4-hour and 8-hour postoperative pain scores during movement were significantly lower in the iPACK + GNB group than that in the iPACK group (−2.5 [3.6, 1.3]; P < .001 and −2 [-3, −1]; P < .001, respectively). The differences in rating pain scores and posterior knee pain were not clinically relevant. The iPACK group demonstrated a significantly higher intravenous morphine consumption than did the GNB and iPACK + GNB groups during the first 48 hours postoperatively (P < .001) but were not clinically relevant. There was no incidence of complete sensorimotor blockade in any of the groups. Conclusion: The iPACK–GNB combination relieved pain during movement better than the iPACK block alone during the 8 hours postoperatively after total knee arthroplasty in setting of multimodal analgesia such as adductor canal block.",medical,Orthopedics and Sports Medicine

Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 3 (CAMSAP3) has been implicated in lung cancer malignancies; however, its role in metastatic processes, including invasion and angiogenesis, is largely unknown. Main method: The clinical relevance of CAMSAP3 expression in lung cancer was evaluated. The relevance of CAMSAP3 expression to in vitro cell invasion and angiogenesis was assessed in human lung cancer cells and endothelial cells, respectively. The molecular mechanism was identified by qRT–PCR, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation. The in vivo metastatic and angiogenic activities of lung cancer cells were assessed. Key findings: Low CAMSAP3 expression was found in malignant lung tissues and strongly correlated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). CAMSAP3-knockout NSCLC exhibited high invasive ability, and CAMSAP3 knockout induced HUVEC proliferation and tube formation; these effects were significantly attenuated by reintroduction of exogenous wild-type CAMSAP3. Mechanistically, in the absence of CAMSAP3, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was upregulated, which increased the levels of downstream HIF-1α targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. Proteomic analysis revealed that nucleolin (NCL) bound to CAMSAP3 to regulate HIF-1α mRNA stabilization. In addition, CAMSAP3-knockout lung cancer cells displayed highly aggressive behavior in metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo. Significance: This study reveals that CAMSAP3 plays a negative regulatory role in lung cancer cell metastatic behavior both in vitro and in vivo through NCL/HIF-1α mRNA complex stabilization.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"
Barium sulphate–amorphous cellulose composite as innovative X-ray shielding substrate,"Mungpayaban H., Rueanngoen A., Rindhatayathon P., Ninlaphruk S., Ekgasit S., Pengprecha S.",2023-01-01,"Amorphous cellulose, Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Barium sulfate, Cellulose composites, Crystalline structure, Eucalyptus pulps, Submicro-particles, X- ray diffractions, X-ray attenuation, X-ray shielding, Amorphous cellulose, barium sulphate, submicroparticle, X-ray shielding","This study aimed to produce a composite of barium sulphate and amorphous cellulose (Ba/AC) as a substrate for X-ray attenuation. Ba/AC was fabricated by converting the crystalline structure of eucalyptus pulp into an amorphous one. Subsequently, amorphous cellulose was regenerated using barium compounds (barium chloride and barium sulphate suspension) to obtain Ba/AC specimens (Ba/AC–BaCl2 and Ba/AC–BaSO4, respectively). All substrates were characterised by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. X-ray attenuation was studied by mixing 20% w/w Ba/AC and 80% w/w silicone rubber, coating the mixture on cotton fabrics, and comparing to barium sulphate powder (BaSO4), a conventional material. The coated fabrics were exposed to X-rays at tube voltages of 30 kV, 40 kV, and 60 kV. The fabrics coated with Ba/AC presented higher X-ray shielding efficiencies than those with BaSO4. Owing to the important role of amorphous cellulose in Ba/AC in distributing barium sulphate particles, more voids on the fabric surfaces were reduced than when using BaSO4. Moreover, the Ba/AC substrate preparation did not require a complex procedure and did not employ analytical-grade chemicals. Thus, a Ba/AC composite could be used as a substrate for X-ray shielding materials, owing to benefits of environmental-friendliness, nontoxicity, cost-effectiveness, and possibility of scaling up for commercial purposes.","corrosion, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the risk of ruin for the insurer who implements the proposed bonus-malus system. Two premiums correction principles are examined: by aggregate claims or by claim frequency. Further, the Parisian type of ruin is also considered, where the premium adjustment rules are different in positive- and negative-surplus environment.","accidentistrys and accidentistry prevention, fluidex; related topics, Mathematics","Computational Mathematics, Applied Mathematics"

Methods: Forty-three cadavers were included. A left-sided anterior retroperitoneal approach was performed in supine position. The distances between the great vessels and psoas muscle (oblique corridor) and distance between great vessels and LSC at the L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5 disk levels were measured. Mobilization of LSC at each disk level was done either close to or away from the psoas muscle, and each mobilization distance was measured. Results: The presence rates of LSC in oblique corridor were 19.5%, 43%, and 75.7% at L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5 levels, respectively. At the L2/3 disk level, the mean distance between the psoas muscle and LSC and its mobility were 0.61 mm ± 1.31 mm and 2.72 mm ± 1.24 mm, respectively. At the L3/4 disk level, the mean distance between the psoas muscle and LSC and its mobility were 1.72 mm ± 2.53 mm and 3.11 mm ± 1.02 mm, respectively. At the L4/5 disk level, the mean distance between the psoas muscle and LSC and its mobility were 2.94 mm ± 3.52 mm and 2.53 mm ± 1.03 mm, respectively. The mean width of corridor of L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5 were 10.73 mm ± 5.82 mm, 12.63 mm ± 5.02 mm, and 15.43 mm ± 6.31 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The LSC tract usually lies in the oblique corridor in L4/5 but keeps decreasing in prevalence when approaching L3/4 and L2/3 levels. It can be mobilized a few millimeters close to or away from the psoas muscle.

The catalyst with a Ni to Re molar ratio of 1 : 0.12 exhibited superior performance for diesel production containing large fraction of iso-alkanes in comparison to Ni and Re benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations revealed that the detection of Ni and Re co-existed with NiO and ReOx on SAPO-11 after the reduction confirmed by XRD, XANES, and XPS analysis gave a large distribution of Lewis acid sites (>80 %) noticed by Pyridine-DRIFTS measurement. Under investigations of WHSV, reaction temperature, and H2 pressure, the NiRe0.12 catalyst contributed a nearly theoretical 77.1 % liquid yield, accompanied by a 18.2 % jet-range and 52.1 % diesel-range yields with a classification for 46.8 % iso-alkanes and 23.5 % normal alkanes yields; whereas, the cold-flow properties of liquid product were in the ranges of winter diesel standard. It was remarkably noticed that the combination effects of Ni and nanosized Re species substantially improved the diesel production comprising iso-alkanes components with proper catalyst lifetime and low carbon deposition attributing to the fabricated active metal species on bimodal SAPO-11 features with large distribution of Lewis acidic sites.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Learning-Based Rate Control for High Efficiency Video Coding,"Chen S., Aramvith S., Miyanaga Y.",2023-04-01,"Bits allocation, Coding efficiency, H.264-AVC, High-efficiency video coding, Learning-based rate control, PSO, Rate controls, Spatial coding, Temporal coding, Video coding standard H.264, HEVC, learning-based rate control, PSO","High efficiency video coding (HEVC) has dramatically enhanced coding efficiency compared to the previous video coding standard, H.264/AVC. However, the existing rate control updates its parameters according to a fixed initialization, which can cause errors in the prediction of bit allocation to each coding tree unit (CTU) in frames. This paper proposes a learning-based mapping method between rate control parameters and video contents to achieve an accurate target bit rate and good video quality. The proposed framework contains two main structural codings, including spatial and temporal coding. We initiate an effective learning-based particle swarm optimization for spatial and temporal coding to determine the optimal parameters at the CTU level. For temporal coding at the picture level, we introduce semantic residual information into the parameter updating process to regulate the bit correctly on the actual picture. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective for HEVC and outperforms the state-of-the-art rate control in the HEVC reference software (HM-16.10) by 0.19 dB on average and up to 0.41 dB for low-delay P coding structure.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, physics, biochemistryistry, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biochemistry, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

A service operation vessel (SOV), used to support maintenance activities, also carries a safe transfer boat (STB), which is used to transport technicians, parts, and equipment to the turbines. The maintenance activities are optimised over a planning horizon by simultaneously coordinating the SOV and the STB. A mixed-integer linear programming model is designed, where the objective function is to minimise the total maintenance cost. As the proposed mathematical model is hard to solve with a commercial solver, a decomposition approach is developed. A two-stage stochastic programming model is also designed to tackle uncertain conditions, including the duration of maintenance and the STB's travel time. The performance of the solution method is evaluated using the Thanet Offshore Wind Farm, in the southeast of the UK. The results of our experiments show that joint use of an SOV and an STB can yield a lower total maintenance cost than only using an SOV or crew travel vessels (CTVs) that are currently the common practice in maintaining offshore turbines.","computer science, Mathematics, decision sciences, engineering","Computer Science (all), Modeling and Simulation, Management Science and Operations Research, Information Systems and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl3 colorimetric assays. The antioxidant capacity was examined by reducing power (RP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ABTS⋅+, and DPPH⋅+ radical cation assays. All extracts potentially exhibited antioxidant activity with IC50 values ranging from 2.93 to 5.73 μg/mL for ABTS⋅+ and from 5.69 to 7.65 μg/mL for DPPH⋅+ except the n-hex extract. The BuOH, MeOH, and aqueous extract possess promising anti-skin-aging activities, as observed by an attenuation of UV-A toxicity on human keratinocytes. We proposed that these anti-skin-aging properties are possibly due to direct scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species and upregulate cellular antioxidant machinery. Moreover, we found that the antioxidant capacity was well correlated with anti-inflammatory capacity against nitric oxide (NO) production in terms of the n-hex, AcOEt, and BuOH extracts with IC50 values from 23.21 to 47.1 μg/mL. In contrast, these activities were found to be poorly correlated with AchE activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antioxidant, anti-skin-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities of the extracts of R. oligophlebia roots. These findings indicated that this species could be a potential source of natural antioxidant, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory agents.

Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide from an infectious disease. This review aimed to investigate the association between prior cytomegalovirus infection and tuberculosis disease. Methods. Six bibliographic databases were searched from their respective inception to 31 December 2021. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results. Of 5476 identified articles, 15 satisfied the inclusion criteria with a total sample size of 38 618 patients. Pooled findings showed that individuals with cytomegalovirus infection had a higher risk of tuberculosis disease compared to those not infected with cytomegalovirus (odds ratio [OR], 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.18–4.70). Age was the only covariate that exerted a significant effect on the result of the association.

A lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) with an electrocautery-enhanced delivery system [electrocautery-enhanced lumen-apposing metal stent (ELAMS)] may facilitate this procedure. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ELAMS in the management of symptomatic PFCs. Patients and Methods: A multicenter, nonblinded, prospective, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, investigational device exemption clinical trial was conducted. Enrollment criteria included symptomatic PFCs ≥6 cm with ≥70% fluid fraction. Subjects were followed prospectively for safety, efficacy, and resolution of the collections. Primary endpoint success was defined as ≥50% reduction in PFC size. Clinical outcomes were compared with our previously published series of LAMS without the cautery-enhanced delivery system. Results: The target enrollment of 30 patients was achieved in 7 US tertiary care centers. All patients underwent successful placement of the ELAMS. The mean procedure duration, stent placement time, and fluoroscopy exposures were 28.1±12.5, 5.8±2.6, and 1.8±1.6 minutes, respectively. Eight patients had no fluoroscopy. The primary endpoint was achieved in 83.3% of patients. Two adverse events were attributed to the ELAMS: 1 bleeding upon stent removal and 1 stent migration. Relative to the comparator noncautery LAMS multicenter trial (N=33, 8 tertiary centers), there was a significantly shorter procedure duration [36 min (P<0.001)] with similar technical and clinical outcomes in the ELAMS cohort.

This work employs K3PO4 catalyzed transesterifications of cassava starch and methyl laurate at varying reaction times (1–10 h), resulting in the enhanced hydrophobicity of starch laurates. At longer reaction times, starch laurates having higher degrees of substitution (DS) were obtained. While starch laurates are the major products of transesterification, relatively low-molecular-weight byproducts (1%) were detected and could be hydrolyzed starches based on gel permeation chromatography results. Contact angle measurements confirmed the relatively high hydrophobicity of the modified starches compared with that of native starch. The modified starches were then employed to prepare water-based adhesives on paper (without any additional additives). Notably, the shear strength of the esterified starch adhesives appears to be independent of the DS of esterified samples, hence the transesterification reaction times. Additionally, the shear strength of water-based adhesives (0.67–0.73 MPa) for bonding to paper substrates is superior to that of two other commercially available glues by a factor of 10 to 80 percent.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

The intake of cannabis by smoking has an impact on the mental health of smokers and intimates. Therefore, rapid monitoring of illicit cannabis use via direct saliva samples is necessary. The Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC) and thiocyanate (SCN) level in saliva can be an effective biomarker to differentiate between cannabis and non-cannabis smokers such as cannabis ingestion, cigarette smokers, and healthy people. In this work, there is a development of an electrochemical sensor, “copper-phthalocyanine-modified screen-printed graphene electrodes (CuPc/SPGE),” for the concurrent determination of Δ⁹-THC and SCN using differential pulse voltammetry. Furthermore, the applicability of the CuPc/SPGE sensor was verified by simultaneously measuring Δ⁹-THC and SCN in saliva samples. The results from the developed sensor were similar to those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography. This proposed sensor represents a first step in the differentiation of illegal cannabis smokers using the correlation between the contents of Δ⁹-THC and SCN in saliva, with features of rapidity, simplicity, low cost, and disposability.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"
Discovery of a chalcone derivative as an anti-fibrotic agent targeting transforming growth factor-β1 signaling: Potential therapy of renal fibrosis,"Poolsri W., Noitem R., Jutabha P., Raveesunthornkiat M., Danova A., Chavasiri W., Muanprasat C.",2023-09-01,"Animals, Antifibrotic Agents, Chalcone, Chalcones, Fibrosis, Kidney, Kidney Diseases, Mice, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Transforming Growth Factor beta1, Ureteral Obstruction, Chalcone derivatives, Kidney fibrosis, RPTEC cells, Transforming growth factor-β1, UUO mice","As a final common pathway of renal injuries, renal fibrosis leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, there is no safe and effective therapy to prevent the progression of renal fibrosis to CKD. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) pathway is proposed as one of the most promising approaches for anti-renal fibrosis therapies. This study aimed to identify novel anti-fibrotic agents using the TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) and characterize their mechanism of action as well as in vivo efficacy. By screening 362 natural product-based compounds for their ability to reduce collagen accumulation assessed by picro-sirius red (PSR) staining in RPTEC cells, a chalcone derivative AD-021 was identified as an anti-fibrotic agent with IC50 of 14.93 μM. AD-021 suppressed TGF-β1-induced collagen production, expression of pro-fibrotic proteins (fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)), and Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signaling pathways via suppression of TGF-β receptor II (TGFβRII) phosphorylation in RPTEC cells. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial fission in RPTEC cells was ameliorated by AD-021 via mechanisms involving inhibition of Drp1 phosphorylation. In a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis, AD-021 reduced plasma TGF-β1, ameliorated renal fibrosis and improved renal function. Collectively, AD-021 represents a novel class of natural product-based anti-fibrotic agent that has therapeutic potential in the prevention of fibrosis-associated renal disorders including CKD.",pharmacology,Pharmacology

Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study examined 186 eyes from 93 individ-uals subdivided into three groups according to 24-hour urine albumin levels: no DN, early DN, and late DN. Vessel density (VD), fractal dimension, foveal avascular zone area, intercapillary area, central retinal thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness were measured from OCTA images to determine their association with the DN stages. Results: VD values of the superficial capillary plexus, deep capillary plexus, and whole retina were significantly lower in the early DN group compared to the no DN group (adjusted P = 0.042, 0.016, and 0.008, respectively). VD values for the deep capillary plexus and whole retina were significantly decreased in the late DN group compared to the no DN group (adjusted P = 0.025 and 0.021, respectively). Mean fractal dimension, intercapillary area, foveal avascular zone area, central retinal thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness were not statistically different among the three groups. Conclusions: VD may be a useful parameter for the early non-invasive screening of DN. Further studies in larger populations are needed to establish a cutoff value for detection. Translational Relevance: This study investigated the association of each retinal vascu-lature measurement by OCTA and diabetic nephropathy status which could serve as an alternative way to screen for albuminuria.","engineering, medical","Biomedical Engineering, Ophthalmology"

Particularly, the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V with surface modification has been utilized in dental applications for decades. In this study, the plasma-based ion implantation (PBII) technique was applied on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V under gaseous mixtures of N2 and Ar with a flow rate of 30 sccm and 5 sccm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the titanium nitrided layer was formed on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V at the peak of 397 eV for N 1s. The effects of plasma nitride on the Ti-6Al-4V were creating a smooth surface with hydrophilic property (RRMS = 17.93 ± 0.05 nm, θ = 61.4° ± 0.36) and increasing surface hardness by ∼42%. Direct culturing with the primary human alveolar bone cells, the plasma-nitrided Ti-6Al-4V improved cell proliferation (4 and 7 days) and showed no cytotoxicity. The DAPI/rhodamine-phalloidin staining and the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to examine cellular morphology and initial cell adhesion. The result demonstrated that the plasma nitride enhanced the human alveolar bone cell adhesion compared with glass slides. Overall, plasma-nitridation with nitrogen and argon on Ti-6Al-4V using the PBII technique enhanced surface properties of Ti-6Al-4V and induced adhesion and proliferation of primary human alveolar bone cells, proposing that it can be a potential surface modification for dental application.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

The GDPR is a privacy law giving European Union (EU) citizens authority over personal data. It enforces software systems to collect, analyze, and share only necessary information (‘data minimization’) following the specific purpose (‘consent’). The GDPR defines consent as permission of individuals (‘data subjects’) to give organizations (‘data controllers’) processing their personal data. Without a data subject's consent, the data controller processes personal data unlawfully. Therefore, consent management is an essential component of a software system to build data subjects' trust and engagement. However, sharing data can lead to a potential loss of control over personal data, as data are across boundaries between software services. One of the significant risks is caused by a lack of developers' experience in data protection practices. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use blockchain technology to manage data subjects' informed consent for data sharing to build trust, transparency, and traceability to share data across software services. We formalized the semantics of smart contracts to extend the blockchain features to validate the consent authorization and manage the request-response interaction between the services. Furthermore, we used the Event-B method to describe the dynamic behavior of the proposed model and prove its correctness. Finally, we provided a mapping from the formal model to a smart contract class diagram and a prototype called SmartDataTrust implemented with solidity and Python REST API that developers can easily utilize.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, computer science","Theoretical Computer Science, Software, Logic, Computational Theory and Mathematics"

This paper offers a primer on hardware acceleration of image processing, focusing on embedded, real-time applications. We then survey the landscape of High Level Synthesis technologies that are amenable to the domain, as well as new-generation Hardware Description Languages, and present our ongoing work on IMP-lang, a language for early stage design of heterogeneous image processing systems. We show that hardware acceleration is not just a process of converting a piece of computation into an equivalent hardware system: that naive approach offers, in most cases, little benefit. Instead, acceleration must take into account how data is streamed throughout the system, and optimize that streaming accordingly. We show that the choice of tooling plays an important role in the results of acceleration. Different tools, in function of the underlying language paradigm, produce wildly different results across performance, size, and power consumption metrics. Finally, we show that bringing heterogeneous considerations to the language level offers significant advantages to early design estimation, allowing designers to partition their algorithms more efficiently, iterating towards a convergent design that can then be implemented across heterogeneous elements accordingly.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, Signal Processing, Information Systems, Modeling and Simulation, Hardware and Architecture"

Their limited bioavailability due to instability under ambient conditions can be overcome by cyclodexrin (CD) encapsulation. Here, single-crystal X-ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been carried out on NCA in free form (1) and in complex with β-CD (2), providing atomic-level insights into the structural flexibility and the inclusion complexation with β-CD of CGA isomers. X-ray analysis revealed that the two symmetry-independent s-cis-NCA and 0.3 water molecules form elaborated H-bond networks (1). Upon β-CD encapsulation, complex H-bond patterns are disrupted and the converted s-trans-NCA is almost entirely enclosed in the asymmetric capsular β-CD dimer (2). On the contrary, the twofold symmetry-related β-CD–s-cis-CGA dimer forms a rare [4]pseudorotaxane reported previously. DFT full-geometry optimization disclosed that both the 2:1 and 1:1 trimodal β-CD–s-trans-NCA inclusion complexes are energetically stable, as the reported s-cis-CGA complex. Furthermore, the three-dimension potential energy surface (3D PES) profiles and all the DFT-fully optimized NCA and CGA structures existing in different lattice environments showed that both the s-cis and s-trans conformers are thermodynamically stable. This study not only presents crystallographic evidence for the distinct NCA and CGA conformers, unequivocally differentiating and resolving the long-time confusing CGA nomenclature for the first time, but also highlights the prime role of CGA conformational flexibility in their pharmacological functions.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, chemistry, coastal engineering","Food Science, Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

Acute effect of various dosages of sugar ingestion on vascular function was also investigated in both groups.Methods:Thirty-two healthy men were recruited and divided into two groups, offspring of hypertensive parents (OHT) and offspring of normotensive parents (ONT). Participants were orally given 15, 30, and 60 g of sucrose solution compared to water. Peak forearm blood flow (FBF), forearm vascular resistance (FVR), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and oxidative stress markers were measured at baseline and after sucrose intake at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.Results:At baseline, peak FBF was significantly lower (22.40 ± 1.18 vs. 25.24 ± 0.63 ml × dl-1 × min-1, P < 0.001), FVR was significantly higher (3.73 ± 0.42 vs. 3.30 ± 0.26 mmHg × ml-1 × dl × min, P = 0.002), and PWV was significantly faster (6.31 ± 0.59 vs. 5.78 ± 0.61 m/s, P = 0.017) in OHT than ONT. After each sucrose intake, peak FBF significantly declined and was lowest at 30 min in both groups. The reduction in peak FBF was seen in all doses of sucrose and the higher dose of sucrose intervened, the longer reduction in peak FBF observed.Conclusions:Vascular function was attenuated in healthy men with a family history of hypertension and became worse after sucrose ingestion even at the low dose. Our findings suggest that the ones, especially those with a parental history of hypertension, should reduce sugar consumption as low as possible.","medical, biochemistryistry","Internal Medicine, Physiology, Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"

We aimed to evaluate the effect of methylprednisolone added to ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) combined with multimodal analgesia including intravenous dexamethasone for prolonged analgesia after early discharge. Materials and Methods: We randomized 80 patients who underwent fast-track TKA into 2 groups. All patients received a periarticular injection, PNBs, and multiple doses of intravenous dexamethasone. The methylprednisolone group received 140 mg methylprednisolone in PNBs, while the nonmethylprednisolone group did not. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain (Numerical Rating Scale ≥4) during the first 12 postdischarge days. The secondary outcomes included pain scores until 3 postoperative months, incidence of rebound pain, functional performances, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. Results: No significant between-group differences were noted in the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain during the first 12 postdischarge days (nonmethylprednisolone vs. methylprednisolone groups: 70% vs. 69.2%, P=0.941). However, this incidence was significantly higher in the methylprednisolone group between 2 weeks and 1 month (P=0.015) and between 1 and 3 months (P=0.004) postoperatively. No between-group differences in the Numerical Rating Scale scores at the postdischarge time points, incidence of rebound pain, and functional performance results were noted. Discussion: Adding perineural methylprednisolone to ultrasound-guided PNBs for multimodal analgesia with intravenous dexamethasone did not prolong analgesia and improved the functional ability after fast-track TKA within 12 postdischarge days. However, the incidence moderate-to-severe pain may increase between the 2-week and 3-month follow-up.",medical,"Neurology (clinical), Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language.

To address the challenge, in this article, the Cyber Collaborative Protocol for Dual-Cycle Task in Future Warehouse is developed to minimise total operation cost and time. The problem is addressed in two phases; the Global and Local phases. The global phase has higher computational power, maintaining a mathematical model, while the local phase has limited computational power and time, utilising heuristics to deliver the outcome. Computer experiments are utilised for validating the designed protocol compared with other alternatives. The results show that, in all given scenarios, the newly designed protocol outperforms alternatives with statistical significance.

Currently, L-DOPA can be produced by chemical synthesis and can also be found naturally in many herbs, especially Mucuna Pruriens (MP). According to clinical research, the MP extract containing L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease could reduce side effects more than the synthetic one. Unfortunately, MP extracts can be easily degraded. Changes in physical and chemical properties such as the appearance (color, melt, solid lump) and the reduction of L-DOPA content in the extract were commonly observed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an extraction procedure to stabilize the extract of L-DOPA. This study attempted to enhance the extraction process by modifying the traditional acidification approach using hydrochloric acid, citric acid, or ascorbic acid. According to the stability test results, using Phyllanthus emblica water (PEW) as a solvent improved the preservative properties more than other solvents. The color of the PEW-MP powder changed slightly after 12 months of accelerated storage, but the amount of L-DOPA remained the highest (73.55%). Moreover, L-DOPA was only detected in MP and PEW-MP, but not PEW alone (the HPTLC chromatogram at Rf 0.48 and the HPLC chromatogram at Rt 6.0 min). The chemical profiles of PEW and L-DOPA observed in the chromatograms indicated that they are independently separated. As a result, they can be applied to a quality control process. Therefore, PEW was proven to be a powerful solvent for L-DOPA herbal extract that could be readily used as a raw material for herbal products.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

The impact of composition engineering, nanoengineering, and mechanisms to improve electrocatalytic performance are studied. The electrochemical performance of Sn-based materials and their composites based on the overpotential, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), Tafel slope, selectivity, turn over frequency (TOF) and chronopotentiometric/chronoamperometric stability have been explained. Thus, tin-based materials have promising perspectives as catalysts for the reduction of electrochemical CO2, with potential for further optimization and integration with renewable energy sources.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all)"
Molecular characterization of turtle-like protein in whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and its role in Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei infection,"Velazquez-Lizarraga A.E., Sukonthamarn P., Junprung W., Nanakorn Z., Itsathitphaisarn O., Jaroenlak P., Tassanakajon A.",2023-09-01,"Animals, Enterocytozoon, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Penaeidae, Turtles, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei, Host-pathogen interaction, Microsporidia, Shrimp disease, Spore wall protein 1, Turtle-like protein","Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) is a microsporidian parasite that infects shrimp hepatopancreas, causing growth retardation and disease susceptibility. Knowledge of the host-pathogen molecular mechanisms is essential to understanding the microsporidian pathogenesis. Turtle-like protein (TLP) is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins, which is widely distributed in the animal kingdom. TLP has multiple functions, such as cell surface receptors and cell adhesion molecules. The spore wall proteins (SWPs) of microsporidia are involved in the infection mechanisms. Some SWPs are responsible for spore adherence, which is part of the activation and host cell invasion processes. Previous studies showed that TLP from silkworms (Bombyx mori) interacted with SWP26, contributing to the infectivity of Nosema bombycis to its host. In this study, we identified and characterized for the first time, the Litopenaeus vannamei TLP gene (LvTLP), which encodes an 827-aa protein (92.4 kDa) composed of five immunoglobulin domains, two fibronectin type III domains, and a transmembrane region. The LvTLP transcript was expressed in all tested tissues and upregulated in the hepatopancreas at 1 and 7 days post-cohabitation (dpc) and at 9 dpc in hemocytes. To identify the LvTLP binding counterpart, recombinant (r)LvTLP and recombinant (r)EhSWP1 were produced in Escherichia coli. Coimmunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated that rLvTLP interacted with rEhSWP with high affinity (KD = 1.20 × 10−7 M). In EHP-infected hepatopancreases, LvTLP was clustered and co-localized with some of the developing EHP plasmodia. Furthermore, LvTLP gene silencing reduced the EHP copy numbers compared with those of the control group, suggesting the critical role of LvTLP in EHP infection. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the host–pathogen interactions during EHP infection.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

In this work, a simple and low-cost electrochemical sensing platform for detecting SAR-CoV-2 antigen was established. The proposed sensor combined the innovative disposable paper-based immunosensor and cost-effective plant-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody CR3022, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The cellulose nanocrystal was modified on screen-printed graphene electrode to provide the abundant COOH functional groups on electrode surface, leading to the high ability for antibody immobilization. The quantification of the presence receptor binding domain (RBD) spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using differential pulse voltammetry by monitoring the changing current of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox solution. The current change of [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- before and after the presence of target RBD could be clearly distinguished, providing a linear relationship with RBD concentration in the range from 0.1 pg/mL to 500 ng/mL with the minimum limit of detection of 2.0 fg/mL. The proposed platform was successfully applied to detect RBD in nasopharyngeal swab samples with satisfactory results. Furthermore, the paper-based immunosensor was extended to quantify the RBD level in spiked saliva samples, demonstrating the broadly applicability of this system. This electrochemical paper-based immunosensor has the potential to be employed as a point-of-care testing for COVID-19 diagnosis.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry
"Effects of vermicompost leachate on nitrogen, phosphorus, and microbiome in a food waste bioponic system","Wongkiew S., Polprasert C., Noophan P.L., Koottatep T., Kanokkantapong V., Surendra K.C., Khanal S.K.",2023-08-01,"Food, Microbiota, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Refuse Disposal, Soil, Microbial community, Nutrient recovery, Organic hydroponics, Organic waste, Probiotics","Food waste is rich in nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and can be integrated with bioponics, a closed-loop agricultural system that combines hydroponics with biological nutrient recovery. Vermicompost leachate (VCL) supplementation has been shown to improve the co-composting of organic waste (i.e., compost quality) and the biodegradation of organic compounds. Thus, VCL has high potential for enhancing nutrient availability in bioponics from food waste. However, the understanding of nitrogen and phosphorus availability in food waste-based bioponics is limited, both with and without VCL. In this study, food waste derived from cafeteria vegetable waste was used as the substrate (500 g dry wt./system) in bioponics to grow lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) for two consecutive cycles (35 days/cycle) without substrate replacement. VCL was applied weekly (1–5% v/v) and compared to the control without VCL. The results showed that the food waste in bioponics provided nitrogen and phosphorus for plant growth (15.5–65.8 g/lettuce head). Organic-degrading and nutrient-transforming bacteria (Hydrogenispora, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Ruminiclostridium_1, Cellvibrio, Thauera, Hydrogenophaga, and Bacillus) were predominantly found in plant roots and residual food waste. VCL addition significantly increased nitrate, phosphate, and chemical oxygen demand levels in bioponics, owing to the nutrients in VCL and the enhancement of keystone microorganisms responsible for organic degradation and nutrient cycling (e.g., Ellin6067, Actinomyces, and Pirellula). These findings suggest that nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon concentrations in an ecosystem of nutrient-transforming and organic-degrading microbes are key in managing nutrient recovery from food waste in bioponics.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Waste Management and Disposal, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

Cellulose acetate (CA)/nanoclay (NC)-based hollow fiber composite membranes were prepared using a wet spinning process of CA solution and the addition of hydrophilic NC particles to improve the mechanical properties and permeability. According to the findings, the 20 wt% CA/0.5 wt% NC hollow fiber showed the higher mechanical strength than the 20 wt% CA hollow fiber without NC. Moreover, the 20 wt% CA hollow fiber without NC provided EtOH and DEE permeances of 8.44 × 10−11 and 4.25 × 10−10 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1, respectively, while the 20 wt% CA/0.5 wt% NC hollow fiber showed higher EtOH and DEE permeances of 6.50 × 10−10 and 8.49 × 10−9 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 plausibly because of the higher porosity based on the SEM images. Furthermore, both CA hollow fiber membranes were selective for DEE over EtOH and were more selective with the addition of NC.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

In this investigation, environmental bacteria identified concurrently from multiple aquatic habitats viz., groundwater, canal, river and coastal waters were profiled for antibiotic resistance, metal tolerance, virulence factors and genes coding for these determinants. Strains from polluted river and canal exhibited higher resistance and virulence, especially Pseudomonas gessardii and P. fluorescens displayed high antibiotic resistance index (ARI > 0.6–0.8) with Alkaline Protease and Phospholipase production. Opportunistic pathogens including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. vulnificus, Corynebacterium and Comamonas testosteroni expressed all three virulence factors with relatively low resistance. However, V. vulnificus and V. alginolyticus exhibited multiclass antibiotic resistance (5/6 classes). Metagenomic analysis revealed that genes corresponding to beta-lactam resistance were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in freshwater than seawater, while multidrug resistance gene were higher (p < 0.05) in seawater. In all aquatic bodies, abundant virulence genes belonged to secretion system proteins followed by motility related genes. Culturable bacteria revealed differential distribution of positive and negative correlation between 31 targeted genes with expressed resistance and virulence. Among Acinetobacter, significant positive correlation was found between Phospholipase production, other virulence genes (OVGs) and resistance to DNA Synthesis Inhibitors (DSI). In Pseudomonas, positive correlation was detected between toxin genes (toxA, eta, hlyA and stx) and resistance to cell wall synthesis inhibitors (CSI) as well as with OVGs and adhesion genes (eae, afa, papC and papA). Network analysis displayed unique clustering of genes ncc, arsB, strA, merA and intI dominated by non-pathogens and distinct clustering of genes pho, erm, nfsA, trh, lasB, tdh and invA by Vibrio. This investigation extends insight on co-occurring resistance and virulence in aquatic reservoir bacteria that could pose serious threats to public health in future.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes available evidence regarding the effect of nutrition on the presence and severity of NAFLD. Methods: A literature search was conducted identifying studies published between January 1985 and May 2021. We included studies with a dietary assessment and anthropometry based on validated tools, performed by a qualified dietitian or a trained health professional. We examined differences between patients with NAFLD and healthy controls as well as patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Risk of bias was assessed with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Results: There were 60 eligible studies with 100,621 patients. The risk of bias was moderate for the majority of studies (41/60; 68%). According to meta-analyses, total caloric intake was higher in patients with NAFLD compared with controls (mean difference, 78.08; 95% confidence interval, 41.03–115.13). Macronutrient (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) consumption as proportion of total caloric intake and daily intake of fiber, caffeine and vitamins E, A, and C did not significantly differ between patients with NAFLD and controls. Soft drink consumption had a trend towards association with the presence of NAFLD. However, the odds ratio was 4.4 and the confidence intervals very wide. Finally, there was no significant difference in any comparison between patients with NAFLD and NASH, although the number of patients was relatively small. All meta-analyses had significant heterogeneity. Conclusions: Overall, despite high heterogeneity among studies, this meta-analysis demonstrated that higher caloric intake is positively associated with NAFLD, whereas diet composition in macronutrients was not associated with the presence or severity of the disease.",medical,"Hepatology, Gastroenterology"

Though corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of these conditions, their efficacy has not been conclusively demonstrated and their use can induce various adverse reactions. Hence, the application of corticosteroids as therapeutic modalities for ALI/ARDS is limited. Meanwhile, the aporphine alkaloid oxocrebanine isolated from Stephania pierrei tubers has demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy in murine/human macrophage cell lines stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Accordingly, the primary objectives of the present study are to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of oxocrebanine on LPS-induced murine alveolar epithelial (MLE-12) cells and its efficacy against LPS-induced murine ALI. Results show that oxocrebanine downregulates the abundance of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, protein kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta signalling proteins in LPS-induced MLE-12 cells. Moreover, in a murine ALI model, oxocrebanine lowers lung injury scores and lung wet/dry weight ratios while reducing inflammatory cell infiltration. It also suppresses LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma. Moreover, oxocrebanine downregulates NF-κB, SAPK/JNK, p38, and Akt phosphorylation in the lung tissues of LPS-treated mice. Taken together, the foregoing results show that oxocrebanine provides significant protection against LPS-induced ALI in mice primarily by suppressing various inflammatory signalling pathways in alveolar epithelial cells and lung tissues. Hence, oxocrebanine might prove effective as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of lung inflammation.","Immunology, pharmacology, medical","Immunology, Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical)"

RPV non-users (N = 760) were asked to rate their RPV knowledge, attitudes, perceived behavioral controls (PBCs), norms, and innovativeness. They then read scenarios describing the current RPV installation cost and payback rate. They rated their adoption intention and specified their intended system capacity, affordable installation cost, and desirable payback period. The gaps between the actual and desired installation costs and the internal rate of return were calculated. These economic expectation gaps, attitudes based on financial benefits, PBC based on perceived financial barriers, social norms, and innovativeness significantly predicted the adoption intention. On the other hand, perceived knowledge, attitudes based on environmental and image benefits, and PBC based on anticipated troubles and inconveniences failed to predict intention. The implications of the TPB model for RPV adoption were discussed.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The future power flows in the distribution system are assumed by overlaying the hourly profiles of the traditional area load and DERs. Although the future DER profiles are made from historical data, the data of some DERs are quite small because they are not metered individually besides the low penetration. As a result, the coincidence factor (CF) of the future profiles becomes too high because the profiles strongly re-flect the specific data. In our previous work, we developed a method to generate DER profiles by generative adversarial network and showed that the forecasted profiles had proper CF.

However, how DnaJ, an HSP family member, in Penaeus vannamei responds to viral invasion has not been reported. In this research, the novel DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 16-like, or DnaJC16, was characterized in P. vannamei. It contains the DnaJ and thioredoxin domains. Phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated the conservation of DnaJC16 among penaeid shrimp, where PvDnaJC16 was found to be closely related to DnaJC16 from Fenneropenaeus chinensis and Marsupenaeus japonicus. The transcripts of PvDnaJC16 were expressed in all the tissues tested, and the highest expression was in the lymphoid organs. As hemocytes are major immune tissue, we found significant upregulation of PvDnaJC16 in shrimp hemocytes after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Furthermore, the suppression of PvDnaJC16 expression by RNA interference in WSSV-infected shrimp showed a decrease in replication and WSSV copy number. Interestingly, a dramatically high cumulative survival rate following the WSSV challenge (over 60%) was observed in PvDnaJC16-silenced shrimp. Meanwhile, the total hemocyte number was significantly increased in PvDnaJC16 knockdown. In addition, the expression of caspase-3 was reduced, as was the caspase-3/7 activity in PvDnaJC16 silencing. Additionally, the percentage of late apoptotic hemocytes diminished after PvDnaJC16 reduction, whereas the percentage of hemocyte viability increased. Our data reflect the fact that the upregulation of PvDnaJC16 expression upon WSSV infection enhances hemocyte apoptosis, which can accelerate viral spreading in shrimp.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

It has been reported that all humans generate unique VOC profiles in their exhaled breath which can be utilized as biomarkers to diagnose disease conditions. The VOCs available in exhaled human breath are the products of metabolic activity in the body and, therefore, any changes in its control level can be utilized to diagnose specific diseases. More than 1000 VOCs have been identified in exhaled human breath along with the respiratory droplets which provide rich information on overall health conditions. This provides great potential as a biomarker for a disease that can be sampled non-invasively from exhaled breath with breath biopsy. However, it is still a great challenge to develop a quick responsive, highly selective, and sensitive VOC-sensing system. The VOC sensors are usually coated with various sensing materials to achieve target-specific detection and real-time monitoring of the VOC molecules in the exhaled breath. These VOC-sensing materials have been the subject of huge interest and extensive research has been done in developing various sensing tools based on electrochemical, chemoresistive, and optical methods. The target-sensitive material with excellent sensing performance and capturing of the VOC molecules can be achieved by optimizing the materials, methods, and its thickness. This review paper extensively provides a detailed literature survey on various non-biological VOC-sensing materials including metal oxides, polymers, composites, and other novel materials. Furthermore, this review provides the associated limitations of each material and a summary table comparing the performance of various sensing materials to give a better insight to the readers.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, biochemistryistry, engineering, physics","Analytical Chemistry, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Instrumentation, Engineering (miscellaneous), Clinical Biochemistry"

Ungeremine also exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (IC50 3.57 μM), which was comparable to galanthamine (IC50 3.11 μM). The molecular docking studies were performed and were well in agreement with the experimental results.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Plant Science, Horticulture"
Gut microbiota-associated metabolites and risk of ischemic stroke in REGARDS,"Ament Z., Patki A., Bhave V.M., Chaudhary N.S., Garcia Guarniz A.-L., Kijpaisalratana N., Judd S.E., Cushman M., Long D.L., Irvin M.R., Kimberly W.T.",2023-07-01,"Biomarkers, Diet, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Incidence, Ischemic Stroke, Risk Factors, Stroke, Case-cohort, exploratory factor analysis, gut microbiome, ischemic stroke, metabolomics","Several metabolite markers are independently associated with incident ischemic stroke. However, prior studies have not accounted for intercorrelated metabolite networks. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if metabolite factors were associated with incident ischemic stroke. Metabolites (n = 162) were measured in a case-control cohort nested in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, which included 1,075 ischemic stroke cases and 968 random cohort participants. Cox models were adjusted for age, gender, race, and age-race interaction (base model) and further adjusted for the Framingham stroke risk factors (fully adjusted model). EFA identified fifteen metabolite factors, each representing a well-defined metabolic pathway. Of these, factor 3, a gut microbiome metabolism factor, was associated with an increased risk of stroke in the base (hazard ratio per one-unit standard deviation, HR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.15–1.31; P = 1.98 × 10−10) and fully adjusted models (HR = 1.13; 95%CI = 1.06–1.21; P = 4.49 × 10−4). The highest tertile had a 45% increased risk relative to the lowest (HR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.25–1.70; P = 2.24 × 10−6). Factor 3 was also associated with the Southern diet pattern, a dietary pattern previously linked to increased stroke risk in REGARDS (β = 0.11; 95%CI = 0.03–0.18; P = 8.75 × 10−3). These findings highlight the role of diet and gut microbial metabolism in relation to incident ischemic stroke.","neuroscience, medical","Neurology, Neurology (clinical), Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"
Emergent technological variation in archaeological landscapes: A primate perspective,"Reeves J.S., Proffitt T., Malaivijitnond S., Luncz L.V.",2023-06-21,"Cognitive traits, Environmental factors, Functional activities, Hominins, Long-tailed macaque, Percussive technology, Plio-pleistocene, Primate archeology, Specific tool, Time-averaged, Animals, Archaeology, Feeding Behavior, Hominidae, Primates, Tool Use Behavior, long-tailed macaques, percussive technology, primate archaeology","Archaeological evidence informs our understanding of the evolution of hominin behaviour. Such evidence is traditionally used to reconstruct hominin activities and intentions. In the Plio-Pleistocene, the presence or absence of specific tools and variation in artefact density is often used to infer foraging strategies, cognitive traits and functional activities. However, the Plio-Pleistocene archaeological record is known to be time-averaged and forms through the aggregation of repeated behavioural events over time. Thus, archaeological patterns do not reflect discrete episodes of activity, but rather the interaction of behaviour with environmental factors over time. However, little is known about how such interactions produce archaeological variation diversity. Primate archaeology can help address this research gap by providing the opportunity to observe how behaviour produces material patterns in a natural setting. This study, thus, examines how varying the material properties of stone and resource availability influence the artefactual signature of nut-cracking in a population of long-tailed macaques from Lobi Bay, Yao Noi island, Thailand. Results show that these interactions can produce a structured and diverse material signature in terms of artefact density and frequency of specific artefact types. These findings demonstrate how material patterns can emerge from long-term interactions between behaviour and environmental factors.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Biotechnology, Biophysics, Bioengineering, Biomaterials, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering"
Micronutrient use in critical care: Survey of clinical practice,"Cameron L.K., Lumlertgul N., Bear D.E., Cooney E., McKenzie C., Ostermann M.",2023-06-01,"Critical Care, Humans, Micronutrients, Refeeding Syndrome, Trace Elements, Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Vitamins, Critical care, Critical illness, ICU, Micronutrients, Trace elements, Vitamins","Background & Aims: Micronutrients, principally vitamins and minerals, play an important role both in health and in disease. Parenteral micronutrient products are commonly prescribed for critically ill patients both in line with the terms of the product's license, and for other indications where there is an underpinning physiological rationale, or precedent, for their use but little evidence. This survey sought to understand United Kingdom (UK) prescribing practice in this area. Methods: A 12-question survey was circulated to healthcare professionals working in UK critical care units. The survey was designed to explore several aspects of micronutrient prescribing or recommendation practice by the critical care multidisciplinary team, including indications and underpinning clinical rationale for using these products, dosing, and considerations with respect to micronutrients delivered as part of nutrition. Results were analysed, exploring indications, considerations relating to diagnoses, therapies including renal replacement therapies, and method of nutrition. Results: 217 responses were included in the analysis, with 58% from physicians and the remaining 42% from nurses, pharmacists, dietitians and other healthcare disciplines. Vitamins were most commonly prescribed or recommended for Wernicke's encephalopathy (prescribed or recommended by 76% of respondents), treatment of refeeding syndrome (64.5%), and for patients with unknown or uncertain alcohol intake history (63.6%). These clinically suspected or confirmed indications were cited more frequently as a reason to prescribe than laboratory identified deficiency states. 20% of respondents indicated that they would prescribe or recommend parenteral vitamins for patients requiring renal replacement therapy. The practice of vitamin C prescribing was heterogeneous, including dose and indication. Trace elements were prescribed or recommended less often than vitamins, with the most frequently reported indications being for patients requiring parenteral nutrition (42.9%), biochemically confirmed deficiency states (35.9%), and for treatment of refeeding syndrome (26.3%). Conclusions: Micronutrient prescribing in ICUs in the UK is heterogeneous, with clinical scenarios where there is an evidence base or an established precedent for their use often guiding decisions to use micronutrient products. Further work to examine the potential benefits and harms on patient-oriented outcomes of micronutrient product administration should be undertaken, to facilitate their judicious and cost-effective use, with a focus on areas where they have a theoretical benefit.","medical, Nursing","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Methods: This was a patient- and outcome assessor–blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients presenting with active bleeding from an upper or lower GI lesion suspected to be malignant at index endoscopy between June 2019 and January 2022 were randomly allocated to receive either TC-325 alone or standard endoscopic treatment (SET). The primary outcome was 30-day rebleeding, and secondary objectives included immediate hemostasis and other clinically relevant endpoints. Results: Overall, 106 patients made up the study population (55 TC-325 and 51 SET, after 1 exclusion in the TC-325 group and 5 in the SET group). Baseline characteristics and endoscopic findings did not differ between the groups. Thirty-day rebleeding was significantly lower in the TC-325 (2.1% TC-325 vs 21.3% SET; odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01–0.80; P =.003). Immediate hemostasis rates were 100% in the TC-325 group vs 68.6% in the SET group (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.93–2.29; P <.001). Other secondary outcomes did not differ between the 2 groups. Independent predictors of 6-month survival included the Charlson comorbidity index (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05–1.32; P =.007) and receiving an additional nonendoscopic hemostatic or oncologic treatment during 30 days after the index endoscopy (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06–0.43; P <.001) after adjustment for functional status, Glasgow-Blatchford score, and an upper GI source of bleeding.

We investigated the incidence and factors associated with high FBG among people living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region, using a World Health Organization BMI classification specific to Asian populations. Methods: This study included people living with HIV enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study from 2003 to 2019, receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and without prior tuberculosis. BMI at ART initiation was categorized using Asian BMI classifications: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal (18.5–22.9 kg/m2), overweight (23–24.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥25 kg/m2). High FBG was defined as a single post-ART FBG measurement ≥126 mg/dL. Factors associated with high FBG were analyzed using Cox regression models stratified by site. Results: A total of 3939 people living with HIV (63% male) were included. In total, 50% had a BMI in the normal weight range, 23% were underweight, 13% were overweight, and 14% were obese. Median age at ART initiation was 34 years (interquartile range 29–41). Overall, 8% had a high FBG, with an incidence rate of 1.14 per 100 person-years. Factors associated with an increased hazard of high FBG included being obese (≥25 kg/m2) compared with normal weight (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–2.44; p < 0.001) and older age compared with those aged ≤30 years (31–40 years: HR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.08–2.01; 41–50 years: HR = 2.03; 95% CI 1.42–2.90; ≥51 years: HR = 3.19; 95% CI 2.17–4.69; p < 0.001). Conclusion: People living with HIV with BMI >25 kg/m2 were at increased risk of high FBG.

Methods and results: A cross-sectional study was conducted among sixty Thai preschool children with cerebral palsy, aged 3–6 years old. Caries experience was determined by identifying decayednon-cavitated and cavitated lesion, missing, and filled surfaces of deciduous teeth(dmfs). Sociodemographic data, CP motor types, dietary habits, oral health behaviors and dental plaque index were collected. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to identify the strength of the association between factors and dental caries experience. The prevalence of dental caries was 91.66%. The average dmfs was 20.30 ± 21.63 surfaces/individual. The multiple linear regression indicated that dmfs was significantly associated with snacking carbohydrate between meals more than two times/day (β ± SE = 0.372 ± 0.125; p = 0.004), spastic type of cerebral palsy (β ± SE = 0.309 ± 0.124; p = 0.015) and one-time daily tooth brushing (β ± SE = 0.306 ± 0.124; p = 0.017). Conclusions: Nine out of 10 preschool children with CP experienced dental caries. Spastic type of CP had more risk to develop dental decay. Caries prevention for preschool children with CP should emphasis on controlling the frequency of carbohydrate snack no more than two times/day and reinforcing tooth brushing at least twice daily.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

The conditions used to extract lignin from PKS was investigated by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The extracted lignin was then utilized as a substitute for phenol in the synthesis of phenol formaldehyde (PF) adhesive, with the aim of producing particleboard from a bio-based adhesive. The statistical results suggest that the highest crude lignin extraction was obtained when treating PKS under alkali condition at 155 °C for 214 min. The extracted lignin was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, TG-DTA, and UV-Spectroscopy to assure the appearance of lignin. The so-produced lignin was then used as a phenol replacement in the formulation of an adhesive. It was found that bonding strength, via ASTM D5868-01, was improved with the addition of extract lignin from PKS, especially in the formulation of 100% substitution yielding the highest lap shear strength of 3.02 MPa. This adhesive was then applied in the manufacture of particleboards based on OPMF. The results suggest that partial substitution of phenol by lignin at 25% in the formation of particleboards had a modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and thickness swelling comparable to PF adhesive.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, coastal engineering","Biomaterials, Chemical Engineering (all), Polymers and Plastics"

This study aims to contribute to the debate on multi-criteria sustainability assessments by applying the SAFA to a test case of an agricultural supply chain, including production, processing, distribution, and marketing. The study case of the maize monoculture value chain in the Mae Chaem District of Chiang Mai Province was selected as a typical highland maize monoculture in northern Thailand. The study area is the site of a rapidly expanding peasant farmer boom of maize production and global livestock feed industry. This qualitative research employs in-depth interviews and questionnaires of all participants along the value chain of the study area. Multiple social sustainability dimensions including decent livelihood, fair trading practices, labor rights, equity, human safety and health, and cultural diversity were assessed using the SAFA tool. The analysis results were moderately favorable in terms of social sustainability, which to a notable extent contrasts with sustainability issues surrounding maize monoculture in Northern Thailand. In terms of the social sustainability dimensions of fair trading practices and of decent livelihood, the results suggest that the contract farming system usually employed in the highland maize monoculture in northern Thailand is unsustainable.

We assessed this impact of increased resolution on a clinical photon counting detector CT (PCD-CT) by comparing its detectability in high resolution and standard resolution (with 2x2 binning and larger focal spot) modes. A 50mμ-thin metal wire was placed in a thorax phantom and scanned in both modes at three exposure levels (12, 15, and 18 mAs); acquired data were reconstructed with three reconstruction kernels (Br40, Br68, and Br76, from smooth to sharp). A scanning nonprewhitening model observer searched for the wire location within each slice independently. Detection performance was quantified as area under the exponential transform of the free response ROC curve. The high-resolution mode had the mean AUCs at 18 mAs of 0.45, 0.49, and 0.65 for Br40, Br68, and Br76, respectively, which were 2 times, 3.6 times, and 4.6 times those of the standard resolution mode. The high-resolution mode achieved greater AUC at 12 mAs than the standard resolution mode at 18 mAs for every reconstruction kernel, but improvements were larger at sharper kernels. The results are consistent with the greater suppression of noise aliasing expected at higher frequencies with high resolution CT. This work illustrates that PCD-CT can provide large dose efficiency gains for detection tasks of small, high contrast lesions.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, medical","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Biomaterials, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

The numerical results obtained from the previously published scientific paper have been used as the training dataset for machine learning models. The potential of machine learning models is examined via traditional statistical indices. Furthermore, the forecast ability and reliability of the established models are also assessed through ranking criteria and validated with external data. As shown in the obtained results, MARS demonstrates its excellent veracity in predicting the uplift resistance of circular anchors in anisotropic and heterogeneous clays. Based on the optimal MARS model, the sensitivity analysis is implemented to detect the impact of each dimensionless input parameter on the uplift resistance.

Methods: CBCT exposures of an adult phantom were simulated using PCXMC 2.0 (STUK, Finland). Fifty-seven fields of view (FOV) were included, ranging from Ø4x4cm to Ø21x19cm. Six tube voltages (70 kV to 120 kV), eight combinations of Al (2.5 to 10 mm) and Cu (0 to 0.5 mm) filtration, and four source-isocentre distances (35 to 65 cm) were used, resulting in 10 896 simulated scan protocols. In addition, 10 944 random combinations of scan parameters within the aforementioned ranges were simulated, resulting in 21 840 scan protocols that were used for fitting a formula using multiple linear regression with 8 independent variables. Finally, 2304 random scan protocols were simulated as validation data to evaluate the formula's generalizability. Results: E/DAP ranged between 0.031 µSv/mGy.cm2 and 0.294 µSv/mGy.cm2, with a mean of 0.150 µSv/mGy.cm2. Due to extensive clustering of the E/DAP, three formulas were determined according to FOV categories (Small: <100 cm2, Medium: 100–400 cm2, Large: >400 cm2). The resulting formulas showed mean absolute errors of 7.9%, 4.0% and 3.6%, respectively, for the validation data. Conclusion: The new formulas allow for a straightforward, yet accurate, estimation of the effective dose for dental CBCT based on DAP. Further fine-tuning of the model could be achieved by incorporating, for example, bowtie filtration and off-axis beam geometries.","biochemistryistry, medical, physics","Biophysics, Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Physics and Astronomy (all)"

Unfortunately, the treatment of PAE remains challenging due to limited effective topical treatments. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical oxymetazoline hydrochloride (OxH) 0.05% solution for PAE. This study was a split-face, participants-and investigators-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted between December 2021 and March 2022 in Bangkok, Thailand. Healthy adults aged from 18 to 45 years with mild to severe PAE, according to the Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA), on both sides of the face were eligible. After randomization, each participant applied the OxH to one side of their face and a placebo to the contralateral face twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was PAE lesion counts. The secondary outcomes were erythema index, clinical response rate at week 12 (“clear,” “almost clear,” or “at least two-grade improvement” by CEA), and patient satisfaction scores. A total of 30 participants were enrolled. The OxH-treated skin showed a significantly greater mean difference (MD) reduction in PAE lesion counts than the placebo after 8 weeks of treatment (4.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42–7.18). Similarly, the MD reduction of the erythema index was higher in the OxH-treated skin from the second week (11.82, 95% CI 8.48–15.15). Additionally, the OxH-treated side also achieved a higher clinical response rate after 8 weeks of treatment (40.00% vs. 6.67%; p = 0.002) and rated higher satisfaction than those using the placebo at the end of the study (mean [standard deviation] satisfaction score 8.30 [0.18] vs 7.40 [0.18], P < 0.001). There were no serious adverse events or flares of erythema during the study. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the topical OxH 0.05% solution was effective, well-tolerated, and safe for reducing PAE without a rebound effect. It could be a choice of PAE management.

This simple and low-cost technique enabled us to quantify different sizes (i.e., 100, 300, 600, and 800 nm) of polystyrene nanospheres (PS NSs) in various aqueous media. The SERS substrate was simply prepared by sputtering gold particles to cover on a glass cover slide. By dissolving PS NSs in toluene and preconcentrating by coffee-ring effect, SERS measurement can quantify NPLs at a very low concentration with a limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 0.10–0.26 μg/mL. The experiment was also conducted in the presence of interferences, including salts, sugars, amino acids, and detergents. The method was validated for quantitative analysis using a mixture of 100-, 300-, 600-, and 800-nm PS NSs in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 in real-world media (i.e., tap water, mineral water, and river water), which successfully approaches the evaluation of PS NSs in the range of 10–40 µg/mL with an LOD of approximately 0.32–0.52 µg/mL.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

However, there remains little consensus in the literature regarding its efficacy in children and adolescents with special educational needs (SEN). This study aimed to examine HIIT as a means of improving key health and fitness parameters in children and adolescents with SEN. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on eight databases (MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library). Studies were eligible if they 1) included an HIIT protocol, 2) examined parameters related to both physical and mental aspects of health and fitness, and 3) examined children and adolescents with SEN aged 5–17 years. Results: Of the 1727 studies yielded by the database search, 13 (453 participants) were included and reviewed. We found that HIIT generally improved body composition, physical fitness, and cardiometabolic risk biomarkers across a spectrum of SEN (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, developmental coordination disorder, and mental illness). Improvements in mental health and cognitive performance following HIIT have also been observed. Conclusion: This review provides up-to-date evidence for HIIT as a viable exercise strategy for children and adolescents with SEN. Further research investigating the benefits of HIIT in a wider range of SEN populations is warranted.

The utilization of WH as a feedstock for biofuel production is a challenging solution to overcome the environmental problem as well as address the energy shortage. Due to the complex structure of lignocellulosic materials, pretreatment is an inevitable step to maximize the sugar yield before being used as a substrate in fermentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the utilization of WH for biobutanol production via acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026. The WH was pretreated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at various concentrations [0, 2, and 4% (w/v)], reaction times (30, 60, and 90 min), and temperatures (80, 100, and 120 °C). The pretreatment results were optimized using response surface methodology with a Box-Behnken design and Minitab software analysis. The maximum total sugar concentration (21.05 g/L) following cellulose digestion was obtained after a 2% (w/v) NaOH for 90 min at 100 °C. This hydrolysate slurry gave a subsequent butanol concentration, yield, and productivity of 2.09 g/L, 0.15 g/g, and 0.012 g/L/h, respectively, following C. beijerinckii JCM 8026 fermentation. To help understand the effect of the pretreatments, changes in the pretreated samples were observed by surface area analyses, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, energy, environmental","Forestry, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Waste Management and Disposal"

There is discussion around the optimal construction materials and designs for artificial reefs, the influences these have on biological communities, and the resulting ecological and social benefits. This discussion also includes the ecological value of repurposed marine infrastructure, such as decommissioned oil and gas platforms. Platforms often have an operational life spanning multiple decades, over which time they can develop extensive and unique community assemblages. The creation of artificial reefs by repurposing oil and gas platforms can have ecological, economic and sociological merit. However, with >12,000 platforms requiring decommissioning globally, there is the need for holistic assessment of biological communities associated with these platforms to inform the potential outcomes of different decommissioning options. We use environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) of water, bio-foul and sediment samples to census broad eukaryotic diversity at eight platforms in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) and five nearby soft sediment habitat locations. We sampled three target depths at sites (shallow, mid, deep) and detected 430 taxa at platforms, with higher diversity in shallow (near-surface) samples (313 taxa), compared to mid (30 m collection depth; 261 taxa) and deep (50 m; 273 taxa). Three percent of taxa were shared among all depths at platforms with distinct assembles at each depth. Introduced species are an ongoing risk for platforms, however the eDNA detected no known introduced species. While the eDNA data provide broad taxon coverage and significant assemblage patterns, ongoing sampling innovation, assay design and local reference material still require development to obtain the maximum benefit of the technique. This study highlights the versatility and scalability of eDNA metabarcoding to holistically census marine infrastructure and inform the management and potential conservation of extant communities.","petroleum engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

Pooled prevalence of ocular complications was derived from generalized linear mixed models (PROSPERO CRD42022326610). Results. A total of 70 and 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis for OC and concordant CE (chorioretinitis with vitreous involvement), respectively. This study represented 8599 patients with candidemia who underwent ophthalmologic examination. Pooled prevalences (95% CI) of OC, overall CE, concordant CE, and discordant CE were 10.7% (8.4–13.5%), 3.1% (2.1–4.5%), 1.8% (1.3–2.6%), and 7.4% (4.5–12%) of patients screened, respectively.

In this work, we investigated the OER /ORR electrocatalytic activity of all CuOOH series (C2/m, Cmc21 and Pmn21) and proposed an improvement scheme for catalytic activity using the DFT method. The results showed that pure CuOOH matrixes with large OER/ORR overpotentials (ηOER/ORR) were inert toward OER/ORR. Therefore, eleven metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, W, and Ir) were used to activate the CuOOH substrates. It is found that the OER/ORR performances of all CuOOH series can be significantly improved by Co or Rh doping. Especially for 2D-layered C2/m-CuOOH substrate, the ηOER/ORR was reduced from 1.26 V/2.01 V to 0.25 V/0.22 V and 0.36 V/0.46 V by Co and Rh embedding, respectively, which mainly owes to the regulation from the moderate d-orbital electrons of doped Co and Rh. This work systematically revealed the OER/ORR performance of the CuOOH series, which will promote the development of new catalysts and help us to deeply understand and improve the OER/ORR performance of previous copper oxide electrocatalysts.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Process Chemistry and Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Pullulan (PUL) biopolymer was used as the reductant of excess AgNO3, at moderate heating, so that stable and dispersed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs or Ag0) were formed, which also contained an unreduced silver ion (Ag+), all intertwined in the pullulan polymeric matrix. Extensive characterization confirmed the role of PUL as a capping agent, while sharp Ag0 and Ag+ peaks were validated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ag0-PUL-Ag+ probe showed a sharp absorption maximum at 415 nm, having a majority size distribution around 20–30 nm, from TEM. The addition of Ag0-PUL-Ag+, acetate buffer pH 5.0, and Fe2+ under room temperature incubation led to Fe2+ reduction of available Ag+ to more AgNPs, based on redox reaction, with color progression from light yellow to yellow, orange, and brownish yellow. The ΔA@411 plotted against Fe2+ concentration was linear within 1.0–20.0 and 20.0–125.0 μM, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.15 μM. The assay was selective to only Fe2+ over other metal ions and was applied to Fe2+ detection in tap water and in ferrous fumarate tablets with satisfactory accuracy/precision. Our work showed that with careful control of nanomaterial synthesis conditions, a sensitive detection probe could be obtained for impressive analyte sensing/detection.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science","Catalysis, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Polymers and Plastics, Colloid and Surface Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, during January 1, 2012—December 31, 2021. The inclusion criteria were Thai women diagnosed with uterovaginal prolapse and undergone vaginal hysterectomy, with or without anterior colporrhaphy, with or without posterior colpoperineorrhaphy, with SSLF and had the complete pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) information at the 12 months follow up. The recurrent case was defined as any compartment prolapse ≥ stage II by POP-Q classification at 1, 3, 6, 12 months follow up. Results: Of 71 cases included, 20 cases had recurrent prolapse at 12 months. The incidences of non-recurrent prolapse rate at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 70/71 (98.59%), 65/70 (92.86%), 58/65 (89.23%), and 51/58 (87.93%).

Augmented effect of fibroblast growth factor 18 in bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced calvarial bone healing by activation of CCL2/CCR2 axis on M2 macrophage polarization,"Namangkalakul W., Nagai S., Jin C., Nakahama K.-I., Yoshimoto Y., Ueha S., Akiyoshi K., Matsushima K., Nakashima T., Takechi M., Iseki S.",2023-01-01,"Bone healing, Bone morphogenetic protein-2, Calvaria, Calvarial bones, Calvarial defects, Chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2, Chemokines, Fibroblast growth factor, Fibroblast growth factor 18, M2 macrophage, Bone healing, calvarium, chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2, fibroblast growth factor 18, M2 macrophage","Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling plays essential roles in various biological events. FGF18 is one of the ligands to be associated with osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and bone healing. The mouse critical-sized calvarial defect healing induced by the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-hydrogel is stabilized when FGF18 is added. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of FGF18 in the calvarial bone healing model. We first found that FGF18 + BMP2 hydrogel application to the calvarial bone defect increased the expression of anti-inflammatory markers, including those related to tissue healing M2 macrophage (M2-Mø) prior to mineralized bone formation. The depletion of macrophages with clodronate liposome hindered the FGF18 effect. We then examined how FGF18 induces M2-Mø polarization by using mouse primary bone marrow (BM) cells composed of macrophage precursors and BM stromal cells (BMSCs). In vitro studies demonstrated that FGF18 indirectly induces M2-Mø polarization by affecting BMSCs. Whole transcriptome analysis and neutralizing antibody treatment of BMSC cultured with FGF18 revealed that chemoattractant chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is the major mediator for M2-Mø polarization. Finally, FGF18-augmented activity toward favorable bone healing with BMP2 was diminished in the calvarial defect in Ccr2-deleted mice. Altogether, we suggest a novel role of FGF18 in M2-Mø modulation via stimulation of CCL2 production in calvarial bone healing.","fluidex; related topics, medical, Materials Science, engineering","Medicine (miscellaneous), Biomaterials, Biomedical Engineering"

Does this ability extend to auditory recognition? Vision and haptics tap into similar representations of shape and texture. In contrast, features of auditory perception like pitch, timbre, or loudness do not readily translate into shape percepts related to edges, surfaces, or spatial arrangement of parts. We find that an auditory object recognition ability correlates highly with a visual object recognition ability after controlling for general intelligence, perceptual speed, low-level visual ability, and memory ability. Auditory object recognition was a stronger predictor of visual object recognition than all control measures across two experiments, even though those control variables were also tested visually. These results point towards a single high-level ability used in both vision and audition. Much work highlights how the integration of visual and auditory information is important in specific domains (e.g., speech, music), with evidence for some overlap of visual and auditory neural representations. Our results are the first to reveal a domain-general ability, o, that predicts object recognition performance in both visual and auditory tests. Because o is domain-general, it reveals mechanisms that apply across a wide range of situations, independent of experience and knowledge. As o is distinct from general intelligence, it is well positioned to potentially add predictive validity when explaining individual differences in a variety of tasks, above and beyond measures of common cognitive abilities like general intelligence and working memory.","psychology, arts, sociology, neuroscience","Experimental and Cognitive Psychology, Language and Linguistics, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Linguistics and Language, Cognitive Neuroscience"

Specifically, it has been investigated as a replacement for toxic bisphenol A (BPA) in the production of polycarbonate (PC). In this study, the synthesis of isosorbide by sorbitol dehydration using a cerium-based catalyst derived from calcined cerium (IV) sulfate (300°C, 400°C, 450°C, 500°C, and 650°C) was investigated. The reaction occurred in a high-pressure reactor containing nitrogen gas. Advanced instrumental techniques were applied to analyze the characteristics of the calcined catalyst. The results showed that the calcined catalysts demonstrated different crystalline structures and sulfate species at different temperatures. However, the acidic properties (strength and amount) of the catalyst did not change with the calcination temperature. The cerium (IV) sulfate calcined at 400°C exhibited the best catalytic performance, achieving the highest isosorbide yield (55.7%) and complete conversion of sorbitol at 180°C, 20 bar of N2, and 6 h using CeSO-400. The presence of a sulfate group on the catalyst was the most important factor in determining the catalytic performance of sorbitol dehydration to isosorbide.

Common users cannot interpret the drawings quickly, understand their exact position within the building, and select appropriate evacuation routes. Thus, when fires occur, the construction project's fire can cause damages, and the number of dead or injured workers involved can be high. Nowadays, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Augmented Reality (AR) are used in construction projects to create construction in a three-dimensional (3-D) visualization. This study aims to create a prototype application that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Augmented Reality (AR) to improve the fire evacuation system and provide real-time access to information for evacuating from hazardous locations. A marker-based location system was implemented, using a marker as a spatial index to link the physical location and virtual information. The system was tested for accuracy using the proposed system and the MATALL Laser Distance Meter on the 4th floor of the Department of Civil Engineering Building at Chulalongkorn University. The results showed that the average percentage difference from the current location to the exit measured by the proposed system was lower than that measured by the MATALL Laser Distance meter, with an average percentage difference of less than 2.2%. Therefore, the proposed system effectively provides real-time access to information such as the current location, exit, distance of the shortest route from the current location to the destination, and virtual green line, voice, and arrow direction for evacuation guidance. It is convenient for decision-making and helps users find destinations quickly and efficiently.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

The soil behaviour for all analyses is governed by the anisotropic undrained shear (AUS) strength model, which requires three anisotropic undrained shear strengths that are simply evaluated from conventional laboratory tests. The upper and lower bound solutions of 3D face stability of circular tunnels are accurately analyzed by considering four dimensionless parameters, including the cover-to-depth ratio, the overburden stress factor, the strength gradient ratio, and the anisotropic strength ratio. The significance of four dimensionless parameters on the stability load factor of the 3D face stability of circular tunnels, and the predicted failure mechanisms due to the influence of cover depth ratios, are also illustrated. A nonlinear regression analysis is employed to the computed data, which enables a new design equation of the factor of safety incorporating the conventional stability number. Thus, the new tunnel stability factors are proposed for the first time in the literature. A comprehensive application of the proposed safety factor equation is also presented and compared. The 3D effects of the tunnel face configuration between 3D geometry and 2D plane strain heading on the tunnel stability factors are also discussed.

According to an abrupt change in the restoring force rate, the evolution of IS can be divided into four distinct regimes, i.e., (i) zero IS, (ii) accelerating IS, (iii) reversing IS and (iv) decelerating IS. In stage I, the wood moisture content (MC) is still above fiber saturation point (FSP) with no drying shrinkage. In stage II, the negative RF constantly accelerates. IS mainly develops due to drying shrinkage with the activation energy of 19 kJ/mol. In stage III, the negative RF sharply decelerates and later reverses to the positive value. This regime takes place as the dried zone moves inwards and ends when there is no wet zone left. The stress reversal phenomenon having the activation energy of 36 kJ/mol contains two negative maxima, which occur faster in mature wood than in juvenile wood. Possible creep relaxation due to shear deformation of hemicellulose/lignin matrix between the cellulose fibrils is discussed. Finally, the positive RF decelerates in stage IV with the RF rate gradually declining and remaining at zero up until the end of drying. The corresponding activation energy of stage IV is 52 kJ/mol for both juvenile and mature rubberwood.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

This study compared the detection rates of adenoma and other precursor lesions using LCI vs white-light imaging (WLI) during screening, diagnostic, and surveillance colonoscopies. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was performed at 11 institutions in 4 Asian countries/regions. Patients with abdominal symptoms, a primary screening colonoscopy, positive fecal immunochemical test results, or undergoing postpolypectomy surveillance were recruited and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the LCI or high-definition WLI group. The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR). Secondary outcomes were polyp detection rate, advanced ADR, sessile serrated lesion (SSL) detection rate, and the mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy. The recommended surveillance schedule distribution after trial colonoscopy was analyzed. Results: Between November 2020 and January 2022, there were 3050 participants (LCI, n = 1527; WLI, n = 1523) recruited. The LCI group ADR was significantly higher than the WLI group ADR using intention-to-treat (58.7% vs 46.7%; P <.01) and per-protocol analyses (59.6% vs 46.4%; P <.01). The LCI group polyp detection rates (68.6% vs 59.5%; P <.01), SSL detection rates (4.8% vs 2.8%; P <.01), and adenomas per colonoscopy (1.48 vs 1.02; P <.01) also were significantly higher. However, the advanced ADR was not significantly different (13.2% vs 11.0%; P =.06). Significantly more patients in the LCI group had shorter recommended surveillance schedules than the WLI group (P <.01). Conclusions: Compared with WLI, LCI improved adenoma and other polyp detection rates, including SSLs, resulting in alteration of the recommended surveillance schedule after screening, diagnostic, and postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopies.

Reconstructing the Anode Interface and Solvation Shell for Reversible Zinc Anodes,"Zhang D., Cao J., Chanajaree R., Yang C., Chen H., Zhang X., Qin J.",2023-03-08,"Dendrite-free, Ion batteries, L(+)-ascorbic acid, L-ascorbic acid sodium additive, Side reactions, Sodium additive, Uniform deposition, Zinc ions, Zinc-ion battery, Zn 2+, dendrite-free, LAA additive, side reactions, uniform deposition, zinc-ion battery","The attractive advantages of the Zn metal anode and water-based electrolyte, such as inherent safety and low cost, endow the zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with great potential in the future energy storage market. However, the severe surface side reactions and dendrites affect the service lifespan and electrochemical performance of ZIBs. Herein, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, l-ascorbic acid sodium (LAA), has been added into ZnSO4 (ZSO) electrolyte (ZSO + LAA) to settle the above issues of ZIBs. On the one hand, the LAA additive tends to adsorb on the Zn anode surface to generate a H2O-resistive passivation layer, which can effectively isolate the H2O corrosion and regulate the Zn2+ ion 3D diffusion, thus inducing a uniform deposition layer. On the other hand, the strong adsorption capacity between LAA and Zn2+ can transform the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ into [Zn(H2O)4LAA], thus reducing the coordinated H2O molecules and further suppressing side reactions. With this synergy effect, the Zn/Zn symmetric battery with the ZSO + LAA electrolyte can deliver a cycle life of 1200 h under 1 mA cm-2, and the Zn/Ti battery also presents an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.16% under 1 mA cm-2, greatly superior to the batteries with the ZSO electrolyte. Additionally, the effectiveness of the LAA additive can be further verified in the Zn/MnO2 full battery and pouch cell.","corrosion, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

An optimum point was obtained via central composite rotatable design at reaction temperature of 567.10 °C, catalyst loading of 3.22 wt%, and CaO loading of 1.25 wt%, with an expected bio-oil yield of 35.31 wt%. Validation runs’ experimental yield was 37.59 ± 1.74 wt%, indicating reliability of the condition. The impregnated catalyst was characterized, and CaO was observed to be successfully impregnated onto HZSM-5 with minor degradation on the catalyst structures. The bio-oil produced through catalytic pyrolysis had increased 16.102 wt% water content, and also lower acid content by 8.02%, and higher aromatic content by 18.86% as compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis, possibly contributed by the combined catalytic effect of CaO/HZSM-5 catalyst via deoxygenation and neutralization reactions. Kinetic study using Coats-Redfern method indicated the decrement of activation energy and frequency factor by 2.14% and 49.17%, respectively, at reaction order of three with addition of CaO/HZSM-5 catalyst. Similar reductions in activation energies in presence of CaO/HZSM-5 catalyst was observed in model-free methods, and the activation energies gradually increased with process conversion due to differences in valorization temperatures of hemicellulose (300 °C), cellulose (340 and 390 °C), and lignin (> 400 °C).","fluidex; related topics, energy, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Agronomy and Crop Science, Energy (miscellaneous)"

On a variety of substrates, the development of practical photocatalyst films has been attempted; however, the effect of the substrate on the charge transfer and catalytic activity has received less attention in the research. Herein, the effect of three different substrates including titanium (Ti), indium tin oxide coated on polyethylene terephthalate (ITO-PET), and PET on the charge transfer and activity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction of two noble-metal free catalysts were studied by density functional theory calculation (DFT), as well as optical and photo-electrochemical analyses. We showed that the transfer of charge carriers between the substrate and the overlying catalyst varies significantly between substrates and has a substantial effect on the photocatalytic activity in the CO2 reduction reaction. This work presents a practical and straightforward approach to enhancing the activity of the photocatalytic films for the CO2 reduction in the water vapor.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

The scheme not only enables the fast learning of swarm particles, but also computes the safe and optimal size distribution of structural members under applied forces and natural frequency conditions at modest computing resources.

Recent studies suggest that an accumulation of perivascular inflammatory cells may be involved with medial thickening which is a sign of the pulmonary artery remodelling in PH. The aim of this study was to characterise perivascular inflammatory cells in the surrounding pulmonary arteries of dogs with PH due to MMVD compared to MMVD dogs and healthy control dogs. Nineteen lung samples were collected from cadavers of small-breed dogs (control n = 5; MMVD n = 7; MMVD + PH n = 7). Toluidine blue stain and multiple IHC targeting α-SMA, vWF, CD20, CD68 and CD3 was performed to examine intimal and medial thickening, assess muscularisation of the small pulmonary arteries and characterise perivascular leucocytes. Medial thickening without intimal thickening of pulmonary arteries and muscularisation of normally non-muscularised small pulmonary arteries was observed in the MMVD and MMVD + PH groups compared with the control group. The perivascular numbers of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and macrophages was significantly increased in the MMVD + PH group compared with the MMVD and control groups. In contrast, the perivascular number of mast cells was significantly higher in the MMVD group compared with the MMVD + PH and control groups.

Our recent studies have shown that prenatal BPA exposure disrupted ASD-related gene expression in the hippocampus, neurological functions, and behaviors associated with ASD in a sex-specific pattern. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BPA are still unclear. Methods: Transcriptome data mining and molecular docking analyses were performed to identify ASD-related transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes underlying the sex-specific effects of prenatal BPA exposure. Gene ontology analysis was conducted to predict biological functions associated with these genes. The expression levels of ASD-related TFs and targets in the hippocampus of rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA were measured using qRT-PCR analysis. The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in BPA-mediated regulation of ASD candidate genes was investigated using a human neuronal cell line stably transfected with AR-expression or control plasmid. Synaptogenesis, which is a function associated with genes transcriptionally regulated by ASD-related TFs, was assessed using primary hippocampal neurons isolated from male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA. Results: We found that there was a sex difference in ASD-related TFs underlying the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the transcriptome profiles of the offspring hippocampus. In addition to the known BPA targets AR and ESR1, BPA could directly interact with novel targets (i.e., KDM5B, SMAD4, and TCF7L2). The targets of these TFs were also associated with ASD. Prenatal BPA exposure disrupted the expression of ASD-related TFs and targets in the offspring hippocampus in a sex-dependent manner. Moreover, AR was involved in the BPA-mediated dysregulation of AUTS2, KMT2C, and SMARCC2. Prenatal BPA exposure altered synaptogenesis by increasing synaptic protein levels in males but not in females, but the number of excitatory synapses was increased in female primary neurons only. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AR and other ASD-related TFs are involved in sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on transcriptome profiles and synaptogenesis in the offspring hippocampus. These TFs may play an essential role in an increased ASD susceptibility associated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals, particularly BPA, and the male bias of ASD.","sociology, biochemistryistry","Gender Studies, Endocrinology"

Methods: We equally assigned 24 lumbar disc levels from 6 cadavers into Flu and CT-based navigation (Nav) groups. Two surgeons performed disc space preparation using the ATP approach in both groups. Digital images of each vertebral endplate were obtained, and the remaining disc tissue was calculated in total and in quadrants. Operative time, number of attempts at disc removal, endplate violation area, number of endplate violation segments, and access angle were recorded. Results: The overall percentage of remaining disc tissue was significantly less in the Nav group than in the Flu group (32.7% vs. 43.3% respectively, P < 0.001). A significant difference was found in the posterior-ipsilateral (4.2% vs. 7.1%, P = 0.005) and posterior-contralateral (6.1% vs. 10.9%, P = 0.002) quadrants, respectively. No significant between-group difference was found concerning operative time, number of attempts at disc removal, endplate violation area, number of endplate violation segments, or access angle. Conclusions: Intraoperative CT-based navigation may improve vertebral endplate preparation quality for an ATP approach, especially in the posterior quadrants. This technique may offer an effective alternative disc space and endplate preparation methods and may help enhance the fusion rates.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

Cleistocalyx nervosum var. paniala (CN), an indigenous berry, has been reported to exhibit several health-beneficial properties. However, investigation of CN seeds is still limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of ethanolic seed extract (CNSE) and mechanisms in BV-2 mouse microglial cells using an inflammatory stimulus, TNF-α. Using LC-MS, ferulic acid, aurentiacin, brassitin, ellagic acid, and alpinetin were found in CNSE. Firstly, we examined molecular docking to elucidate its bioactive components on inflammation-related mechanisms. The results revealed that alpinetin, aurentiacin, and ellagic acid inhibited the NF-κB activation and iNOS function, while alpinetin and aurentiacin only suppressed the COX-2 function. Our cell-based investigation exhibited that cells pretreated with CNSE (5, 10, and 25 μg/mL) reduced the number of spindle cells, which was highly observed in TNF-α treatment (10 ng/mL). CNSE also obstructed TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA levels and repressed the TNF-α and IL-6 releases in a culture medium of BV-2 cells. Remarkably, CNSE decreased the phosphorylated forms of ERK, p38MAPK, p65, and IκB-α related to the inhibition of NF-κB binding activity. CNSE obviously induced HO-1 protein expression. Our findings suggest that CNSE offers good potential for preventing inflammatory-related NDDs.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Previous hashtag recommendations have been proposed based on the topic model approach. In spite of their improvement, two issues are still unresolved. First, prior studies inferred the topic distribution of users, words, and hashtags by using a non-neural network framework, making them unable to deal with the complex topic distribution of users, words, and hashtags. Second, previous work required word and hashtag frequency to process the topic distribution inference only, ignoring not only word ordering and word context but also the relation between word and hashtag. It is one of the crucial factors that affect hashtag recommendation since some words in the target microblog can indicate the relevant hashtags. In this paper, we propose a novel hashtag recommendation model called Hashtag-NTM to infer the topic distribution of users, words, and hashtags by using the neural network framework, making the model able to deal with the complexity of distribution. Moreover, we explore the relationship between words and hashtags to model word and hashtag representation before processing topic distribution inference, making the recommended hashtags more related to words in the target microblog. Extensive experiments on the Twitter dataset demonstrate that Hashtag-NTM consistently outperforms baseline methods over hit rate metrics.","computer scienceuter systems and equipment, fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Computer Science Applications, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Instrumentation"

Liver fibrosis significantly elevated liver function ALT, AST, and ALP, as well as anti-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) and VEGF. The oxidative stress parameters (MDA, SOD, and NO) were significantly increased with a marked reduction in GSH. Expression of MAPK and MCP-1 was unregulated in the TAA group, with downregulation of Nrf2 was observed. TAA caused histopathological alterations associated with hepatic vacuolation and fibrosis, increasing collagen fibers and high immuno-expression of VEGF.

Our device combined paper chromatography and an electrochemical sensor as a single system for increasing the selectivity to simultaneous detection of the two pesticides. During the simultaneous detection of CBF and CBR, the separation of the two carbamate compounds depends on the differences between the movements of the substances on the chromatographic paper in the moving phase flow. The isolated pesticides were electrochemically measured using an amperometric method. Under optimal conditions, which include the effect of the mobile phase, separation channel, and the applied potential, the proposed device provides a linear range for the simultaneous determination of CBF and CBR from 0.1 to 2.0 and 0.5–7.5 mg L−1, with the limits of detection at 0.06 and 0.40 mg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, we successfully used the developed device to determine CBF and CBR in water, cucumber, and cabbage samples. The obtained results correspond to results obtained from a standard method. This developed ePAD is low-cost and uses a low sample volume (2 µL). Moreover, it is disposable, portable, and a promising tool for the on-site quantification of pesticides in actual samples.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

Fecal samples and environmental parameters were collected from individuals of three social groups of wild Assamese macaques living at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Northeastern Thailand. Our study confirmed the methodological feasibility and biological validity of measuring IF-T3 in this population. Specifically, the biological validation demonstrated higher IF-T3 levels in immatures compared to adults, and higher levels in females during late gestation compared to the preconception stage. Our analysis of IF-T3 levels in developing immature macaques revealed a significant increase with age. Furthermore, we found a positive association between IF-T3 and immunoreactive fecal glucocorticoid levels, an indicator of the physiological stress response. Neither minimum temperature nor fruit abundance predicted variation in IF-T3 levels in the immatures. Our findings indicate the possibility for differing effects of climatic factors and food availability on thyroid hormone level changes in immature versus adult animals and in wild compared to experimental conditions. Overall, our study provides the basis for further investigations into the role of thyroid hormones in shaping species-specific traits, growth, and overall primate development.","geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Animal Science and Zoology"

In this study, we collected wastewater samples between November 2020 and February 2022 from twenty-three sites in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants for comparison to standard clinical sampling. A total of 215 wastewater samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time PCR with three targeted genes (N, E, and ORF1ab); 102 samples were positive (42.5%). The SARS-CoV-2 variants were determined by a multiplex PCR MassARRAY assay to distinguish four SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Multiple variants of Alpha–Delta and Delta–Omicron were detected in the wastewater samples in July 2021 and January 2022, respectively. These wastewater variant results mirrored the country data from clinical specimens deposited in GISAID. Our results demonstrated that wastewater surveillance using multiple signature mutation sites for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection is an appropriate strategy to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the community at a low cost and with rapid turn-around time. However, it is essential to note that sequencing surveillance of wastewater samples should be considered complementary to whole genome sequencing of clinical samples to detect novel variants.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Data Sources: A systematic search was performed through MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases from January 1, 1985 to April 15, 2021. Study Eligibility Criteria: Studies including asymptomatic singleton pregnant women at >18 weeks’ gestation with risk of developing preeclampsia were evaluated. We included only cohort or cross-sectional test accuracy studies reporting on preeclampsia outcome, allowing tabulation of 2×2 tables, with follow-up available for >85%, and evaluating performance of placental growth factor alone, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1– placental growth factor ratio, or placental growth factor-based models. The study protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register Of Systematic Reviews (CRD 42020162460). Methods: Because of considerable intra- and interstudy heterogeneity, we computed the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic plots and derived diagnostic odds ratios, β, θi, and Λ for each method to compare performances. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by the QUADAS-2 tool. Results: The search identified 2028 citations, from which we selected 474 studies for detailed assessment of the full texts. Finally, 100 published studies met the eligibility criteria for qualitative and 32 for quantitative syntheses. Twenty-three studies reported on performance of placental growth factor testing for the prediction of preeclampsia in the second trimester, including 16 (with 27 entries) that reported on placental growth factor test alone, 9 (with 19 entries) that reported on the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio, and 6 (16 entries) that reported on placental growth factor-based models. Fourteen studies reported on performance of placental growth factor testing for the prediction of preeclampsia in the third trimester, including 10 (with 18 entries) that reported on placental growth factor test alone, 8 (with 12 entries) that reported on soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio, and 7 (with 12 entries) that reported on placental growth factor-based models. For the second trimester, Placental growth factor-based models achieved the highest diagnostic odds ratio for the prediction of early preeclampsia in the total population compared with placental growth factor alone and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio (placental growth factor-based models, 63.20; 95% confidence interval, 37.62–106.16 vs soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio, 6.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.76–27.61 vs placental growth factor alone, 5.62; 95% confidence interval, 3.04–10.38); placental growth factor-based models had higher diagnostic odds ratio than placental growth factor alone for the identification of any-onset preeclampsia in the unselected population (28.45; 95% confidence interval, 13.52–59.85 vs 7.09; 95% confidence interval, 3.74–13.41). For the third trimester, Placental growth factor-based models achieved prediction for any-onset preeclampsia that was significantly better than that of placental growth factor alone but similar to that of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio (placental growth factor-based models, 27.12; 95% confidence interval, 21.67–33.94 vs placental growth factor alone, 10.31; 95% confidence interval, 7.41–14.35 vs soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio, 14.94; 95% confidence interval, 9.42–23.70). Conclusion: Placental growth factor with maternal factors ± other biomarkers determined in the second trimester achieved the best predictive performance for early preeclampsia in the total population. However, in the third trimester, placental growth factor-based models had predictive performance for any-onset preeclampsia that was better than that of placental growth factor alone but similar to that of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1–placental growth factor ratio. Through this meta-analysis, we have identified a large number of very heterogeneous studies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop standardized research using the same models that combine serum placental growth factor with maternal factors ± other biomarkers to accurately predict preeclampsia.

Here, we propose a low-temperature solution-precipitation process to prepare polymer-solid electrolyte composites for a highly uniform polymer distribution in the electrolyte to enhance their mechanical strength and reduce their electronic conduction. The composites with up to 12 wt % of polymer are prepared, and the composites exhibit high ionic conductivities of up to 0.3 mS/cm. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte composites on Li striping/plating cycles is investigated. We confirm that the proposed solution-precipitation process makes the composite much more stable than the bare solid electrolyte and causes them to outperform similar composites from the other existing preparation methods, such as mechanical mixing and solution dispersion.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)

AIM To identify the characteristics of GI manifestations of Long-COVID in patients with dialysis-dependent or KT status. METHODS This observational, prospective study included patients with COVID-19 infection, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, with the onset of symptoms between 1 January 2022 and 31 July 2022 which was explored at 3 mo after the onset, either through the out-patient follow-up or by telephone interviews. RESULTS The 645 eligible participants consisted of 588 cases with hemodialysis (HD), 38 patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 19 KT recipients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection during the observation. Of these, 577 (89.5%) cases agreed to the interviews, while 64 (10.9%) patients with HD and 4 (10.5%) cases of PD were excluded. The mean age was 52 ± 11 years with 52% women. The median dialysis duration was 7 ± 3 and 5 ± 1 years for HD and PD groups, respectively, and the median time post-transplantation was 6 ± 2 years. Long-COVID was identified in 293/524 (56%) and 21/34 (62%) in HD and PD, respectively, and 7/19 (37%) KT recipients. Fatigue was the most prevalent (96%) of the non-GI tract symptoms, whereas anorexia (90.9%), loss of taste (64.4%), and abdominal pain (62.5%) were the first three common GI manifestations of Long-COVID. Notably, there were 6 cases of mesenteric panniculitis from 19 patients with GI symptoms in the KT group. CONCLUSION Different from patients with non-chronic kidney disease, there was a high prevalence of GI manifestations of Long-COVID in dialysis-dependent patients and KT recipients. An appropriate long-term follow-up in these vulnerable populations after COVID-19 infection is possibly necessary.",medical,Gastroenterology

This work investigates the optimal conditions for preparing magnetic BEA-type zeolites using the DGC method, including the gel/water ratio, crystallization temperature and time. Precursor dry-gel incorporating well-dispersed magnetite was subjected to crystallization under water vapor atmosphere with a gel/water ratio of 0.5–2, crystallization temperature of 140–200 °C for 1.5–12 h, followed by characterization using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The optimum conditions were found to be gel/water ratio of 1 and crystallization at 180 °C for 12 h. Magnetic properties of collected samples were evaluated using a vibrating-sample magnetometer after calcination at 400–500 °C for 12 h. Products calcined below 450 °C showed good magnetic properties. Adsorption of sulfadiazine using the BEA and magnetic BEA-type zeolites was evaluated in a 10–50 mg/l range. Results revealed favorable multilayer-type adsorption of sulfadiazine onto both non-magnetic and magnetic BEA-type zeolites (Freundlich model). These indicate that DGC method is suitable for preparing high-silica magnetic BEA-type zeolites with potential for antibiotic removal.

At the same time, the photocatalytic degradation performance of the fabricated materials was analyzed by the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light. Of all prepared WS2/BiYWO6 composites, the 20 wt.% WS2 loaded WS2/BiYWO6 composite exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability than other prepared photocatalysts. Here, O2·− and ·OH radicals are performing a pivotal role in the Rhodamine B degradation and the optimized composite shows greater photocurrent intensity than pure BiYWO6 and WS2, respectively. Also, the synthesized photocatalyst maintains its stability with negligible changes even after three cycles. Thereby, the constructed S-scheme WS2/BiYWO6 heterojunction is a potential material for the wastewater remediation.

However, the effectiveness of online teaching in non-lecture physiology topics during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been thoroughly investigated. Method: We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the students’ academic achievement and opinions on online teaching during the COVID-19 academic year. Academic achievement of 312 students in the COVID-19 year was compared with that of 299 students in the pre-COVID-19 year. Student opinions regarding social interactions and the preferred learning method were also collected. Results: We found that student academic achievement in the non-lecture physiology topics, assessed by summative scores, was 4.80±0.92 percent higher in the pre-COVID-19 year than in the COVID-19 year (P < 0.01, Cohen’s d = 0.42). Students rated that online classes tended to reduce their interactions with peers and teachers; however, students preferred online learning over traditional on-site learning. Conclusions: This study pointed out that students’ academic performance related to the physiology topics taught by online non-lecture methods during the COVID-19 pandemic was lower than their performance when the topics were taught by the traditional (on-site) methods, although students reported that they preferred the online teaching. Hence, we suggest that medical teachers should deliberately plan and utilise a variety of tools and techniques when developing online non-lecture classes to preserve the interactivity of the classes, which might overcome this gap in students’ academic performance.",sociology,Education

Currently, cannabis extracts are used in medicine, but the amount of THC as a main psychoactive component is strictly regulated. Therefore, the ability to rapidly and accurately detect THC is important. Herein, we developed a sensitive electrochemical method combining a rapid lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect THC rapidly. An electrochemical LFA device was constructed by attaching a screen-printed electrode inside a lateral-flow device to exploit the remarkable binding of THC to the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor in the test zone. The ferrocene carboxylic acid attached to the monoclonal THC antibody acts as an electroactive species when it binds to the THC in the sample before it flows continuously to the CB2 receptor region on the electrode. Under optimal conditions, the detection time is within 6 min and the devise shows excellent performance with a detection limit of 1.30 ng/mL. Additionally, the device could be applied to detect THC in hemp extract samples. The results obtained from this sensor are similar to the standard method (HPLC) for detecting THC. Therefore, this proposed device is useful as an alternative device for the on-site determination of THC because it is inexpensive, portable, and exhibits high sensitivity.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, environmental, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Biochemistry, Spectroscopy"

The experiments were conducted in a 100 mL high-pressure batch reactor. The initial sucrose concentration of 500 g/L, initial nitrogen pressure of 101.3 kPa, and catalyst loading of 0.2 g remained constant during the reactions. An increase in the reaction temperature and time, which varied in the range of 303-373 K and 1-12 h, respectively, resulted in an increase in the glucose and fructose yields owing to the high acidity of Amberlyst-15. The most elevated glucose and fructose yields based on carbon moles of 0.50 mol-C/mol-C and 0.49 mol-C/mol-C, respectively, were obtained at 373 K after 3 h with complete sucrose conversion. Moreover, Amberlyst-15 was reused for more than 24 cycles, with complete sucrose conversion and a high yield of inverted sugar. Therefore, Amberlyst-15 is an active, selective, and stable catalyst for sucrose hydrolysis.","process equipment, energy",Energy (all)

The raw material selection is the important procedure for real industrial production. The effect of biomass structural composition in feedstock on ethanol production is therefore needed to explore for feedstock selection. According to the previous research studies, the fermentation process includes pre-treatment and fermentation of sugar to ethanol. This study focuses on the simulation of raw material variation in ethanol production especially the structural composition of carbohydrate that contains three main components, cellulose, xylan, and lignin, in the fermentation section. The simulation model is validated by the data of previous study information with small deviation. The mixture design method is used for result interpretation and analysis. From the design of experiment, there are 14 scenarios and the selected response parameter is the mass fraction of ethanol in outlet stream of fermentation section. From the results, the maximum mass fraction of ethanol in outlet stream is in the scenario which has a large amount of cellulose and xylan fractions. This is because the conversion of reaction in the fermentation reactor mostly consumes cellulose and xylan to produce glucose and xylose, respectively, and converts them into ethanol product. From the overall result of this study, the important of raw material selection in ethanol production is illustrated.","fluidex; related topics, energy",Energy (all)

Effect of inlet gas and liquid velocity profiles on one-group interfacial area transport equation in a vertical large rectangular channel,"Rassame S., Hibiki T.",2023-11-01,"Flow boundary conditions, Inlet conditions, Interfacial area concentrations, Interfacial area transport equation, Large rectangular channel, Non-uniform, Non-uniform inlet condition, Rectangular channel, Side walls, Two-fluid modeling, Interfacial area transport equation, Large rectangular channel, Non-uniform inlet conditions, Two-fluid model","Bubbly flows appear in many heat and mass transfer equipment. The interfacial area concentration is a critical parameter in determining the performance of the heat and mass transfer systems. The one-dimensional one-group interfacial area transport equation (IATE) was developed based on area-averaged bubbly flow data collected under uniform inlet flow boundary conditions. The applicability of the IATE to the flow systems with non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions was not comprehensively examined. This study investigated the effect of inlet liquid and gas velocity profiles on measured interfacial area concentration changes along the flow direction. The data used in this study were collected for vertical upward air-water two-phase flow in a rectangular channel with a gap length of 10 mm and width of 200 mm. The test conditions were the superficial gas velocity ranging from 0.0870 to 0.288 m/s and the superficial liquid velocity ranging from 0.515 to 2.53 m/s. The interfacial area concentrations with uniform and non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions measured in a large vertical rectangular channel were compared under the same area-averaged flow rate conditions. Then, the predictive capability of the IATE to the bubbly flow test data with uniform and non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions was assessed. Some non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions, including channel-center peaking of liquid flow (CPF), channel-center peaking of gas flow (CPG), single-side-wall peaking of liquid flow (SPF), and single-side-wall peaking of gas flow (SPG), significantly affected the interfacial area concentration changes along the axial location at relatively high superficial gas or liquid velocity conditions. The IATE's predictive capability deteriorated for several non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions, including double-side-wall peaking of gas flow (DPG) and single-side-wall peaking of liquid flow (SPF), specifically at relatively high superficial liquid velocity conditions. The maximum percentage error of the interfacial area concentration prediction by the IATE for these non-uniform inlet flow boundary conditions reached 75%.","physics, engineering, coastal engineering","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes"

The four adsorbate–adsorbent systems have been examined at different temperatures, pressures, and concentration ratios in the mixture. Among them, the carbon nanotube CNT (11,11) exhibited the highest selectivity, reaching up to 104.","mixing and separation, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

The aim of this study was to test concurrently the validity of COH-FIT items and the internal validity of the co-primary outcome, a composite psychopathology “P-score”. Methods: The COH-FIT survey has been translated into 30 languages (two blind forward-translations, consensus, one independent English back-translation, final harmonization). To measure mental health, 1–4 items (“COH-FIT items”) were extracted from validated questionnaires (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire 9). COH-FIT items measured anxiety, depressive, post-traumatic, obsessive-compulsive, bipolar and psychotic symptoms, as well as stress, sleep and concentration. COH-FIT Items which correlated r ≥ 0.5 with validated companion questionnaires, were initially retained. A P-score factor structure was then identified from these items using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) on data split into training and validation sets. Consistency of results across languages, gender and age was assessed. Results: From >150,000 adult responses by May 6th, 2022, a subset of 22,456 completed both COH-FIT items and validated questionnaires. Concurrent validity was consistently demonstrated across different languages for COH-FIT items. CFA confirmed EFA results of five first-order factors (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic, psychotic, psychophysiologic symptoms) and revealed a single second-order factor P-score, with high internal reliability (ω = 0.95). Factor structure was consistent across age and sex. Conclusions: COH-FIT is a valid instrument to globally measure mental health during infection times. The P-score is a valid measure of multidimensional mental health.","psychology, medical","Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"
Simple approach for correcting an entrapped ectopic permanent mandibular first molar caused by poor marginal adaptation of a preformed metal crown on an adjacent primary second molar: a case report with a 5-year follow-up,"Changsiripun C., Chatchaiwong C.",2023-05-01,"Child, Crowns, Dentists, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Malocclusion, Molar, Professional Role, Tooth Eruption, Ectopic, ectopic eruption, first molar, interceptive orthodontics, preformed metal crown, separating module","Ectopic eruption of the permanent first molar can lead to malocclusion if left untreated. Despite several reported etiologic factors and treatment options, ectopic eruption caused by an improper restoration on an adjacent tooth and a simple solution have never been documented. Case report: An 8-year-old boy presented with an entrapped ectopic permanent mandibular first molar under the poorly adapted margin of a preformed metal crown (PMC) on the adjacent primary second molar. Replacement with a PMC that had well-contoured margins followed by inserting a separating module between the proximal contact of the two teeth resulted in successful management of this situation in 1 month. Conclusion: This simple approach with good interdisciplinary communication is practical for correcting eruption problems due to a poorly adapted PMC, with long-term satisfactory results. To avoid subsequent malocclusion and unnecessary treatments, dental practitioners must be vigilant when manipulating PMCs and assessing the marginal adaptation prior to their cementation.",medical,Medicine (all)

AD is characterized by the aberrant accumulation of β-amyloid plaques and tau protein-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain giving rise to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic failure, and eventual neuronal cell death. The total cost of care in AD treatment and related health care activities is enormous and pharmaceutical drugs approved by Food and Drug Administration have not manifested sufficient efficacy in protection and therapy. In recent years, there are growing studies that contribute a fundamental understanding to AD pathogenesis, AD-associated risk factors, and pharmacological intervention. However, greater molecular process-oriented research in company with suitable experimental models is still of the essence to enhance the prospects for AD therapy and cell lines as a disease model are still the major part of this milestone. In this review, we provide an insight into molecular mechanisms, particularly the recent concept in gut-brain axis, vascular dysfunction and autophagy, and current models used in the study of AD. Here, we emphasized the importance of therapeutic strategy targeting multiple mechanisms together with utilizing appropriate models for the discovery of novel effective AD therapy.

One of the hallmarks of sepsis is hyperinflammation due to the excessive release of inflammatory mediators. Recently, new therapeutic approaches, such as immune modulation and blood purification, have been tried to improve outcomes in patients with septic shock. Methods: This study is a prospective observational study composed of children with septic shock and the PELOD-2 score ≥10 or the PRISM-3 score ≥15. All received 2-4 h of HA330 treatment on 2 consecutive days, used as adjunctive therapy. The effectiveness of HA330 hemoperfusion was evaluated by improving the PELOD-2 and PRISM-3 scores, the vasoactive inotropic score (VIS), and inflammatory markers from baseline to 72 h after the use of HA330 hemoperfusion. Results: Twelve patients hospitalized in the PICU and diagnosed with septic shock between July 2021 and May 2022 were included in this study and received hemoperfusion with HA330. The average PELOD-2 and PRISM-3 scores decreased significantly from 9.5 (IQR: 6.5-13.0) at baseline to 2.0 (IQR: 0-6.5) at 72 h (p = 0.002) and from 16.5 (IQR: 15.0-20.5) at baseline to 5.5 (IQR: 2.0-9.5) at 72 h (p = 0.002), respectively. The VIS decreased significantly from baseline to 72 h (p = 0.003). IL-6, procalcitonin, and lactate levels also decreased significantly from baseline to 72 h (p = 0.005, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively). Two of 12 patients expired due to their underlying condition (2/12, 16.7%). Device-related adverse events did not occur in this study. Conclusions: Our observational case series suggests a possible role for HA330 hemoperfusion as an adjunctive treatment of refractory septic shock in children with high severity scores in the context of rapid improvement in organ dysfunction, without serious adverse effects.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"

Recent Findings: Forty-seven randomized controlled trials evaluating 18 HMs in six different rhinosinusitis populations were included in the network meta-analysis. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. For the common cold, Pelargonium sidoides offered the most beneficial effect on symptom improvement (moderate certainty of evidence). For acute post-viral rhinosinusitis, Cineole and Pelargonium sidoides were the most effective treatments for controlling symptoms (moderate certainty), while Spicae aetheroleum was most effective for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improvement (moderate certainty). For chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), Origanum vulgare was the most beneficial treatment for improving symptoms and HRQoL (low certainty). Evidence of HMs for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and unclassified chronic rhinosinusitis was restricted to a limited number of studies. Adverse events should be of concern in some HMs, such as Spicae aetheroleum or Mytorl. Summary: Several HMs improved patient-important outcomes, above minimal clinically important differences, in treating common cold, acute post-viral rhinosinusitis, and CRSsNP. Further studies with adequate sample sizes and long-term follow-ups are warranted to support the current evidence.

Previously, key attributes of the upstream and the downstream processing in the synthesis of bio-based succinic acid were identified, which substantially influence the technological competitiveness compared to petroleum-based production. Accordingly, this study aims to simulate succinic acid production from glycerol with the most promising technology. The techniques of reactive extraction and direct crystallization, as well as the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an electron acceptor, are investigated. Selected scenarios are evaluated based on techno-economic, energy, exergy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performances to acquire a broader perspective on the sustainability of the technology. The obtained results indicate that the addition of DMSO in the fermentation is key for the bio-based succinic acid production – the best profit of 190 million USD of the net present value, 33.3% of the internal rate of return, and 4.48 years of the payout period are estimated. Additionally, bio-based succinic acid production could compete with the petrochemical route, particularly the reduction of GHG by 26%. Therefore, the production of succinic acid from glycerol is feasible given the positive net present value and lower GHG emissions compared to the petrochemical route.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, environmental, Business","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Environmental Science (all), Strategy and Management, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

The results show that the nanocomposites have stronger mechanical properties, higher thermal stability, greater crystallinity, better barrier ability, and excellent antibacterial property due to the influence of Graphene-ZnO. The tensile strength, crystallinity, melting temperature, thermal stability and barrier performance of the nanocomposites reached the maximum when Graphene-ZnO with a content of 0.2 phr was added. Compared with pure PBS, when Graphene-ZnO was added to PBS at 0.2 phr, the tensile strength, yield strength, elongation at break and moisture barrier performance of PBS were significantly increased by 22.5%, 31.34% ,62.84% and 42.57% respectively. This improvement in barrier performance might be attributed to the presence of Graphene-ZnO extended the penetration path of molecules and the coordination from PBS and Graphene-ZnO, so as to narrow the H2O transmission path. The results of the buried soil test show that the weight loss rate of the nanocomposite increased with increase Graphene-ZnO content, which may be caused by boundary defects between nanofiller and matrix, and poor compatibility at high content of Graphene-ZnO.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Polymers and Plastics, Organic Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"

To address this, PVDF photocatalytic hollow fiber membranes were prepared by coating with polydopamine (PDA) for 1–4 h, then with titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) in the current study. SEM and EDX results showed that TiO2 adhered firmly to the PDA-pretreated membrane after ultrasonic treatment. The PDA layer protected the membranes from UV irradiation. The PVDF-TiO2 membrane without PDA pretreatment was destroyed after 24 h of UV irradiation, while after 9 days of continuous irradiation, the membranes treated with PDA for 2 h remained unchanged. Compared with the original membrane, applying PVDF membranes coated with PDA for 2 h and TiO2 for 1 h increased the Reactive Red 239 rejection and flux recovery rates by 13% and 40%, respectively, achieving 60% COD removal. The permeate flux and dye rejection rate were stable after 5 cycles (20 h of operation).

The combination of dynamic covalent bonds and widely available, biodegradable, and biobased raw materials enables new polymers with an excellent carbon footprint, mechanical properties, and outstanding features in terms of multiple recycling methods, e.g., thermomechanical, chemical, and biological reprocessing/reusability. Natural corn starch granules have been surface-modified by an acetoacetylation reaction without using any additional solvent and maintaining the inner semicrystalline structure, giving a polyfunctional cross-linker for starch-reinforced vitrimer composites. Vinylogous urethane vitrimer matrices were synthesized by the condensation reaction of fully acetoacetylated glycerol and different diamines, while glycerol and the diamines were deliberately selected as potentially biobased raw materials. Seven different matrix vitrimers were synthesized with a content of 0-70 wt % of modified starch and investigated in terms of their thermal and mechanical properties. In total, 20 elastomeric and thermosetting materials have been prepared, exhibiting high elastic moduli of 2 GPa with short stress relaxation times and a high content of modified starch up to 70 wt %. The composites show low swelling ratios, suppressing the natural gelatinization of starch in water. Moreover, suitable thermomechanical, chemical, and enzymatic recycling methods for closed-loop cycles, remolding, reusability, and biodegradability were developed.","heat exchange, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, energy","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

CAS consists of three steps e.g., obstacle sensing, collision prediction, and collision avoidance. Collision prediction enables drones to gain information, process information, and estimate whether the object has a risk of collision. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the methods that can be employed for collision prediction. However, CNN is a method that needs a large data in the training. Dario Pedro et al. provided a dataset called the CoLANet dataset that consists of VDOs of collision drones. Subsequently, they proposed a new algorithm called Neural Network Pipeline which has a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) part to extract the feature from a couple of images. CNN extracts images by using MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model. They chose MobileNetV2 due to training performance from another dataset. This paper aims to assess the performance of lightweight CNN models using the CoLANet dataset. The models will be trained on the Keras library with parameters of fewer than ten million. The models will be validated by Confusion Matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristics. In conclusion, we examine which pre-trained CNN model has the best performance and suggest ongoing work.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Methods: We reanalyzed data from 34 studies including 16 164 individuals in 6 risk groups defined by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, sex, and male sexuality: men who have sex with men (MSM) and people with HIV (MSMWH), HIV-negative MSM, women with HIV (WWH), HIV-negative women, men who have sex with women (MSW) with HIV (MSWWH), and HIV-negative MSW. We used Markov models to estimate incidence and clearance of 13 hrHPV types and their determinants. Results: Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 had the highest incidence-clearance ratio of the hrHPV types. MSMWH had the highest hrHPV incidence (eg, 15.5% newly HPV-16 infected within 2 years), followed by HIV-negative MSM (7.5%), WWH (6.6%), HIV-negative women (2.9%), MSWWH (1.7%), and HIV-negative MSW (0.7%). Determinants of HPV-16 incidence included HIV status and number of sexual partners for MSM, women, and MSW, and anal sex behavior for MSM only. HPV-16 clearance was lower for people with HIV (PWH) and lower for prevalent than incident infection. Among MSM, increasing age was associated with lower clearance of prevalent, but not incident, HPV-16 infection. Conclusions: This robust and unifying analysis of anal hrHPV natural history is essential to designing and predicting the impact of HPV vaccination and HPV-based screening programs on anal cancer prevention, particularly in MSM and PWH. Importantly, it demonstrates the higher carcinogenic potential of longstanding anal prevalent hrHPV infection than more recent incident infection.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Recent studies of H-dropouts (HST-dark galaxies) have revealed that we may be missing a large proportion of star formation that is taking place in massive galaxies at z > 3. In this work, we extend the H-dropout criterion to lower masses to select optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs) at high redshifts in order to complete the census between LBGs and H-dropouts. Our criterion (H > 26:5 mag & [4.5] < 25 mag) combined with a de-blending technique is designed to select not only extremely dust-obscured massive galaxies but also normal star-forming galaxies (typically E(B - V) > 0:4) with lower stellar masses at high redshifts. In addition, with this criterion, our sample is not contaminated by massive passive or old galaxies. In total, we identified 27 OFGs at zphot > 3 (with a median of zmed = 4:1) in the GOODS-ALMA field, covering a wide distribution of stellar masses with log(M∗/M ) = 9:4-11:1 (with a median of log(M∗med/M ) = 10.3). We find that up to 75% of the OFGs with log(M∗/M ) = 9:5-10:5 were neglected by previous LBGs and H-dropout selection techniques. After performing an optical-to-millimeter stacking analysis of the OFGs, we find that rather than being limited to a rare population of extreme starbursts, these OFGs represent a normal population of dusty star-forming galaxies at z > 3. The OFGs exhibit shorter gas depletion timescales, slightly lower gas fractions, and lower dust temperatures than the scaling relation of typical star-forming galaxies. Additionally, the total star formation rate (SFRtot = SFRIR + SFRUV) of the stacked OFGs is much higher than the SFRcorr UV (SFRUV corrected for dust extinction), with an average SFRtot/SFRcorr UV = 8 ± 1, which lies above (∼0.3 dex) the 16 84th percentile range of typical star-forming galaxies at 3 = z = 6. All of the above suggests the presence of hidden dust regions in the OFGs that absorb all UV photons, which cannot be reproduced with dust extinction corrections. The effective radius of the average dust size measured by a circular Gaussian model fit in the uv plane is Re(1:13 mm) = 1:01 ± 0:05 kpc. After excluding the five LBGs in the OFG sample, we investigated their contributions to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD). We found that the SFRD at z > 3 contributed by massive OFGs (log(M∗/M ) > 10:3) is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the one contributed by equivalently massive LBGs. Finally, we calculated the combined contribution of OFGs and LBGs to the cosmic SFRD at z = 4-5 to be 4 × 10-2 M yr-1 Mpc-3, which is about 0.15 dex (43%) higher than the SFRD derived from UV-selected samples alone at the same redshift. This value could be even larger, as our calculations were performed in a very conservative way.","mixing and separation, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"
Evaluation of dynamic impression lining material effects on masticatory function and the oral health-related quality of life of complete denture wearers: A six-month randomized controlled trial,"Limpuangthip N., Tumrasvin W., Pinyowattanasilp T., Kulpiyavaja P.",2023-01-01,"Dental Impression Materials, Denture, Complete, Humans, Mastication, Pain, Patient Satisfaction, Quality of Life, Complete denture, Denture liner, Dynamic impression liner, Masticatory performance, Oral impacts on daily performance","Purpose: To determine the effect of a dynamic impression lining material (DIL) on the retention and stability of mandibular complete dentures (LCD), masticatory performance, and the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of the patients wearing complete denture (CD) compared with those wearing a denture with conventional hard denture liner (HL). Methods: Twenty-five patients who wore CD with an ill-fitting LCD were randomly assigned to two groups: LCD relined with DIL (Dynamic impression lining material) or HL (Tokuyama® Rebase II (fast)). Three objective measures (denture retention, stability, and masticatory performance) were measured. The OHRQoL was also measured using the Thai version of oral impacts on daily performance. Outcomes were measured at six time points: baseline, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after relining. Outcome changes were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation, and all models were adjusted for age, mandibular ridge form, and CD age at a 5% significance level. Results: After LCD relining, the frequency and severity of adverse oral impacts significantly decreased. In the DIL group, denture pain occurred on and off over six months, and an ill-fitting denture impacted at one month. In the HL group, denture pain continuously decreased over time. At 3 months, changes in the clinical properties of DIL were observed, including perceived odor. The material also peel-off from the denture base, and plaque accumulation was observed. In contrast, the HL properties remained stable for over 6 months. Conclusions: Although DIL improves denture retention and stability, masticatory performance, and the OHRQoL of the patients who wear CD, oral adverse effects were not eliminated. The clinical properties of DILs changed at 3 months, while the HL remained relatively stable for up to 6 months.

The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the effect of different interfacial agents, namely polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) and ϒ-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (ATPS) on the morphology and properties of PVC/NMPCB composites. A PVC/NMPCB composite was prepared by melt compounding with varying amounts of NMPCB ranging between 10, 20 and 30 wt.%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy–attenuated total reflectance (FTIR–ATR) analysis revealed the interactions between PVC and NMPCB when using both PP-g-MAH and ATPS interfacial agent. The properties and morphology of PVC/NMPCB composites were significantly dependent on the interfacial agent treated on the NMPCB surface. The phase morphology and mechanical properties of PVC/NMPCB composites (30 wt.% of NMPCB) were improved and the result also indicated that the higher compatibility of composites with ATPS as an interfacial agent led to our obtaining the maximum Young’s modulus of 484 MPa. The dynamic mechanical analysis revealed the interaction at the interface, with the Tg shifting to a lower temperature in the presence of PP-g-MAH and strong interfacial adhesion noted with the improved Tg in the presence of the ATPS interfacial agent. Further evidence of the improved interaction was observed with the increment in density in the presence of ATPS when compared with PP-g-MAH in PVC/NMPCB composite. Hence, of the two interfacial agents, ATPS showed itself to be more effective when employed as an interfacial agent for NMPCB in PVC composite for industry.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"
Immunomodulation Effect of Regional Citrate Anticoagulation in Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Renal Replacement Therapy,"Kaewdoungtien P., Tachaboon S., Kangsumrith N., Srisawat N.",2023-05-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Adult, Anticoagulants, Citrates, Citric Acid, Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy, Critical Illness, Humans, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1, Renal Replacement Therapy, Acute kidney injury, Continuous renal replacement therapy, Critical illness, Immunomodulation, Regional citrate anticoagulation","Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome in critically ill patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the standard treatment for patients with AKI. Research on the immunomodulating effects of regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) remains limited in patients with AKI receiving CRRT. We aimed to evaluate the immunomodulating effects of RCA in patients with AKI receiving CRRT. Methods: A randomized controlled trial study on critically ill adult patients with AKI undergoing CRRT was undertaken. Participants were randomized into either a regional citrate group or control group (either heparin anticoagulant or normal saline). Measurements were taken at baseline, 6 and 24 h after commencing CRRT for CD11b expression, C3a, C5a, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. Clinical outcomes assessed were 28-day survival rate, length of ICU stay, renal support duration, and renal function at discharge. Results: Thirty patients were recruited and randomized into 2 groups of 15 subjects. Baseline demographic and clinical data were comparable between groups. In the citrate group, CD11b expression was significantly decreased at 24 h compared to the control group (1.84% [1.18-3.32] versus 4.92% [2.63-6.93], p < 0.01). The complement level, including c3b and c5a, was stable during CRRT. Additionally, the PAI-1 levels were significantly decreased at 24 h compared to the control group (114 ng/mL [19-193] versus 359 ng/mL [264-491], p < 0.01). No significant difference in survival rate was observed. Conclusions: RCA may have the potential to mitigate the inflammatory response by decreasing CD11b expression of neutrophil and improve fibrinolysis activity through a reduction of PAI-1 levels. Larger clinical trials are warranted to test this immunomodulation effect of RCA.",medical,"Hematology, Nephrology"
Sonar glass—Artificial vision: Comprehensive design aspects of a synchronization protocol for vision based sensors,"Balakrishnan A., Ramana K., Ashok G., Viriyasitavat W., Ahmad S., Gadekallu T.R.",2023-04-01,"Comprehensive designs, Human eye, Localisation, Object information, Objects detection, Obstacles avoidance, Sonar glass, Synchronization protocols, Vision-based sensors, Visually impaired people, Artificial vision, Human eye, Object detection, Sonar glass, Synchronization protocol, Vision based sensors","Supporting visually impaired people during their navigation is a challenging task that involves localization, tracking, navigation, obstacle avoidance, and path guidance. Many researchers have experimented with Sonar, RFID, GPS, NFC, walking sticks, waist-based devices, and even computer vision modules for blind navigation. Using five sonar sensors for obstacle detection with direction and timestamp, we developed Sonar Glass. As humans see in left, right, front, top, and bottom directions based on eye angle and the head pose, the sonar glass is designed to provide obstacle information at the same angle. The head movement of the visually impaired person activates a pair of sensors for each module. Understanding human eye movement mechanisms and developing a synchronization protocol for each pair of visual sensors on sonar glass sitting on both eyes is the main goal of this paper. The major challenge lies in understanding and simulating the human vision mechanism and to realize how the field of Artificial Intelligence can be a contributor in producing technologies for the visually impaired. We are using log-polar transform to simulate human retinal image mapping. The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm has also been implemented. It is the first time that both human eyes can be replaced by vision sensors. After comparing the estimated obstacle information from one sensor pair with that of the other sensors, the voice track is activated. The blind person uses the nearest obstacle information to avoid the obstacle and to extract spatial information about obstacles ahead of the user and provide an early warning. Unique in its design, the sonar Glass's synchronization protocol for a pair of related sensors provides possible object information in that direction. The executions were simulated in MATLAB and the results obtained in real time are found to be promising as the tests were carried out both indoor and outdoor. The sonar Glass design is unique of its kind and the synchronization protocol for the pair of related sensors provides the possible vision about the object information at that particular direction.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The current classification system of phobias does not account for this. Here, we analyze the fear-eliciting elements and discern the different types of fears that originate from them. We propose Pain, Disgust, Vasovagal response, Visual-vestibular and postural interactions, Movement and Speed, Distance and Size, Low and mid-level visual features, Smell, and Territory and social status. We subdivide phobias according to the fear-eliciting elements most frequently triggered by them and their impact on behavior. We discuss the implications of a clinical conceptualization of phobias in humans by reconsidering the current nosology. This conceptualization will facilitate finding etiological factors in defensive behavior expression, fine-tuning exposure techniques, and challenging preconceived notions of preparedness. This approach to phobias leads to surprising discoveries and shows how specific responses bear little relation to the interpretation we might later give to them. Dividing fears into their potentially fear-eliciting elements can also help in applying the research principles formulated by the Research Domain Criteria initiative.","psychology, neuroscience","Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Behavioral Neuroscience"

The purposes of this study were 1) to compare urinary OP metabolites, nerve conduction, and neurobehavioral (NB) performance between farmers and a control group, as well as between baseline measurement and after spraying OP pesticides; 2) to investigate the factors associated with increased urinary OP metabolites after spraying OP pesticides; and 3) to investigate the effects of OP metabolites on changes in nerve conduction and NB performance after spraying OP pesticides. This study was conducted with a sample size of 71 farmers and a control group of 26. The findings showed that after spraying OP pesticides total dialkylphosphate (DAP) levels were significantly higher than baseline levels. Multiple linear regression showed that increased urinary OP metabolites among farmers after spraying pesticides were negatively associated with wearing a mask when spraying OP pesticides and positively associated with the number of years of farm work and type of sprayer equipment. The results also showed a positive association between the increased urinary total diethylphosphate (DEP) levels and the decreased amplitude of motor nerve conduction. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between increased urinary total DEP and decreased right amplitude of sympathetic skin response (SSR). An increase in urinary total DMP was positively associated with a decrease in raw score and a standard score of visual-motor integration (VMI). Our findings provide evidence that exposure to OP pesticides can cause a deficit in nerve conduction and NB performance in farmers. These findings may contribute to the early detection of neurological disease and inform strategies to prevent damage to the peripheral and central nervous systems.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Hence, the use of Trauma Hybrid Operating Room (THOR) in abdominopelvic injuries has theoretical advantages including rapid bleeding control and minimizing patient transportation. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the impact of THOR in abdominopelvic injuries. Method: A pre-post intervention study of abdominopelvic injury patients requiring both surgery and interventional radiology (IR) procedures for bleeding control from January 2015 to May 2020 was conducted. The patients were divided into 2 groups, pre-THOR group (received surgery in OR and scheduled for IR procedures in a separate IR suite, before December 2017) and THOR group (received all procedures in THOR, after December 2017). The primary outcomes were procedure time (including transit time in the pre-THOR group) and mortality. Results: Ninety-one abdominopelvic trauma patients were identified during the study period, 56 patients in pre-THOR group and 35 patients in THOR group. Distribution of injuries was similar in both groups (59 abdominal injuries, 25 pelvic fractures, and 7 combined injuries). The bleeding-control interventions in both groups were 79 laparotomies, 10 preperitoneal pelvic packings, 12 pelvic fixations, 45 liver AEs, and 21 pelvic AEs. THOR group underwent significantly less thoracotomy (1 vs. 11, p = 0.036), more resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA, 0 vs. 5, p = 0.014), and more pelvic AE (13 vs. 9, p = 0.043). The procedure time was significantly shorter in THOR group (153 min vs. 238 min, p = 0.030). Excluding the transit time in the pre-THOR group, procedure time was not significantly different (153 vs. 154 min, p = 0.872). Both groups had similar mortality rates of 34%, but the mortality due to exsanguination was significantly lower in THOR group (11% vs. 34%, p = 0.026). Conclusions: THOR eliminated transit time, resulting in shorter procedure time in abdominopelvic trauma patients requiring bleeding-control intervention. Although overall mortality reduction could not be demonstrated, the mortality due to exsanguination was reduced in THOR group.","gastroenterology, medical","Emergency Medicine, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

This causes the challenges in energy market for EVs in terms of electricity costs and technical effects on distribution systems. This paper proposes a centralized market platform managed by a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine the appropriate and appealing electricity costs for charging an EV without violating the power system's limits: bus voltage level, line capacity, and transformer loading limits. To complete the operations of the centralized market platform, the EV power and the bidding price from each EV owner who wishes to participate in the centralized market platform are collected through a single auction. The electricity costs for charging an EV are calculated by taking into account the maximum EV power as determined by the DSO so that the power system' limits are not violated. This paper modifies and employs a Thailand-typical 380-V distribution test system during off-peak and peak hours for the case study. The results show that during off-peak hours, the electricity costs for charging an EV range between 2.40 and 2.50 THB/kWh, while during peak hours, the electricity costs range between 3.50 and 5.40 THB/kWh. The decrease in EV charging costs will encourage EV owners to utilize their EVs.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

Stock curcumin-LAE solutions were prepared by titrating curcumin dissolved in ethanol into LAE aqueous solutions (pH 3.5). The LAE in the stock solutions inhibited the crystallization and prevented the chemical degradation of curcumin during storage at 20 °C. The antimicrobial activity of the curcumin-LAE solutions against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Listeria innocua (L. innocua) cocktails was assessed by exposing the sample to UV-A light (λ = 365 nm) for 5 min. For samples with both LAE and curcumin at pH 3.5 during irradiation, synergistic antimicrobial activity was observed. The release of protein or nucleic acid from the cells indicated an increase in its membrane permeability after treatments which was due to LAE-facilitated interaction between the photosensitizer and the membrane. LAE could inactivate both bacteria within 10 min without UV-A light irradiation, only at pH 7, which shows that LAE's antimicrobial efficacy depends on the pH. Therefore, microbial inactivation by two mechanisms, photosensitization and permeability operating simultaneously, produced a curcumin-LAE solution that could inactivate bacteria at a broad pH range.","fluidex; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Food Science

This leads to the difficulty of delivery in animal body system as well as the feed pelleting process. The present work proposes the microcapsule networks based on polymer matrices and charges under ionic crosslink to encapsulate probiotic for an extensive stability in adverse conditions. The combination of agar (AG) and alginate (AL) is a good model to combine agar matrices and alginate charges under ionic crosslink through o/w emulsion system for probiotic incorporation. By simply mixing Lactobacillus plantarum MB001(LPMB001) with AL and AG containing few drops of soybean oil, a stable o/w microemulsion can be obtained. The addition of calcium chloride favors the ionic crosslink among AG matrices resulting in LPMB001/AG-AL microcapsules. In vitro studies indicate the survival of LPMB001 and the slow release even after treatment in adverse conditions. This microencapsulation prolongs LPMB001 viability under the heat treatment and the storage conditions and this designates the potential feed processing.

Multi-object tracking generates enormous measurements of targets and extended object positions using light detection and ranging (Lidar) sensors. Designing an adequate object-tracking system is a global challenge because of dynamic object detection and data association uncertainties during scene understanding. In this regard, we develop an intelligent multi-objective tracking (IMOT) system with a novel measurement model, called the box data association inflate (BDAI) model, to assess each target&#x2019;s object state and trajectory without noise by using the Bayesian approach. The box object filter method filters ambiguous detection responses during data association. The theoretical proof of the box object filter is derived based on binomial expansion. Prognosticating a lower-dimension object than the original point object reduces the computational complexity of vehicle orchestration. Two datasets (NuScenes dataset and our lab dataset) are considered during the simulations, and our approach measures the kinematic states adequately with reduced computation complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. The simulation outcomes show that our proposed method is effective and works well to detect and track objects.

However, this English questionnaire is difficult for Thai parents to complete. The purpose of this study is to translate the PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF into Thai and test its reliability and validity. Methods: The PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF was translated into Thai using FACIT translation methodology. This version and the Thai version of the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (Thai-MHQ) were used to evaluate 30 Thai children with different types of congenital upper extremity anomalies. The reliability and validity of the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF were evaluated by test-and-retest with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Correlations between the Thai-PROMIS Parent Proxy UE-SF and Thai-MHQ were analysed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Results: The children’s mean age was 4.47 ± 2.08 years (range 1–9 years). The main diagnoses included thumb duplication (11 children), syndactyly (4 children)4, congenital trigger thumb (3 children) and obstetric brachial plexus palsy (3 children). The children’s parents completed the questionnaires, taking 164.23 ± 22.58 s for the Thai-PROMIS and 337.8 ± 49.37 s for the Thai-MHQ. The test-retest reliability of Thai-PROMIS evaluated by ICCs, was 0.9909 (good reliability), and the Cronbach’s alpha of all items was 0.923. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the Thai-PROMIS and Thai-MHQ showed a strong correlation with Domain 2 (activities of daily living, r = 0.7432) and a moderate correlation with the overall Thai-MHQ score (r = 0.699).

The model's performance indicated that the RF algorithm has the highest performance as compared to those of SVM and ANN in both deep and shallow aquifers (Deep: AUC=0.72, Recall=0.61, F1 =0.69; Shallow: AUC=0.81, Recall=0.79, F1 =0.68). In addition, the uncertainty from the quantile regression of each model confirmed that the RF algorithm has the lowest uncertainty (Deep: PICP=0.20; Shallow: PICP=0.34). The result of the risk map obtained from the RF reveals that the deep aquifer, in the northern part of the Rayong basin has a higher risk for people to expose to As. In contrast, the shallow aquifer revealed that the southern part of the basin has a higher risk, which is also supported by the location of the landfill and industrial estates in the area. Therefore, health surveillance is important in monitoring the toxic effects on the residents who use groundwater from these contaminated wells. The outcome of this study can help policymakers in regions to manage the quality of groundwater resources and enhance the sustainable use of groundwater resources. The novelty process of this research can be used to further study other groundwater aquifers contaminated and increase the effectiveness of groundwater quality management.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, groundwater quality; phreatic zone, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Because of their low vision these patients were incorrectly assumed to have microphthalmia. A complete ophthalmological exam established a clinical diagnosis of LCA. Candidate gene exons were sequenced with a targeted retinal dystrophy panel. Five subjects in three related families were diagnosed with LCA. All five were from Tonoas Island, within the Chuuk Lagoon, with ages ranging from 6 months to 16 years. DNA sequencing of affected individuals revealed a homozygous CRB1 NM_201253.3:c.3134del pathogenic variant, which was heterozygous in their parents. CRB1 genotypes were confirmed by a PCR restriction assay. We report identification of a founder pathogenic variant in CRB1 responsible for autosomal recessive LCA in this isolated community.

Protease allergens as initiators–regulators of allergic inflammation,"Soh W.T., Zhang J., Hollenberg M.D., Vliagoftis H., Rothenberg M.E., Sokol C.L., Robinson C., Jacquet A.",2023-05-01,"Allergens, Humans, Hypersensitivity, Inflammation, Interleukin-33, Peptide Hydrolases, Th2 Cells, IL-33, protease allergen; epithelial cell, protease-activated receptor, sensory neuron","Tremendous progress in the last few years has been made to explain how seemingly harmless environmental proteins from different origins can induce potent Th2-biased inflammatory responses. Convergent findings have shown the key roles of allergens displaying proteolytic activity in the initiation and progression of the allergic response. Through their propensity to activate IgE-independent inflammatory pathways, certain allergenic proteases are now considered as initiators for sensitization to themselves and to non-protease allergens. The protease allergens degrade junctional proteins of keratinocytes or airway epithelium to facilitate allergen delivery across the epithelial barrier and their subsequent uptake by antigen-presenting cells. Epithelial injuries mediated by these proteases together with their sensing by protease-activated receptors (PARs) elicit potent inflammatory responses resulting in the release of pro-Th2 cytokines (IL-6, IL-25, IL-1β, TSLP) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs; IL-33, ATP, uric acid). Recently, protease allergens were shown to cleave the protease sensor domain of IL-33 to produce a super-active form of the alarmin. At the same time, proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen can trigger TLR4 signaling, and cleavage of various cell surface receptors further shape the Th2 polarization. Remarkably, the sensing of protease allergens by nociceptive neurons can represent a primary step in the development of the allergic response. The goal of this review is to highlight the multiple innate immune mechanisms triggered by protease allergens that converge to initiate the allergic response.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"
Stability and bifurcation analysis of delayed tri-trophic food chain model in poisoned environment with fear effect and additional food,"Ramasamy S., Banjerdpongchai D., Park P.",2023-01-01,"Condition, Delayed tri-trophic food chain model, Ecological modeling, Fear effect, Food chain model, Holling type II functional response, Stability analyze, Stability and bifurcation analysis, Supplying additional food, Trophic food chains, delayed tri-trophic food chain model, fear effect, Hopf bifurcation, stability analysis, supplying additional food","One of the most important goals of theoretical ecologists is to find a strategy for controlling the chaos in ecological models to maintain healthy ecosystems. We investigate the influence of fear and the supply of additional food to predators in a delayed tri-trophic food chain model, where interference among the species is determined by Holling type-II functional response. The proposed model incorporates the fact that the growth rates of prey and middle predators are decreased due to the fear of middle and special predators, respectively. The additional food is supplied to both predators by either nature or external agencies. Furthermore, the poisoned prey in the predator's environment is taken into account. In the proposed model, we use two time delays: one for the growth term of the middle predator and another for the gestation delay of the special predator. We determine the conditions for the existence of ecologically feasible equilibrium points and their local and global stability. In addition, we establish the conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcation around interior equilibrium to seek periodic behavior in nondelayed and delayed models. Numerical investigations are performed to justify the proposed theoretical findings through phase portraits, time series of solutions, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe that the chaotic dynamics of a tri-trophic food chain model can be controlled by the proper choice of the fear effect and by supplying additional food parameters. As a result, our findings provide more ecological insights into the dynamics of the delayed tri-trophic food chain model with the fear effect and additional food supply.","fluidex; related topics, Mathematics, engineering","Mathematics (all), Engineering (all)"
Bond performance of fiber reinforced polymer bars in normal- and high-strength concrete,"El-Nemr A., Ahmed E.A., Barris C., Joyklad P., Hussain Q., Benmokrane B.",2023-08-22,"Analytical modeling, Bond strength, Bond stress, Bond stress-slip relationship, Concrete, Design codes, Fiber-reinforced polymer, Fiber-reinforced polymer bar, Fiber-reinforced polymers, Fibre reinforced polymers, Stress-slip relationship, Analytical modelling, Bond strength, Bond stress-slip relationship, Concrete, Design codes, Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), FRP bar","The structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) members depends on the bond between the reinforcing bars and surrounding concrete. Unlike steel bars, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are manufactured with different fiber types (glass, basalt, carbon, and aramid) and have different mechanical properties and surface configurations (sand-coated, deformed, grooved, sand-coated over helical wrapping). These differences impact the bond performance between the FRP bars and concrete. This paper investigates the bond performance of new generation and different FRP bars embedded in concrete. A total of 87 pullout specimens were constructed and tested until failure. The test results are presented and discussed. The test parameters include (i) fiber type (glass or carbon), (ii) surface configuration (sand-coated, deformed, or grooved), (iii) No. 4 to No. 8 (13 to 25.4 mm diameter) bar diameters), and (iv) concrete strength (normal- or high-strength concrete: NSC or HSC). Specimens with deformed 10 M or 15 M steel bars were also fabricated as controls and tested for comparison. The embedment length and block dimensions were also considered to ensure pullout-failure mode. The test results reveal that increasing the bar diameter generally reduced the bond strength of the FRP bars, while the bar diameter had insignificant impact on the steel bars. There was a positive relationship between the concrete compressive strength and the bond strength gained. The anticipated failure modes with the high concrete strength were at the fiber resin interface due to the high confinement generated by high-strength concrete. With the lower strength, failure usually occurred at the resin–concrete interface. In addition, the test results were used to assess different analytical models for bond stress-slip relationships.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all)"

For the recombinant subunit-based vaccines, effective adjuvants are crucial to enhance the magnitude and breadth of immune responses elicited by the vaccine. In this study, we report a preclinical evaluation of the immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of a recombinant plant-based SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine formulated with 3M-052 (TLR7/8 agonist)-Alum adjuvant. This vaccine formulation, named Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 2, induced significant levels of RBD-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses in mice. A viral challenge study using humanized K18-hACE2 mice has shown that animals vaccinated with two doses of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 2 established immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. A study in nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkeys) indicated that immunization with two doses of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 2 was safe, well tolerated, and induced neutralizing antibodies against the prototype virus and other viral variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron subvariants). The toxicity of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 2 was further investigated in Jcl:SD rats, which demonstrated that a single dose and repeated doses of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 Vax 2 were well tolerated and no mortality or unanticipated findings were observed.

Among five possible isomers, isomer A which has an octahedral geometry and a (cis-N/trans-O/cis-Cl) arrangement is the most stable pre-reaction Ti-FI dichloride complex. The isomer A can be activated by MAO to form the active catalyst and the active form was used for the study of the mechanism for Ti-FI. The second ethylene insertion was found to be the rate-determining step of the catalyzed ethylene polymerization. To examine the effect of group IVB transition metals (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) substitutions, calculated activation energies at the rate-determining step (EaRDS) were compared, where values of EaRDS of Zr < Hf < Ti agree with experiments. Moreover, we examined the effect of substitution on (O, X) ligands of the Ti-phenoxy-imine (Ti-1) based catalyst. The results revealed that EaRDS of (O, N) > (O, O) > (O, P) > O, S). Hence, the (O, S) ligand has the highest potential to improve the catalytic activity of the Ti-FI catalyst. We also found the activation energy to be related to the Ti-X distance. In addition, a novel Ni-based FI catalyst was investigated. The results indicated that the nickel (II) complex based on the phenoxy-imine (O, N) ligand in the square-planar geometry is more active than in the octahedral geometry. This work provides fundamental insights into the reaction mechanism of M − FI catalysts which can be used for the design and development of M − FI catalysts for ET polymerization.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, Materials Science","Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design, Materials Chemistry"

The digital twin of the automatic painting robot simulates the entire process and estimates the paint result before the real execution. An operator can view the simulated process and result with an option to either confirm or cancel the task. If the task is accepted, the digital twin generates all the parameters, including the end effector trajectory of the robot, the material flow to the collaborative robot, and a spray mechanism. This ability means that the painting process can be practiced in a virtual environment to decrease set costs, waste, and time, all of which are highly demanded in single-item production. In this study, the screen was fixtureless and, thus, a camera was used to capture it in a physical environment, which was further analyzed to determine its pose. The digital twin then builds the screen in real-time in a virtual environment. The communication between the physical and digital twins is bidirectional in this scenario. An operator can design a painting pattern, such as a basic shape and/or letter, along with its size and paint location, in the resulting procedure. The digital twin then generates the simulation and expected painting result using the physical twin’s screen pose. The painting results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the painting is less than 1.5 mm and the standard deviation of RMSE is less than 0.85 mm. Additionally, the initial benefits of the technique include lower setup costs, waste, and time, as well as an easy-to-use operating procedure. More benefits are expected from the digital twin framework, such as the ability of the digital twin to (1) find a solution when a fault arises, (2) refine the control or optimize the operation, and (3) plan using historic data.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, computer science, biochemistryistry, physics, engineering","Analytical Chemistry, Information Systems, Biochemistry, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Several oxygen scavengers were selected and examined according to their compatibility with ion chromatography. The mixture of sulfite and bisulfite (14 mg L−1) showed the highest efficiency in preventing the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate.

Long-term protection induced by low levels of type-specific neutralizing antibodies can be assessed using the virus-neutralizing antibody test. However, this test is laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a blockade-of-binding enzyme-linked immunoassay was developed to assess antibody activity by using a set of neutralizing anti-E monoclonal antibodies and blood samples from dengue virus-infected or -immunized macaques. Diluted blood samples were incubated with plate-bound dengue virus particles before the addition of an enzyme-conjugated antibody specific to the epitope of interest. Based on blocking reference curves constructed using autologous purified antibodies, sample blocking activity was determined as the relative concentration of unconjugated antibody that resulted in the same percent signal reduction. In separate DENV-1-, -2-, -3-, and -4-related sets of samples, moderate to strong correlations of the blocking activity with neutralizing antibody titers were found with the four type-specific antibodies 1F4, 3H5, 8A1, and 5H2, respectively. Significant correlations were observed for single samples taken 1 month after infection as well as samples drawn before and at various time points after infection/immunization. Similar testing using a cross-reactive EDE-1 antibody revealed a moderate correlation between the blocking activity and the neutralizing antibody titer only for the DENV-2-related set. The potential usefulness of the blockade-of-binding activity as a correlative marker of neutralizing antibodies against dengue viruses needs to be validated in humans. IMPORTANCE This study describes a blockade-of-binding assay for the determination of antibodies that recognize a selected set of serotype-specific or group-reactive epitopes in the envelope of dengue virus. By employing blood samples collected from dengue virus-infected or -immunized macaques, moderate to strong correlations of the epitope-blocking activities with the virus-neutralizing antibody titers were observed with serotype-specific blocking activities for each of the four dengue serotypes. This simple, rapid, and less laborious method should be useful for the evaluation of antibody responses to dengue virus infection and may serve as, or be a component of, an in vitro correlate of protection against dengue in the future.","biochemistryistry, environmental, Immunology, medical","Physiology, Ecology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Cell Biology, Infectious Diseases"

Our study aimed to validate the CCI after cytoreductive surgery for primary advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, and to compare its diagnostic performance with the Clavien-Dindo classification. Methods This prospective cohort study classified post-operative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and the CCI. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between both classifications with intensive care unit admission, prolonged length of hospital stay (defined as stays longer than the 75th percentile of all stays in this study), 30-day readmission, and time to initiating chemotherapy after surgery >42 days. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were used to assess the discriminative performance of each classification. Results A total of 300 patients were included in the analysis. Most patients (n=255, 85%) underwent interval cytoreductive surgery. Complete cytoreduction was achieved in 235 (78%) patients. Overall, 30-day post-operative complications classified by the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 147 (49%) patients. Severe complications (grade ≥3a) occurred in 51 (17%) patients. Approximately 30% (n=82) had multiple complications. The CCI showed an excellent correlation with the Clavien-Dindo classification (r=0.906, p<0.001). In comparison with the Clavien-Dindo classification, the proportion of patients classified with severe complications increased from 17% to 30% when stratified with the CCI, and 20% of patients were diagnosed with a CCI score that correlated with a higher Clavien-Dindo classification grade. On regression analysis, both Clavien-Dindo classification and CCI had associations with intensive care unit admission, prolonged length of hospital stay, 30-day readmission, and time to chemotherapy >42 days (all p<0.05). AUC demonstrated that CCI (0.842, 95% CI 0.792 to 0.893) and Clavien-Dindo classification (0.813, 95% CI 0.762 to 0.864, p<0.001) had a good diagnostic performance for prolonged length of hospital stay.

From the peak ground acceleration values, kinetic velocity values are generated. The maximum kinetic energy density due to earthquake shaking is determined using the simplified energy concept. The Empirical analysis is employed to predict liquefaction potential. The empirical analysis results are then correlated to kinetic energy density to generate equations that estimate liquefaction potential in Bengkulu City. Results show that a simplified energy concept can be used to estimate liquefaction potential. The performance of the proposed equations is generally consistent with documented liquefaction cases from around the world, and thus the framework implemented in this study can be adopted to calculate liquefaction potentials in other areas worldwide.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

A total of 20 mix designs were utilized, with 10–30% volume replacement of fine aggregate with CR and addition of 0.1–0.4% GNPs by weight of binder. All mix designs were studied for attributes including slump flow, compressive strength, stress-strain behavior, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, flexural strength, toughness, impact resistance, water absorption, and porosity. Morphological changes due to crack formation, microstructure, and interfacial interaction between aggregate and mortar were evaluated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Vickers microhardness tests were carried out from the surface of aggregate towards the matrix to evaluate the interfacial transition zone. Results indicated that CR replacement reduced the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete, while GNPs inclusion mitigated the negative effects of CR and significantly enhanced the properties of the geopolymer concrete. Results also revealed that 0.3% addition of GNPs increased the compressive strength, elastic modulus, tensile strength, and flexural toughness of the concrete containing the CR. Moreover, addition of 0.3% GNPs in specimens having 30% CR enhanced the average microhardness by 34%, which demonstrates that GNPs addition improved the matrix compactness and interfacial transition zone between CR and matrix. Multi-objective optimization with RSM was accomplished for the combined use of CR and GNPs in fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. RSM results showed that combination of 10% CR and 0.2% GNPs is the best combination for achieving the highest strength properties with the lowest percentage of GNPs.","mixing and separation, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Mechanics of Materials"

The predictor variables included demographic, medical, dental, fracture-related, operative, and postoperative parameters. The outcome variable was CSI. We used descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses at the 0.05 significant level. Results: The sample included 339 patients (24.5% females, 9.4% had complications) with an average age of 58.2 ± 12.0 years (range, 17–89). Bivariate analyses revealed nine significant variables. However, forward stepwise multiple logistic regression modelling identified three variables statistically associated with CSI: smoking (OR, 691.8; 95% CI, 75.9 to 6303.9; P < 0.0001; number needed to harm [NNH], 6), moderate to high gingival inflammation (OR, 786.7; 95% CI, 66 to 9378.9; P = 0.002; NNH, 12), and postoperative use of chlorhexidine mouthwash (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.77; P = 0.0003; number needed to treat [NNT], 2). Conclusions: smokers and subjects with gingivitis were more likely to experience CSI. Postoperative chlorhexidine rinsing was the potentially modifiable, albeit low-OR, factor. These findings could help to draw an effective guideline against the CSI.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

The effect of piperazine loading was studied by varying the percentage of piperazine (0%, 20%, 50%, and 80%). The adsorbent materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), N2 adsorption-desorption, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The characterization studies confirmed the successful incorporation of piperazine on MIL-101. The CO2 adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms model were investigated at three different temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C) to better understand the behavior of CO2 adsorption on the synthesized adsorbents. It was found that 50%pz/MIL-101 can enhance CO2 capacity up to 67% compared to bare MIL-101. Furthermore, piperazine grafted on MIL-101 can increase the rate constant and improve the binding energy between CO2 molecules and the surface of adsorbents. The regenerability for CO2 adsorption of pz/MIL-101 had nearly no drop after eight adsorption-desorption cycles. Thus, the pz/MIL-101 provides an excellent opportunity to capture CO2 in industrial applications.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"
Analytical modelling of adaptive optics systems: Role of the influence function,"Berdeu A., Tallon M., Thiebaut A., Langlois M.",2023-06-01,"Adaptive optics systems, Fitting error, Influence functions, Instrumentation: adaptive optics, Instrumentation:high angular resolution, Method: numerical, Methods:analytical, Monte Carlo's simulation, Techniques: high angular resolutions, Wavefront corrector, Instrumentation: adaptive optics, Instrumentation: high angular resolution, Methods: analytical, Methods: numerical, Techniques: high angular resolution","Context. Adaptive optics (AO) is now a tool commonly deployed in astronomy. The real time correction of the atmospheric turbulence that AO enables allows telescopes to perform close to the diffraction limit at the core of their point spread function (PSF). Among other factors, AO-corrected PSFs depend on the ability of the wavefront corrector (WFC), generally a deformable mirror, to fit the incident wavefront corrugations. Aims. In this work, we focus on this error introduced by the WFC, the so-called fitting error. To date, analytical models only depend on the WFC cut-off frequency, and Monte Carlo simulations are the only solution for studying the impact of the WFC influence function shape on the AO-corrected PSF. We aim to develop an analytical model accounting for the influence function shape. Methods. We first obtain a general analytical model of the fitting error structure function. With additional hypotheses, we then derive an analytical model of the AO-corrected power spectral density. These two analytical solutions are compared with Monte Carlo simulations on different ideal profiles (piston, pyramid, Gaussian) as well as with real hardware (DM192 from ALPAO). Results. Our analytical predictions show a very good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations. We show that in the image plane, the depth of the correction as well as the transition profile between the AO-corrected area and the remaining turbulent halo depend on the influence functions of the WFC. We also show that the generally assumed hypothesis of stationarity of the AO correction is actually not met. Conclusions. As the fitting error is the intrinsic optimal limit of an AO system, our analytical model allows for the assessment of the theoretical limits of extreme AO systems limited by the WFC in high-contrast imaging through a context where other errors become comparable.","the atmosphere, physics, earth sciences","Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space and Planetary Science"
Aerosol Concentrations During Otolaryngology Procedures in a Negative Pressure Isolation Room,"Seresirikachorn K., Sirinara P., Tangjaturonrasme N., Panyametheekul S., Ngamsritrakul T., Supaphan U., Boonroung T., Ongphichetmetha N., Koosrivinij S., Snidvongs K.",2023-05-01,"Aerosols, Humans, Nose, Otolaryngology, Patient Isolation, Patient Isolators, aerosol-generating procedures, flexible laryngoscopy, nasal endoscopy, negative pressure room, tracheotomy","Objective: To evaluate the role of a negative pressure room with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration system on reducing aerosol exposure in common otolaryngology procedures. Study Design: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation. Settings: Tertiary care. Methods: The particle concentrations were measured at various times during tracheostomy tube changes with tracheostomy suctioning, nasal endoscopy with suctioning, and fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FOL), which included 5 times per procedure in a negative pressure isolation room with a HEPA filter and additional 5 times in a nonpressure-controlled room without a HEPA filter. The particle concentrations were measured from the baseline, during the procedure, and continued until 30 minutes after the procedure ended. The particle concentrations were compared to the baseline concentrations. Results: The particle concentration significantly increased from the baseline during tracheostomy tube changes (mean difference [MD] 0.80 × 106 p/m3, p =.01), tracheostomy suctioning (MD 0.78 × 106 p/m3, p =.004), at 2 minutes (MD 1.29 × 106 p/m3, p =.01), and 3 minutes (MD 1.3 × 106 p/m3, p =.004) after suctioning. There were no significant differences in the mean particle concentrations among various time points during nasal endoscopy with suctioning and FOL neither in isolation nor nonpressure-controlled rooms. Conclusion: A negative pressure isolation room with a HEPA filter was revealed to be safe for medical personnel inside and outside the room. Tracheostomy tube change with tracheostomy suctioning required an isolation room because this procedure generated aerosol, while nasal endoscopy with suctioning and FOL did not. Aerosol generated in an isolation room was diminished to the baseline after 4 minutes.",medical,"Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"

Objective: This pivotal cohort study defines the scope, natural history, treatment, and overall survival of a large global cohort of patients with pathogenic STAT3 GOF variants. Methods: We identified 191 patients from 33 countries with 72 unique mutations. Inclusion criteria included symptoms of immune dysregulation and a biochemically confirmed germline heterozygous GOF variant in STAT3. Results: Overall survival was 88%, median age at onset of symptoms was 2.3 years, and median age at diagnosis was 12 years. Immune dysregulatory features were present in all patients: lymphoproliferation was the most common manifestation (73%); increased frequencies of double-negative (CD4−CD8−) T cells were found in 83% of patients tested. Autoimmune cytopenias were the second most common clinical manifestation (67%), followed by growth delay, enteropathy, skin disease, pulmonary disease, endocrinopathy, arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, neurologic disease, vasculopathy, renal disease, and malignancy. Infections were reported in 72% of the cohort. A cellular and humoral immunodeficiency was observed in 37% and 51% of patients, respectively. Clinical symptoms dramatically improved in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, while a variety of other immunomodulatory treatment modalities were less efficacious. Thus far, 23 patients have undergone bone marrow transplantation, with a 62% survival rate. Conclusion: : STAT3 GOF patients present with a wide array of immune-mediated disease including lymphoproliferation, autoimmune cytopenias, and multisystem autoimmunity. Patient care tends to be siloed, without a clear treatment strategy. Thus, early identification and prompt treatment implementation are lifesaving for STAT3 GOF syndrome.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

This study assessed health risk behaviours (including substance use), mental health, quality of life (QOL) and HIV treatment outcomes of Thai YA-PHIV. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Thai YA-PHIV aged 18–25 years who were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at five tertiary paediatric HIV care centres in Thailand. Study data were obtained through face-to-face interviews from November 2020 to July 2021. Assessments were performed for alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; AUDIT), smoking (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence), drug/substance use (Drug Abuse Screening Test; DAST-10), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents; PHQ-A), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder; GAD-7) and QOL (World Health Organization QOL Brief-Thai). HIV treatment outcomes were extracted from the National AIDS Program database. Results: Of 355 YA-PHIV, 163 (46%) were males: their median age was 21.7 (interquartile range, IQR 20.2–23.5) years. There were 203 YA-PHIV (58%) who reported ever having sex; 141 (40%) were sexually active in the past 6 months, of whom 86 (61%) reported 100% condom use. Overall, 49 (14%) met the criteria for harmful alcohol use; 28 (7.9%) were alcohol dependent. Sixty (17%) were current smokers and 37 (11%) used drugs/substances. The frequency of moderate up to severe symptoms for depression was 18% and for anxiety was 9.7%. Their overall QOL was good in 180 (51%), moderate in 168 (47%) and poor in five (1.4%). There were 49 YA-PHIV (14%) with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 and 85 (24%) with virologic non-suppression (HIV-RNA >200 copies/ml). On multivariate analyses, the highest education at the primary to high school or vocational school levels (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.40–3.95, p 0.04), harmful alcohol use (aOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.24–4.99, p 0.01), alcohol dependence (aOR 3.54, 95% CI 1.51–8.31, p <0.01) and lifetime suicidal attempt (aOR 2.66, 95% CI 1.11–6.35, p 0.03) were associated with non-suppression. Conclusions: Regular screening for alcohol use and mental health, including suicidality, would be useful to identify YA-PHIV who need more intensive psychosocial support or referral services to ensure they can achieve and maintain a high QOL into adult life.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

The statistical analysis of geotechnical data was performed to describe the spatial variability of soil properties. The mean, coefficient of variation, and scale of fluctuation of the undrained shear strength, standard penetration test, total unit weight, plasticity index, and thickness of soil layers were evaluated in detail using random field model. The lognormal distribution and decay exponential function were adopted to describe the fluctuation trend of soil properties. Based on the data, the empirical correlations between soil shear strength and index properties can be also established. The results of this research can help civil engineers to describe the influence of spatial variability of soil properties in geotechnical engineering analysis.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

The three-stage UASB could not function at a chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate greater than 3 kg/m3d due to the K toxicity, causing system failure. The K concentration in the distillery wastewater was 9000–10,000 mg/L, close to the severe inhibitory range for anaerobes (> 12,000 mg/L). Hence, the wastewater was diluted to reach moderate K toxicity. Surprisingly, the three-stage UASB could function effectively, providing high optimum and maximum COD loading rates (20 and 40 kg/m3d, respectively). This was because the three-stage UASB was regulated under a slow stepwise increase in the COD loading rate to achieve fully adapted anaerobe communities for each COD loading rate. This then led to the high ability to withstand the moderate inhibition of K via the successive development of sludge granules.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

It reduces their service life. This study investigated the impact wear of alloy steel using computational techniques combined with empirical data. The ultimate objective was to develop an approach requiring low–moderate effort for industrial application using limited resources to predict the average impact wear rate of AISI 4140 alloy steel (one of the most commonly used materials). The wear mechanisms were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Indirect monitoring was used to examine the wear stage transition cycle, e.g., from mild to severe wear. The empirical results showed that the transition cycle depended on the impact force. Fatigue was identified as the key damage mechanism, with cracks and lamellar wear appearing under severe deterioration. The average wear rate from the initial impact cycle to the wear stage transition cycle increased as the impact force increased. A simplified computational 2D finite element model assuming a smooth frictionless surface was used to investigate the contact condition. The contact behavior including the stress–strain distribution that developed during first contact was investigated using finite element analysis. A combined empirical and computational approach to predicting average wear rate was developed based on stress distribution data from the FE model and fatigue properties. The prediction results were then validated by comparison with the empirical data. These showed good agreement. The stress amplitude derived from an equivalent high-stress region was also introduced. The predicted curve of average wear rate versus stress amplitude of an equivalent high-stress region improved the design of the component.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Materials Chemistry"

This review aimed to compile scientific information about the role and action of tea plants, as well as their status concerning clinical applications, based on the currently available evidence, with a focus on metabolic syndrome, mainly covering obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It has been recognized that these diseases pose a significant threat to public health, and the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies is necessary but still challenging. In this article, the potential benefits of tea plants and their derived bioactive components (such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate) as anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, and anti-cardiovascular agents are clearly shown and emphasized, along with their mechanisms of action. However, according to the status of the clinical translation of tea plants, particularly in drug development, more substantial efforts in well-designed, randomized, controlled trials are required to expand their applications in treating the three major metabolic disorders and avoiding the toxicity caused by overconsumption.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

Forty primary molar blocks with natural dentin carious lesions were measured for baseline lesion depth and mineral density using Image-Pro Plus software. The samples were randomly distributed into 4 groups; 38% SDF applied for 1) 10-s (10SDF), 2) 60-s (60SDF), 3) 10-s + LC (10SDF + LC), 4) 60-s + LC (60SDF + LC) and an additional control group to assess the outcome of pH-cycling only. Then all the groups underwent a 7-d bacterial pH-cycling. The dentin carious lesions’ mMDD was determined by digital subtraction radiographic analysis. The surface morphology and elemental profile were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The mMDD of the dentin lesions was analyzed using two-way ANOVA, generalized linear models analysis. Light curing was the only factor that affected the mMDD (p = 0.007). The mMDD in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups were significantly higher than those without light curing (p = 0.041 and 0.041, respectively). The 60SDF + LC group demonstrated a significantly higher mMDD than the 10SDF group (p = 0.010), while that in the 10SDF + LC group was similar to the 60SDF group (p = 1.00). Scanning electron microscopy revealed denser mineral content layers, which were likely silver and chloride, in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups than in the 10SDF and 60SDF groups, respectively.

The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6−/Li+ co-storage mode shows a high energy density of 878 Wh kg−1 cycled more than 20 000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28 kW kg−1 that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co-storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single-ion electrodes.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

The disease is commonly found in Southeast Asia and exists worldwide. Some filarial nematodes are associated with intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia, which plays an important role in embryogenesis, molting, and the long-term survival of adult worms. This study aims to characterize Wolbachia sp. and determine the association between Wolbachia and canine filarial nematode species in Thailand. A total of 46 dog blood samples that were naturally infected with filarial nematodes were obtained to identify filarial nematode species by Giemsa stained under a light microscope and confirmed using the molecular technique. In order to characterize Wolbachia sp., the nested PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene showed that all samples of Dirofilaria immitis and fifteen samples of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis were grouped into Wolbachia supergroup C. In addition, all samples of Brugia spp. and five samples of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis were classified into Wolbachia supergroup D. The genetic diversity analysis conducted using the 16S rRNA gene revealed a similar result when analyzed through phylogenetic tree analysis. This is the first genetic diversity study of Wolbachia of Candidatus Dirofilaria hongkongensis in infected dogs in Thailand.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, population genetics, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"
Is automatic cephalometric software using artificial intelligence better than orthodontist experts in landmark identification?,"Ye H., Cheng Z., Ungvijanpunya N., Chen W., Cao L., Gou Y.",2023-12-01,"Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Cephalometry, Humans, Orthodontists, Reproducibility of Results, Software, Artificial intelligence, Automatic digitization, Cephalometric tracings","Background: To evaluate the techniques used for the automatic digitization of cephalograms using artificial intelligence algorithms, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each one and reviewing the percentage of success in localizing each cephalometric point. Methods: Lateral cephalograms were digitized and traced by three calibrated senior orthodontic residents with or without artificial intelligence (AI) assistance. The same radiographs of 43 patients were uploaded to AI-based machine learning programs MyOrthoX, Angelalign, and Digident. Image J was used to extract x- and y-coordinates for 32 cephalometric points: 11 soft tissue landmarks and 21 hard tissue landmarks. The mean radical errors (MRE) were assessed radical to the threshold of 1.0 mm,1.5 mm, and 2 mm to compare the successful detection rate (SDR). One-way ANOVA analysis at a significance level of P <.05 was used to compare MRE and SDR. The SPSS (IBM-vs. 27.0) and PRISM (GraphPad-vs.8.0.2) software were used for the data analysis. Results: Experimental results showed that three methods were able to achieve detection rates greater than 85% using the 2 mm precision threshold, which is the acceptable range in clinical practice. The Angelalign group even achieved a detection rate greater than 78.08% using the 1.0 mm threshold. A marked difference in time was found between the AI-assisted group and the manual group due to heterogeneity in the performance of techniques to detect the same landmark. Conclusions: AI assistance may increase efficiency without compromising accuracy with cephalometric tracings in routine clinical practice and research settings.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Both disorders are associated with the necessity of chronic treatment, and their mutual coexistence contributes to the phenomenon of drug resistance. Influencing the functioning of patients, they also cause numerous social consequences - affecting the quality of life and achievement of personal goals of patients. This review presents factors that may explain the common pathomechanisms of depression and migraine. Structural and functional disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS), disturbances in the neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory theories, hormonal disturbances, as well as a possible genetic basis were taken into account. Due to the fact that both depression and migraine have a multifactorial etiology and at the present stage of scientific research it is difficult to clearly determine which factor is the most important, such a broad overview has been presented. It is also difficult to determine which of the above-mentioned factors, well documented in international studies, only coexist, and which of them may have a cause-and-effect relationship in the described disorders.

Forty participants with POP stage II to III were randomly allocated to pessary or PFMT. Participants were asked to list up 3 goals they expected from treatment. Thai version of Prolapse Quality of Life Questionnaire (P-QOL) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, IUGA-revised (PISQ-IR) were completed at 0 and 6-week period. At 6-week post-treatment, they were asked if their goals had been achieved. The totally achieved goals in the vaginal pessary group were 70% (14/20) significantly higher than PFMT group at 30% (6/20) (p = 0.01). The mean ± SD of the post-treatment P-QOL score in the vaginal pessary group was significantly lower than the PFMT group (13.90 ± 10.83 vs 22.04 ± 5.93, p = 0.01), but not different in all PISQ-IR subscales. Pessary treatment for POP yielded better total goal achievements and better quality of life than PFMT for POP treatment at a 6-week follow-up.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can severely affect the quality of life, causing physical, social, psychological, occupational, and/or sexual dysfunction. Individual patient goal setting and goal achievement scaling (GAS) offers a new method of patient-reported outcome measurement (PRO) in therapeutic success such as pessary or surgery in patient with POP. But there is no randomised controlled trial comparing pessary vs pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) using GAS as the outcome measurement. What do the results of this study add? The results showed that women with POP stage II to III who received vaginal pessary had higher totally goal achievements and better quality of life than the women received the PFMT at 6-week follow up. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The information about the better goal achievements by using pessary can be used as the tools for counselling for patients with POP for selecting the choices for the treatment in the clinical setting.","obstetrics and gynecology, medical",Obstetrics and Gynecology

Surface modification of coconut shell activated carbon (CSAC) was performed by grafting with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) using citric acid (CA) as the crosslinking agent. A proper ratio of CMC and CA to CSAC and grafting time improved the surface functionalization of grafted nanostructured CMC-CSAC while the specific surface area and porosity remained unchanged. Lactic acid was partially purified (78%) with the recovery percentage of lactic acid at 96% in single-stage adsorption at room temperature and pH 6 with a 10:1 ratio of cell-free broth to CMC-CSAC bioadsorbent. A thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption was exothermic and non-spontaneous while the Langmuir isotherm model explained the adsorption phenomena.

The strain showed taxonomic characteristics consistent with those of members of the genus Micromonospora. HSS6-12T produced a single spore directly on the substrate mycelium, and no aerial mycelium was detected. The isomer of diamino acid presented in cell wall peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. Arabinose, xylose, glucose, and ribose were detected in whole-cell hydrolysates. MK-10(H4), MK-9(H4), and MK-10(H6) were major menaquinones. Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0, iso-C15:0, and iso-C17:0. Phospholipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositolmannosides. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that HSS6-12T shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Micromonospora inositola DSM 43819T (99.3%). In contrast, the genome analysis showed that HSS6-12T formed a tight taxonomic position in a phylogenomic tree with Micromonospora endolithica DSM 44398T. Moreover, the average nucleotide identity-blast, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization, and the average amino acid identity values between HSS6-12T and M. inositola DSM 43819T and M. endolithica DSM 44398T were 83.1–84.0%, 27.5–28.7%, and 80.4–82.2%, respectively, indicating that HSS6-12T was different species with both closely related Micromonospora-type strains. In addition, HSS6-12T could be discriminated from its closely related type strains by many physiological and biochemical characteristics. Thus, HSS6-12T could be considered a novel species of the genus Micromonospora, and the name Micromonospora thermarum is proposed for the strain. The type strain is HSS6-12T (= BCC 41915T = JCM 17127T).","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, biochemistryistry","Microbiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

Some of the successful examples of POC testing include lateral flow assays, urine dipsticks, and glucometers. Unfortunately, POC analysis is somewhat limited by the ability to manufacture simple devices to selectively measure disease specific biomarkers and the need for invasive biological sampling. Next generation POCs are being developed that make use of microfluidic devices to detect biomarkers in biological fluids in a non-invasive manner, addressing the above-mentioned limitations. Microfluidic devices are desirable because they can provide the ability to perform additional sample processing steps not available in existing commercial diagnostics. As a result, they can provide more sensitive and selective analysis. While most POC methods make use of blood or urine as a sample matrix, there has been a growing push to use saliva as a diagnostic medium. Saliva represents an ideal non-invasive biofluid for detecting biomarkers because it is readily available in large quantities and analyte levels reflect those in blood. However, using saliva in microfluidic devices for POC diagnostics is a relatively new and an emerging field. The overarching aim of this review is to provide an update on recent literature focused on the use of saliva as a biological sample matrix in microfluidic devices. We will first cover the characteristics of saliva as a sample medium and then review microfluidic devices that are developed for the analysis of salivary biomarkers.","medical, pharmacology","Medicine (miscellaneous), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)"

It is found that the presence of thiosulfate in the solution can hinder the passivation. Potentiodynamic polarization results show that thiosulfate increases the current density at which the thin passive films with the low corrosion resistance are formed. Thiosulfate effect to retard the passivation, is different with the concentrations exposed to the respective Zn alloys based on the Al content. Due to the presence of various Zn and Al protective compounds at the surface, the passivation of Zn alloys occurs at the immersion time of 432 ks in the form of thin film. After the immersion time is 1037 ks, the passivation is still approximately as close as 432 ks inhibiting the film growth by the effect of thiosulfate and depassivation also would be occurred with the removal of the oxide thin film by the longer immersion time.","corrosion, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In this study, we evaluated contributions of nutrients via river, SGD and atmospheric deposition, and their roles on PP in the bay. Contribution of nutrients from the three sources during different time of the year was estimated. Nutrients supply from Tapi-Phumduang River accounted for two-fold the amount from SGD while very little supply was from atmospheric deposition. Significant seasonal difference in silicate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were observed in river water. Dissolved phosphorous in river water was mainly (80 % to 90 %) of DOP in both seasons. For the bay water, DIP in wet season was two-fold higher than in dry season while dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was only one half of those measured in dry season. In SGD, dissolved nitrogen was mostly inorganic (with 99 % as NH4 +), while dissolved phosphorous was predominantly (DOP). In general, Tapi River is the most important source of nitrogen (NO3 −, NO2 −, and DON), contributing >70 % of all considered sources, especially in wet season, while SGD is a major source for DSi, NH4 + and phosphorus, contributing 50 % to 90 % of all considered sources.

Calcined C-MIL-101(Fe) provided lower furfural conversion and FOL selectivity, with an interesting switch towards acetal products.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all), Process Chemistry and Technology"
First case series and literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated pulmonary tuberculosis in Southeast Asia: Challenges and opportunities,"Siranart N., Sowalertrat W., Sukonpatip M., Suwanpimolkul G., Torvorapanit P.",2023-01-01,"Adult, Aged, Asia, Southeastern, COVID-19, Cross-Sectional Studies, Humans, Middle Aged, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pandemics, SARS-CoV-2, Sputum, Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis, Pulmonary, COVID-19, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SARS-CoV-2, Subclinical tuberculosis","Background: Subclinical tuberculosis (TB) is accidentally detected by radiologic and microbiologic findings. Transmission by those with subclinical TB could delay prevention effort. However, our study demonstrated positive aspect of COVID-19 outbreak as it could allow subclinical TB to be detected faster through a chest X-Ray (CXR). Methods: This cross-sectional cohort study aimed to report demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes related to early detection of TB among COVID-19 patients, and to elaborate the association between SARS-CoV-2 and pulmonary TB. Data of patients with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) diagnosed between March 2020 – March 2022 was collected. Results: Out of 12,275 COVID-19 patients, 26 were definitively diagnosed with MTB infection (mean age 48.16 ± 20.17 years). All cases that had suspicious CXR that were not typical for COVID-19, were tested for MTB. On average, pulmonary TB was diagnosed after admission 5(3−10) days, the treatment initiation period was 3(1−5) days from the TB diagnosis. Conclusions: This suggests an early detection of tuberculosis among COVID-19 patients by quicker screening CXR and sputum comparing to previous symptom guided screening. Thereby reducing the chance of TB transmission demonstrated during COVID-19 pandemic. So, clinicians should be aware of pulmonary tuberculosis in COVID-19 patients with atypical radiologic findings.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Infectious Diseases"

While traditional laboratory diagnostics like PCR and well-plate ELISA are sensitive and specific, they can be costly and take hours to complete. Diagnostic tests that can be used at the point-of-care or at home, like lateral flow assays (LFAs) are a simple, rapid alternative, but many commercially available LFAs have been criticized for their lack of sensitivity compared to laboratory methods like well-plate ELISAs. The Capillary-Driven Immunoassay (CaDI) device described in this work uses microfluidic channels and capillary action to passively automate the steps of a traditional well-plate ELISA for visual read out. This work builds on prior capillary-flow devices by further simplifying operation and use of colorimetric detection. Upon adding sample, an enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody, wash steps, and substrate are sequentially delivered to test and control lines on a nitrocellulose strip generating a colorimetric response. The end user can visually detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen in 15–20 min by naked eye, or results can be quantified using a smartphone and software such as ImageJ. An analytical detection limit of 83 PFU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 was determined for virus in buffer, and 222 PFU/mL for virus spiked into nasal swabs using image analysis, similar to the LODs determined by traditional well-plate ELISA. Additionally, a visual detection limit of 100 PFU/mL was determined in contrived nasal swab samples by polling 20 untrained end-users. While the CaDI device was used for detecting clinically relevant levels of SARS-CoV-2 in this study, the CaDI device can be easily adapted to other immunoassay applications by changing the reagents and antibodies.","chemistry, environmental, biochemistryistry","Analytical Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Biochemistry, Spectroscopy"

Seaweed resources are still unexplored for its multiple activities. The present study is focused to evaluate the biochemical and structural composition, and antioxidant, antimicrobial activity of a brown seaweed Stoechospermum marginatum. Bioactive substances such as alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, and phenols were determined by the qualitative analysis of phytochemicals. Moreover, quantitative analysis of seaweed extract obtained from Soxhlet extraction method using methanol as solvent revealed the significant existence of phenolic compound, flavonoids, and tannins. Phytochemical constituents of the extract were confirmed by UV visible spectroscopy, FTIR, NMR and HPLC analysis. This study revealed the presence of secondary metabolites, and functional groups that are responsible for biological activities. The antioxidant assays for S. marginatum used were as follows: DPPH radical scavenging activity (44.03 ± 0.307%), H2O2 scavenging activity (31.60%), metal chelating activity (47.33 ± 0.665%), ferrous iron reducing assay, and total antioxidant activity (47.92 ± 0.001%). The findings obtained from this study exhibited that the extracts yielded a great potential of antioxidant activities. Besides, bioactive extracts showed excellent antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens. The extract had effective activity against Bacillus subtilis strain (13 mm inhibition zone). It is noticeable that the seaweed S. marginatum can be utilized as a novel substance to replace many toxic synthetic antioxidants and antimicrobial agents available in the pharmaceutical industry.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

The system was investigated under a controlled temperature (35 °C) with total organic carbon/total nitrogen (TOC/TN) ratios of 1.8, 2.5, 0.3, and 3.0, which corresponded to Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for 500 days. The ABR achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of 95–99 % at TOC/TN ratios higher than 1.8. The nitrate removal efficiency significantly decreased from 98 % to 12 % when the TOC/TN ratio decreased from 3.0 to 0.3. The highest TN removal efficiency (94 ± 4 %) was achieved with a TOC/TN ratio of 3.0. The ABR could remove 97 ± 6 % of the suspended solids during the entire experimental period. The DHS reactor achieved a nitrification efficiency of 70 % with short hydraulic retention times of 0.11–0.28 min. Total ammonia nitrogen in the DHS effluent was less than 1.0 mg N/L in the stable condition. The denitrifying Thauera genera predominant in the ABR reactor led to a high degree of denitrification. Methanogenic organisms such as Methanobacterium and Methanosaeta contributed to methane production of 0.8 ± 0.4 L/d in the ABR at a TOC/TN ratio of 3.0. Microbial community structure analysis showed that nitrifying microorganisms, such as Nitrosomonas, Nitrospira, and Candidatus Nitrosopumilus, were detected in the DHS-retained sludge. These results indicate that the ABR–DHS system evaluated could be applied for the removal of nitrogen and solids from RAS derived black wastewater to meet the water quality level needed for production-scale RAS.","geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Aquatic Science

Numerical calculation results show electric field distribution in the channel between high voltage and ground electrodes with and without particle trap to clarify the particle motion under the electric field. Particle traps are fabricated with silicone and polyimide. The particle deactivation performance is observed for two types of particle traps. The experimental results show that the first type of trap can deactivate 53% and 87% of all experiment conditions for aluminum and stainless-steel particle, respectively. The first type and second type can trap aluminum particles at 10% and 80%, respectively. The particle's velocity under an electric field is an important parameter in predicting the trap performance.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, physics, engineering","Artificial Intelligence, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Instrumentation"

This study developed an in vitro EGF delivery platform with Nicotiana benthamiana plant-produced EGF (P-EGF) encapsulated on hyaluronic acid/alginate (HA/Alg) hydrogel to improve the effectiveness of glandular organoid biofabrication in short-term culture systems. Primary submandibular gland epithelial cells were treated with 5 - 20 ng/mL of P-EGF and commercially available bacteria-derived EGF (B-EGF). Cell proliferation and metabolic activity were measured by MTT and luciferase-based ATP assays. P-EGF and B-EGF 5 - 20 ng/mL promoted glandular epithelial cell proliferation during 6 culture days on a comparable fashion. Organoid forming efficiency and cellular viability, ATP-dependent activity and expansion were evaluated using two EGF delivery systems, HA/Alg-based encapsulation and media supplementation. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control vehicle. Epithelial organoids fabricated from PBS-, B-EGF-, and P-EGF-encapsulated hydrogels were characterized genotypically, phenotypically and by functional assays. P-EGF-encapsulated hydrogel enhanced organoid formation efficiency and cellular viability and metabolism relative to P-EGF supplementation. At culture day 3, epithelial organoids developed from P-EGF-encapsulated HA/Alg platform contained functional cell clusters expressing specific glandular epithelial markers such as exocrine pro-acinar (AQP5, NKCC1, CHRM1, CHRM3, Mist1), ductal (K18, Krt19), and myoepithelial (α-SMA, Acta2), and possessed a high mitotic activity (38-62% Ki67 cells) with a large epithelial progenitor population (∼70% K14 cells). The P-EGF encapsulation strikingly upregulated the expression of pro-acinar AQP5 cells through culture time when compared to others (B-EGF, PBS). Thus, the utilization of Nicotiana benthamiana in molecular farming can produce EGF biologicals amenable to encapsulation in HA/Alg-based in vitro platforms, which can effectively and promptly induce the biofabrication of exocrine gland organoids.",medical,Medicine (all)

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of OsMS in salt stress responses using the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional mutant line of malate synthase (AtMS), an OsMS orthologous gene, for ectopic expression. Germination of the Atms mutant under salt stress was lower than that of Arabidopsis Col-0 wildtype (WT); furthermore, the two Atms mutant lines ectopically expressing OsMS reversed the salt-sensitive phenotype. Atms mutants salt-treated for 3 days exhibited higher electrolyte leakage, higher Na+/K+ ratio, lower expression of stress-responsive genes, and lower soluble sugar content than WT and the two OsMS-expressing Atms mutant lines. Consistently, Atms mutants salt-treated for 3 days followed by a 5-day recovery period displayed greater fresh-weight reduction. Notably, leaf greenness and chlorophyll and total carotenoid contents were higher in the Atms mutant lines than in the WT under stress. OsMS-expressing Atms mutants exhibited a change in pigment content closer to that of WT. During dark-induced senescence, an Atms mutant, Aticl, mutant (the other key gene in the glyoxylate cycle), and three double mutant lines of Atms and Aticl exhibited lower decreases in leaf greenness than the WT and OsMS-expressing Atms mutant lines. Furthermore, SAG12 expression levels in the Atms mutant, Aticl mutant, and three double mutant lines were lower than those in OsMS-expressing Atms mutant lines. Altogether, our data indicate that OsMS likely plays a key role in salt stress responses, possibly through the induction of leaf senescence.","biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physiology, Agronomy and Crop Science, Plant Science"

This rise is likely to be multi-factorial, but the role of certain nutrients known to facilitate neurodevelopment should be considered. One possible contributing factor could be attributed to deficits in choline intake, particularly during key stages of neurodevelopment, which includes the first 1000 days of life and childhood. Choline, a key micronutrient, is crucial for optimal neurodevelopment and brain functioning of offspring. The present narrative review discusses the main research, describing the effect of choline in neurodevelopmental disorders, to better understand its role in the etiology and management of these disorders. In terms of findings, low choline intakes and reduced or altered choline status have been reported in relevant population subgroups: pregnancy (in utero), children with autism spectrum disorders, people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and those with dyslexia. In conclusion, an optimal choline provision may offer some neuronal protection in early life and help to mitigate some cognitive effects in later life attributed to neurodevelopmental conditions. Research indicates that choline may act as a modifiable risk factor for certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Ongoing research is needed to unravel the mechanisms and explanations.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Nursing","Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics"

According to Modified pull-out tests, with increasing the fire exposure time to 45 and 90 min, it significantly reduced the interfacial bonding strength and ductility. The bonding performance of fired specimens is achieved by applying longer bond length. Finally, the shear stress–slip model of the fire-damaged concrete bonded with CFRP can be proposed by using the experimental relationship between strain and slip with the simple derivative of local shear–stress equilibrium.

Curcumin reduces blood-nerve barrier abnormalities and cytotoxicity to endothelial cells and pericytes induced by cisplatin,"Kobutree P., Tothonglor A., Roumwong A., Jindatip D., Agthong S.",2023-01-01,"Animals, Blood-Nerve Barrier, Cisplatin, Curcumin, Endothelial Cells, Humans, Pericytes, Rats, capillaries, cisplatin, nerve, neuropathy","BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is a platinum-based antineoplastic agent used to treat cancers of solid organs. Neuropathy is one of its major side effects, necessitating dose reduction or cessation. Previous studies suggested that cisplatin causes microvascular toxicity, including pericyte detachment. This study aimed to clarify whether these alterations occurred in the blood-nerve barrier (BNB) of capillaries after cisplatin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: Electron microscopic analysis of rat sciatic nerves with cisplatin neuropathy showed increased frequency and severity of pericyte detachment. Moreover, the vascular basement membrane did not tightly encircle around the endothelial cells and pericytes. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human brain vascular pericytes showed reduced viability, increased caspase-3 activity and enhanced oxidative stress following cisplatin treatment. In addition, cisplatin decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1. Curcumin, a polyphenol found in the root of Curcuma longa, had favourable effects on cisplatin neuropathy in previous work. Therefore, curcumin was tested to determine whether it had any effect on these abnormalities. Curcumin alleviated pericyte detachment, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, TEER reduction and tight junction protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that cisplatin causes BNB disruption in the nerves and might result in neuropathy. Curcumin might improve neuropathy via the restoration of BNB. Whether alterations in the BNB occur and curcumin is effective in patients with cisplatin neuropathy remain to be investigated.",medical,Medicine (all)

Individualized pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided dosing of extended half-life (EHL) FVIII concentrates may reduce their bleeding events. Aim: To compare clinical outcomes before and after switching low-dose prophylaxis using weight-based SHL FVIII to PK-guided EHL FVIII concentrates, taking into consideration of a trough FVIII activity at 1 IU/dl above natural baseline. Methods: In this single-centre prospective cohort, Thai severe or moderate HA (FVIII activity ≤3 IU/dl) patients receiving low-dose weight-based SHL FVIII prophylaxis were enrolled. After a 3-day wash-out period, participants underwent low-dose EHL FVIII prophylaxis with PK-based adjustment (myPKFiT®) for 6 months. The annualized bleeding rates (ABR), the annualized joint bleeding rates (AJBR), the haemophilia-specific quality-of-life (Haemo-QoL or Haemo-QoL-A) scores, the Hemophilia Joint Health Scores (HJHS) and the annualized FVIII consumption were compared between the two prophylactic periods. Results: Of 15 eligible subjects (mean age 18.7 ± 6.7 years), ABR, AJBR and HJHS were significantly reduced (mean differences of -11.1 ± 4.9 bleeds/year, -10.4 ± 5.2 joint bleeds/year and -5.1 ± 1.5 marks, respectively; P <.001 for all comparisons) after switching regimen. The quality-of-life scores had also improved (P =.001). Nonetheless, FVIII consumption tended to increase despite no statistical significance (means of 1240.9 ± 531.3 SHL FVIII IU/kg/year versus 1591.7 ± 438.9 EHL FVIII IU/kg/year; P =.05). Conclusions: This is the first low-dose, PK-guided, EHL FVIII prophylaxis clinical study in Thailand. Benefits and practicability of this personalized regimen may support the implementation of regular FVIII prophylaxis in developing countries with budget constraints.

Methods: At 60-<90, 90-<120, or 120-180 days intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac, participants were randomized to full-dose or half-dose AZD1222 or BNT162b2, followed up at day 28, 60, and 90. Vaccination-induced immune responses to Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 strains were evaluated by antispike, pseudovirus, and microneutralization and T cell assays. Descriptive statistics and noninferiority cut-offs were reported as geometric mean concentration or titer and concentration or titer ratios comparing baseline to day 28 and day 90 and different intervals. Results: No safety concerns were detected. All assays and intervals showed noninferior immunogenicity between full doses and half doses. However, full-dose vaccines and/or longer 120-180-day intervals substantially improved the immunogenicity (measured by antispike or measured by pseudotyped virus neutralizing titers 50; P <0.001). Seroconversion rates were over 90% against the SARS-CoV-2 strains by all assays. Immunogenicity waned more quickly with half doses than full doses but remained high against the Ancestral or Delta strains. Against Omicron, the day 28 immunogenicity increased with longer intervals than shorter intervals for full-dose vaccines. Conclusion: Immune responses after day 28 when boosting at longer intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac was optimal.

The present study investigated the influence of Tideglusib on human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC) proliferation, apoptosis, migration and odonto/osteogenic differentiation. Methodology: hDPSCs were treated with 50, 100 nM or 200 nM Tideglusib. β-catenin accumulation was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Colony-forming unit ability was assessed by staining with Coomassie blue. Cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Cell migration was examined using an in vitro wound-healing assay. Osteogenic differentiation was examined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red S staining and osteogenic-related gene expression. The gene expression profile was examined using a high-throughput RNA sequencing technique. All experiments were repeated using cells derived from at least four different donors (n = 4). The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to identify significant differences between two independent group comparisons. For three or more group comparisons, statistical differences were assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison. The significance level was set at 5% (p <.05). Results: Tideglusib activated the Wnt signalling pathway in hDPSCs as demonstrated by an increase in cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. Tideglusib did not affect hDPSC proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis or cell migration. In contrast, 50 and 100 nM Tideglusib significantly enhanced mineralization and osteogenic marker gene expression (RUNX2, ALP, BMP2 and DSPP; p <.05). Conclusions: Tideglusib enhanced the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. Therefore, incorporating this bioactive molecule in a pulp-capping material could be a promising strategy to promote dentine repair.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

These phytoestrogens are well known; however, their biosynthetic genes remain largely uncharacterized. Cytochrome P450 (P450) is a large protein family that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of various compounds in plants, including phytoestrogens. Thus, we focused on P450s involved in the isoflavone hydroxylation that potentially participates in the biosynthesis of miroestrol. Three candidate P450s were isolated from the transcriptome libraries by considering the phylogenetic and expression data of each tissue of P. mirifica. The candidate P450s were functionally characterized both in vitro and in planta. Accordingly, the yeast microsome harboring PmCYP81E63 regiospecifically exhibited either 2′ or 3′ daidzein hydroxylation and genistein hydroxylation. Based on in silico calculation, PmCYP81E63 had higher binding energy with daidzein than with genistein, which supported the in vitro result of the isoflavone specificity. To confirm in planta function, the candidate P450s were then transiently co-expressed with isoflavone-related genes in Nicotiana benthamiana. Despite no daidzein in the infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves, genistein and hydroxygenistein biosynthesis were detectable by liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Additionally, we demonstrated that PmCYP81E63 interacted with several enzymes related to isoflavone biosynthesis using bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies and a yeast two-hybrid analysis, suggesting a scheme of metabolon formation in the pathway.

Methods: The study included 48 eyes of 48 subjects (14 healthy, 19 glaucomatous, and 15 non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy). Each participant was scanned using four OCTA devices in a random sequence: RTVue XR Avanti (RTVue), DRI OCT Triton (Triton), Revo NX 130 (Revo), and PLEX Elite 9000 (PlexE). All 6 × 6-mm grayscale OCTA images from each device were analyzed for RPC density using a customized algorithm. Agreement between each pair of devices was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland–Altman plots. Results: There was a poor correlation between devices in all comparisons (RTVue–Triton, ICC = 0.34; RTVue–Revo, ICC = 0.31; RTVue–PlexE, ICC = 0.28; Triton–Revo, ICC = 0.31; Triton–PlexE, ICC = 0.17; Revo–PlexE, ICC = 0.34). Significant proportional biases (P < 0.05) and wide limits of agreement with apparent constant biases were identified in all comparisons. The mean difference was greatest for the RTVue–Revo pair (−49.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −52.9 to −45.8) and smallest for the Triton–PlexE pair (−7.7%; 95% CI, −10.1 to −5.3). Conclusions: The RPC densities obtained from each device had poor inter-device agreement and significant biases and cannot be used interchangeably. Translational Relevance: RPC density obtained from different OCTA devices is not interchangeable; thus, the progression of optic neuropathy should be monitored using the same OCTA device.","engineering, medical","Biomedical Engineering, Ophthalmology"
3D-printed polyacrylamide-based hydrogel polymer electrolytes for flexible zinc-ion battery,"Poompiew N., Jirawatanaporn N., Okhawilai M., Qin J., Roman A.J., Aumnate C., Osswald T.A., Potiyaraj P.",2023-10-20,"3-D printing, 3D-printing, Electrical energy storages, Gel polymer electrolytes, Hydrogel polymers, Ion batteries, Photo polymerization, Polymer electrolyte, Zinc battery, Zinc ions, 3D printing, Electrical energy storage, Gel polymer electrolyte, Photopolymerization, Zinc battery","Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are a highly cost-effective and safe option for electrochemical energy storage, particularly suited for flexible wearable devices. However, the development of hydrogel polymer electrolytes (HPEs) for ZIBs using 3D printing technology presents challenges in terms of performance, stability, and durability. The purpose of this study is to address these challenges by creating 3D-printed flexible HPEs with varying porosity from polyacrylamide (PAM) using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. The electrochemical properties of the 3D-printed HPEs were compared to conventional casted HPEs. The 3D printed HPEs exhibited improved electrochemical performance, especially in ionic conductivity (28.10 mS cm−1, equivalent to the current conventional HPEs). Higher porosity in the 3D printed HPEs enhanced electrolyte absorption and facilitated Zn2+ ions diffusion, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results. Furthermore, galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements demonstrated that the 3D-printed PAM hydrogel electrolyte with 40% porosity achieved a specific capacity of 161.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The findings validate the potential of the 3D-printed PAM hydrogel as a flexible HPE for ZIBs. The customized design structure of the 3D-printed HPEs enabled improved electrochemical properties, surpassing the limitations of conventional casted HPEs.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Electrochemistry"
Association between oral hypofunction and general health: a systematic review,"Limpuangthip N., Komin O.",2023-12-01,"Aged, Cognitive Dysfunction, Databases, Factual, Frailty, Health Status, Humans, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Cognitive impairment, Mastication, Oral function, Physical activity, Social activity, Swallowing","Background: Oral hypofunction comprises 7 oral function conditions, including mastication, swallowing, pronouncing, oral hygiene, and oral dryness. However, it remains unresolved whether having oral hypofunction and each individual condition adversely affect general health. This study aimed to investigate the association between oral hypofunction and general health, encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions. Methods: Oral hypofunction was diagnosed following the criteria proposed by the 2016 Japan Society of Gerodontology, comprising 7 oral function conditions. Oral hypofunction was diagnosed when at least 3 conditions presented. The selected studies eligible for reviewing were based on the PI(E)CO criteria: P (population), adult and older adults; I/E (intervention/exposure), having oral hypofunction by considering overall and individual 7 oral function conditions; C (comparator), not having oral hypofunction; O (outcome), the general health status, encompassing physical, psychological, and social dimensions. Electronic search limited to English articles was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases from January 2016 to June 2023. The included studies were assessed for quaility and risk of bias using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Qualitative analyses were performed on the general outcome, and having oral hypofunction considering overall and individual oral function conditions. Results: Ten studies were included in the final syntheses. One was a prospective cohort, one was a case-control, and the others were cross-sectional studies. All included studies were high quality. General health outcomes were mostly frailty, sarcopenia, and malnutrition, whereas mild cognitive impairment,social withdrawal, and gastric cancer prognosis were identified in one of the included studies. The association between general health and having oral hypofunction was stronger than when considering an individual condition. The health outcomes were predominantly associated with mastication and swallowing, whereas their relationships with oral hygiene and dryness were less likely to be reported. Conclusions: The present review found an association between the presence of oral hypofunction and impaired general health. However, the specific impact on individual physical, psychological, and social dimensions cannot be distinctly delineated. Further prospective studies are required to clarify the causal-effect relationship between oral and general health.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

In this study, we co-encapsulated metformin (Met) and curcumin (Cur) into chitosan/alginate (CTS/ALG) nanoparticles (NPs) at their synergistic drug ratio by applying response surface methodology. The optimized Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs were achieved with Pluronic® F-127 2.33 % (w/v), Met 5.91 mg, and CTS:ALG mass ratio 0.05:1. The prepared Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs had 243 nm particle size, −21.6 mV zeta potential, 32.6 and 44.2 % Met and Cur encapsulations, 19.6 and 6.8 % Met and Cur loading, respectively, and 2.9:1 Met:Cur mass ratio. Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs displayed stability under simulated gastrointestinal (GI) fluid conditions and during storage. In vitro release study of Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs in simulated GI fluids showed sustained release, with Met exhibiting Fickian diffusion and Cur demonstrating non-Fickian diffusion following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs exhibited increased mucoadhesion and improved cellular uptake in Caco-2 cells. Additionally, Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs exhibited better anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage and BV-2 microglial cells than the equivalent amount of the Met-Cur physical mixture, indicating a greater ability to modulate peripheral and central immune mechanisms of pain. In the mouse formalin-induced pain model, Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs administered orally exhibited better attenuation of pain-like behaviors and proinflammatory cytokine release compared to the Met-Cur physical mixture. Furthermore, Met-Cur-CTS/ALG-NPs did not induce significant side effects in mice at therapeutic doses. Altogether, the present study establishes a CTS/ALG nano-delivery system for Met-Cur combination against pain with improved efficacy and safety.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science
Determinants of Ride-Hailing Applications Adoption: How Travelers’ Characteristics and Attitudes Affect the Adoption of New Online Mobility Platforms in Bangkok?,"Laosinwattana W., Thaithatkul P., Chalermpong S.",2023-01-01,"Bangkok, Individual mobility, Mobility platform, Mobility systems, Questionnaire surveys, Ride-hailing application, Ride-sourcing service, Travel demand, Travel modes, Urban mobility, Individual mobility, Ride-hailing applications, Ride-sourcing services, Urban mobility","As Bangkok expanded and urbanized over the past decades, the population and travel demand have increased rapidly. Urban mobility such as ride-hailing applications (RHAs) has become a popular alternative travel mode in Bangkok. Knowledge of these services, therefore, becomes more important for a sustainable development of an urban mobility system. In this paper, the factors affecting the adoption of ride-hailing services were investigated by observing the use of RHAs through the questionnaire survey in Bangkok. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the influence of socio-demographic variables, socioeconomic variables, and attitudes toward RHAs adoption. This study revealed that RHAs users are young adults, have high income, and are using a smartphone for a long time. RHAs were mostly used for personal business and meeting friends. This study also showed that RHAs users are the same pool of demand for taxis. In other words, RHAs were likely to substitute taxis. Therefore, RHAs regulations are required in order to keep the fair competition between RHAs and taxis.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

We performed a pooled analysis of virologically suppressed Asian participants from three international phase III trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to B/F/TAF. Methods: Virologically suppressed people living with HIV were randomized to switch to B/F/TAF or to stay on baseline regimens. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/ml at week 48. We analysed the incidence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory abnormalities, and changes in relevant tolerability parameters through 48 weeks. Results: Overall, 136 Asian participants were included. The proportions of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/ml at week 48 were low in both arms (0% for B/F/TAF vs 1.4% for those who stayed on baseline regimens). Those who switched to B/F/TAF had virological suppression rates similar to those who stayed on baseline regimens (100% vs 95.9%, p = 0.2485), with no treatment-emergent resistance. Drug-related AEs occurred in three participants in each arm; none were serious. No participants discontinued the study drug because of AEs, and no deaths were observed. No significant differences were observed between the arms in the median changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, body weight, and most lipid parameters. Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing regimens to B/F/TAF resulted in a significant decrease in tubular proteinuria compared with those who stayed on baseline regimens (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Virologically suppressed Asian people living with HIV who switched to B/F/TAF maintained 100% virological suppression at week 48, with no treatment-emergent drug resistance and safety profiles comparable to those seen in people who stayed on baseline regimens.

Real-Time Identification of Malignant Biliary Strictures on Cholangioscopy Images Using Explainable Convolutional Neural Networks With Heatmaps,"Phuangthongkham P., Angsuwatcharakon P., Kulpatcharapong S., Vateekul P., Rerknimitr R.",2023-01-01,"Cancer, Convolutional neural network, Deep learning, Explainable deep learning, Images classification, Indeterminate biliary stricture, Real - Time system, Real time images, Real-time image classification, Real-time images, Task analysis, Deep learning, explainable deep learning, indeterminate biliary strictures, real-time image classification","Determination of benign or malignant etiology of bile duct strictures is difficult. Currently, a digital single-operator cholangioscopy allows endoscopists to examine the bile duct with greater accuracy. Consequently, lesions in the bile duct can be detected directly with their own eyes. However, there is still inconsistency of diagnosis among endoscopists. Therefore, a biopsy is usually considered as a gold standard. Thus, pieces of tissue are taken from the bile duct and undergo examination. A false negative of cancer diagnosis from a sampling error of biopsy leads to the need to repeat procedures. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network specifically designed for classifying malignant biliary strictures in real-time. In our development, this model can generate output not only for classification but also for a class activation map, which relies solely on an image-level label rather than annotation position. The model mainly focuses on tissues, not on equipment e.g. guide wire. To increase the number of cholangioscopy images, and solve the issue of equipment, 'a guide-wire augmentation' is invented. To employ a video inference, our model for still images is further modified. In our experiment, all models are run on 3 patient-based bootstraps. The data contains 104 patients' records collected at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital with 885 images: 447 malignant and 438 benign images. The model's performance for still images is 0.8577 and 0.8395 in terms of sensitivity and F1, respectively. With our video inference algorithm, the sensitivity of the model attains 0.9024 and the F1-score achieves 0.9193. Finally, the model can facilitate real-time inference with a speed of 83 frames per second.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

Here, a new sensitive nanocomposite (Ti3C2Tx-MXene) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) ratiometric electrochemical sensor coupled with an intrinsic built-in-correction has been developed through incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to enhance conduction and methylene blue (MB) as an internal reference. Analysis of the electrochemical properties by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and adsorptive stripping differential pulse voltammetry (AdSDPV) showed an excellent electrocatalytic response for the anticancer agent mitoxantrone (MIT), even in serum and urine samples, in the linear range between 3.0 nM and 11.0 µM with a limit of detection as low as 79.15 pM, a rapid response of less than 120 s, and good anti-interference ability against multiple co-existing compounds. Additionally, no deterioration in sensitivity was observed in one month due to the strong adsorption capability of MXene towards the inner reference MB. However, GCE-modified electrodes have certain limitations, such as complicated setup and handling, electroactive material fouling, and extensive requirements for electrode washings, which cause these studies to be confined to laboratories and are not suitable for in-field use. To assist in point-of-care testing, we developed a portable, smartphone-compatible ratiometric sensor by depositing MB/Ti3C2Tx/MWCNTs on a paper substrate, which allowed the sensitive detection of MIT in serum and urine samples. The performances of GCE-modified and paper-based sensors were compared, and the advantages and disadvantages of each were discussed.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Instrumentation, Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Materials Chemistry"

We demonstrated the efficacy of such Coatsome-replicon vehicles for RepRNA-mediated induction of CD8 T-cell responses in mice. Moreover, we provide new insights on physical properties of the RepRNA, showing that the removal of all CSFV structural protein genes has a positive effect on the translation of the GOI. Finally, we successfully engineered RepRNA constructs encoding a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antigen, providing an example of antigen expression with potential application to combat viral diseases.

With the broad beamwidth of PCB-based metasurfaces, the dimension tolerance of PCB manufacturing can be traded off between cost benefits and key communications performance. From our numerical results based on full-wave simulations, the received power at the design anomalous angle is not significantly affected by the geometrical precision while high errors can cause higher interference at specular and mirror angles.

The tunable phase separation behavior of MEA-based biphasic absorbents can be achieved by adjusting the mass concentration ratio of solvent and water, and the CO2 loading of phase separation point was much more impacted by the effect of the carbon chain length than that of isomerism. The intermolecular interactions between species in solutions before and after CO2 absorption were analyzed by the classical molecular dynamics simulations and independent gradient model analysis. Based on the experimental and computational results, the fundamental mechanism of phase separation was elucidated, which is related to the broken of hydrogen bonds between solvent with H2O or MEA, and the enhanced interaction among MEACOO−, MEAH+ and H2O.

The prepared BGS composites are utilized sustainably using solar light as the energy source for the continuous flow of photodegradation of tetracycline (TC) antibiotics. This work highlights that the photocatalysts preparation was carried out with an eco-friendly strategy, solvent-free and without additional reagents. To alter the amount of boron quantity (0.124 g, 0.248 g, and 0.49 g) have to prepare three different composites using a similar procedure, the obtained composites viz., BGS-1, BGS-2 and BGS-3, respectively. The physicochemical property of the prepared composites was investigated by X-ray diffractometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman, Diffraction reflectance spectra, Photoluminescence, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results shows that 0.24 g boron- loaded BGS composites degrade TC up to 93.74%, which is much higher than the rest of the catalyst. The addition of mesoporous SBA-15 incresed the specific surface area of the g-CN, and heteroatom of boron increased the interplanar stracking distance of g-CN, enlarged the optical absorption range, reducing the energy bandgap and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TC. Additionally, the stability and recycling efficiency of the representative photocatalysts viz., BGS-2 was observed to be good even at the fifth cycle. The photocatalytic process using the BGS composites demonstrated to be capable candidate for the removal of tetracycline biowaste from aquesous media.","geobase; related topics, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

From the perspective of environment conservation and sustainability, conscientious applications of materials with none/minimal deleterious effects on the human ecosystem are being pushed to the front burner. In this wise, nanocellulose materials or simply cellulose in nanostructured form have become green materials of huge interest owing to their intrinsic physicochemical properties. High aspect ratio, mechanical ruggedness, biocompatibility, non-toxic, high availability, and their multitudinous hydroxyl groups which can be easily tuned through various chemical reactions present nanocellulose as an attractive substrate for modern applications. In this chapter, we will present nanocellulose materials and composites for emerging applications. We started the chapter with a brief classification of nanocellulose materials into nanofibers and nanostructured materials. The nanofibers comprise cellulose nanofibrils, cellulose nanocrystal, and bacterial cellulose, while the nanostructured materials are made up of cellulose microcrystals or microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose microfibrils. A brief explanation on the preparation methods, properties, challenges, etc., encountered toward full exploitation of these materials is further provided. We showcased a gamut of areas, with huge applications of nanocellulose materials in modern technology, including formulation of stable Pickering emulsions, composites with Metal nanoparticles (MNPs), and application in anti-cancer, anti-fungal and antibacterial agents, film packaging materials fabrication, water purification, in electrospinning for sustainable fabrication of processable nanofibrous membranes and, finally, in biomedicine (wound healing and medical implant application).","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

Nevertheless, manually bent reconstruction plates and miniplates could be applied in limited defects with caution.",medical,"Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"
Effect of mixed light emitting diode spectrum on antioxidants content and antioxidant activity of red lettuce grown in a closed soilless system,"Sawatdee S., Jarunglumlert T., Pavasant P., Sakihama Y., Flood A.E., Prommuak C.",2023-12-01,"Antioxidants, Lettuce, Light, Photosynthesis, Vegetables, Antioxidant enzymes, Continuous light, Hydroponic cultivation, Light spectrum, Molecular antioxidants, Phenolics productivity","Background: Light spectra have been demonstrated to result in different levels of comfort or stress, which affect plant growth and the availability of health-promoting compounds in ways that sometimes contradict one another. To determine the optimal light conditions, it is necessary to weigh the vegetable’s mass against the amount of nutrients it contains, as vegetables tend to grow poorly in environments where nutrient synthesis is optimal. This study investigates the effects of varying light conditions on the growth of red lettuce and its occurring nutrients in terms of productivities, which were determined by multiplying the total weight of the harvested vegetables by their nutrient content, particularly phenolics. Three different light-emitting diode (LED) spectral mixes, including blue, green, and red, which were all supplemented by white, denoted as BW, GW, and RW, respectively, as well as the standard white as the control, were equipped in grow tents with soilless cultivation systems for such purposes. Results: Results demonstrated that the biomass and fiber content did not differ substantially across treatments. This could be due to the use of a modest amount of broad-spectrum white LEDs, which could help retain the lettuce’s core qualities. However, the concentrations of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity in lettuce grown with the BW treatment were the highest (1.3 and 1.4-fold higher than those obtained from the control, respectively), with chlorogenic acid accumulation (8.4 ± 1.5 mg g− 1 DW) being particularly notable. Meanwhile, the study observed a high glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the plant achieved from the RW treatment, which in this study was deemed the poorest treatment in terms of phenolics accumulation. Conclusion: In this study, the BW treatment provided the most efficient mixed light spectrum to stimulate phenolics productivity in red lettuce without a significant detrimental effect on other key properties.",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Plant Science
The free swell potential of expansive clays stabilized with the shallow bottom ash mixing method,"Jamsawang P., Adulyamet B., Voottipruex P., Jongpradist P., Likitlersuang S., Tantayopin K.",2023-03-20,"Bottom ash, Clay stabilization, Expansive clays, Free swell, Mixing method, Potential values, Shallow mixing, Stabiliser, Swell potential, Thickness ratio, Bottom ash, Clay stabilization, Composite, Expansive clay, Shallow mixing, Swell potential","An expansive clay is considered a geological material and classified as problematic soil because its high free swell potential (FSP) after water absorption often damages light buildings or structures. Stabilizers such as cement and lime have been extensively used to improve the swelling characteristics of expansive clays. Bottom ash (BTA), a waste material obtained from coal lignite electric power plants, is considered a noncohesive coarse-grained soil without undesirable swelling characteristics. Thus, BTA can be applied as a suitable alternative stabilizer in cost-effectiveness and waste management to reduce the FSP of expansive clays. This paper investigates the FSP of expansive clays partially replaced with BTA by the shallow mixing method, which creates composite materials with a reduced FSP. FSP tests were performed on conventional and composite expansive clay samples using kaolin-bentonite mixtures with low to very high FSP levels to determine the optimal BTA content and study the effect of the stabilized thickness ratio (STR) on the FSP. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques were applied to analyze the microstructural and mineral changes in the samples. Finally, FSP tests were conducted on natural expansive clay layers using six full-scale test sections to study the influence of STR on the field FSP. The main results show that when stabilized at the optimal BTA content, the montmorillonite reflection intensity and sodium (Na) amount of the stabilized expansive clay mixtures decreased, while the calcium (Ca) amount increased. This phenomenon was caused by the replacement of Na in montmorillonite with Ca in BTA, resulting in decreasing FSP values. A correlation was proposed between the FSP and STR of the composite samples based on the laboratory tests. However, such correlation overestimated the FSP values of the full-scale tests due to the effect of the overburden pressure caused by the actual thickness of the stabilized layer under field conditions. Hence, a modification factor related to increasing the overburden pressure induced by the upper stabilized layer was included in the correlation to derive an accurate prediction of the field FSP values.","mixing and separation, earth sciences","Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Geology"

The primary target of SISR is to recover the visually appealing high-resolution (HR) output image from the original degraded low-resolution (LR) input image. However, most recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based image super-resolution frameworks often used a deeper and broader network architecture that requires a sizeable computational resource, risk of overfitting, increases computational complexity, and more memory consumption, as well as takes more processing time during the evaluations. To address these issues, we have presented a Squeeze-and-ExcitationNext for Single Image Super-Resolution approach, known as SENext. In brief, the squeeze-and-excitation blocks (SEB) are used in our network architecture with a view to reduce the computational cost and adopt the channel-wise feature mappings to recalibrate the features adaptively. Furthermore, local, sub-local, and global skip connections are employed between each SEB to enable the feature reusability and stabilize training convergence smoothly. Instead of hand-designed bicubic upsampling at pre-processing step, we have performed post-upsampling at the later stage to reconstruct the high-resolution image. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are performed on the benchmark test dataset, including Set5, Set14, BSDS100, Urban100, and Manga109. These experimental evaluations validate the superiority of the SENext over other deep CNN image SR methods in terms of PSNR/SSIM, FLOPs, Number of parameters, processing speed, and visually pleasing effect.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

When exposed to Cu2+ ions in an aqueous environment even in presence of other cations, the probe BMIP exhibited striking color changes via a fluorescence-off process only for Cu2+ ions. The detection limit of Cu2+ was found to be 7.84 nM with response time as low as 10 s. In addition, BMIP-Cu2+ was found to be a reversible sensor with the addition of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Experiments with test strips and with real water samples showed that the probe BMIP holds promise for identification of environmental ions. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations with the Gaussian 16 software were employed to examine the BMIP sensing mechanism. The experimental findings were theoretically validated by DFT calculations. The application of BMIP as a Cu2+ sensor has been extended to live cell and fingerprint imaging.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Materials Chemistry"
Stigmasterol isolated from Azadirachta indica flowers attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity via downregulation of the Cdk5/p35/p25 signaling pathway in the HT-22 cells,"Mongkolpobsin K., Sillapachaiyaporn C., Nilkhet S., Tencomnao T., Baek S.J.",2023-05-01,"Azadirachta, Down-Regulation, Flowers, Glutamic Acid, Humans, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Neurons, Neuroprotective Agents, Phosphorylation, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction, Stigmasterol, tau Proteins, Water, Cdk5/p35/p25 signaling pathway, Glutamate, Neuronal apoptosis, Soybean polysaccharides with chitosan, Stigmasterol","Background: Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, was elevated in the brain of neurodegenerative disease (ND) patients. The excessive glutamate induces Ca2+ influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which exacerbates mitochondrial function, leading to mitophagy aberration, and hyperactivates Cdk5/p35/p25 signaling leading to neurotoxicity in ND. Stigmasterol, a phytosterol, has been reported for its neuroprotective effects; however, the underlying mechanism of stigmasterol on restoring glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is not fully investigated. Purpose: We investigated the effect of stigmasterol, a compound isolated from Azadirachta indica (AI) flowers, on ameliorating glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis in the HT-22 cells. Study design: To further understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of stigmasterol, we investigated the effect of stigmasterol on Cdk5 expression, which was aberrantly expressed in glutamate-treated cells. Cell viability, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence are employed. Results: Stigmasterol significantly inhibited glutamate-induced neuronal cell death via attenuating ROS production, recovering mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and ameliorating mitophagy aberration by decreasing mitochondria/lysosome fusion and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. In addition, stigmasterol treatment downregulated glutamate-induced Cdk5, p35, and p25 expression via enhancement of Cdk5 degradation and Akt phosphorylation. Although stigmasterol demonstrated neuroprotective effects on inhibiting glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, the efficiency of stigmasterol is limited due to its poor water solubility. We conjugated stigmasterol to soluble soybean polysaccharides with chitosan nanoparticles to overcome the limitations. We found that the encapsulated stigmasterol increased water solubility and enhanced the protective effect on attenuating the Cdk5/p35/p25 signaling pathway compared with free stigmasterol. Conclusion: Our findings illustrate the neuroprotective effect and the improved utility of stigmasterol in inhibiting glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.","biochemistryistry, pharmacology, medical","Molecular Medicine, Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Complementary and Alternative Medicine"

A shortened version of the Oral Impact on Daily Performances (OIDP) might be more practical and feasible in clinical setting due to the busy nature of oral medicine clinics and staff availability to conduct the interview for data collection. The aim of the study was to develop a Thai version of shortened OIDP for assessing the OHRQoL in OLP patients. Methods: Two types of shortened OIDP versions were tested in 69 OLP patients, one comprising the most commonly interfered with daily performances (OIDP-3 and OIDP-2) and another comprising either the highest frequency (OIDP frequency) or severity score (OIDP severity). The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Thongprasom sign score were used to assess oral pain and clinical severity. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients (rs) were used to demonstrate the associations between the shortened and original OIDP, pain, and clinical severity. Results: OIDP-3 (Eating, Cleaning, and Emotional stability) and OIDP-2 (Eating and Emotional stability) were developed. The associations of the original OIDP with OIDP-3 and OIDP-2 (rs = 0.965 and 0.911) were significantly higher than those of the original OIDP with OIDP frequency and OIDP severity (rs = 0.768 and 0.880). The original OIDP, OIDP-3, and OIDP-2 were more significantly associated with pain compared with OIDP frequency and OIDP severity. The association between the clinical severity and oral impacts assessed by the original OIDP, OIDP-3, and OIDP-2 were similar and had higher correlation coefficients compared with those of OIDP frequency and OIDP severity. Conclusion: OIDP-3 and OIDP-2 performed more similarly to the original OIDP than OIDP frequency and OIDP severity in assessing the OHRQoL of OLP patients.

Although the PC sleepers are durable under harsh environmental conditions, frequent cracks can be found hindering the railway's capacities. This article investigates an improvement of placing steel stirrups in shear deficient PC sleepers commonly used in railways of Thailand. PC sleepers with a cross-section of 258 × 205 mm2 varied with five different stirrup's ratios were tested under a three-pointed bending load to observe the improvement of shear resistance. From the experimental results, the peak load of PC sleepers with stirrups can be enhanced from 14.1% to 21.2%, whilst the failure deformation can also be enhanced from 87.5% to 176.6%, compared with PC sleeper without any stirrup. With increasing stirrup's ratio, failure modes of PC sleepers were shifted from brittle shear to ductile flexural failures. Moreover, the PC sleepers with deformed-bar stirrups exhibited better bond interfaces than that with rounded-bar. Then, the proper stirrup's ratio and type of steel stirrups are recommended to enhance the shear resistance of the PC sleeper. In addition, a finite element analysis results based on advanced constitutive models and the fixed-cracking approach showed good agreement with the results from experiment.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Civil and Structural Engineering, Building and Construction, Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials"

We assessed the impact of PPE on verbal communication in a simulated operating room and evaluated use of an audio communication device. Methodology Frontline health professionals across specialties including surgery, anesthetics, and nursing undertook speech discrimination testing with and without standardized levels of PPE in a simulated operating room environment. Background noise (30- and 70-a-weighted decibel multitalker babble) at 2 distances (2 and 4 m) were selected representative of operating room environments. Bamford-Kowal-Bench (BKB) scoring (192 sentences per participant) was performed. A Digital Multichannel Transceiver System (DMTS) was evaluated. We assessed the effects of PPE use, distance, and use of the DMTS with pairwise comparisons, using a Bonferroni correction, and assessed participant experience via Likert scales. Results Thirty-one healthcare professionals were tested. Without PPE in 70-a-weighted decibel ""babble,""median BKB sentence scores were 90% and 76% at 2 and 4 m (adjusted P < 0.0005). The median BKB sentence scores dropped to 8% and 4% at 2 and 4 m in PPE (adjusted P < 0.0005). Improved speech discrimination was achieved with DMTS use to 70% and 76% at 2 and 4 m. Personal protective equipment led to a statistically significant reduction in BKB scores across all conditions compared with baseline. Overall participant confidence in PPE clinical communication was low. Conclusions Addition of PPE dramatically impairs speech discrimination and communication in high levels of background noise characteristic of clinical environments, which can be significantly improved using DMTS. Measures should be taken by teams through both through reduction of background noise and consideration of assistive technologies maximizing patient safety. This may be further rehearsed in a simulation environment.","medical, sociology, Mathematics","Epidemiology, Medicine (miscellaneous), Education, Modeling and Simulation"

Several of these studies have suggested that aldosterone inhibition may lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of 4 weeks of maximally tolerated mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy with eplerenone on PTH levels in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) when compared to amiloride and placebo. We also investigated the synergistic effect of these interventions when combined with cinacalcet for an additional 2 weeks. Design: Randomized, double-blinded, three parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. Patients: Patients with P-HPT. Results: Most patients were women (83%) and White (76%). Maximally tolerated doses of eplerenone and amiloride induced significant reductions in blood pressure and increases in renin and aldosterone production; however, despite these physiologic changes, neither intervention induced significant changes in PTH or calcium levels when compared to the placebo. Both eplerenone and amiloride therapy induced significant reductions in procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide levels when compared to placebo. When cinacalcet therapy was added, PTH and calcium levels were markedly reduced in all groups; however, there was no significant difference in PTH or serum calcium reductions between groups. Conclusions: Although maximally tolerated therapy with eplerenone and amiloride induced expected changes in renin, aldosterone and blood pressure, there were no meaningful changes in PTH or serum calcium levels in P-HPT patients. These results suggest that inhibition of aldosterone action does not have a clinically meaningful role in medical therapy for P-HPT.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Endocrinology"

In this study, we developed a high-resolution bacterial cytological profiling method that can capture morphological variations of bacteria upon antibiotic treatment. With an unprecedented single-cell resolution, this method classifies morphological changes of individual cells into known MOAs with an overall accuracy above 90%. We next showed that combinations of two antibiotics induce altered cell morphologies that are either unique or similar to that of an antibiotic in the combinations. With these combinatorial profiles, this method successfully revealed multiple cytological changes caused by a natural product-derived compound that, by itself, is inactive against Acinetobacter baumannii but synergistically exerts its multiple antibacterial activities in the presence of colistin.

However, their flexibility is associated with undesired vibrations, making accurate positioning challenging. As most of the existing controllers are model-based, their performances are affected by uncertainties and often require the feedback of all the states. This makes such control challenging and expensive. Interestingly, despite its poor position tracking, the input shaping control (ISC) proved to be effective in oscillation suppression of flexible structures. In this paper, precise automation of the FLM is presented by hybridizing an improved input shaping control (iISC) with a model-free fuzzy logic control (FLC), and the model-based sliding mode control (SMC). The single feedback FLC, and SMC were designed for the position control while the iISC provided the tip deflection control. Three parameters of the FLM, namely, the length, mass, and spring stiffness of the link were used to assess the sensitivity of the controllers. With the maximum velocity of 94 deg/s and the maximum r.m.s of 0.33 deg, ISC+FLC has increased the velocity of the iISC by at least 77% and improved the poor oscillation suppression of the FLC by at least 64%. Thus, the analysis demonstrated that the iISC+FLC could provide precise automation of the FLM by measuring the output of only one state (position), making it cost-effective and reduces the complexity and computation time of the full-state feedback controllers.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The microencapsulated bacterial spores were employed as an additive substance at ratios of 0%, 0.5%, and 1% by weight of cement. Specimens were kept in a climate-controlled room after casting to induce shrinkage crack. Crystalline phases formed in the specimen were identified using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS) method was used to investigate the morphology of precipitated calcite (CaCO3) crystals. Additionally, the specimen's permeability and compressive strength were also determined. When the bacterial spores were added to produce MICP procedure, the results demonstrated that it was successful in healing the shrinkage cracking. Within three days, the specimen with 1% spores could completely seal the shrinkage crack. According to the XRD patterns, the CaCO3 crystals appeared to promote the production of the calcite phase. Based on SEM/EDS investigation, the MICP process leads to concentrations of calcite crystal in certain regions, especially at the top surface of the crack. The 28-day compressive strength, on the other hand, decreased, owing to the addition of nutrients.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science","Ceramics and Composites, Biomaterials, Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Metals and Alloys"

The results demonstrated a higher level of serum AMH in the cryptorchid group compared to the intact group (P < 0.01), while serum AMH levels of all castrated dogs were below the limit of detection (<0.05 ng/mL). Moreover, the percentage of positive AMH immunostaining of the intact group was less than that of the cryptorchid group (P < 0.01). A significantly positive correlation was found between serum AMH concentration and localization in testicular tissues (r = 0.93, P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that AMH levels in the peripheral blood could be used as an alternative and rapid screening method for detecting dogs with abdominal cryptorchidism.","Veterinary Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Small Animals, Food Animals, Animal Science and Zoology, Equine"
Motivation and Quality of Work Life of In-Home Paid Caregivers of Older Adults,"Tangchitnusorn K., Prachuabmoh V.",2023-04-01,"Aged, Caregivers, Female, Home Care Services, Humans, Long-Term Care, Motivation, Thailand, caregiving, home care, paid caregiver, population aging, qualitative methods",Hiring in-home paid caregivers (IPCs) to tend to older adults at home has been one of the popular long-term care strategies in several urban aging societies. Relevant studies in the Global South that provide empirical findings have been lacking. This study contributes to the literature on home care by conducting a qualitative analysis of work motivation and the quality of work life of female IPCs in Thailand. We found that work motivation involved the desire for personal economic improvement and the search for an emotional anchor. Analysis of quality of work life pointed to three major themes: great contribution but low recognition and support; interdependence as an ultimate career goal; and effective training as a key to opportunity and success. We proposed a theoretical extension to the existing care theories and suggested necessary policy interventions to sustain the supply of IPCs.,"Nursing, medical","Gerontology, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

The influence of niobium precursor concentration and the electrolyte temperature on the electrochemical, morphological, and compositional responses are investigated using chemometric tools. The experimental design provides a geometrical representation of experimental parameters and shows the effect of the anodizing conditions on the pore density and the anodization curves. The samples are prepared at a constant current (10 mA cm−2) under the PEO regime. The coatings reveal a porous structure and crystalline phases of Nb2O5 and γ-Al2O3. A preliminary photodegradation test under UV radiation and utilizing Rhodamine B (RhB) solution shows the best photocatalytic performance for the sample produced by the highest Nb salt concentration (16.0 g L−1) and highest temperature (18.7 °C). These results are attributed to a higher niobium content in this sample and crystalline phases of Nb2O5 over the Al substrate.","corrosion, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

To explain a viable reaction mechanism for the 2760 ± 10 % μmol.gcat-1.hr-1 production rate achieved in a continuous reaction system, several theoretical models were developed. According to DFT simulation results, oxygen vacancy might be regarded as the main reaction site for CO2 to CO conversion. Moreover, a viable reaction pathway leading to CH4 formation is proposed. The catalyst's lower rate of CO2 reduction in the batch reactor as compared with the flow reactor was justified via surface affinity simulation.

The properties and synthesis of anodized TNA films are well-established in the literature. Contrary to the dye-sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical water-splitting, photocatalysts, biosensors, and implant applications, where they are widely explored, TNAs are still in the exploratory stage in fuel cells. The precise morphology control by the anodizing conditions, high surface area, low cost, chemical stability, and unidirectional orientation are their attractive properties. TNA-based electrodes have been explored mainly as bioanodes in conventional MFCs, and photoanodes in hybrid MFC systems and evaluated in terms of power and current generation and compared with Ti and carbon-based electrodes. The effects of nanotubular morphology, heat treatment conditions, and surface modification of TNA electrodes are addressed. Its utilization as a photoanode in photo-assisted MFCs is discussed as the strategies for improving MFC performance and turning it cost-effective by coupling other functions, like H2 production and CO2 conversion.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, energy, chemistry, engineering","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Subsequently, column chromatography was carried out to determine the effects of purification conditions such as the amount of and particle sizes of the sample silica gel, and elution modes, on the percentage of γ-oryzanol yield and recovery. The results from the TLC suggested that 75:25 (v/v) hexane to ethyl acetate mixture was a suitable mobile phase. The semi-chromatographic results indicated that the column containing 10 g of 25-40 μm silica gel with isocratic elution gave the highest yield (84%) of purified γ-oryzanol (> 95% purity). Further application of a step-gradient elution with 85:15 (v/v), followed by 75:25 (v/v) hexane to ethyl acetate mixture increased chromatographic resolution (Rs), resulting in enhanced separation efficiency, which in turn led to a higher yield of purified γ-oryzanol of 90%.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all)"

This study aimed to compare the metaproteomic profiles of the gut resistome and related metabolism in the cecal microbiota of fattening pigs raised under antibiotic-free (ABF) conditions with those of ordinary industrial pigs (controls [CTRL]). The top three relatively abundant microbes in both groups were Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus, and Lactobacillus, followed by Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. E. coli, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides were found to be increased in the CTRL group, whereas Ruminococcus and Clostridium were greater in the ABF group. The highest abundances of antibiotic resistance proteins (log2 expression levels [ELs] of >10) were found to be for tetracycline resistance (Tetr) and aminoglycoside resistance (AMGr) proteins found in Bacteroides, with a significant increase in the CTRL group. High Tetr (ELs of 5.32) was found in Ruminococcus in the CTRL group, although pigs in both groups had never received tetracycline, possibly reflecting the influence of environments in farms. In E. coli, AMGr and β-lactamase family proteins were observed in both groups (ELs of 3 to 6), whereas multidrug resistance protein MdtL was significantly expressed in the CTRL group (ELs of around 3). In the ABF group, CRISPR-associated endonucleases Cas1 and Cas9, which function to defend against viruses, were markedly observed in Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus, respectively, with ELs of 8.6 and 4.15, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that CRISPR-associated endonucleases were markedly observed in the ABF group, whereas higher levels of Tetr, AMGr, and multidrug resistance protein MdtL was markedly observed in dominant bacterial species in the CTRL group. IMPORTANCE In order to control and reduce antibiotic use in animals, the Department of Livestock Development, Thailand, has launched a campaign for antibiotic-free livestock production. The present study has shown for the first time that CRISPR-associated endonucleases Cas1 and Cas9, which function to defend against viruses, were markedly observed in Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus, respectively, in ceca of pigs raised without antibiotics (ABF). The highest abundances of antibiotic resistance proteins were for tetracycline (Tetr) and aminoglycoside resistance (AMGr) proteins found in Bacteroides, with a significant increase in the controls. In E. coli, the microbe with the highest relative abundance, AMGr and β-lactamase family proteins were observed in both groups, whereas multidrug resistance protein MdtL was significantly expressed in the controls. Pigs in both ABF and control groups had never received tetracycline, possibly reflecting the influence of farm environments. We suggest that pigs raised without antibiotics may have more beneficial microorganisms for the gut than pigs raised with antibiotics.","biochemistryistry, environmental, Immunology, medical","Physiology, Ecology, Immunology and Microbiology (all), Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Cell Biology, Infectious Diseases"

Recent sequence models that incorporate CTC loss have been focusing on speed by removing recurrent structures, hence losing important context information. This paper presents extensive studies of Contextualized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CCTC) framework, which induces prediction dependencies in non-recurrent and non-autoregressive neural networks for sequence modeling. CCTC allows the model to implicitly learn the language model by predicting neighboring labels via multi-task learning. Experiments on ASR and HTR tasks in two different languages show that CCTC models offer improvements over CTC models by 2.2-8.4% relative without incurring extra inference costs. We have also found that higher order of context information can potentially help the model produce better predictions.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Materials Science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Materials Science (all), Engineering (all)"

The main obstacle to the eradication of the disease continues to be insufficient treatment options. Sericin, a natural biopolymer from Bombyx mori cocoons, can improve skin conditions via its immunomodulatory effect. Many external therapeutic methods are currently used to treat psoriasis, but sericin-based hydrogel is not yet used to treat plaques of eczema. Through the use of an imiquimod rat model, this study sought to identify the physical and chemical characteristics of a silk sericin-based poly(vinyl) alcohol (SS/PVA) hydrogel and assess both its therapeutic and toxic effects on psoriasis. The cytokines, chemokines, and genes involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis were investigated, focusing on the immuno-pathological relationships. We discovered that the SS/PVA had a stable fabrication and proper release. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties of SS/PVA reduced the severity of psoriasis in both gross and microscopic skin lesions. This was demonstrated by a decrease in the epidermal histopathology score, upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and interleukin (IL)-10, and a decrease in the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-20. Moreover, the genes S100a7a and S100a14 were downregulated. Additionally, in rats given the SS/PVA treatment, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels were within normal limits. Our findings indicate that SS/PVA is safe and may be potentiated to treat psoriasis in a variety of forms and locations of plaque because of its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized three themes: vaccine availability, vaccination program deployment, and vaccine acceptability. Switching pediatric vaccines can pose unforeseen challenges to health-care systems worldwide and additional resources are often required to overcome those challenges. Yet, the magnitude of the impact, especially economic and societal, was frequently under-researched with variability in reporting. Therefore, an efficient vaccine switch requires a thorough consideration of the added benefits of replacing the existing vaccine, preparation, planning, additional resource allocation, implementation timing, public–private partnerships, outreach campaigns, and surveillance for program evaluation.","medical, Immunology, pharmacology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology, Pharmacology"

Therefore, the desorption process is one of the key important processes for the CO2 capture system. Traditionally, most of the literature studies focus on the desorption of solid sorbent under an N2 atmosphere. However, the desorption process of the solid sorbent is inappropriate in the real system because the system will need another process to separate CO2 and nitrogen (N2) after the desorption process. This study focused on the CO2 desorption of potassium carbonate supported on gamma-alumina (K2CO3/γ-Al2O3) in a wet fluidized bed under a steam atmosphere by using the multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The effects of water thickness and dry restitution coefficient on CO2 desorption rate were investigated to provide a realistic particle collision behavior and to explore their effects on CO2 desorption phenomena. Moreover, the effect of steam velocity on the hydrodynamic behaviors of fluidization which on CO2 desorption rate was studied. The simulated results demonstrated that all the parameters, water thickness, dry restitution coefficient, and steam velocity had significantly affected system hydrodynamics and CO2 desorption rate in the wet fluidization desorption process. Furthermore, the effect of desorption temperature on CO2 desorption rate was evaluated for finding the appropriate temperature for CO2 desorption process of K2CO3/γ-Al2O3. The results showed that the appropriate desorption temperature for CO2 desorption under steam atmosphere was the temperature over 150 °C.","coastal engineering, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (all), Materials Science (all)"

Examples of the resources required include a reliable laboratory facility, reference material, highly specific and sensitive instrumentation able handle trace levels of contamination, data management, and the most limited resource - time. Therefore, the supporting tools to assist with risk assessment e.g., shared databases for drug and excipients in concern, screening models for the determination of nitrosamine formation potential, and an in silico model to help with toxicity estimation, have proven to be beneficial to tackle the risk and concern of nitrosamine contamination in pharmaceuticals.",pharmacology,Pharmaceutical Science

As the most-used anode material, zinc metal always encounters poor coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability, because of the serious zinc dendrite and harmful side reactions on Zn surface. Here, a solid-phase non-adhesive homogeneous Nano-Si layer has been embedded on the Zn surface (Zn-Si) via an ultra-facile grinding method. The Nano-Si layer can regulate an even electric field distribution to achieve a homogeneous zinc deposition, and it also can greatly lower the charge transfer resistance and nucleation energy barrier of Zn2+ to facilitate the zinc deposition, thus achieving a dendrites-free and long-life Zn anode. Encouragingly, the zinc symmetrical battery with Zn-Si anode delivers a superior CE of 99.6 % in 1000 cycles under 5 mA cm−2, and a stable cycle lifespan of 3600 h under 1 mA cm−2 with much lower polarization potential (42 mV), outperforming the symmetrical battery with pure Zn anode (455 h, 59 mV) and various previously reported strategies.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of BLF content on the foam structure, mechanical properties, cushion performance, and biodegradability. The NRL foam cushion nets with and without BLF were prepared using the Dunlop method along with microwave-assisted vulcanization. BLF (90–106 µm in length) at various loadings (0.00, 2.50, 5.00, 7.50, and 10.00 phr) were introduced to the latex compounds before gelling and vulcanizing steps. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the BLF in a NRL foam caused an increase in cell size and a decrease in the number of cells. The changes in the cell structure and number of cells resulted in increases in the bulk density, hardness, compression set, compressive strength, and cushion coefficient. A soil burial test of 24 weeks revealed faster weight loss of 1.8 times when the BLF content was 10.00 phr as compared to the NRL foam without BLF. The findings of this work suggest the possibility of developing an eco-friendly cushion with a faster degradation rate while maintaining cushion performance, which could be a better alternative for sustainable packaging in the future.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Polymers and Plastics"

Metal-organic-framework-based materials as green catalysts for alcohol oxidation,"An G., Zhang X., Zhang C., Gao H., Liu S., Qin G., Qi H., Kasemchainan J., Zhang J., Wang G.",2023-07-01,"Alcohol oxidation, Catalytic performance, Catalytic system, Green catalysis, Green catalysts, Metal-organic framework-based material, Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), Oxidation of alcohols, Selective oxidation, ]+ catalyst, Alcohol oxidation, Catalytic performance, Green catalysis, MOF-based material, Stability","The selective oxidation of alcohols is widely regarded as one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. Although efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts for alcohol oxidation are highly desirable, their development remains an enormous challenge. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts have demonstrated great potential in the catalytic oxidation of alcohols and have remarkably progressed in the past few decades owing to their advantages of large surface area, tunable porous structure, abundant accessible active sites, and ease of reuse and recycling. In this review, recent representative results of the catalytic oxidation of alcohols by MOF-based materials are summarized and classified according to the type of material and reaction, such as pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF derivatives for traditional thermal catalysis, photo-assisted catalysis, and electro-assisted catalysis. Each catalytic system is described in detail from multiple aspects, including the materials synthesis process, catalytic performance, alcohol oxidation mechanisms, and material stability. Thus, the aims of this review are to identify potentially efficient, green, and reusable MOF-based catalytic systems and to provide new insights for the further development of catalytic alcohol oxidation to obtain the target organics.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"
"Characteristics and Risk Assessment of Environmentally Persistent Free Radicals (EPFRs) of PM2.5 in Lahore, Pakistan","Ahmad M., Chen J., Yu Q., Tariq Khan M., Weqas Ali S., Nawab A., Phairuang W., Panyametheekul S.",2023-02-01,"Air Pollutants, China, Coal, Environmental Monitoring, Free Radicals, Humans, Pakistan, Particulate Matter, Risk Assessment, Seasons, Vehicle Emissions, carbonaceous species, EPFRs, hydroxyl radicals, oxidative potential, risk assessment","Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are an emerging pollutant and source of oxidative stress. Samples of PM2.5 were collected at the urban sites of Lahore in both winter and summertime of 2019. The chemical composition of PM2.5, EPRF concentration, OH radical generation, and risk assessment of EPFRs in PM2.5 were evaluated. The average concentration of PM2.5 in wintertime and summertime in Lahore is 15 and 4.6 times higher than the national environmental quality standards (NEQS) of Pakistan and WHO. The dominant components of PM2.5 are carbonaceous species. The concentration of EPFRs and reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as OH radicals, is higher in the winter than in the summertime. The secondary inorganic ions do not contribute to the generation of OH radicals, although the contribution of SO42+, NO3−, and NH4+ to the mass concentration of PM2.5 is greater in summertime. The atmospheric EPFRs are used to evaluate the exposure risk. The EPFRs in PM2.5 and cigarette smoke have shown similar toxicity to humans. In winter and summer, the residents of Lahore inhaled the amount of EPFRs equivalent to 4.0 and 0.6 cigarettes per person per day, respectively. Compared to Joaquin County, USA, the residents of Lahore are 1.8 to 14.5 times more exposed to EPFRs in summer and wintertime. The correlation analysis of atmospheric EPFRs (spin/m3) and carbonaceous species of PM2.5 indicates that coal combustion, biomass burning, and vehicle emissions are the possible sources of EPFRs in the winter and summertime. In both winter and summertime, metallic and carbonaceous species correlated well with OH radical generation, suggesting that vehicular emissions, coal combustion, and industrial emissions contributed to the OH radical generation. The study’s findings provide valuable information and data for evaluating the potential health effects of EPFRs in South Asia and implementing effective air pollution control strategies.","atmospheric pollution, environmental, medical","Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

The alpha diversity indexes and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix revealed that the bacterial profiles between the two conditions are significantly different. Correspondingly, the relative abundance indicates that the predominant bacterial phylum in both conditions was Proteobacteria. At genus level, the dominant bacterial genera in the mild patients belonged to Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Achromobacter, while bacterial genera belonging to Enhydrobacter, Comamonas, and Acinetobacter were dominant in the severe patients.

This paper aims to understand recent BCT development for its BPM applications and identify the limitations and challenges for further development via a systematic literature review (SLR). It is found that numerous works have reported using BCT as technical solutions to fulfill some traditional BPM functions. This paper is distinguished from existing works, especially several relevant surveys in the sense that (1) the impact of using BCT in BPM is thoroughly explored to identify new constraints and challenges explicitly brought by blockchains; (2) the requirements for Business Process Compliance (BPC) are firstly analyzed in detail. Note that BPC is to assure the adherence of business processes to pre-defined policies, standards, specifications, regulations, and laws when business processes are executed. To fill the gaps of BCT applications in these two aspects, Blockchain-as-a-Service (BCaaS) is adopted in business process architecture, and the trends of BCT developments are identified accordingly.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management"
Influences of epoxidized natural rubber and fiber modification on injection molded-pulp/poly(lactic acid) biocomposites: Analysis of mechanical-thermal and weathering stability,"Kadea S., Kittikorn T., Chollakup R., Hedthong R., Chumprasert S., Khanoonkon N., Witayakran S., Chatakanonda P.",2023-10-01,"Biocomposite, Chemical degradation, Epoxidized natural rubber, Modified wood, Physical chemical degradation, Poly lactic acid, Poly(lactic acid), Silanized, Weathering acceleration, Wood pulp fibers, Biocomposites, Epoxidized natural rubber, Physical chemical degradation, Poly(lactic acid), Weathering acceleration, Wood pulp fiber","Accelerated weathering tests were conducted to evaluate the weathering resistance of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based biocomposites without and with epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), that were reinforced with unmodified wood pulp fiber (WP) and silanized wood pulp fiber (modified WP). Changes in mechanical and thermal properties and morphology were observed, and structural and chemical degradation were analyzed. The addition of ENR improved the impact strength of the biocomposites before weathering, acting as an impact modifier. After the weathering test, the flexural properties of PLA-based biocomposite with ENR and silanized wood pulp fiber (ENR-modified WP) was better than the flexural properties of a biocomposite without ENR. The biodegradability of the biocomposites largely depended on the PLA matrix. The modified fibers have lower UV absorbance and can protect composites from UV light better than unmodified fibers. ENR and modified WP helped prevented the degradation of PLA. While weathering reduced the molecular weight of the WP and modified WP biocomposites by 78% and 61%, respectively, the molecular weight of the same biocomposites with ENR decreased by 51% and 50%, respectively. The accelerated weathering test produced cracks and increased surface roughness in the biocomposites and the glass transition temperature was reduced as a result of crystallization and chain shortening. These indicated that the biocomposite based containing ENR and silanized wood pulp fiber had better weathering resistance due to lowest absorption of UV radiation which was more suitable for applications in construction, furniture, and exterior and interior decoration.","fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

Instead of combining through pages or replies of irrelevant information, users can easily and quickly pinpoint relevant posts and answers using tags. Since User-submitted posts can have multiple tags, classifying tags in Stack Overflow can be challenging. This results in an imbalance problem between labels in the whole labelset. Pretrained deep-learning models with small datasets can improve tag classification accuracy. Common multi-label resampling techniques with machine learning classifiers can also fix this issue. Still, few studies have explored which resampling technique can improve the performance of pre-trained deep models for predicting tags. To address this gap, we experimented to evaluate the effectiveness of ELECTRA, a powerful deep learning pre-trained model, with various multi-label resampling techniques in decreasing the imbalance that induces mislabeling in Stack Overflow's tagging posts. We compared seven resampling techniques, such as LP-ROS, ML-ROS, MLSMOTE, MLeNN, MLTL, ML-SOL, and REMEDIAL, to find the best method to mitigate the imbalance and improve tag prediction accuracy. Our results show that MLTL is the most effective selection to tackle the inequality in multi-label classification for our Stack Overflow data with deep learning scenarios. MLTL achieved 0.517, 0.804, 0.467, and 0.98 from the metrics Precision@l, Recall@5, F1-score@1, and AUC, respectively.

At enrollment, the overall median age was 19 (interquartile range [IQR] 17-20) years, 67% were female, and 95% were Thai. Almost all PHIV youth (99%) were receiving antiretroviral therapy; 50% self-reported adherence ≥95%. Median CD4 was 579 (IQR 404-800) cells/mm3, and 24% had HIV-RNA ≥1,000 copies/mL. During follow-up, 31 (22%) PHIV youth and 9 (6%) HIV-negative youth had at least one SAE. The overall crude SAE rate was 4.66 (3.42-6.35) per 100 person-years (PY); 7.22 (5.08-10.26) per 100 PY among youth with PHIV and 2.10 (1.09-4.03) per 100 PY in HIV-negative youth (p < .001). All seven deaths that occurred were among those with PHIV and primarily due to opportunistic infections (e.g., pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculous meningitis). In multivariate analyses, having PHIV, being <20 years of age, and having anogenital high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with types 16 and/or 18 increased risk of SAEs. Among PHIV youth, CD4 count <350 cells/mm3, HIV-RNA ≥1,000 copies/mL, advanced WHO stages, and having anogenital HPV 16 and/or 18 infection predicted higher incidence of SAEs; no prior use of alcohol was protective. These data emphasize the need for tailored interventions for adolescents with PHIV to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality.","Immunology, medical","Immunology, Virology, Infectious Diseases"

Do Disfluencies Increase With Age? Evidence From a Sequential Corpus Study of Disfluencies,"Beier E.J., Chantavarin S., Ferreira F.",2023-03-27,"Aged, Aging, Humans, Speech, Speech Disorders, Speech Production Measurement, cognitive aging, disfluencies, sequential corpus analysis, speech, speech production","Speech disfluencies such as repeated words and pauses provide information about the cognitive systems underlying speech production. Understanding whether older age leads to changes in speech fluency can therefore help characterize the robustness of these systems over the life span. Older adults have been assumed to be more disfluent, but current evidence is minimal and contradictory. Particularly noteworthy is the lack of longitudinal data that would help establish whether a given individual’s disfluency rates change over time. This study examines changes in disfluency rates through a sequential design with a longitudinal component, involving the analysis of 325 recorded interviews conducted with 91 individuals at several points in their lives, spanning the ages of 20–94 years. We analyzed the speech of these individuals to assess the extent to which they became more disfluent in later interviews. We found that, with older age, individuals spoke more slowly and repeated more words. However, older age was not associated with other types of disfluencies such as filled pauses (uh’s and um’s) and repairs. Overall, this study provides evidence that, although age itself is not a strong predictor of disfluencies, age leads to changes in other speech characteristics among some individuals (i.e., speech rate and indicators of lexical and syntactic complexity), and those changes in turn predict the production of disfluencies over the life span. These findings help resolve previous inconsistencies in this literature and set the stage for future experimental work on the cognitive mechanisms underlying changes in speech production in healthy aging.","psychology, biochemistryistry, medical","Social Psychology, Aging, Geriatrics and Gerontology"

Positively charged colistin binds to negatively charged lipids and damages the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. However, the MCR-1 protein, encoded by the mobile colistin resistance (mcr) gene, is involved in bacterial colistin resistance by catalysing phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transfer onto lipid A, neutralising its negative charge, and thereby reducing its interaction with colistin. Our preliminary results showed that treatment with a reference pyrazolone compound significantly reduced colistin minimal inhibitory concentrations in Escherichia coli expressing mcr-1 mediated colistin resistance (Hanpaibool et al. in ACS Omega, 2023). A docking-MD combination was used in an ensemble-based docking approach to identify further pyrazolone compounds as candidate MCR-1 inhibitors. Docking simulations revealed that 13/28 of the pyrazolone compounds tested are predicted to have lower binding free energies than the reference compound. Four of these were chosen for in vitro testing, with the results demonstrating that all the compounds tested could lower colistin MICs in an E. coli strain carrying the mcr-1 gene. Docking of pyrazolones into the MCR-1 active site reveals residues that are implicated in ligand–protein interactions, particularly E246, T285, H395, H466, and H478, which are located in the MCR-1 active site and which participate in interactions with MCR-1 in ≥ 8/10 of the lowest energy complexes. This study establishes pyrazolone-induced colistin susceptibility in E. coli carrying the mcr-1 gene, providing a method for the development of novel treatments against colistin-resistant bacteria.","fluidex; related topics, pharmacology, computer science, chemistry","Drug Discovery, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"

Here, a techno-economic analysis of the integrated processes of furfural and HMF production combined with electricity generation under different scenarios was performed to identify the most suitable process design. Simulations revealed that using the whole bagasse in the biorefinery plant and recycling 50% waste from the HMF production to recover unreacted sugar (scenario 2) achieved the maximum furfural and HMF production with minimum CO2 emission, compared with integrated processes without sugar recycling (scenario 1), with 80% (scenario 3) and 60% biomass (scenario 4) bypassed to the biorefinery, and with a standalone combined heat and power system (scenario 5). Moreover, heat integration improved the efficiency of biorefinery plant (scenario 2), with an energy recovery potential of 71%, leading to the maximum profit at 11% internal rate of return. However, the high operating cost associated with the requirement of solvents and catalysts for HMF production represents the largest cost distribution in the proposed integrated processes. Sensitivity analysis revealed that solvent cost was the most important parameter for economic benefit. In addition, improving technological efficiency in the pretreatment and HMF production phases can enhance product yield, thereby benefiting the profitability of this process.","petroleum refining and petrochemistryicals; chemistryical products and processes; oxygen computer scienceounds, fluidex; related topics, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Vitamin K2 (MK-7) supplementation can improve vitamin K status in HD patients. However, the benefits of vitamin K supplementation on arterial stiffness have still not been established. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation on arterial stiffness in chronic HD patients. Methods: This open-label multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted in 96 HD patients who had arterial stiffness, defined by high carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV ≥ 10 m/s). The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral MK-7 (375 mcg once daily) for 24 weeks (n = 50) or standard care (control group; n = 46). The change in cfPWV was the primary outcome. Results: Baseline parameters were comparable between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the change in cPWV at 24 weeks between the MK-7 group and standard care [−6.0% (−20.2, 2.3) vs. −6.8% (−19.0, 7.3), p = 0.24]. However, we found that MK-7 significantly decreased cPWV in patients with diabetes [−10.0% (−15.9, −0.8) vs. 3.8% (−5.8, 11.6), p = 0.008]. In addition, the MK-7 group had a lower rate of arterial stiffness progression, compared to controls (30.2% vs. 39.5%, p = 0.37), especially in diabetes patients (21.4% vs. 72.7%, p = 0.01). No serious adverse events were observed during the 24 weeks.

It has severely damaged the world's most developed countries and has turned into a major threat for low- and middle-income countries. Since its emergence in late 2019, medical interventions have been substantial, and most countries relied on public health measures collectively known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We aimed to centralize the accumulative knowledge of NPIs against COVID-19 for each country under one worldwide consortium. International COVID-19 Research Network collaborators developed a cross-sectional online survey to assess the implications of NPIs and sanitary supply on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The survey was conducted between January 1 and February 1, 2021, and participants from 92 countries/territories completed it. The association between NPIs, sanitation supplies, and incidence and mortality were examined by multivariate regression, with the log-transformed value of population as an offset value. The majority of countries/territories applied several preventive strategies, including social distancing (100.0%), quarantine (100.0%), isolation (98.9%), and school closure (97.8%). Individual-level preventive measures such as personal hygiene (100.0%) and wearing facial masks (94.6% at hospitals; 93.5% at mass transportation; 91.3% in mass gathering facilities) were also frequently applied. Quarantine at a designated place was negatively associated with incidence and mortality compared to home quarantine. Isolation at a designated place was also associated with reduced mortality compared to home isolation. Recommendations to use sanitizer for personal hygiene reduced incidence compared to the recommendation to use soap. Deprivation of masks was associated with increased incidence. Higher incidence and mortality were found in countries/territories with higher economic levels. Mask deprivation was pervasive regardless of economic level. NPIs against COVID-19 such as using sanitizer, quarantine, and isolation can decrease the incidence and mortality of COVID-19.","medical, Immunology","Infectious Diseases, Virology"

Aggregators will make contracts with customers with photovoltaic (PV) power systems and battery energy storage systems (BESSs) including electric vehicles (EVs) to participate in electricity markets. Aggregators might have to pay electricity supply-demand imbalance charges when generated and consumed energies contracted at the day-ahead supply-demand market are different from those at the current day operation due to distribution network constraints such as voltage and power flow limitations. Therefore, the information on network constraints is very important for aggregators to determine their day-ahead schedules. In this paper, we evaluated the relationship between aggregator supply-demand schedules and the distribution system operation. It was assumed that the reverse power flow limitations due to network constraints are notified to the aggregators by distribution system operator (DSO). Two cases of the aggregators’ schedules of PV systems and stationary BESSs were compared in the simulations. In addition, aggregator strategies for making adequate schedules were evaluated.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering","Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Four databases were searched, and controlled human studies that applied autogenous dentin for implant surgery, comparing it with other bone grafts, were included. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, five of which were randomized controlled trials and were included in the meta-analysis. ADG showed equivalent primary and secondary implant stability when compared to Bio-Oss (primary: mean difference −0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 3.36 to 1.88, P = 0.58; secondary: mean difference − 1.29, 95% CI − 5.69 to 3.11, P = 0.57).

However, the steroidogenic potential of the gonad is still unknown. In this study, H. rugulosus were obtained by stimulating fertilization in the laboratory under natural light and temperature conditions. The gonads were collected and their steroidogenic potential was evaluated by determining the expression level of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase/C17–20 lyase (CYP17) and cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and the localization of CYP17 mRNA in tissues by in situ hybridization. The CYP17 mRNA levels in males at 4–11 weeks postmetamorphosis were higher than in female and intersex gonads. This corresponded to their localization in the gonadal tissues, where CYP17 signals were specifically detected in the Leydig cells of the testis at 5–16 weeks postmetamorphosis but was undetectable in all ovary samples. The CYP19 mRNA levels in females at 4–11 weeks postmetamorphosis was higher than in male and intersex gonads, which corresponded with gonadal development, indicating the potential steroidogenic function of the ovary. Based on the present results, the role of CYP17 and CYP19 mRNA in sex differentiation in H. rugulosus may occur after gonadal sex differentiation and the steroidogenic potential of the gonads exhibited a sexual dimorphic pattern. These results provide a crucial basis for further research on the developmental biology in anuran species.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry","Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Physiology, Animal Science and Zoology, Molecular Biology, Genetics"

Encapsulation has been proven an effective technique to enhance gas–liquid mass transfer and thus improve gas hydrate formation kinetics. However, the dissociation behaviour of gas hydrate in individual capsules remains unknown. In this work, the dissociation kinetics of encapsulated CO2-TBAB semi-clathrate hydrates in different shapes are experimentally investigated under various operating conditions, and, for the first time, a two-stage numerical model is developed which integrates mass transfer, heat transfer and the intrinsic gas hydrate reaction kinetics to simulate the gas hydrate dissociation process. The effects of temperature, pressure, capsule volume and capsule geometry on gas hydrate dissociation kinetics are investigated. The results reveal that the proposed model is capable of capturing two distinct experimentally-observed dissociation stages, a rapid and subsequently slow stage according to the measured dissociation rate. Surface-to-volume ratio of the capsule and the dissociation driving force are the two main factors influencing the dissociation kinetics. The ring-shaped capsule exhibits the most efficient dissociation process due to its high surface-to-volume ratio and long transition time to the slow dissociation stage. This work enhances the understanding of gas hydrate dissociation behaviour in individual capsules and guides the manipulation of dissociation for efficient hydrate-based gas transport and recovery.","Health Professionsth and environmentalronment; air pollution; control, chemistry, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Chemistry (all), Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

Design: Oral Candida isolates were collected from HIV-infected and healthy individuals in our previous study (n = 66 isolates/group). The minimum-inhibitory-concentration (MIC) of amphotericin-B and fluconazole was determined by Epsilometer test. Minimal-fungicidal-concentration (MFC) of 3 chitosan derivatives: high-molecular-weight chitosan (HMWC, 150–200 kDa), oligomer (7–9 kDa) and polymer (900–1000 kDa) chitosan, were investigated by agar dilution method. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. Results: Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans were significantly more prevalent in HIV-infected than in healthy individuals (P = 0.02), while amphotericin-B-resistant C. parapsilosis were more common in healthy individuals (P = 0.03). The majority of Candida isolates were killed by HMWC at ≤ 40 mg/ml, as well as by oligomer and polymer chitosan at ≤ 6 mg/ml. Remarkably, chitosan was effective against most antifungal drug-resistant isolates. Conclusions: Antifungal drug resistance was prevalent among oral C. albicans isolates from HIV-infected individuals.

Conventional treatment for hyposalivation relies on the use of sialogogues such as pilocarpine; however, their efficacy is constrained by the limited number of remnant acinar cells after radiation. After radiotherapy, the salivary gland (SG) secretory parenchyma is largely destroyed, and due to the reduced stem cell niche, this gland has poor regenerative potential. To tackle this, researchers must be able to generate highly complex cellularized 3D constructs for clinical transplantation via technologies, including those that involve bioprinting of cells and biomaterials. A potential stem cell source with promising clinical outcomes to reserve dry mouth is adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC). MSC-like cells like human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC) have been tested in novel magnetic bioprinting platforms using nanoparticles that can bind cell membranes by electrostatic interaction, as well as their paracrine signals arising from extracellular vesicles. Both magnetized cells and their secretome cues were found to increase epithelial and neuronal growth of in vitro and ex vivo irradiated SG models. Interestingly, these magnetic bioprinting platforms can be applied as a high-throughput drug screening system due to the consistency in structure and functions of their organoids. Recently, exogenous decellularized porcine ECM was added to this magnetic platform to stimulate an ideal environment for cell tethering, proliferation, and/or differentiation. The combination of these SG tissue biofabrication strategies will promptly allow for in vitro organoid formation and establishment of cellular senescent organoids for aging models, but challenges remain in terms of epithelial polarization and lumen formation for unidirectional fluid flow. Current magnetic bioprinting nanotechnologies can provide promising functional and aging features to in vitro craniofacial exocrine gland organoids, which can be utilized for novel drug discovery and/or clinical transplantation.",medical,Medicine (all)

MIL-88B(Fe)-derived carbon at 900 ºC (CMIL88–900) exhibited great increases in surface area, porosity, and hydrophobicity, resulting in the excellent adsorption rates and capacities of five I-THMs (4–44 times calculated by linear isotherm) compared to powdered activated carbon (PAC). The primary adsorptive mechanisms onto CMIL88–900 consists of hydrophobic partitioning and an ion-dipole interaction at the acidic surface functional groups (ASGs), which is supported by the diffusibility of the small molecular structure of I-THMs. Bromodiiodomethane demonstrated the highest competitive adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 in single- and mixed-solute solutions due to it having the highest hydrophobicity and smallest molecular structure. MIL-53(Al)-derived carbon at 900 ºC (CMIL53–900) showed comparable I-THMs adsorption capacities with PAC, approximately 10 times lower than those detected from CMIL88–900. The ion-dipole interaction between the I-THMs and ASGs of CMIL53–900 served as the dominant adsorptive mechanism. Chlorinated haloform showed higher adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 than brominated and iodinated haloforms. Among the three dominant I-DBPs, dichloroiodomethane had the highest adsorption capacity on CMIL88–900 compared to iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide, respectively, due to its hydrophobicity and having the lowest molecular weight.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

As an upgradation of this process, the introduction of urea gives improved energy conversion efficiency and can also be used for the treatment of urea-rich wastewater. Inspired by the above, a bifunctional electrocatalyst, namely NiCuP@NiCu supported on graphitic carbon, is prepared for the first time via high-temperature pyrolysis and in-situ phosphidization process. The carbon support endorses better electron transference, and the presence of mixed active metal redox couples (Mx+/My+, M = Ni&Cu) and their M-O/O–C bonds formation with urea molecule collectively leads to substantial UOR activity. Under alkaline conditions with 0.33 M urea in 1.0 M KOH, the NiCuP@NiCu/C drives 10 mA cm−2 current density with a minimum potential of 1.242 V and overpotential of 98 mV for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. What is significant is that NiCuP@NiCu/C is explored as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to construct two electrode electrolyzer, which only requires the minimum potential of 1.313 V to drive 10 mA cm−2 current density. Furthermore, the NiCuP@NiCu/C equipped electrolyzer is used under human urine sample and achieved the maximum H2 production of 0.387 mmol. From the aforementioned outcomes, this works delivers a facile method for exploring an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea electrolysis and providing a new path to real-time fuel approach enabled H2 production.","energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

Because the effect of surface energy becomes nontrivial at such a small scale, a modified continuum theory is required to accurately predict their mechanical behaviors. A Gurtin–Murdoch continuum model of surface elasticity is implemented to establish a computational scheme for investigating an elastic multilayered system under axisymmetric loads with the incorporation of surface/interface energy. Each layer stiffness matrix is derived based on the general solutions of stresses and displacements obtained in the form of the Hankel integral transform. Numerical solutions to the global equation, which are formulated based on the continuity conditions of tractions and displacements across interfaces between layers, yield the displacements at each layer interface and on the top surface of the multilayered medium. The numerical solutions indicate that the elastic responses of multilayered structures are affected significantly by the surface material properties of both the top surface and interfaces, and that they become size dependent. In addition, the indentation problem of a multilayered nanoscale elastic medium under a rigid frictionless cylindrical punch is investigated to demonstrate the application of the proposed solution scheme.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture"

As biomass is seasonal variation and diversity, the design of the gasifier should consider a variety of biomass feedstock. This study investigated a single-designed downdraft gasifier of different biomass pellets using computational fluid dynamics and optimized for producer gas quality and gasifier efficiencies. Three biomass pellets, i.e., wood, bagasse, and palm-oil empty fruit bunch (PEFB), were considered the primary qualitative variable in addition to the main process variables, i.e., air-inlet temperature and equivalence ratio (ER). Response surface methodology (RSM) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) were carried out for process and biomass optimization. Tar yield is considered a response for optimization along with carbon conversion (CCE) and cold gas efficiencies (CGE). The results showed that ER and biomass type are crucial. The range of ER for each biomass should be carefully selected.

Utilization of palm oil as an alternative processing oil in carbon black-filled natural rubber compounds,"Hayichelaeh C., Boonkerd K.",2023-04-01,"Crosslinking type, Distillate aromatic extracts, Elastic properties, Environmental friendliness, Environmental sustainability, Filler-filler interactions, Natural rubber compounds, Payne-effects, Tan δ, Temperature scanning stress relaxations, Crosslinking type, Elastic property, Natural rubber, Palm oil, Payne effect","Due to the toxicity of distillate aromatic extract (DAE), palm oil (PO) being environmental friendliness, renewability, and sustainability, was used as an alternative processing oil in this study. The properties of carbon black-filled natural rubber compounds containing PO were investigated and compared with the DAE-added rubber compound. The results revealed that the presence of PO in the rubber compound gave the same degree of filler–filler interactions but higher filler-rubber interactions compared with the one with DAE. Payne effect as referred to filler-filler interactions of the rubber compounds with DAE and PO was 191 and 189 kPa, respectively. In addition, the presence of PO not only accelerated the vulcanization reaction but also reduced the crosslink density within the rubber matrix. The crosslinking type of PO-added rubber compounds consisted only of polysulfidic linkages, whereas the DAE-added rubber compound contained various crosslinking types, i.e., mono-, di-, and polysulfidic linkages. On the other hand, the presence of PO in rubber compounds promoted a positive effect on elastic properties, as indicated by the temperature scanning stress relaxation (TSSR) index and tan δ at 60 °C. The TSSR index of rubber compounds with DAE and PO was 0.69 and 0.71, respectively. Given the low tan δ at 60 °C of the PO-added rubber compounds, PO promoted a low rolling resistance when applied in tire applications, providing tires with safe energy.","petroleum engineeringneering, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science
Analysis of the Trade-Off in Data Quality Management for Crowdsourcing,"Gangwanpongpun K., Chuangsuwanich E., Punyabukkana P.",2023-01-01,"Cost-effective methods, Crowdsourcing platforms, Data collection, Data labelling, Data quality control, Data quality management, Diverse methods, Gold standards, Labelings, Trade off, crowdsourcing, data labeling, data quality control","Crowdsourcing is generally a faster, more cost-effective and diverse method form of data collection. However, there are high risks in crowdsourcing labeling tasks online to a large number of people, thus, a quality control process is necessary for any crowdsourcing platform. This article explores the challenges and its possible solutions in user quality management for crowdsourcing platforms. Three aspects are studied, 1. Job Prerequisites, 2. Gold Standard Questions and 3. Data Redundancy. We have found that job prerequisites are necessary in order to screen for high quality workers, and emphasis should be put on the task specifics. Questions that check for consistency between tasks are better than obvious questions as a gold standard question. We have also found that a single data validator may yield most of the improvement in data quality.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

Most thyroblastomas were initially diagnosed as malignant teratoma or carcinosarcoma. The cytologic features of thyroblastoma have not been well documented. Here, we present the cytological findings of a case of thyroblastoma in a 19-year-old female with a dominant solid left thyroid nodule. A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass revealed a highly cellular aspirate composed of crowded, atypical, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio epithelial cells, arranged in a variety of architectural patterns including rosette-like microfollicular, solid, and morular. In addition, the background contains a minor population of atypical mesenchymal cells. The cytologic differential diagnosis of thyroblastoma includes primary thyroid neoplasms such as adenomatous nodule, follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma, and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma as well as metastatic carcinoma.",medical,"Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Histology"

It provides beneficial effects on human health in the treatment/management of many diseases. The present study was performed to demonstrate the anti- Acanthamoeba activity of ethanolic extracts of Propolis samples from Iran. The interactions of the compounds and essential proteins of Acanthamoeba were also visualized through docking simulation. Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Propolis extract against Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts was determined in vitro. In addition, two-fold dilutions of each of agents were tested for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions. Three major compounds of Propolis extract such as chrysin, tectochrysin and pinocembrin have been selected in molecular docking approach to predict the compounds that might be responsible for encystment, excystment and adhesion inhibitions of A. castellanii. Furthermore, to confirm the docking results, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out for the most promising two ligand-pocket complexes from docking studies. Results : The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 62.5 and 125 µg/mL of the most active Propolis extract were assessed in trophozoites stage of Acanthamoeba castellanii ATCC30010 and ATCC50739, respectively. At concentrations lower than their MICs values (1/16 MIC), Propolis extract revealed inhibition of encystation. However, at 1/2 MIC, it showed a potential inhibition of excystation and anti-adhesion. The molecular docking and dynamic simulation revealed the potential capability of Pinocembrin to form hydrogen bonds with A. castellanii Sir2 family protein (AcSir2), an encystation protein of high relevance for this process in Acanthamoeba. Conclusions : The results provided a candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against Acanthamoeba infection. In vivo experiments and clinical trials are necessary to support this claim.","biochemistryistry, Immunology, pharmacology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all), Immunology and Microbiology (all), Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)"
Boosting the detection performance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test through a sensitive optical biosensor with new superior antibody,"Lin C.-Y., Wang W.-H., Li M.-C., Lin Y.-T., Yang Z.-S., Urbina A.N., Assavalapsakul W., Thitithanyanont A., Chen K.-R., Kuo C.-C., Lin Y.-X., Hsiao H.-H., Lin K.-D., Lin S.-Y., Chen Y.-H., Yu M.-L., Su L.-C., Wang S.-F.",2023-09-01,"Detection performance, High sensitivity, Phase-sensitive surface, Phase-sensitive surface plasmon resonance, Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Spike, Spike rapid antigen test, Surface plasmon resonance biosensor, Surface-plasmon resonance, Target-captured ELISA, monoclonal antibody, PS-SPR, SARS-CoV-2, spike, spike rapid antigen test, target-captured ELISA","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus emerged in late 2019 leading to the COVID-19 disease pandemic that triggered socioeconomic turmoil worldwide. A precise, prompt, and affordable diagnostic assay is essential for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its variants. Antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was reported as a suitable strategy for therapy and diagnosis of COVID-19. We, therefore, developed a quick and precise phase-sensitive surface plasmon resonance (PS-SPR) biosensor integrated with a novel generated anti-S monoclonal antibody (S-mAb). Our results indicated that the newly generated S-mAb could detect the original SARS-CoV-2 strain along with its variants. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which could be processed in BSL-2 facility was generated for evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of the assays including PS-SPR, homemade target-captured ELISA, spike rapid antigen test (SRAT), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Experimentally, PS-SPR exerted high sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at 589 copies/ml, with 7-fold and 70-fold increase in sensitivity when compared with the two conventional immunoassays, including homemade target-captured ELISA (4 × 103 copies/ml) and SRAT (4 × 104 copies/ml), using the identical antibody. Moreover, the PS-SPR was applied in the measurement of mimic clinical samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus mixed with nasal mucosa. The detection limit of PS-SPR is calculated to be 1725 copies/ml, which has higher accuracy than homemade target-captured ELISA (4 × 104 copies/ml) and SRAT (4 × 105 copies/ml) and is comparable with qRT-PCR (1250 copies/ml). Finally, the ability of PS-SPR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in real clinical specimens was further demonstrated, and the assay time was less than 10 min. Taken together, our results indicate that this novel S-mAb integrated into PS-SPR biosensor demonstrates high sensitivity and is time-saving in SARS-CoV-2 virus detection. This study suggests that incorporation of a high specific recognizer in SPR biosensor is an alternative strategy that could be applied in developing other emerging or re-emerging pathogenic detection platforms.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, engineering, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Pharmaceutical Science"

Nevertheless, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this evidence in aggregate. Methods: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the association of KD, ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat diet (K-LCHF), and very low-calorie KD (VLCKD) with health outcomes, PubMed, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched up to February 15, 2023. Meta-analyses of RCTs of KD were included. Meta-analyses were re-performed using a random-effects model. The quality of evidence per association provided in meta-analyses was rated by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) criteria as high, moderate, low, and very low. Results: We included 17 meta-analyses comprising 68 RCTs (median [interquartile range, IQR] sample size of 42 [20–104] participants and follow-up period of 13 [8–36] weeks) and 115 unique associations. There were 51 statistically significant associations (44%) of which four associations were supported by high-quality evidence (reduced triglyceride (n = 2), seizure frequency (n = 1) and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (n = 1)) and four associations supported by moderate-quality evidence (decrease in body weight, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), hemoglobin A1c, and increased total cholesterol). The remaining associations were supported by very low (26 associations) to low (17 associations) quality evidence. In overweight or obese adults, VLCKD was significantly associated with improvement in anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes without worsening muscle mass, LDL-C, and total cholesterol. K-LCHF was associated with reduced body weight and body fat percentage, but also reduced muscle mass in healthy participants. Conclusions: This umbrella review found beneficial associations of KD supported by moderate to high-quality evidence on seizure and several cardiometabolic parameters. However, KD was associated with a clinically meaningful increase in LDL-C. Clinical trials with long-term follow-up are warranted to investigate whether the short-term effects of KD will translate to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality.","public Health Professionsth, sociologyal medicalcine and epidemiology, medical",Medicine (all)

CD4/CD8 ratio normalization was defined as a ratio ≥1. Longitudinal changes in CD4/CD8 ratio were analyzed by linear mixed model, the incidence of the normalization by Cox regression, and the differences in ratio recovery by group-based trajectory modeling.Results:A total of 5529 PLWH were included; 80% male, median age 35 years (interquartile range [IQR], 29-43). First-line regimens were comprised of 65% NNRTI, 19% PI, and 16% INSTI. The baseline CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.19 (IQR, 0.09-0.33). PLWH starting with NNRTI-(P = 0.005) or PI-based ART (P = 0.030) had lower CD4/CD8 recovery over 5 years compared with INSTI. During 24,304 person-years of follow-up, 32% had CD4/CD8 ratio normalization. After adjusting for age, sex, baseline CD4, HIV-1 RNA, HCV, and year of ART initiation, PLWH started with INSTI had higher odds of achieving CD4/CD8 ratio normalization than NNRTI-(P < 0.001) or PI-based ART (P = 0.015). In group-based trajectory modeling analysis, INSTI was associated with greater odds of being in the higher ratio trajectory.Conclusions:INSTI use was associated with higher rates of CD4/CD8 ratio recovery and normalization in our cohort.

Natural Rubber/Hexagonal Mesoporous Silica Nanocomposites as Efficient Adsorbents for the Selective Adsorption of (−)-Epigallocatechin Gallate and Caffeine from Green Tea,"Jermjun K., Khumho R., Thongoiam M., Yousatit S., Yokoi T., Ngamcharussrivichai C., Nuntang S.",2023-08-01,"Adsorption, Caffeine, Nanocomposites, Rubber, Silicon Dioxide, Tea, (−)-epigallocatechin, adsorption, caffeine, hexagonal mesoporous silica, natural rubber","(–)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a bioactive component of green tea that provides many health benefits. However, excessive intake of green tea may cause adverse effects of caffeine (CAF) since green tea (30–50 mg) has half the CAF content of coffee (80–100 mg). In this work, for enhancing the health benefits of green tea, natural rubber/hexagonal mesoporous silica (NR/HMS) nanocomposites with tunable textural properties were synthesized using different amine template sizes and applied as selective adsorbents to separate EGCG and CAF from green tea. The resulting adsorbents exhibited a wormhole-like silica framework, high specific surface area (528–578 m2 g−1), large pore volume (0.76–1.45 cm3 g−1), and hydrophobicity. The NR/HMS materials adsorbed EGCG more than CAF; the selectivity coefficient of EGCG adsorption was 3.6 times that of CAF adsorption. The EGCG adsorption capacity of the NR/HMS series was correlated with their pore size and surface hydrophobicity. Adsorption behavior was well described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that adsorption involved H-bonding interactions between the silanol groups of the mesoporous silica surfaces and the hydroxyl groups of EGCG and the carbonyl group of CAF. As for desorption, EGCG was more easily removed than CAF from the NR/HMS surface using an aqueous solution of ethanol. Moreover, the NR/HMS materials could be reused for EGCG adsorption at least three times. The results suggest the potential use of NR/HMS nanocomposites as selective adsorbents for the enrichment of EGCG in green tea. In addition, it could be applied as an adsorbent in the filter to reduce the CAF content in green tea by up to 81.92%.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

Methods: This open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study evaluated the safety (events of special interest [ESIs]; primary end point) and effectiveness of 46 weeks of CT-P13 treatment according to routine practice in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with 1 year follow-up post-treatment. Results: 30 patients were enrolled (16 RA, 8 AS and 6 PsA). Infections were the most frequently reported study drug-related ESIs (2 RA and 2 AS). One patient with RA and one with PsA experienced infusion-related reactions. No cases of tuberculosis, malignancy (as expected, given 1 year follow-up), or drug-induced liver disease were reported. Disease activity improved across indications. Conclusion: CT-P13 was well tolerated and effective across indications. Infliximab is one biological medicine used to treat inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). CT-P13 is a near-identical copy, called a biosimilar, of the original (‘reference’) version of infliximab. CT-P13 is the first biosimilar to receive regulatory approval for treatment of the same three diseases from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration. Biosimilarity means that CT-P13 does not differ from the original version of infliximab in clinically important ways, such as how safe it is and how well it works. CT-P13 and reference infliximab provided similar symptom relief during previous clinical trials, and both drugs caused similar side effects. It is important to monitor the safety and performance of CT-P13 when given during routine clinical practice, and in different ethnic populations, such as through the study reported here. Following regulatory approval in Thailand, 30 patients prescribed CT-P13 during routine clinical practice participated in this study. The study included 16 patients with RA, eight with AS and six with PsA. The patients took CT-P13 for 46 weeks and were monitored for a further year. Side effects of CT-P13 were as expected based on previous experience and did not raise any safety concerns. Based on the known safety profile of CT-P13, the study looked at some side effects in particular: infections were the most common of these side effects, experienced by 16 patients overall (seven patients with RA, five patients with AS and four patients with PsA). CT-P13 improved symptoms for all of the diseases. The study suggests that CT-P13 can be given safely and reduces symptoms in Thai patients with AS, RA or PsA.

Dysregulation of DNA repair associated with genomic instability, abnormal cell survival and not only promotes cancer progression but also resistance to cancer treatment. The three major SSHs, androgen, estrogen, and progesterone, have been shown to interact with several essential DNA repair components. The presence of androgens directly regulates key molecules in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Estrogen can promote cell proliferation and DNA repair, allowing cancer cells to tolerate chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Information on the role of progesterone in DNA repair is limited: progesterone interaction with some DNA repair components has been identified, but the biological significance is still unknown. Here, we review the roles of how each SSH affects DNA repair regulation and modulates response to genotoxic therapies and discuss future research that can be beneficial when combining SSHs with cancer therapy. We also provide preliminary analysis from publicly available databases defining the link between progesterone/PR and DDRs & DNA repair regulation that plausibly contribute to chemotherapy response and breast cancer patient survival.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine, Molecular Biology, Endocrinology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology"

Updated management for antibody-mediated rejection: Opportunity to prolong kidney allograft survival,"Townamchai N., Avihingsanon Y.",2023-01-01,"Allografts, Biomarkers, Graft Rejection, Graft Survival, Humans, Isoantibodies, Kidney, ABO incompatibility, antibody-mediated rejection, antihuman leukocyte antigen, donor-specific antihuman leukocyte antibody","Purpose of reviewAntibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is an important barrier to achieve long-term kidney allograft survival. Human leukocyte antibody (HLA)-incompatibility and ABO-incompatibility are the two main mechanisms of ABMR. Nevertheless, the advances in managing ABMR have changed the paradigm for kidney transplantation. This review aimed to emphasize the HLA-incompatibility and ABO-incompatibility kidney transplant and update the management of ABMR.Recent findingsHLA-incompatibility kidney transplantation is a strong risk factor for ABMR. Donor-specific antibody (DSA) is a surrogate biomarker that prevents long-term allograft survival. The standard treatment for ABMR has unfavorable results. New drugs that target the B cell are a promising approach to treat ABMR. In the past, ABO-incompatibility kidney donor was an absolute contraindication but now, it is widely accepted as an alternative organ resource. The advancement of ABO antibody removal and B-cell depletion therapy has been successfully developed. ABO isoagglutination remains the main biomarker for monitoring ABMR during the transplantation process. C4d staining without inflammation of the kidney allograft is the marker for the accommodation process.SummaryWith the shortage of organ donors, transplant experts have expanded the organ resources and learned how to overcome the immunological barriers by using novel biomarkers and developing new treatments that support long-term graft survival.",medical,Medicine (all)

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing PD-related clinical outcomes between PD centres included in the PDOPPS (the PDOPPS group) and those not included (the non-PDOPPS group) from January 2018 to December 2019. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors associated with achieving the target KPIs. Results: Of 181 PD centres, 22 (12%) were included in the PDOPPS. PD centres in the PDOPPS group were larger and tended to serve more PD patients than those in the non-PDOPPS group. However, the process and outcome KPIs (KPIs 1–8) were comparable between the 2 groups. Large hospitals (≥120 beds), providing care to ≥100 PD cases and having experience for >10 years were independent predictors of achieving the peritonitis rate target of <0.5 episodes/year. Most PD centres in Thailand showed weaknesses in off-target haemoglobin levels and culture-negative peritonitis rate. Conclusions: The PD centres included in Thai PDOPPS were found to be representative of other PD centres in Thailand in terms of clinical outcomes. Thus, Thai PDOPPS findings may apply to the broader PD population in Thailand.",medical,Nephrology

Loss of a kidney after kidney donation might, therefore, affect the glucose and lipid metabolism of the donors. This matched cohort study investigated the effect of nephrectomy on glucose and lipid metabolisms using Bayesian hypothesis testing. There were 77 pairs of matched donor-control pairs in the present study. Clinical and laboratory data of the participants, at baseline and 1-year, were extracted from electronic medical records. Comparisons between donor and control groups were performed using the Bayesian independent samples t-test or Bayesian Mann–Whitney test. The Bayes Factor for alternative hypothesis over null hypothesis (BF10) was used to compare the two competing hypotheses. The BF10 of 3 or more was considered evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Comparing changes from baseline to 1-year between donors and controls, the BF10 of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index of insulin resistance, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 7.95, 3.96, 30.13, and 1.32 x 1041, respectively signifying that the change of these variables in the donors differed from those in the controls (alternative hypothesis). Triglyceride, HDL-C, and TyG index of the donors increased more than those of the controls while eGFR of the donor decreased more than that of the controls. Our data suggest that triglycerides and insulin resistance increase after donor nephrectomy. Kidney donors should be informed about these metabolic changes and should adhere to lifestyle recommendations that may mitigate insulin resistance.",medical,Nephrology

Among the various products that can be produced from ERC, methanol is a potential liquid product that can be utilized as fuel and an intermediate feedstock for fuel and chemical production. Recently, many researchers have shown interest in the ERC process for selective methanol production. The development of ERC technology for methanol production has been done both in experimental studies, particularly electrocatalyst design and development, and in process design and analysis to overcome challenges such as low CO2 solubility, low product selectivity, inefficient catalysts, mass transfer limitations, high overpotentials, and technology commercialization. This review aims to present progress in studies on the production of methanol via ERC. An overview of the CO2 conversion process involving CO2 hydrogenation, ERC, and CO2 photoelectrochemical reduction is first described. Then, key factors affecting the ERC, such as the electrocatalyst, electrolyte, and operating conditions, are analyzed. Furthermore, process design and modeling analyses are discussed to consider the commercialization of the ERC to form methanol. Finally, suggestions for future research are given in the final section of this review.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The hydrogel-based sensor was formed by Ca2+ cations cross-linked PV/Cu2+-GO/Alg. The morphologies of hydrogel were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier-transform Raman spectroscopy. Incorporating GO into the hydrogel improved its uniformity of porosity, large surface area, and compressive strength, leading to amplified colorimetric signals of the hydrogel sensor. Under optimal conditions, this sensor offered a linear range of 0.0–0.5 g/L with a detection limit of 0.05 g/L for cysteine without interfering effects in urine. Furthermore, this hydrogel-based sensor was applied for urinary cysteine detection and validated with laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. This platform could be used to determine cysteine at its cutoff (0.25 g/L) in human urine, which was distinguishable between normal and abnormal individuals, to evaluate an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Eventually, this system was integrated with diapers for a wearable cysteine sensor.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"

It can cause detrimental effects on patient's quality of life and nutrition intake, especially in older adults. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been one of the management strategies for acceleration of the recovery. This review summarises the current evidence on sensory threshold stimulation of the procedure. Method: This review compiled data from the Internet database PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus using combination of MeSH thesaurus: ‘Sensory threshold’, ‘electrical stimulation’, ‘neuromuscular stimulation’, ‘Deglutition’, ‘Dysphagia’. Eleven studies were intergraded into the review. Results: Most of the studies show significant improvement to the outcomes of sensory neuromuscular electrical stimulation treatment. In many cases, the results of the treatment are comparable or superior to motor threshold stimulation and conventional therapy. However, the study design and parameters of the procedure varied greatly without conclusive standardised guidelines. Conclusion: The sensory neuromuscular electrical stimulation (SNMES) is a viable treatment option for treating oropharyngeal dysphagia. The most suggested application parameters are an intensity at sensory threshold, a frequency of 80 Hz, an impulse time of 700 μs, a combined total duration of 20 h of stimulation in a 2-week period, and placing the electrodes in the submental area of the neck.

The study was performed for two conditions, i.e., as-built by DMLS method and as-built by DMLS method + covered by a layer containing CrN + Cr2N phases. An analysis of the surface morphology revealed that the ion-nitriding process significantly affects the physical and chemical phenomena occurring on the specimen’s surface. The XRD measurement of the specimens showed that preparing them with the DMLS method as well as following a nitriding process produced residual tensile stresses. Based on the measurement of the nanohardness distribution through the layer approximatively of 7 μm in width and the superalloys substrate, the results of the nanohardness showed the maximum values of 27 GPa and 13.5 GPa for the nitrided layer and the substrate, respectively. The surface protection from the nitrided layer proved a positive effect on the corrosion resistance of the DMLS specimens in the solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 + 0.1 M NaCl at room temperature. The results of the tensile tests at 750 °C showed that the ion-nitriding process did not significantly affect the elevated-temperature tensile strength of the superalloy specimens produced with the DMLS technique.","corrosion, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

MTORC2 is a physiological hydrophobic motif kinase of S6 Kinase 1,"Majeed S.T., Majeed R., Malik A.A., Andrabi K.I.",2023-04-01,"Amino Acids, Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E, Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1, Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2, Molecular Docking Simulation, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, eIF4E, Hydrophobic motif, Kinase, mTORC1, mTORC2, Rapamycin, S6 Kinase 1, Torin","Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a major downstream effector molecule of mTORC1, regulates cell growth and proliferation by modulating protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We have recently identified eIF4E as an intermediate in transducing signals from mTORC1 to S6K1 and further demonstrated that the role of mTORC1 is restricted to inducing eIF4E phosphorylation and interaction with S6K1. This interaction relieves S6K1 auto-inhibition and facilitates its hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and activation as a consequence. These observations underscore a possible involvement of mTORC1 independent kinase in mediating HM phosphorylation. Here, we report mTORC2 as an in-vivo/physiological HM kinase of S6K1. We show that rapamycin-resistant S6K1 truncation mutant ∆NH∆CT continues to display HM phosphorylation with selective sensitivity toward Torin-1. We also show that HM phosphorylation of wildtype S6K1and ∆NH∆CT depends on the presence of mTORC2 regulatory subunit-rictor. Furthermore, truncation mutagenesis and molecular docking analysis reveal the involvement of a conserved 19 amino acid stretch of S6K1 in mediating interaction with rictor. We finally show that deletion of the 19 amino acid region from wildtype S6K1 results in loss of interaction with rictor, with a resultant loss of HM phosphorylation regardless of the presence of functional TOS motif. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 acts as a physiological HM kinase that can activate S6K1 after its auto-inhibition is overcome by mTORC1. We, therefore, propose a novel mechanism for S6K1 regulation where mTOR complexes 1 and 2 act in tandem to activate the enzyme.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, biochemistryistry","Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

The extraction parameters were optimized using a Box–Behnken design. Optimal conditions were identified by superimposing the response surfaces of oil yield and thymoquinone content. The thymoquinone content was stable under extraction conditions of 60 °C. Moisture played an important role in both oil yield and thymoquinone content. A maximum oil yield of 31.67 wt% ± 0.85 wt% was obtained at a feed rate of 45 g/min, temperature of 70 °C, and moisture content of 6 wt%. However, a low thymoquinone content of 5.14 ± 0.74 mg/mL was observed under these conditions. Furthermore, high thymoquinone content (∼12.00 mg/mL) reduced the oil yield to 10–13 wt%. The optimal conditions were found to be a feed rate of 50–54 g/min, moisture content of 15–18 wt%, and temperature of 55–60 °C, which gave a yield of 22 wt% oil and 10 mg/mL thymoquinone content.","mixing and separation, geobase; related topics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences",Agronomy and Crop Science

Although advances in medical care have improved mortality and morbidity, neurological complications remain high. Therefore, aside from antibiotics, therapeutic adjuvants targeting neuroinflammation are essential to combat the long-term neuronal sequelae of bacterial meningitis. In the present study, we propose (−)-dendroparishiol as a potential add-on therapy to improve neuroinflammation associated with bacterial meningitis. The biological activity of (−)-dendroparishiol was first predicted by computational analysis and further confirmed in vitro using a cell-based assay with LPS-induced BV-2 microglial cells. Biological pathways involved with (−)-dendroparishiol were identified by applying network pharmacology. Computational predictions of biological activity indicated possible attenuation of several inflammatory processes by (−)-dendroparishiol. In LPS-induced BV-2 microglial cells, (−)-dendroparishiol significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators: iNOS, NO, COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α. Molecular docking results demonstrated the potential iNOS and COX-2 inhibitory activity of (−)-dendroparishiol. Network pharmacological analysis indicated the plausible role of (−)-dendroparishiol in biological processes involved in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation with enrichment in neuroinflammatory pathways. Overall, this study provides scientific evidence for the potential application of (−)-dendroparishiol in the management of bacterial meningitis-associated neuroinflammation.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Methods: A decision tree and Markov model were constructed to capture long-term costs and outcomes from a societal perspective. Patients with psoriatic arthritis who failed 2 previous csDMARDs were modeled over a 3-month cycle with a lifetime horizon. Clinical probabilities were derived from a published meta-analysis. Prices of bDMARDs were proposed by pharmaceutical companies. Other costs and utilities were based on data in Thailand. All costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3% annual rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: All 11 bDMARDs (3 infliximab originator and biosimilars, 2 etanercept originator and biosimilar, golimumab, 2 secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg, 3 adalimumab biosimilars) gained better quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with more costly than csDMARDs. Infliximab had the highest QALYs compared with other bDMARDs. Only secukinumab 150 mg showed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the Thai threshold of 5152 US dollars per QALY.

We postulate that women are more likely to have a milder degree of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and lower extent of hypoxia on Type III sleep studies versus polysomnography (PSG). Patients and methods: The Cleveland Clinic Sleep laboratory registry was leveraged to identify all adult inpatient sleep studies performed for OSA. Demographics, comorbidities, and sleep study measures were collected and compared by sex and sleep study type. Logistic regression was used to examine sleep study type predictive of OSA (apnea hypopnea index [AHI; ≥5, ≥15 and ≥ 30]) and hypoxia, (median percentage of sleep time spent at <90% SaO2 [TST<90%,≥ 11%,] adjusted for covariates. Results: The sample 778 patients had a mean age of 56.1 ± 16.1 years; 44.5% were female and 72.2% Caucasian. At an AHI≥5, women showed an increase odds of OSA (adjusted, OR = 2.04,95%; CI:1.24–3.35, p = 0.005) with Type III sleep study vs PSG compared to men. At an AHI≥15, men had less odds of OSA (adjusted OR = 0.60,95%CI:0.39–0.90,p = 0.015) with Type III sleep study vs PSG compared to women (OR = 1.15,95%CI:0.72–1.85,p = 0.56), with an interaction p-value of 0.040.

In essence, the proposed method maintains a good balance between the global explorative and local exploitative optimization schemes. The global searches within the explorative subpopulation are independent to the exploitative simulations even if the latter scheme prematurely converges to the local swarm position. For both subpopulations, the comprehensive learning approach constructs the particles through a cross-positioning process on the individual variable space and avoids the local optimal pitfall. Moreover, the chaotic logistic map within the exploitative optimization tests the global best particle through the set of diversely generated samples and hence enhances the local search ability. Various enriching techniques, including automatic adaptive (inertial weight and acceleration) parameters with dynamic space reduction, are incorporated to improve the likelihood of finding the optimal solution of practical-scale problems at modest computing efforts. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through a number of planar and spatial truss design benchmarks subjected to the challenging nonconvex and/or nonsmooth programs.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science","Control and Systems Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"
Using a complex measure of product innovativeness to explain abnormal financial returns,"Ganbaatar B., Myagmar K., Douglas E.J.",2023-01-01,"Abnormal returns, Artificial neural network analysis, Compound product innovativeness score, Effect size, Financial returns, Firm Performance, Market novelty, Product innovativeness, Technical novelty, Artificial neural network analysis, Compound product innovativeness score, Firm performance, Market novelty, Product innovativeness, Technical novelty","Purpose: By examining the impact of product innovation on abnormal financial returns following the launch of new products, this study aims to test the explanatory power of a new compound measure of product innovativeness (Ganbaatar and Douglas, 2019). Design/methodology/approach: It is a longitudinal study in which the authors used the compound product innovativeness score (CPIS) for the first time to measure product innovativeness. The abnormal financial returns are estimated through the event study design, where four different models are used. Artificial neural network analysis is done to determine the impact of the CPIS on abnormal returns by utilising a hexic polynomial regression model. Findings: The authors find effect sizes that substantially exceed practically significant levels and that the CPIS explain 65% of the variance in the firm’s abnormal returns in market valuation. Moreover, new-to-the-market novelty predicts 83% of the variation, while new-to-the-firm (catch-up) innovation insignificantly impacts firm value. Research limitations/implications: This paper demonstrates how the CPIS, an objective and direct measure of product innovativeness, can be used to gain more insight into the innovation effect. Practical implications: Implications for the business practice of this study include the necessity of relentless innovation by firms in contested differentiated markets, particularly where technological advance is ongoing. Larger and mature firms must practice corporate entrepreneurship to renew their products on a continuous basis to avoid slipping backwards in their markets. Innovation leadership, rather than following the leader, is also important to increase competitive advantage, given the result that innovation followship does not produce abnormal financial returns. Originality/value: In this study, the authors focused on the effect of product innovativeness on firm performance. While the literature affirms a positive relationship between innovation and firm performance, the effect size of this relationship varies, due largely to the authors contend to simplistic measures of innovativeness. In this study, the authors adopt the relatively novel “compound” measure of product innovativeness (Ganbaatar and Douglas, 2019) to better encapsulate the nuances of both technical novelty and market novelty. This measure of product innovativeness is applicable to firms of all sizes but is more easily applied to entrepreneurial new ventures and SMEs, and it avoids the shortcomings of prior firm-level and subjective measures of innovativeness for both smaller and larger firms. Using a more effective analytical method (Artificial Neural Network), the authors investigated whether there is a “practically” significant effect size due to product innovation, which could be valuable for entrepreneurs in practice. The authors show that the CPIS measure can very effectively explain abnormalities in the stock market, exhibiting a moderate effect size and explaining 65% of the variation in abnormal returns.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Business","Engineering (all), Management of Technology and Innovation"
Bifunctional mesoporous silica solid acids for transformation of glucose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,"Srida M., Chen S.-Y., Smith S.M., Ngamcharussrivichai C., Boonyuen S., Tateno H., Mochizuki T., Luengnaruemitchai A.",2023-12-01,"5 hydroxymethyl furfurals, Acid site, Acid site control, Bi-functional, Brønsted acid, Lewis Acid, Mesoporous silicas, Site controls, Solid acid, ]+ catalyst, Acid sites control, Biomass, Brønsted acid, HMF, Lewis acid, Mesoporous silica","Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable resource that can be converted into glucose, a precursor for the synthesis of high-value bio-chemicals, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the conversion of glucose to HMF using conventional liquid and solid acids is challenging due to the formation of byproducts, leading to low HMF yield. In this study, bifunctional solid acid catalysts (named Al-SA-S15) consisting of aluminum (Al) as Lewis acid sites and sulfonic acid (SA) as Brønsted acid sites were prepared by direct synthesis. The catalysts were then evaluated for the transformation of glucose to HMF using a co-solvent medium of acetone and water. Among the catalysts tested, the 5Al-15SA-S15 catalyst with a Si/Al molar ratio of 5 and a 15 mol% of sulfonic acid groups achieved 95% conversion of glucose and a 51% yield of HMF. The 5Al-15SA-S15 catalyst was found to be stable under the studied conditions, with no leaching of acidic groups observed. It could be easily regenerated by washing with acetone and reused for more than five times without significant loss of performance. This study provides a deep understanding of solid acid catalysts, with precise control of acidic nature and sites for the conversion of biomass into high-value added products.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, energy, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (all)"
Implications of the antiviral drug favipiravir on rabies immunoglobulin for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies in mice model with category III-like exposures,"Kimitsuki K., Khan S., Kaimori R., Yahiro T., Saito N., Yamada K., Nakajima N., Komeno T., Furuta Y., Quiambao B.P., Virojanapirom P., Hemachudha T., Nishizono A.",2023-01-01,"Animals, Antiviral Agents, Disease Models, Animal, Immunoglobulins, Immunologic Factors, Mice, Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, Rabies, Rabies Vaccines, Rabies virus, Category III exposure, Favipiravir, Post-exposure prophylaxis, Rabies immunoglobulin, Rabies virus","Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease caused by the rabies virus (RABV), with almost 100% mortality if proper post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), consisting of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) and rabies vaccine, is not applied in a timely manner. However, this is challenged by the limited availability of RIG, especially in resource-constrained countries. In this study, we assessed the scope of the antiviral drug favipiravir to treat rabies-infected mice as an alternative to RIG. Category III-like wounds were induced in RABV-challenged mice treated with favipiravir instead of RIG in the PEP regimen. The use of favipiravir followed by rabies vaccine provided complete protection against rabies-related death in 100% of mice, even after RABV propagated to the central nervous system during infection. Additionally, the virus-neutralizing antibody titer in the favipiravir and vaccine group was significantly higher than that of the RIG and vaccine recipients. The use of favipiravir with rabies vaccine seemingly prevents fatal outcomes and even rescues the cases that already express clinical symptoms. A clinical trial of this approach is warranted, especially in countries with low RIG availability.","pharmacology, Immunology","Pharmacology, Virology"

Wet milling and drying to produce cassava starch can reduce cyanide compounds to levels that are safe for human consumption and meet international regulations, but at a high cost in terms of water. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of atmospheric nonthermal (ANT) plasma treatment on the removal of free cyanide from dry-milled cassava flour, as well as other physical and chemical properties. To generate cold plasma, helium was used as the feed gas in a dielectric barrier discharge reactor. The results show that the first-order kinetic model can explain the fraction degradation of cyanide by ANT plasma. The rate of HCN fraction removal increased from 0.0116 min−1 to 0.0453 min−1 and 0.0119 min−1 to 0.0349 min−1 with increasing voltage level (10–20 kV) when the initial HCN were 143 ± 7 and 233 ± 5 mg kg−1 dw, respectively. The 20 kV-15 min ANT plasma treatment of cassava flour containing 143 ± 7 mg kg−1 dw reduced 35.7% of HCN without affecting starch crystallinity, protein, fiber, fat, or moisture content, but significantly changed the pasting properties (P < 0.05).",Agricultural and Biological Sciences,Food Science

We demonstrated that the γ-Al2O3(110) surface is proper for atomic coke deposition and dimerization in the initial state, where the presence of OH species promotes the coke evolution to higher coke, Cn (where n ≥ 3). Also, the higher coke formation thermodynamically preferred the cyclic form to the aliphatic one. The electron transfer from substrates to adsorbed coke illustrates the role of the electron donor of catalyst surfaces corresponding to the electron acceptor of adsorbed cokes.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Planners can achieve sustainability goals by accurately forecasting how people will get to and from work. In the prediction of travel mode selection, machine learning methods are commonly employed. To fit a machine-learning model to various challenges, the hyperparameters must be tweaked. Choosing the optimal hyperparameter configuration for machine learning models has an immediate effect on the performance of the model. In this paper, optimizing the hyperparameters of common machine learning models, including support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, single decision trees, ensemble decision trees, and Naive Bayes, is studied using the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. These models were developed and optimized using two datasets from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. Using several criteria, including average accuracy (%), average area under the receiver operating characteristics, and a simple ranking system, the performance of the optimized models was investigated. The findings of this study show that the BO is an effective model for improving the performance of the k-nearest neighbor model more than other models.

The chemicals involved may be sequestered from their diet or synthesized de novo in the insects’ body tissues. Parasitoid wasps are a diverse group of insects that play a critical role in regulating their host insect populations such as lepidopteran caterpillars. The successful parasitization of caterpillars by parasitoid wasps is contingent upon their aptitude for locating and selecting suitable hosts, thereby determining their efficacy in parasitism. However, some hosts can be toxic to parasitoid wasps, which can pose challenges to their survival and reproduction. Caterpillars employ a varied array of defensive mechanisms to safeguard themselves against natural predators, particularly parasitoid wasps. These defenses are deployed pre-emptively, concurrently, or subsequently during encounters with such natural enemies. Caterpillars utilize a range of strategies to evade detection or deter and evade attackers. These tactics encompass both measures to prevent being noticed and mechanisms aimed at repelling or eluding potential threats. Post-attack strategies aim to eliminate or incapacitate the eggs or larvae of parasitoids. In this review, we investigate the dietary challenges faced by parasitoid wasps when encountering toxic hosts. We first summarize the known mechanisms through which insect hosts can be toxic to parasitoids and which protect caterpillars from parasitization. We then discuss the dietary adaptations and physiological mechanisms that parasitoid wasps have evolved to overcome these challenges, such as changes in feeding behavior, detoxification enzymes, and immune responses. We present new analyses of all published parasitoid–host records for the Ichneumonoidea that attack Lepidoptera caterpillars and show that classically toxic host groups are indeed hosts to significantly fewer species of parasitoid than most other lepidopteran groups.","pharmacology, environmental","Toxicology, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

Problem has been specially found in the water supply services in the eastern part of the Chao Phraya River basins that mainly use the Chao Phraya River as a raw water source for producing the water supply. The problematic issue of high salinity in the produced water supply can be caused by the seawater from the gulf of Thailand intruding into the Chao Phraya River. Therefore, this research aimed to study and find out proper solutions to the problem by reusing the treated wastewater from the Bangkok wastewater treatment plants as raw water to produce water supply during the seawater intrusion period. Based on the study results, it was found that the reuse of the treated wastewater as a raw water source for tap water production could not be practically suitable because BMA has reused some of the treated wastewater for their activities as well as discharged some of it to maintain the environmental and ecological conditions of the river and canals. Hence, two approaches have been suggested as possible solutions to the faced salt tap water problem including 1) relocation of the water intake station (the raw water pumping station) to prevent the high salinity polluting the raw water resource during the seawater intrusion period, and 2) provision of new water reservoirs for especially reserving raw water for producing water supply during the seawater intrusion period.","engineering, Multidisciplinary","Engineering (all), Multidisciplinary"

A series of centrifuge tests were performed on the soil slope model under calibrated seepage and rainfall conditions. Medical gypsum plaster sheet, which has an equivalent strength and stiffness to GCCM, was used to reinforce a model soil slope. The results showed that GCCM-reinforcement could reduce slope displacement by contributing its high stiffness and creating an interface frictional force with the slope. In addition, the GCCM could delay the increase in pore-water pressure in the soil slope during rainfall, thus diminishing the hydraulic force acting on the slope, even if the slope surface was not fully covered by GCCMs. Overall, the results indicate that GCCM has good slope reinforcement potential.","slopes, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for intraoperative blood transfusion in this procedure. The secondary outcome was to investigate postoperative complications and clinical outcomes related to blood transfusion. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed among children who underwent a craniotomy for brain tumor resection at a tertiary hospital over a 10-year period. The pre- and intraoperative variables were examined and compared between the transfusion and nontransfusion groups. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two patients (58%) received intraoperative blood transfusions among a total of 295 craniotomies in 284 children. Factors associated with blood transfusion were body weight ≤ 20 kg (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.286, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.892-9.661; p < 0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status III-IV (AOR 6.860, 95% CI 1.434-32.811; p = 0.016), preoperative hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dl (AOR 3.610, 95% CI 1.406-9.265; p = 0.008), tumor size ≥ 45 mm (AOR 2.117, 95% CI 1.214-3.693; p = 0.008), and duration of operation ≥ 6 hours (AOR 3.816, 95% CI 1.736-8.385; p = 0.001). Postoperative infection of other systems, other complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were found to be significantly higher in the transfusion group. CONCLUSIONS: Lower body weight, higher ASA physical status, preoperative anemia, large tumor size, and prolonged duration of surgery were found to be significant factors for predicting intraoperative blood transfusion in pediatric craniotomy. The identification and modification of risks from intraoperative blood transfusion can be beneficial in reducing the probability of transfusion and improving allocation efficiency of limited blood component resources.",medical,"Surgery, Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Neurology (clinical)"

EDTA is a chelating agent that is commonly used to remove mineral salts, but this step is time-consuming and can take as long as 45 days. Commercial ultrasonic cleaner and microwave oven were reported to reduce the decalcification timing. The aim of this study is to determine and compare the decalcification of human articular cartilage and subchondral bone using EDTA together with ultrasonic cleaner or microwave oven. Hundred pieces of articular cartilage and subchondral bones obtained from osteoarthritis patients undergone total-knee-replacement were divided into 10 groups according to decalcification method (ultrasonic cleaner or microwave) and timing (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h). In each group, all cartilage and subchondral bone pieces were decalcified and sectioned, and subsequently stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Von Kossa, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, or caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. The optimal timing of decalcification of articular cartilage and subchondral bones using EDTA together with ultrasonic cleaner was at 8 and 10 h, while the timing using EDTA together with microwave oven was more than 10 h. Clear TUNEL and caspase-3 signals were obtained from samples decalcified using EDTA together with ultrasonic cleaner for 8 h. In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study that compared EDTA decalcification between ultrasonic cleaner and microwave oven.

The modified 3DE was characterized using microscopy and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometry were used to evaluate sensor performance. The modified 3DE provided electrocatalytic activity towards creatinine without enzymes. Under optimal conditions, the modified 3DE directly coupled with a portable smartphone potentiostat exhibited the linear detection range of 0.5–35.0 mM, and the limit of detection was 37.3 μM, which is sufficient for detecting creatinine in human urine samples. Furthermore, the other physiological compounds present in human urine were not detected on the modified 3DE.

This systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the safety and tolerability of SABA reliever monotherapy for adults and adolescents with asthma, through analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence. Methods: An SLR of English-language publications between January 1996 and December 2021 included RCTs and observational studies of patients aged ≥ 12 years treated with inhaled SABA reliever monotherapy (fixed dose or as needed) for ≥ 4 weeks. Studies of terbutaline and fenoterol were excluded. Meta-analysis feasibility was dependent on cross-trial data comparability. A random-effects model estimated rates of mortality, serious AEs (SAEs), and discontinuation due to AEs (DAEs) for as-needed and fixed-dose SABA treatment groups. ICS monotherapy and SABA therapy were compared using a fixed-effects model. Results: Forty-two studies were identified by the SLR for assessment of feasibility. Final meta-analysis included 24 RCTs. Too few observational studies (n = 2) were available for inclusion in the meta-analysis. One death unrelated to treatment was reported in each of the ICS, ICS + LABA, and fixed-dose SABA groups. No other treatment-related deaths were reported. SAE and DAE rates were < 4%. DAEs were reported more frequently in the SABA treatment groups than with ICS, potentially owing to worsening asthma symptoms being classified as an AE. SAE risk was comparable between SABA and ICS treatments. Conclusions: Meta-analysis of data from RCTs showed that deaths were rare with SABA reliever monotherapy, and rates of SAEs and DAEs were comparable between SABA reliever and ICS treatment groups. When used appropriately within prescribed limits as reliever therapy, SABA does not contribute to excess rates of mortality, SAEs, or DAEs.",medical,Pharmacology (medical)

While continuous testing can enhance code quality and minimize maintenance workload, it may also lead to a notable rise in overhead for test execution. Building on previous research, we introduce a new static class-level technique by constructing test cases to class dependency graphs from abstract syntax trees using JavaParser and applying it to seven Java systems. Like prior findings, we observe that, despite a small number of changed files in code changes, roughly 40 percent of test cases are impacted and require execution on average. Nonetheless, we conclude that test impact analysis can serve as a powerful tool for reducing test overhead. Moreover, we compare our proposed technique with a state-of-the-art static class-level method and find that our approach outperforms by achieving roughly a 13 percent reduction in selecting impacted tests on the commonly evaluated systems.","fluidex; related topics, computer science","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Software"

Extraction parameters involve the type of vegetable oil used, pH of feed solution, time, and O/A ratio. Three parameters in the stripping process are optimized by applying response surface methodology (RSM). Models NRTL, UNIQUAC, and Van't Hoff are employed in the mutual solubility of corn oil; the various strippants (NaOH, HCl, and thiourea) are investigated under different temperatures. Under optimal conditions, results demonstrate that percentages of extraction and stripping of mercury reach 99.4% and 95.4%, respectively. Corn oil proved to be the most efficient solvent for mercury extraction at pH ranges 2-8. Based on ANOVA, the stirring speed and A/O ratio had a significant influence on the stripping process. The mechanisms of extraction reaction were evaluated via density functional theory (DFT) along with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). Extraction and stripping kinetics are found to be of first-order (k = 0.182 min-1) and second-order (k = 0.9244 L•mg-1min-1), respectively. It is seen that our method has the ability to successfully remove mercury while still remaining below the standard discharge level.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"
Quality and Health Risk Assessment of Groundwater for Drinking and Irrigation Purpose in Semi-Arid Region of India Using Entropy Water Quality and Statistical Techniques,"Panneerselvam B., Ravichandran N., Kaliyappan S.P., Karuppannan S., Bidorn B.",2023-02-01,"Drinking and irrigations, Health risk assessments, Human health, Nitrate contamination, Nitrate pollution, Nitrate pollution index, Noncarcinogenic risk, Pollution index, Sample location, Water quality indexes, groundwater, human health, nitrate contamination, nitrate pollution index, noncarcinogenic risk","The continuous intake of contaminated drinking water causes serious issues for human health. In order to estimate the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation, and also conduct human risk assessments of various groups of people, a total of 43 sample locations in the semi-arid southern part of India were selected based on population density, and we collected and analyzed groundwater from the locations for major anions and cations. The present study’s novelty is integrating hydrochemical analysis with the entropy water quality index (EWQI), nitrate pollution index (NPI) and human health risk assessment. The results of the EWQI revealed that 44.19% of the sample locations need to be treated before consumption. About 37.20% of the study region has a high concentration of nitrate in the groundwater. NPI revealed that 41.86% of the samples had moderate or significant pollution levels. The non-carcinogenic risk evaluation showed that 6–12-year-old children are at a higher risk than teenagers, adults and elderly people in the study area. The natural sources of nitrate and other contamination of groundwater are rock–water interaction, weathering of rock, dissolution of carbonate minerals and evaporation processes, and the anthropogenic sources are the decomposition of organic substances in dumping yards, uncovered septic tanks and human and animal waste. The results suggest taking mitigation measures to reduce the contamination and improve the sustainable planning of groundwater management.","water engineeringneering, sociology, biochemistryistry, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Biochemistry, Aquatic Science, Water Science and Technology"

The DNS is a growing, and more vulnerable target for emerging attacks since traffic via it is frequently not monitored. Even on high-speed networks, software-based mitigation strategies and specialized, advanced firewalls may become bottlenecks and are vulnerable to saturation assaults. Many techniques for reducing network security threats may be quickly and easily implemented using the P4-programmable data plane without slowing down or interfering with regular traffic Using the stateful processing capabilities of programmable switches, in the course of this research, we develop a system that is able to monitor DNS traffic in the data plane and then apply the security rules that have been established by the administrator to certain domains. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is used in particular to apply filtering criteria (such as preventing harmful environments) and retrieve the domain name from a collection of labels. The evaluation findings reveal that the suggested method outperforms the state-of-the-art P4-based methods in terms of the number of domain labels it can parse. Further, throughput, latency, and packet loss achieve considerable performance gains compared to a conventional software firewall-pfsense-. However, due to the low resource consumption of the implemented P4 software, it may include additional security features.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Information Systems and Management"

The proxies may degrade over time and inherently inhibit the robustness of event interpretations. Multi-proxy methods, which leverage on each other's advantage/s and limitation/s, are employed to improve the identification of tsunami deposits from the geological record. Here, we assess the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) for tsunami research by comparing and contrasting the eDNA collected from a sequence of well-documented palaeotsunami deposits spanning the past three millennia. We study swales in a coastal beach ridge sequences on Phra Thong Island, Thailand and test if eDNA can robustly discriminate the tsunami-deposited sand sheets that intercalate between the non-tsunami derived organic mud layers. Our results indicate that the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami deposit and preceding tsunami deposits (approximately 550 to 700 years ago) contain microbial communities that differ significantly from the overlying and underlying organic mud layers (p-value = 0.0269) but the signal becomes restricted in the older sediment layers up to 2800-year-old that are constantly submerged in groundwater.

Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Quantum Dots as “Off-On” Fluorescent Probes in Paper-Based Test Kits for Selective Monitoring of Cyanide in Food,"Malahom N., Ma-In T., Naksen P., Anutrasakda W., Amatatongchai M., Citterio D., Jarujamrus P.",2023-07-14,"Ag +, Fluorescence turn-on, Fluorescent probes, Fluorescent sensors, Fluorometric paper-based test kit, Hydrogen cyanide, Nitrogen doped graphene, Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot, Paper-based test, Test kits, fluorescence turn-on, fluorescent sensor, fluorometric paper-based test kit, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs)","We successfully developed a fluorometric paper-based test kit for the selective and sensitive determination of cyanide using nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as the fluorescent probe. Citric acid and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane were precursors for the one-step synthesis of N-GQDs via in situ hydrothermal methods, providing a high quantum yield of 57.9%. The proposed mechanism uses a fluorescence turn-on approach. Specifically, the fluorescence of N-GQDs is quenched by the incorporation of Ag+ via a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). During the detection step, sulfuric acid converts cyanide (CN-) into hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The Ag+ species on the N-GQD surface then react with the evolved HCN via a coordination bond to form a silver cyanide complex, resulting in the fluorescence emission of the N-GQDs being turned back on. As a result, the fluorescence emission intensity of N-GQDs linearly increased with increasing CN- concentrations in the range of 0.5-25 mg L-1, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08 mg L-1. Notably, the developed sensor has advantages in terms of simplicity, rapidity, low cost, and high selectivity toward CN-.

Thus, improvements and developments of LFIA are constantly being reported. Herein, we enriched the sensitivity of LFIA using the gold enhancement principle, emphasizing needlessly complicated apparatus, only one step for the strip test operation, and typical time incubation (15 min) process. Self-enhanced LFIA was then executed for subsequent flows by overlapping the additionally enhanced pad composed of gold ions and reducing agent on the conjugate pad and the sample pad. Self-enhanced LFIA was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in saliva. The obtained result depicted that the achieved sensitivity was up to tenfold compared with that of conventional LFIA by visual measurements. The detection limits of self-enhanced LFIA detecting nucleocapsid protein antigens in the saliva sample was 0.50 and 0.10 ng/mL employed by naked eye detection and calibration curve-based calculation, respectively. When the proposed device was applied to 207 human saliva samples, the diagnostic performance presented a 96.10 % sensitivity and 99.23 % specificity.

Herein, we integrated an electrochemical sensing and microfluidic channel for the simultaneous determination of As(III) and total inorganic As (total iAs) within a single device. The platform was fabricated by assembling a gold nanoparticle-modified screen-printed graphene electrode (AuNP/SPGE) on a hydrophilic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet that was specially designed to enclose a microfluidic channel with dual flow channels for separate determination of the two species. While As(III) can be promptly detected with the AuNP/SPGE on one end, thioglycolic acid stored in glass fiber is employed on the other end to reduce As(V) before being electrochemically analyzed on the AuNP/SPGE as total iAs; the difference represents the amount of As(V). With a wireless potentiostat and a smartphone equipped with Bluetooth technology, the overall procedure can be fully automated and accomplished merely within 9 min. The linear ranges for the determination of As(III) and total iAs were found to be 50–1000 and 100–1500 ng/mL with detection limits of 3.7 and 17 ng/mL, respectively. The proposed method was validated and applied for the inorganic As speciation of various food samples with satisfactory results compared to those obtained with the standard HPLC-ICP‒MS protocol. This novel microfluidic electrochemical platform offers numerous advantages, notably for its simplicity, speed, low cost, and portability for on-site analysis, which conclusively makes it a highly promising analytical device for the speciation of inorganic arsenic.","process equipment, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Nevertheless, a proper extracellular matrix (ECM) microarchitecture to harbor primary cells is yet to be established towards human salivary gland (SG) organogenesis. By using porcine submandibular gland (SMG) biopsies as a proof-of-concept to mimic the human SG, a new decellularized ECM bioassembly platform was developed herein with varying perfusions of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to limit denaturing events and ensure proper preservation of the native ECM biochemical niche. Porcine SMG biopsies were perfused with 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1% SDS and bio-assembled magnetically in porous polycarbonate track-etched (PCTE) membrane. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), cell removal efficiency, and ECM biochemical contents were analyzed. SDS at 0.1% and 1% efficiently removed dsDNA (< 50 ng/mg) and preserved key matrix components (sulfated glycosaminoglycans, collagens, elastin) and the microarchitecture of native SMG ECM. Bio-assembled SMG decellularized ECM (dECM) perfused with 0.1–1% SDS enhanced cell viability, proliferation, expansion confluency rates, and tethering of primary SMG cells during 7 culture days. Perfusion with 1% SDS promoted greater cell proliferation rates while 0.1% SDS supported higher acinar epithelial expression when compared to basement membrane extract and other substrates. Thus, this dECM magnetic bioassembly strategy was effective for decellularization while retaining the original ECM biochemical niche and promoting SMG cell proliferation, expansion, differentiation, and tethering. Altogether, these outcomes pave the way towards the recellularization of this novel SMG dECM in future in vitro and in vivo applications.

A novel recycling route for aluminum alloys: Synthesis of Fe/Al bimetallic materials and magnetic separation,"Park I., Ito M., Jeon S., Tabelin C.B., Phengsaart T., Silwamba M., Hiroyoshi N.",2023-10-01,"Aluminium powder, Aluminum alloy scrap, Aluminum production, Bimetallics, Cementation, Fe/aluminum bimetallic material, High-energy input, NaCl solution, Non-ferrous metals, Recycling, Aluminum alloy scrap, Cementation, Fe/Al bimetallic materials, Magnetic separation, Recycling","Aluminum (Al) is one of the most important non-ferrous metals used in modern society, but its production from primary ores (e.g., bauxite) requires high energy input, emits large CO2, and generates huge amounts of solid wastes. In contrast, the production of Al from recycled scrap—also known as secondary Al production—only requires 5–8% of the energy for producing Al from bauxite and generates less amount of solid waste than that of the primary Al production, thus having both economic and environmental benefits. In general, scrap Al alloys are treated by physical-based separation techniques to remove impurities, and then mixed aluminum alloys are charged into the furnace for further refining. The ideal way of recycling Al scrap is to process each Al alloy by remelting/refining processes. To this end, this study investigated the surface modification of aluminum alloys by iron (Fe) deposition, followed by their separation by magnetic separation. When Al powder was treated with an acidified ferrous chloride solution (FeCl2-HCl-NaCl solution), dissolved Fe concentration decreased with time while releasing Al3+ into the solution, indicating that Fe cementation on Al occurred. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of treated Al powder showed that its surface was covered with zero-valent iron (ZVI) as well as its oxidation products (e.g., Fe(II)/Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide). The synthesis of Fe/Al bimetallic materials from Al alloys—1050, 2024, 3003, 5083, 6061, and 7075—was strongly dependent on HCl concentration as well as reaction temperature. Moreover, the kinetics of Fe cementation on Al alloys and the amounts of Fe cemented were determined not only by the rest potentials of the Al alloys but also their corrosion resistance. After treating Al alloys with FeCl2-HCl-NaCl solution, each Al alloy could be sequentially recovered by magnetic separation.","engineering, chemistry, earth sciences","Control and Systems Engineering, Chemistry (all), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Mechanical Engineering"
Pre-trained Model Robustness Against GAN-Based Poisoning Attack in Medical Imaging Analysis,"Singkorapoom P., Phoomvuthisarn S.",2023-01-01,"Adversarial machine learning, Architecture learning, Generative adversarial network, Imaging analysis, Machine-learning, Medical image classification, Model robustness, Network-based, Performance, Poisoning attacks, adversarial machine learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), medical image classification, poisoning attack","Deep learning revolutionizes healthcare, particularly in medical image classification, with its analysis performance aided by public architectures and transfer learning for pre-trained models. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks as they rely on learned parameters, and their unexplainable nature can make it challenging to identify and fix the root cause of the model after an attack. Given the increasing use of pre-trained models in life-critical domains like healthcare, testing their robustness against attacks is essential. Evasion and poisoning attacks are two primary attack types, with poisoning attacks having a broader range of poison sample-generating methods, making testing model robustness under them more critical than under evasion attacks. Poisoning attacks do not require an attacker to have a complete understanding to corrupt the model, making them more likely to occur in the real world. This paper evaluates the robustness of the famous pre-trained models trained as binary classifiers under poisonous label attack. The attacks use GANs to generate mislabeled fake images and feed poison samples to the model in a black box manner. The amount of performance degradation using classification metrics evaluates the model's robustness. We found that ConvNeXt architecture is the most robust against this type of attack, suggesting that transformer architecture can be used to build a more robust deep-learning model.","fluidex; related topics, decision sciences",Information Systems and Management

Beginning in 2016, an institutional policy was implemented in which medication prescription length was increased from 30 to 90 days. However, there have been no formal investigations into how this policy has impacted medication adherence among patients in hospitals. As such, this study evaluated how prescription length impacted medication adherence among dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients who were treated at Phramongkutklao Hospital. Methods: This pre-post implementation study compared patients who received prescription lengths of 30 and 90 days based on information recorded in the hospital database between 2014 and 2017. Therein, we used the medication possession ratio (MPR) to estimate patient adherence. Focusing on patients with universal coverage insurance, we employed the difference-in-difference method to examine changes in adherence from before and after policy implementation, then conducted a logistic regression to test for associations between the predictors and adherence. Results: We analyzed data from a total of 2,046 patients, with equal amounts of 1,023 placed into the control group (no change to 90-day prescription length) and intervention group (change from 30 to 90-day prescription length). First, we found that increased prescription length was associated with 4% and 5% higher MPRs among dyslipidemia and diabetes patients in the intervention group, respectively. Second, we found that medication adherence was correlated with sex, comorbidities, history of hospitalization, and the number of prescribed medications. Conclusion: Increasing the prescription length from 30 to 90 days improved medication adherence in both the dyslipidemia and type-2 diabetes patients. This shows that the policy change was successful for patients in the hospital considered for this study.",medical,Health Policy

With LPS stimulation, mgmt null (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Crecre/-) macrophages demonstrated less profound inflammation; supernatant cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10) and pro-inflammatory genes (iNOS and IL-1β), with higher DNA break (phosphohistone H2AX) and cell-free DNA, but not malondialdehyde (the oxidative stress), compared with the littermate control (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Cre-/-). In parallel, mgmt null mice (MGMT loss only in the myeloid cells) demonstrated less severe sepsis in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model (with antibiotics), as indicated by survival and other parameters compared with sepsis in the littermate control. The mgmt null protective effect was lost in CLP mice without antibiotics, highlighting the importance of microbial control during sepsis immune modulation. However, an MGMT inhibitor in CLP with antibiotics in WT mice attenuated serum cytokines but not mortality, requiring further studies. In conclusion, an absence of mgmt in macrophages resulted in less severe CLP sepsis, implying a possible influence of guanine DNA methylation and repair in macrophages during sepsis.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

However, the motor also increases the unsprung mass, which can impair the ride comfort of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose and investigate a control strategy using the vertical component of the driving force provided by an in-wheel motor for better ride comfort and handling dynamics. In the next stage, a mathematical model of the vehicle with coupled longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics was introduced. The parameters of the vehicle were measured and collected from an actual car equipped with in-wheel motors. To analyze the performance of the controller, a model of the vehicle was tested in a series of simulations. The straight-line acceleration test indicated an improvement to the ride comfort of 31.8% in terms of the RMS vertical vibrations of the sprung mass. The control is achieved without any deterioration of the tire load and the vehicle’s longitudinal dynamics. The stable lateral dynamics of the controlled vehicle was confirmed using a sine-sweep steering excitation, conducted on a perfectly smooth road surface with a constant longitudinal acceleration.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Automotive Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

The impedance examination was carried out under a voltage ranging from −1 V to 1 V. Each complex impedance arch unveiled only one arc with its center beneath the real axis. Elevated voltage facilitates a reduction in the semicircle size. Based on the simulated equivalent circuit model, the heterojunctions possessed high parallel resistance and a constant phase element (CPE) at the grain boundary, raising the V. The CPE for the grain, grain boundary, and junction implied behavior close to the ideal capacitor. The dielectric loss tangent results indicated that the heterojunctions exhibited leakage behavior.

Acquiring, monitoring, and processing lifestyle and other behavior-oriented data become key activities to gain in-sights about older consumers. While lifestyle patterns have been observed in marketing research for several decades, observing older consumers' lifestyles is still a challenging task and needs further exploration. This study investigates the current practices of marketing researchers and professionals in Thailand in conducting lifestyle-based market segmentation (LMS) as well as related challenges and opportunities. A qualitative in-depth interview approach was employed, with eighteen marketers who have at least ten years of experience. The verbatim data were analyzed by using deductive thematic analysis. As a result, Thai marketers frequently use self-reported questionnaires in offline and online formats, face-to-face interviews with older consumers, telephone surveys, and questionnaires posted on social media sites to collect data for LMS. From the marketers' perspectives, the LMS of older consumers requires abundant resources. It is still perplexing to access data that directly lead to customer insights into the current practices. Additionally, there is a lack of data collection tools tailored to LMS for the older population. Nevertheless, these issues shed some light on specific opportunities to develop more robust and tailored tools and techniques to conduct LMS faster and more efficiently (i.e., getting valid and reliable data while using fewer resources than the current ones).","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science, decision sciences","Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Information Systems and Management"

The high binding energies of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle/GO magnetic nanocomposite with target pesticides are verified by density functional theory. The Fe3O4/GO nanocomposite-modified electrode enhances the electrocatalytic property of the pesticides and provides a linear range of 1-250 μM with LODs of 0.06 and 0.18 μM for CBF and CBZ, respectively. For LDI-MS, after magnetic separation, CBF and CBZ bound to the magnetic nanocomposite are readily ionized by using Fe3O4/GO as a self-matrix, leading to high ion abundance with a linear range of 0.25-1000 μM and LODs of 0.25 μM for both pesticides. Furthermore, CBF and CBZ bound to Fe3O4/GO spiked in pear are visualized by imaging MS, illustrating the distribution of these pesticides in real pear peels. LOD values obtained from both detection techniques are lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) in the database of these pesticide residues, suggesting that this platform might be an alternative tool for the selective detection of pesticide residues in fruit samples.","mixing and separation, Materials Science",Materials Science (all)
Efficient Traffic Management For Resolving Traffic Congestion On Motorways,"Arslan M., Bakar R.A., Ahad A.",2023-01-01,"Centralized traffic, Style, Traffic coordination, Traffic formulation, Traffic jams, Traffic management, Vehicle platooning, Vehicle to vehicles, Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, Wait time, style, Traffic formulation, Vehicle Platooning, vehicle to vehicle","Traffic jams on the motorways due to accidents or other emergencies have proven difficult to resolve. The time it takes for the cars to line up and move out of the jam on their own accord is usually rather long. This article presents a system named ETMRTCM, which effectively centralized traffic coordination as a solution for overcoming transitory bottlenecks on multi-lane motorways. At initially, warning alerts regarding the traffic congestion happened depending on Vehicle to Vehicle communications. Then, automobiles start negotiating with their neighbors to figure out the best structure (platoon leader, distance gap, speed, and the number of vehicles) for formulating platoons. As a result, cars can move through the congestion more efficiently. After that, the platoon leaders give orders to the troops to switch lanes if there is an open space in the road adjacent to the one in which they are. The trial findings show that our method may shorten the wait time for the last few cars passing through the congested region by up to 22%. The suggested process also efficiently shortens wait times for vehicles entering the crowded zone while keeping things even for those leaving it.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Information Systems, Information Systems and Management"

Existing established predictive risk scores had poor discrimination performance in the prediction of mortality after the TAVI. Objectives: The present study aimed to develop machine learning-based predictive models for 30-day and 1-year mortality in severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing TAVI. Methods: A total of 186 patients in a retrospective cohort study were analyzed. The models were fitted by a decision tree. Each model was tested in 100 iterations of 80:20 stratified random splitting into training/testing samples and 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Variables that predict 30-day mortality are a set of factors driven mainly by height, chronic lung disease, STS score, preoperative LVEF, age, and preoperative LVOT VTI. Variables that predict 1-year mortality are a set of factors consisting of preoperative LVEF, STS score, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, home oxygen use, serum creatinine level, and preoperative LVOT Vmax. This decision tree-generated predictive models for 30-day and 1- year mortality provided the most precise accuracy of 0.97 and 0.90 with the AUC-ROC curves of 0.83 and 0.71 on 30-day and 1-year mortality on testing data and had better discrimination performance compared to the existing established TAVI predictive risk scores. Conclusions: These machine learning models show excellent accuracy and have a better prediction for 30-day and 1-year mortality than the existing established TAVI predictive risk scores. A customized predictive model deems to be properly developed for better risk discrimination among cohorts.",medical,Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine
Regulatory Functions and Mechanisms of Circular RNAs in Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation and Liver Fibrosis,"Nokkeaw A., Thamjamrassri P., Tangkijvanich P., Ariyachet C.",2023-02-01,"Fibrosis, Hepatic Stellate Cells, Humans, Liver Cirrhosis, MicroRNAs, RNA, Circular, circular RNA, hepatic stellate cells, liver fibrosis, microRNA, non-coding RNA","Chronic liver injury induces the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts, which produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in tissue fibrosis. If the injury persists, these fibrous scars could be permanent and disrupt liver architecture and function. Currently, effective anti-fibrotic therapies are lacking; hence, understanding molecular mechanisms that control HSC activation could hold a key to the development of new treatments. Recently, emerging studies have revealed roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs that was initially assumed to be the result of splicing errors, as new regulators in HSC activation. These circRNAs can modulate the activity of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their interacting protein partners involved in regulating fibrogenic signaling cascades. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of this class of non-coding RNAs for their molecular function in HSC activation and liver fibrosis progression.",biochemistryistry,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)"

Acraea terpsicore (Linnaeus, 1758), a common butterfly in Southeast Asia that uses Passiflora as a host plant, has been studied to compare larval performance and adult phenotypes on one local wild Passiflora plant, P. foetida and 3 exotic congeneric plants, P. edulis, a fruit crop plant, and P. x alata-caerulea and P. x coccinea-caerulea, both hybrid ornamental plants. Laboratory caterpillars that fed on P. edulis and P. x alata-caerulea died within 1–10 days, while caterpillars fed on P. foetida and P. x coccinea-caerulea completed their life cycle in 30.42 ± 0.25 days. Although the caterpillars differed in several food utilization indices, the relative growth rate and consumption index were not affected. Adult butterflies that hatched from caterpillars fed on these experimental plants had different phenotypes, especially wing colors. Therefore, although some congeneric exotic plants may have a negative impact on the butterfly population, some exotic plants can serve as alternative larval host plants and expand the ecological niche of butterflies. Difference in the composition and concentration of nutrients and defensive chemicals in each host plant may exert an impact on the phenotypic traits of butterflies, such as their body size, coloration, and wing shape. Whether butterflies may separate into different subpopulations in the future due to phenotypic variation should be further examined.","adaptation, medical",Medicine (all)

It can not only improve hypoxia but also promote pulmonary annulus (PA) growth. In this study, we evaluated the effect of PBPV on PA growth in infants with TOF. To eliminate the effect of the systemic to pulmonary shunt (SPS) that may promote PA growth, we divided TOF infants into 2 groups: group A, patients who underwent PBPV with or without other SPS, and group B, patients who attempted SPS but without PBPV. Sixty patients were included, 28 patients in group A and 32 patients in group B. Age at the time of intervention in group A (range, 0.4–5.4; median 1.4 months) was lower than that in group B (range, 2.3–7.7; median 4.8 months), p-value 0.02. The body weight in group A (range, 3–5.5; median 3.7 kg) was also lower than that in group B (range 4.1–6.4; median 5.9 kg), p-value 0.02. Echocardiographic data at the mean follow-up period of 37.2 months (3–88 months) in group A and 39.6 months (6–95 months) in group B demonstrated an increase in mean PA diameter from 5.0 ± 1.3 mm to 10.2 ± 2.9 mm, p-value < 0.001 in group A; and from 6.2 ± 2 mm to 9.5 ± 2.9 mm, p-value < 0.001 in group B. The median PA z-score increased from − 3.4SD (− 3.9 to − 2.6SD) to − 1.8SD (− 2.5 to − 0.8SD), with the p-value of 0.002 in group A; and increased from − 2.9SD (− 4.5 to − 1.3SD) to − 2.7SD (− 3.6 to − 1.4SD), with the p-value of 0.73 in group B. By using the PA z-score as the absolute value, there was a statistically significant increase in the PA z-score during follow-up in group A, but not in group B.

However, advanced age is an important factor that determines eligibility and outcomes after ASCT. Over the past decade, attributed to improved supportive care, ASCT for older patients has become more feasible. In this study, we report the single-center outcomes of older patients with lymphoma undergoing ASCT at Mayo Clinic Rochester to highlight its interval improvement over time and to help redefine the implications of ASCT in the chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy era. This single-center retrospective study evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of older patients with lymphoma who underwent ASCT between 2000 and 2021. We report various relevant transplantation-related outcomes, including progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in older patients with various lymphoma histologic subtypes. The main outcome was NRM, defined as the time from ASCT to non-lymphoma-related death, with relapse as a competing event. Of 492 patients age ≥65 years were analyzed. The median age at ASCT was 68.8 years. The most common indication for ASCT was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, accounting for 59.3% of cases. In multivariate analyses, patients undergoing ASCT in 2009 to 2021, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0, and low Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) (0 to 3) had a significantly lower NRM. Factors associated with OS included age, lactate dehydrogenase level, and HCT-CI. The 1-year NRM in older patients was low at 6.0%, in concordance with previous reports. Age should not be the sole factor determining a patient's ASCT eligibility. With the proper patient selection, ASCT remains a reasonable option for older patients with lymphoma.","medical, biochemistryistry","Immunology and Allergy, Molecular Medicine, Hematology, Cell Biology, Transplantation"

A series of nonlinear finite element (FE) analyses is first performed to define the optimal shape and dimensions of the joint. The FE analysis results show that the most effective joint shape is the 45° key joint, as it does not induce an overly high stress concentration at the joint. Therefore, fourteen UHPC segments connected with optimal joint configurations are prepared and tested under bending and shear loads. Several parameters, such as prestressing force, joint depth, the number of shear keys, and the presence of dowels, that affect the flexural and shear capacities of the UHPC segment are experimentally examined. The experimental results indicate that by inducing the prestressing forces, both flexural and shear performance predominantly increase, and higher ductile behavior in the UHPC segments can be achieved. Moreover, the presence of dowel bars and double shear keys can significantly retard crack opening at the joints under flexure and shear loading, respectively. This is because both dowel bars and key joints can facilitate the transfer of higher stresses across the joint. Additionally, the joint depth contributes positively to the stiffness and loading capacity of the UHPC segmental joints.","fluidex; related topics, engineering","Civil and Structural Engineering, Architecture, Building and Construction, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"

Methods: We accessed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for DC cases from 1975 to 2020. Three electronic databases were also searched for additional DCs. Individual patient data of DC patients from SEER and published literature were combined in integrated analyses. Results: After excluding duplicated patients, we identified 14 and 116 DC patients from SEER and published literature, respectively. There were 74 de novo, 39 secondary, and 18 cases with unknown origin. Our results showed that de novo and secondary DCs were not statistically different in terms of age, gender, primary location, tumor size, distant metastasis at diagnosis, extent of resection, and chemotherapy receipt. There was limited available molecular data for de novo and secondary DCs, though examples TP53 mutations were found in both. In addition, the rates of tumor relapse, metastasis during follow-up, and patient mortality were also comparable between the 2 groups. In the multivariate Cox regression model, we demonstrated that gross total removal and radiotherapy use were associated with prolonged survival of DCs. Conclusions: De novo and secondary DCs were statistically comparable in terms of patient demographics, clinical manifestations, and prognoses.

However, due to limitations in size and weight, it is very challenging to select motors that can generate enough power to provide sufficient grip force and high grasp speed. Accordingly, this research proposes a new prosthetic hand design using a dual-motor actuator as an actuation strategy, which consists of two motors separated by a differential mechanism to operate at the load (high force) and no-load (high speed) conditions individually. One motor is used for creating a high torque and the other for creating a high speed, so the prosthetic hand can operate at the loads without using a high-power motor with excessive size and weight. The developed prosthetic hand can perform grasping motions with the following achievements: It can provide a maximum grip force of 80.2 N and maintain a maximum of 62 N with non-backdrivable mechanisms, and provide an average closing time of 1.2 s. Furthermore, the design can provide more grip force than research prosthetic hands using a single motor.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence"

We take advantage of the existing public transport system to reduce the latency and deployment costs. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to find the optimal bus route for edge node deployment by prioritizing the number of workloads with the top-N technique.

Using cesium carbonate in the presence of 2-chloroacetamide and catalytic potassium iodide, α-mangostin (1) was subsequently transformed in three steps to provide ether 2, amide 3, and amine 4 in good yields at an optimum ratio of 1:3:3, respectively. The evaluation of the biological activities of α-mangostin and analogs 2–4 was described. Amine 4 showed promising cytotoxicity against the non-small-cell lung cancer H460 cell line fourfold more potent than that of cisplatin. Both compounds 3 and 4 possessed antitrypanosomal properties against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense at a potency threefold stronger than that of α-mangostin. Furthermore, ether 2 gave potent SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition by suppressing 3-chymotrypsinlike protease (3CLpro) activity approximately threefold better than that of 1. Fragment molecular orbital method (FMO–RIMP2/PCM) indicated the improved binding interaction of 2 in the 3CLpro active site regarding an additional ether moiety. Thus, the series of N-containing α-mangostin analogs prospectively enhance druglike properties based on isosteric replacement and would be further studied as potential biotically active chemical entries, particularly for anti-lung-cancer, antitrypanosomal, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 main protease applications.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"
Modeling of turbulent diffusion terms for one-dimensional interfacial area transport equation in vertical round channels,"Rassame S., Hibiki T.",2023-03-01,"Bubbly flow, Interfacial area concentrations, Interfacial area transport equation, Interfacial transfer, Mass energy, Mass momentum, One-dimensional, Relative deviations, Source terms, Turbulent diffusion, Bubbly flow, Interfacial area transport equation, Turbulent diffusion","The two-fluid model is comprised of the mass, momentum, and energy equations for liquid and gas phases separately. The terms of interfacial transfer govern mass, momentum, and energy transfer across the gas-liquid interface. The interfacial area concentration is critical to formulating the interfacial transfer terms. The one-dimensional Interfacial Area Transport Equation (IATE) has excellent potential in dynamically predicting the interfacial area concentration. The sink and source terms modeling for the interfacial area concentration is vital in the successful IATE development. The current IATE in bubbly flows considers the sink terms caused by bubble coalescence owing to random bubble collision and wake entrainment. The source term is caused by bubble breakup owing to turbulent impact. The turbulent diffusion term has not been considered in the current practice of one-dimensional IATE. This study developed the equation to predict the turbulent diffusion terms in the one-dimensional IATE for bubbly flow in vertical round channels. The predictive capability of the developed equation was validated with the collected database. The non-dimensionalized turbulent diffusion terms predicted by the developed equation agreed with those directly calculated by the experimental data. The developed turbulent diffusion term was also implemented in the one-dimensional IATE. The interfacial area concentrations predicted by the one-dimensional IATE with the turbulent diffusion term had a satisfactory agreement with the experimental results by the statistical parameters of the mean relative deviation of 3.76% and the mean absolute relative deviation of 10.1%.","energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"
"Phase stability, fuel properties, and diesel engine performance of palm-oil-based microemulsion biofuels","Attaphong C., Morawan N., Sarikprueck P., Charoensaeng A., Khaodhiar S.",2023-05-01,"Diesel engine performance, Direct use, Engine load, Engine performance, Ethanol blend, Fuel properties, Microemulsification, Oil based, Palm oil biodiesels, Stability properties, biodiesel, biofuel, engine performance, fuel property, microemulsion, palm oil","Microemulsification and blending are two viscosity-modifying techniques of vegetable oils for direct use with diesel engine. In this study, alcohol blends are mixtures of ethanol, diesel, and palm-oil biodiesel while microemulsion biofuels are thermodynamically stable, clear, and single-phase mixtures of diesel, palm oil, and ethanol stabilized by surfactants and cosurfactants. Although there are many studies on biofuels lately, there is limited research on using biodiesel as a surfactant in microemulsion formulations and applied on engine performance at different engine loads. Therefore, the objectives are to investigate phase stability and fuel properties of formulated biofuels (various blends and microemulsions), to determine the engine performance at different engine loads (no load, and from 0.5 to 2.0 kW), and to estimate laboratory-scale cost of the selected biofuels compared to diesel and biodiesel. The results showed that phase stability and fuel properties of selected microemulsion biofuels are comparable to diesel and biodiesel. These microemulsion biofuels can be applied to the diesel engine at different loads while diesel-ethanol blends and palm-oil-biodiesel-ethanol blends cannot be. It was found that the energy efficiencies of the system using microemulsion biofuels were slightly lower than the average energy efficiency of diesel engine. From this study, it can be summarized that microemulsion biofuels can be formulated using palm-oil biodiesel (palm-oil methyl ester) as a bio-based surfactant and they can be considered as environmentally-friendly alternatives to diesel and biodiesel. However, cost considerations showed that the raw materials should be locally available to reduce additional costs of microemulsion biofuels.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, Materials Science, chemistry","Chemical Engineering (all), Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry"
Influence of the Residual Ridge Widths and Implant Thread Designs on Implant Positioning Using Static Implant Guided Surgery,"Thanasrisuebwong P., Pimkhaokham A., Jirajariyavej B., Bencharit S.",2023-04-01,"Computer-Aided Design, Cone-Beam Computed Tomography, Dental Implantation, Endosseous, Dental Implants, Humans, Imaging, Three-Dimensional, Software, Surgery, Computer-Assisted, Accuracy, computer-aided, computer-assisted, digital, guided surgery, implant, implant design, implant surgery, implantology","Purpose: Aggressive implant macrothread designs have been widely used. However, the effects of the aggressive thread design on the accuracy of static guided surgery, especially in a case of narrow residual ridge, have not been well-studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different implant macrothread designs and the residual ridge widths on the accuracy of tooth-supported static guided implant surgery. Materials and methods: Forty implant fixtures with two different macrodesigns: a conventional thread design bone level tapered (BLT), and an aggressive thread design bone level tapered (BLX) were placed in 40 simulated polyurethane models with narrow and wide residual ridges. The placed implant positions were compared with the planned implant position and angulational deviation, as well as three-dimensional (3D) deviations at the entry and apex of the implant were measured. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons (ɑ = 0.05) were used to determine level of significance between the mean and variance deviation values. 95% confidence intervals and box plots were used to demonstrate the means and ranges of precision. Results: In terms of angulational deviation, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean deviations for both types of implants, p = 1.55 and p = 0.84 for wide and narrow ridge groups, respectively. However, the range of deviation was much larger in the narrow ridge of the BLX group compared to the BLT group. In both narrow ridge and wide ridge, the BLX group had lower mean 3D deviation values at both the entry and the apex with statistically significant differences for both entry point of the wide ridge (p = 0.027) and narrow ridge (p = 0.022) as well as at the apex of the wide ridge (p = 0.006) but not the apex of the narrow ridge (p = 0.142). Conclusion: The aggressive larger thread design of dental implants may influence the accuracy of implant placement more than the ridge dimension.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

AI-based applications can offer tools to examine high-volume data to inform predictive analytics that supports complex decision-making processes. Time-sensitive trauma and emergency contexts are often challenging. The study aims to investigate trauma and emergency surgeons’ knowledge and perception of using AI-based tools in clinical decision-making processes. Methods: An online survey grounded on literature regarding AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids was created by a multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). The survey was advertised to 917 WSES members through the society’s website and Twitter profile. Results: 650 surgeons from 71 countries in five continents participated in the survey. Results depict the presence of technology enthusiasts and skeptics and surgeons’ preference toward more classical decision-making aids like clinical guidelines, traditional training, and the support of their multidisciplinary colleagues. A lack of knowledge about several AI-related aspects emerges and is associated with mistrust. Discussion: The trauma and emergency surgical community is divided into those who firmly believe in the potential of AI and those who do not understand or trust AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids. Academic societies and surgical training programs should promote a foundational, working knowledge of clinical AI.",medical,"Surgery, Emergency Medicine"

However, the effects of the care bundle in broader population of patients undergoing surgery require confirmation. Methods and analysis The BigpAK-2 trial is an international, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial. The trial aims to enrol 1302 patients undergoing major surgery who are subsequently admitted to the intensive care or high dependency unit and are at high-risk for postoperative AKI as identified by urinary biomarkers (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2∗insulin like growth factor binding protein 7 (TIMP-2)∗IGFBP7)). Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either standard of care (control) or a KDIGO-based AKI care bundle (intervention). The primary endpoint is the incidence of moderate or severe AKI (stage 2 or 3) within 72 hours after surgery, according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Secondary endpoints include adherence to the KDIGO care bundle, occurrence and severity of any stage of AKI, change in biomarker values during 12 hours after initial measurement of (TIMP-2)∗(IGFBP7), number of free days of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), duration of RRT, renal recovery, 30-day and 60-day mortality, intensive care unit length-of-stay and hospital length-of-stay and major adverse kidney events. An add-on study will investigate blood and urine samples from recruited patients for immunological functions and kidney damage. Ethics and dissemination The BigpAK-2 trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Münster and subsequently by the corresponding Ethics Committee of the participating sites. A study amendment was approved subsequently. In the UK, the trial was adopted as an NIHR portfolio study.

It could be a sign of sleep apnea which leads to a potentially serious sleep disorder. Thus, detecting snoring sounds is the first step to diagnosing sleep disorders. Due to improving edge device performance, we can use edge devices, or mobile phones, to detect snoring during sleep. Edge devices allow us to deploy a machine learning model, which is a widely used technique to detect snoring. However, snoring sounds are privacy-sensitive data because they contain activity information through participants' sleep. This paper aims to detect snoring sounds on edge devices while preserving data privacy. We designed and implemented a convolutional-based neural network model that utilizes fewer commuting resources while maintaining the model's accuracy. The proposed model contains six two-dimensional convolutional and two fully connected layers. As a result, the accuracy is improved by 1.96% and the model size is reduced by 66%. Due to the smaller model size, the proposed model is able to maintain the model accuracy with lower required communication cost for federated learning when compared to the original accuracy.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, sociology","Computer Science Applications, Information Systems and Management, Media Technology, Education"

Final analysis results are presented. Patients and methods: KEYNOTE-122 was an open-label, randomized study conducted at 29 sites, globally. Participants with platinum-pretreated recurrent and/or metastatic NPC were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to pembrolizumab or chemotherapy with capecitabine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel. Randomization was stratified by liver metastasis (present versus absent). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), analyzed in the intention-to-treat population using the stratified log-rank test (superiority threshold, one-sided P = 0.0187). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population. Results: Between 5 May 2016 and 28 May 2018, 233 participants were randomly assigned to treatment (pembrolizumab, n = 117; chemotherapy, n = 116); Most participants (86.7%) received study treatment in the second-line or later setting. Median time from randomization to data cut-off (30 November 2020) was 45.1 months (interquartile range, 39.0-48.8 months). Median OS was 17.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.7-22.9 months] with pembrolizumab and 15.3 months (95% CI 10.9-18.1 months) with chemotherapy [hazard ratio, 0.90 (95% CI 0.67-1.19; P = 0.2262)].

In this work we report the fabrication of Lanthanum -doped indium sulfide thin films (In2S3:La) using a low-cost nebulizer spray pyrolysis method. La-doping concentration is varied from 0 to 5 wt% and the effect of doping on the properties of In2S3 thin films are investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra. Incorporation of 3 wt% of La3+ in In2S3 lattice has substantially improved the crystallinity, surface morphology and optical properties of the thin films suitable for the device fabrication. Moderate doping of La3+ in the crystal lattice of β-In2S3 led to a red-shift in the absorption edge, which benefited utilization of wider light spectrum. Photodetectors are fabricated using In2S3:La (0–5 wt%) films and photodetector performance parameters are evaluated using I-V characteristics and current–time characterization. The In2S3 film with 3% La dopant concentration showed high photodetector performance with estimated detectivity (D*), photoresponsivity (R), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.11 × 1011 Jones, 5.05 × 10-1 AW−1, 118% respectively. For the same sample, the rise and fall time calculated from transient photo-response analysis is found to be 0.4 s and 0.3 s respectively. These optimally doped In2S3:La 3wt% thin film samples could be useful for the fabrication of photosensor based optoelectronic devices.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, coastal engineering, physics","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Physics and Astronomy (all)"
Enhancement of methanogenic activity by micronutrient control: Micronutrient availability in relation to sulfur transport,"Pornmai K., Itsadanont S., Lertpattanapong M., Seneesrisakul K., Jiraprasertwong A., Leethochawalit M., Sekiguchi H., Chavadej S.",2023-05-01,"% reductions, CH 4, Chemical-oxygen demands, Cobalt-copper, Ethanol wastewater, Ferric, Methanogenic activity, Micronutrient, Process performance, Sulphur transport, Anaerobiosis, Bioreactors, Gases, Methane, Micronutrients, Sewage, Sulfur, Trace Elements, Biogas, Ethanol wastewater, Ferric, Micronutrients, Sulfur transport","The main purpose of this research was to clarify the influence of the addition of iron (Fe) alone (0–100 mg/L) or 50 mg/L of Fe with 2 mg/L each of cobalt (Co), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) on the methanogenic activity of a mesophilic two-stage UASB system treating ethanol wastewater at a fixed chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of 16 kg/m3/day under a continuous mode of operation and steady state condition. The addition of Fe provided the dual benefits of a reduction in both the dissolved sulfide and the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content in produced gas, resulting in marginally improved hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) productivities. When the Fe dosage was increased beyond the optimum value of 50 mg/L, the process performance drastically declined, as a consequence of the high total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations that inhibited both the acidogens and methanogens predominantly present in the 1st and 2nd reactors, respectively. The chemical precipitation of iron sulfide was responsible for the reduction of produced H2S in both the aqueous and gaseous phases as well as the minimization of added amounts of all other micronutrients to fulfil the sufficiency of all micronutrients for anaerobic digestion (AD). The addition of 2 mg/L each of Co, Cu and Ni together with 50 mg/L Fe resulted in the greatest enhancement in process performance, as indicated by the improved CH4 yield (mL/g COD applied) to about 42.3%, compared to that without micronutrient supplement.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Science (all)"

Hair follicle stem cells can be found in the dermal papilla at the base of the follicle and the bulge region, and they have garnered increased attention because of their potential to regenerate hair as well as their application for tissue repair. In recent years, these cells have been shown to affect hair restoration and prevent hair loss. These stem cells are endowed with mesenchymal characteristics and exhibit self-renewal and can differentiate into diverse cell types. As research in this field continues, it is probable that insights regarding stem cell maintenance, as well as their self-renewal and differentiation abilities, will benefit the application of these cells. In addition, an in-depth discussion is required regarding the molecular basis of cellular signaling and the influence of nature-derived compounds in stimulating the stemness properties of dermal papilla stem cells. This review summarizes (i) the potential of the mesenchymal cells component of the hair follicle as a target for drug action; (ii) the molecular mechanism of dermal papilla stem cells for maintenance of their stem cell function; and (iii) the positive effects of the natural product compounds in stimulating stemness in dermal papilla stem cells.

In addition, artifactual nitrosamine formation during sample preparation and injection leading to overestimation of nitrosamines has received considerable attention. Numerous analytical methodologies have been reported for quantifying nitrosamine impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients and medicinal products at the interim limit criteria as preventive measures. In this review, we meticulously discuss those reported gas and liquid chromatographic methods for nitrosamine determination in pharmaceuticals in aspects of chromatographic conditions and sensitivity of detection. We also introduce the potential of novel fluorescence-based methods recently developed to rapidly screen nitrosamine impurities. In addition, the review assesses the nitrosation assay procedure (NAP test), which is expected to be a future preventive measure for screening potential nitrosation and identifying suspected contamination with N-nitroso or other potential mutagenic impurities during the drug development process.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry",Analytical Chemistry

Effect of battery material and operation on dynamic performance of a vanadium redox flow battery under electrolyte imbalance conditions,"Jienkulsawad P., Jirabovornwisut T., Chen Y.-S., Arpornwichanop A.",2023-04-01,"Battery capacity, Battery performance, Capacity degradation, Condition, Dynamics models, Electrolyte imbalance, Life cycle analysis, Self-discharges, Side reactions, Vanadium redox flow batteries, Battery performance, Dynamic model, Electrolyte imbalance, Life cycle analysis, Vanadium redox flow battery","An electrolyte imbalance in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is a significant problem that can degrade the performance of VRFB during a long-term operation. The systematic analysis of a VRFB is, therefore, performed to examine the battery performance and capacity degradation caused by an electrolyte imbalance through the use of different electrode materials and membranes, which consider carbon felt structures and their treatment, and cation- and anion-exchange types of membrane. A dynamic model of the VRFB explains the gas evolutions and self-discharge side reactions coupled with the mass balance of the vanadium and proton ions. Investigation of the VRFB performance reveals that the rate of capacity loss resulting from the electrolyte imbalance considerably depends on the material and operating conditions. The variation of the vanadium ions during long-term operation depends on the gassing and self-discharge side reactions. The VRFB using Type 3 electrodes and an AMV membrane provides the highest energy efficiency. The battery operating time is considered a key factor in managing the vanadium variation caused by self-discharge reactions. Current density, temperature, and total vanadium concentration are found to affect the battery capacity degradation rate. A high-capacity degradation rate is observed under low current density, high temperature, and high total vanadium concentration conditions. However, changes in the electrolyte flow rate do not improve the battery capacity during long-term operation because the state of charge of the VRFB decreases due to the electrolyte imbalance.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, fluidex; related topics, geobase; related topics, engineering, Mathematics, energy, environmental","Civil and Structural Engineering, Modeling and Simulation, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Pollution, Mechanical Engineering, Energy (all), Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Given their unique physicochemical properties, such as minuscule size (< 1 µm), surface charge, and high internal pressure, nanobubbles (NB) could provide new opportunities in the fields of environmental engineering (including environmental remediation, water treatment, aerobic fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and algal biomass production), and agriculture (including agronomy, horticulture, aquaculture, aquaponics, bioponics, and hydroponics). In addition, applying NB-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) can inactivate pathogens in water treatment, remove harmful microorganisms on food, and remove persistent organic pollutants from wastewater (removal efficacies > 60%). NB technology can also maintain high aqueous phase dissolved oxygen levels compared to conventional aeration, as demonstrated in hydroponics and intensive crop farming, where NB-treated water led to increases in plant yields (10–40%). However, a concise and comprehensive source of information on the fundamental mechanisms involving NB technology is lacking. As NB applications advance into the biological frontier, these mechanisms serve as critical knowledge areas toward understanding the NB–biomolecular and cellular mechanisms of action. In addition, mass transfer performance is not stringently assessed. To advance and summarize current understanding, this review provides an updated, in-depth discussion of the fundamental mechanisms and performance of NB technologies for various applications in environmental and agricultural fields. Mechanistic details focusing on electrostatic and hydrophobic attachment, the formation of ROS, and gas–liquid mass transfer are discussed. This review further outlines the opportunities and challenges and concludes with important research needs in NB technology.","environmentalronmental Health Professionsth and pollution control, geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Water Science and Technology, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The aim of this study was to determine whether children with CHD and ADHD clinically treated with stimulant medication were at increased risk for changes in cardiovascular parameters or death compared with CHD-matched controls.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, patients with CHD + ADHD treated with stimulant medication (exposed group [EG]) were matched by CHD diagnosis and visit age to patients not on stimulants (nonexposed group [NEG]). Cardiovascular parameters (heart rate [HR] and systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP and DBP]) and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from medical records over 12 months were compared using mixed effects models.Results:Cardiovascular parameters for 151 children with CHD (mean age 8 ± 4 years) were evaluated (N = 46 EG and N = 105 NEG). Stimulant medication use was not associated with sudden cardiac death. HR and SBP did not significantly change over time in the EG and remained similar between groups. EG children had higher DBP compared with NEG children over time (p = 0.001). Group × time interactions for HR, SBP, and DBP were not different between the EG and NEG. QTc was not significantly different between the EG and NEG (447 ms vs 439 ms, p = 0.23). EG children demonstrated improvement in ADHD symptoms.Conclusion:Stimulant medication use in children with CHD was not associated with clinically significant changes in cardiovascular parameters compared with controls. Stimulants should be considered for ADHD treatment in children with CHD when prescribed with appropriate monitoring and coordination with the cardiologist.","medical, psychology","Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Developmental and Educational Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health"

The CAR cryogels were prepared by freeze-drying method based on the effects of CAR types which were different sulfate ester group content in the structure, K-CAR concentrations, and blending K and I-CAR. According to the results, the increasing K-CAR concentrations affected to reduce the swelling behavior and pore size of cryogels. However, the swelling behavior was increased and pore size was decreased with blending K/I-CAR. The release mechanism of DCNa and Theo was a non-fickian and fickian diffusion depending on drug types, cryogels composition, and applied electric potentials. The amount of drug release was decreased with increasing K-CAR concentrations and decreased with a blending K/I-CAR. However, the amount of drug release was increased with increasing electric potential, especially an anionic drug. The amount of DCNa was higher than that of Theo with and without applied electric potential. The maximum amount of drug release was 78.06 and 58.78% for DCNa and Theo, respectively. Thus, the CAR cryogel is suitable for controlled release of ionic and non-ionic drug with and without applied electric field.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

These were accomplished through a light-induced intramolecular photoredox reaction using blue light (4 W) and Steglich esterification, respectively. Renieramycin M (4), a bis-tetrahydroisoquinolinequinone compound isolated from the Thai blue sponge (Xestospongia sp.), served as the starting material. The cytotoxicity of the 10 natural and semisynthesized renieramycins against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was evaluated. The 5-O-(4′-pyridinecarbonyl) renieramycin T (11) compound exhibited high cytotoxicity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 35.27 ± 1.09 and 34.77 ± 2.19 nM against H290 and H460 cells, respectively. Notably, the potency of compound 11 was 2-fold more than that of renieramycin T (7) and equal to those of 4 and doxorubicin. Interestingly, the renieramycin-type derivatives with a hydroxyl group at C-5 and C-22 exhibited weak cytotoxicity. In silico molecular docking and dynamics studies confirmed that the mitogen-activated proteins, kinase 1 and 3 (MAPK1 and MAPK3), are suitable targets for 11. Thus, the structure–cytotoxicity study of renieramycins was extended to facilitate the development of potential anticancer agents for NSCLC cells.",pharmacology,"Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)"

Overexpression of PLK1 has been associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal bile duct cancer and the current treatments in inoperable patients have not been satisfactory. In order to develop novel targeted therapies, we investigated the efficacy of BI6727 (volasertib) and GSK461364A, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors in KKU-100 and KKU-213A CCA cell lines. PLK1 expression was significantly up-regulated in CCA cases compared with normal tissues based on the results derived from GEPIA. Western blot results exhibited PLK1 protein expression in both CCA cell lines. Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations based on MM/GBSA method revealed that BI6727-PLK1 and GSK461364A-PLK1 complexes were stable in an aqueous environment, and their complexation was mainly driven by Van der Waals interaction. BI6727 and GSK461364A clearly suppressed CCA cell proliferation and induced G2/M arrest, accompanied with upregulation of cyclin B1 and phosphorylated Histone H3 at Ser10 (pS10H3), specific markers of mitosis. Furthermore, both compounds triggered mitotic catastrophe followed by cell apoptosis via activation of PARP and Caspase 3, as well as downregulation of Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic protein in both CCA cell lines. In conclusion, pharmacologic PLK1 inhibition by BI6727 and GSK461364A blocked survival of CCA cells by several mechanisms. Our study provides evidence that BI6727 and GSK461364A could be alternative drugs and have potential implications at the clinical level for CCA therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Cell Biology"

Previously, we have showed that a crab proline-rich AMP designated as SpPR-AMP1 is a potent AMP that exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we demonstrated the importance of SpPR-AMP1 peptide in treating a virulent acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) Vibrio campbellii VH-639 isolate and eliciting the innate immune response to counter the AHPND infection in shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. SpPR-AMP1 exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity against V. campbellii VH-639 at MIC value of 0.195–0.39 μM. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the membrane disruption potential of SpPR-AMP1 against the V. campbellii VH-639 cells. The in vivo effect of SpPR-AMP1 in shrimp L. vannamei was investigated and the results showed that SpPR-AMP1 was capable of modulating the innate immune response by stimulating the expression levels of AMP transcripts in shrimp hemocytes. Moreover, treatments with SpPR-AMP1 could promote the resistance of shrimp against V. campbellii VH-639 infection as demonstrated by a significant increase in shrimp survival rate and decrease in both the bacterial load and the expression levels of bacterial PirA and PirB toxin gene transcripts in the infected shrimp. These results suggest the potential of SpPR-AMP1 peptide with the combined antimicrobial and immunoenhancing capabilities as promising antimicrobial agent to treat V. campbellii VH-639 causing AHPND infection in shrimp aquaculture.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

Methods: This was a combined study between retrospective review of medical records and a cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 500 dyads of antidepressant-treated MDD patients and their unpaid caregivers. MDD patients’ medical records, the concept of healthcare resource utilization, the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: depression and mood & mental state versions (WPAI: D, MM), the Class Impairment Questionnaire (CIQ), and the Family Experiences Interview Schedule (FEIS) were applied as the tools of the study. Pearson Chi’s square, Fisher’s Exact test, and independent T-test were employed for statistical analysis. Results: The proportion of TRD was 19.6% among antidepressant-treated MDD patients in a Thai tertiary public hospital. The results of the study indicated that several factors showed a statistically significant association with TRD criteria. These factors included younger age of MDD patients, a younger age of onset of MDD, lower body mass index (BMI), a history of suicide attempts and self-harm, as well as frequent smoking behavior. The annualized economic cost of TRD was 276,059.97 baht per person ($7,668.33), which was significantly higher than that of cost of non-TRD (173,487.04 baht or $4,819.08). The aggregated economic costs of MDD were 96.8 million baht annually ($2.69 M) if calculated from 500 MDD patients and unpaid caregivers. This contributed to the economic cost of TRD 27.05 million baht (98 respondents) and the economic cost of non-TRD 69.74 million baht (402 respondents). Conclusions: The economic burden associated with TRD was significantly higher compared to non-TRD among antidepressant-treated MDD patients. Specifically, both direct medical costs and indirect costs were notably elevated in the TRD group.",medical,"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

In particular, fine particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) in the atmosphere is a major concern for human health. The modelling (analysis and prediction) of particulate matter concentrations remains unsatisfactory owing to the rapid increase in urbanization and industrialization. In the present study, we reconstructed a prediction model for both PM2.5 and PM10 with varying meteorological conditions (windspeed, temperature, precipitation, specific humidity, and air pressure) in a specific region. In this study, a prediction model was developed for the two observation stations in the study region. The analysis of particulate matter shows that seasonal variation is a primary factor that highly influences air pollutant concentrations in urban regions. Based on historical data, the maximum number of days (92 days in 2019) during the winter season exceeded the maximum permissible level of particulate matter (PM2.5 = 15 μg/m3) concentration in air. The prediction results showed better performance of the Gaussian process regression model, with comparatively larger R2 values and smaller errors than the other models. Based on the analysis and prediction, these novel methods may enhance the accuracy of particulate matter prediction and influence policy- and decision-makers among pollution control authorities to protect air quality.","fluidex; related topics, aerosols, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The coated paperboards exhibited color difference values compared with an uncoated paperboard in the range of 0.4 to <2 which is hardly distinguishable from the human eye. These results suggest that a biopolymer obtained from modified bamboo leaves does in fact provide a suitable replacement for hydrophobic coating on paper.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)
Chemical recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) wastes by oxidative degradation to dicarboxylic acids and their use as value-added curing agents for acrylate-based materials,"Pinsuwan K., Opaprakasit P., Petchsuk A., Dubas L., Opaprakasit M.",2023-04-01,"Acid ratio, Acrylate copolymers, Carbon recovery, Chemical recycling, Diacid, High-density polyethylenes, Oxidative degradation, Succinic acids, UV curable, UV-curable acrylate copolymer, Chemical recycling, Diacids, HDPE, Oxidative degradation, UV-curable acrylate copolymers","Plastic waste has become a serious pollution problem due to the material's high consumption volume and durability. Therefore, effective waste treatment and conversion technology are urgently required. In this work, a chemical recycling process has been developed to convert high-density polyethylene (HDPE) from post-consumer milk bottles to value-added chemicals, especially mixed diacids with high succinic acid content, via hydrothermal nitric acid oxidation. The results reveal that HDPE can be completely recycled into water-soluble compounds with a yield ranging from 15 to 70% (∼8–36% carbon recovery) at 180–200 °C for 2–4 h. The oxidized products examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy are a mixture of succinic acid (C4), glutaric acid (C5), and adipic acid (C6), whose compositions are strongly governed by the reaction temperature, reaction time, filling capacity, nitric acid concentration and the HDPE/nitric acid ratio. With 20 ml of 0.18 g/ml nitric acid solution (1/7.2 HDPE/nitric acid ratio), a maximum product yield (%carbon recovery) of 69% (35%) with C4:C5:C6+ ratio of 55:30:15 (mol%) is achieved at 180 °C for 3 h. When the filling capacity was increased from 40 to 60% by adding extra water at the same HDPE: nitric acid ratio, prolonging the reaction time for 1 h resulted in the products with a high succinic acid composition (>94%) and 75% yield (36% carbon recovery). The benefits of employing dilute nitric acid solutions with the same HDPE: nitric acid ratio on the selectivity of succinic acid is also confirmed by a reaction at 200 °C for 2 h. As oxidation typically occurs at a higher rate at a higher temperature, the maximum product yield (∼53–56%) is received at 200 °C for 2 h. This lower optimum yield obtained at higher reaction temperature and higher nitric acid concentration implies heterogeneous degradation due to limited diffusion of reactive molecules. By adjusting the HDPE: nitric acid ratio (1:3.6 to 1:10.8), the optimum content of nitric acid is in a range of 3.6x–5.4x. The as-received products are successfully developed as UV-curable acrylate precursors by esterifying their carboxylic groups with hydroxyethyl acrylate, using 5 mol% p-toluene sulfonic acid as a catalyst. UV-cured sheets obtained after irradiating under a UV lamp for 10 min have a gel fraction of 80–90% tested in toluene, chloroform, and ethanol.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanics of Materials, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
PRB inhibited cell proliferation through let-7b-E2F1 in breast cancer,"Asavasupreechar T., Saito-Koyama R., Miki Y., Tamai K., Abe J., Inoue C., Sato I., Boonyaratanakornkit V., Sasano H.",2023-07-01,"Breast Neoplasms, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, E2F1 Transcription Factor, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, MicroRNAs, Receptors, Progesterone, cell proliferation, E2F1, let-7b, progesterone receptor isoform B","The presence of progesterone receptor (PR) and PR isoform B (PRB) in breast cancer is generally correlated with better clinical outcomes. Additionally, the significance of hormone-independent effects of PR/PRB correlated with better prognosis has been reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the detailed mechanism of that still remains unclear. In this study, we examined how microRNAs (miRNAs) could contribute to tumor inhibition via PR/PRB expression, in order to find miRNAs that have tumor-agnostic effects between breast cancer and NSCLC. We obtained miRNA data using human tissues of breast cancer and NSCLC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA) database and PCR array from NSCLC patients of our cohort. Subsequently, we examined the function of the miRNA through in vitro study using breast cancer cell lines. As a result, only let-7b expression was significantly correlated with PR expression in both cancers. Additionally, the expression of let-7b significantly inhibited cell proliferation by inducing PR and PRB expression in breast cancer cell lines. However, the positive correlation of let-7b and PRB required a mediated factor, E2 promoter binding factor 1 (E2F1), obtained from TGCA database analysis. In vitro experiments showed that let-7b significantly inhibited E2F1, and E2F1 significantly inhibited PRB. This study revealed that PRB inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells by the let-7b-E2F1 interaction. In addition, the immunohistochemical analysis in NSCLC was also consistent with these in vitro data. Our results could contribute to developing novel therapeutic strategies for patients with PR/PRB-positive cancer by targeting let-7b or PRB expression in breast cancer and possibly NSCLC.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Oncology, Endocrinology, Cancer Research"
Cell Wall Mannan of Candida Attenuates Osteogenic Differentiation by Human Dental Pulp Cells,"Bulanawichit W., Nguyen T.N.Y., Ritprajak P., Nowwarote N., Osathanon T.",2023-02-01,"Candida, Cell Differentiation, Cell Wall, Dental Caries, Dental Pulp, Humans, Interleukin-12, Mannans, Osteogenesis, Candida albicans mannan, human dental pulp cells, osteogenic differentiation","Introduction: Candida spp. has recently been introduced to interact with conventional carious bacteria, leading to dental caries progression and virulence ability. Evidence regarding the influence of Candida spp. on human dental pulp cell response remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Candida albicans mannans on cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and inflammatory-related gene expression in human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). Methods: hDPCs were treated with cell wall mannans isolated from C. albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropocalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis. Cell viability was performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Osteogenic differentiation– and inflammatory-related gene expression were determined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Mineralization was examined using alizarin red S staining. Results: The treatment of mannans isolated from C. albicans, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. tropocalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. dubliniensis at concentrations ranging from 10–100 μg/mL did not affect cytotoxicity or cell proliferation. Mannans isolated from C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropocalis significantly attenuated mineralization. However, cell wall mannans isolated from C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. dubliniensis did not significantly influence mineral deposition in hDPCs. C. albicans cell wall mannans significantly attenuated osteogenic differentiation–related gene expression (RUNX2, ALP, and ENPP1). Interestingly, IL12 messenger RNA expression was significantly upregulated when treated with C. albicans cell wall mannans. The addition of recombinant IL12 significantly decreased mineralization in hDPCs. Conclusions: C. albicans cell wall mannans attenuated osteogenic differentiation in hDPCs and up-regulated inflammatory-related gene IL12 expression.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Methods: A prospective study including singleton pregnancy presenting at an antenatal clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University from 2019–March 2020 was conducted. Serum SHARP1 was collected at the gestational age (GA) of 11–13+6weeks, and transabdominal uterine artery Doppler ultrasound was performed at GA of 18–24 weeks. Serum SHARP1 level and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) were combined to calculate the predictive value for preeclampsia detection. Results: 288 pregnant women were enrolled in the first trimester, but only 249 participants completed the study. Thirteen patients had preeclampsia (5.2%), which three cases (1.2%) had early-onset preeclampsia. The median serum SHARP1 level in the first trimester of pregnant women with preeclampsia was lower than the normal pregnancy group (1392 pg/ml vs. 1941 pg/ml, p = 0.046). The second-trimester uterine artery PI and prevalence of early diastolic notching were higher in the preeclampsia group than in the normal pregnancy group (p = 0.029 and p = 0.001, respectively). When the first-trimester serum SHARP1 level is combined with the second-trimester uterine artery PI, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for preeclampsia prediction were 84.6%, 47.5%, 8.2%, and 98.3%, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that serum SHARP1 level in the first trimester combined with the uterine artery PI in the second trimester had good sensitivity to predict preeclampsia.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Obstetrics and Gynecology"

Synthesis and crystallization of the complex has been achieved at ambient conditions using methanol-water (4:1 v/v) as a solvent mixture after very slow evaporation. Furthermore, the complex is characterized by elemental analyses, spectroscopic methods (UV–Visible, FT-IR) and structure elucidation has been carried out by single crystal X-ray structure analyses. X-ray structure determination of the complex revealed the presence of [Cu(H3tea)2]2+ as a cation and two moieties of 3,4-dimethoxycinnamate as anions forming a second sphere coordination complex. Various weak (non-covalent) interactions such as C–H∙∙∙O, and O–H∙∙∙O impart an important role in the lattice stabilization of a second sphere coordination complex. Hirshfeld surface calculations clearly revealed the existence of interplay of non-covalent interactions in lattice stabilization. The theoretical calculation also suggested the total interaction energies in this complex, i.e. 32.6 kj.mol−1. In addition, molecular docking investigations of this complex clearly showed that there is substantial protein-ligand interaction with best binding scores of -7.2, -7.3, -7.9 kcal/mol against 4GKU, 3W4P, 5CGX and -5.8, -7.8 kcal/mol against 4HFZ, 1D5R proteins lesser than parent acid i.e. 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid indicating the potential of this complex; [Cu(H3tea)2](3,4-DMC)2·2H2O as antibacterial and anticancer agent respectively.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Methods: In a prospective longitudinal cohort of PWH and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection living in Bangkok, Thailand, we collected blood and liver biopsies from 18 participants prior to and following ART and quantified HIV and HBV persistence using quantitative (q)PCR and RNA/DNAscope. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug levels were quantified using mass spectroscopy. Findings: In liver biopsies taken prior to ART, HIV DNA and HIV RNA were detected by qPCR in 53% (9/17) and 47% (8/17) of participants respectively. Following a median ART duration of 3.4 years, HIV DNA was detected in liver in 61% (11/18) of participants by either qPCR, DNAscope or both, but only at very low and non-quantifiable levels. Using immunohistochemistry, HIV DNA was observed in both hepatocytes and liver infiltrating CD4+ T cells on ART. HIV RNA was not detected in liver biopsies collected on ART, by either qPCR or RNAscope. All ARVs were clearly detected in liver tissue.

Moreover, questionnaires with face-to-face interviews were used to make a health risk assessment and to determine the associated factors. The median of As in urine was 61.33 μg/L (5.38–600.86 μg/L), accounting for 68.18% of participants who exposed to the contaminated groundwater had obviously high urinary As levels, exceeded the normal value of 50 μg/L of As, as set by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The major factor affecting As in urine was the As contaminated groundwater. Pearson's chi-squared test showed that the urinary As level was influenced on the different groups of As level in groundwater (p-value <0.001). Multiple linear regression confirmed that the actual risk factors of As in urine were the As level in groundwater and the oral exposure route but not the dermal contact. Meanwhile binary logistic regression revealed that all socio-demographic factors were not influenced. Approximately 45.45% of the area had the HI above the risk level of 1, mostly via groundwater drinking pathway. The estimated total cancer risk values, 5.11 × 10−6 to 2.08 × 10−3, were higher than the safe level of 10−6. For long-term exposure, the As concentration and exposure duration were the most variables influencing health risk level. This finding suggests that chronic As exposure should be monitored and also the groundwater should be improved to provide the safe drinking water for the residents.","water engineeringneering, environmental, chemistry, medical","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemistry (all), Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"
Association between greenness and cardiovascular risk factors: Results from a large cohort study in Thailand,"Paoin K., Pharino C., Phosri A., Ueda K., Seposo X.T., Kelly M., Seubsman S.-A., Sleigh A.",2023-03-01,"China, Cholesterol, Cohort Studies, Humans, Hypertension, Longitudinal Studies, Thailand, Diabetes, EVI, High blood cholesterol, High blood pressure, NDVI","Background: The risk of cardiovascular diseases may be reduced by residing in green environments. However, there are relatively few longitudinal cohort studies, especially in Southeast Asia, that focused on the health benefits of long-term greenness exposure in young adults. The present study examined the association between long-term exposure to residential greenness and self-reported morbidities in participants of the Thai Cohort Study (TCS) in Thailand from 2005 to 2013. Methods: The self-reported outcomes, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes, were reported in 2005, 2009, and 2013, where the study participants provided the exact year of disease occurrence. Greenness was assessed by the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), with a spatial resolution of 250 m. Long-term exposure to NDVI and EVI of each participant's sub-district was averaged over the period of person-time. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between greenness and health outcomes. Associations with self-reported morbidity were measured using hazard ratios (HRs) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI and EVI. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed that an IQR increase in NDVI was associated with lower incidence of high blood pressure (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.97) and high blood cholesterol (HR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.87, 0.92), but not significantly associated with diabetes (HR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.85, 1.01). EVI was also inversely associated with self-reported high blood pressure (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.88, 0.96), high blood cholesterol (HR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.87, 0.91), and diabetes (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.85, 0.99). Conclusions: Long-term exposure to residential greenness was inversely associated with self-reported high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes in participants of TCS. Our study provides evidence that greenness exposure may reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors in adult population.","medicalcal geography, biochemistryistry, environmental","Biochemistry, Environmental Science (all)"
Boron vacancy-driven thermodynamic stabilization and improved mechanical properties of AlB2-type tantalum diborides as revealed by first-principles calculations,"Ektarawong A., Johansson E., Pakornchote T., Bovornratanaraks T., Alling B.",2023-04-01,"Boron-deficient tantalum diboride, Cluster expansion, Elastic properties, First principle calculations, First principles, First-principle cluster expansion, Tantalum diboride, Thermodynamic stabilization, Thermodynamically stable, Transition metal diborides, boron-deficient tantalum diboride, first-principles cluster expansion, mechanical properties, thermodynamic stability, transition-metal diborides","Thermodynamic stability as well as structural, electronic, and elastic properties of boron-deficient AlB2-type tantalum diborides, which is designated as α − TaB 2 − x , due to the presence of vacancies at its boron sublattice are studied via first-principles calculations. The results reveal that α − TaB 2 − x , where 0.167 ≲ x ≲ 0.25, is thermodynamically stable even at absolute zero. On the other hand, the shear and Young’s moduli as well as the hardness of stable α − TaB 2 − x are predicted to be superior as compared to those of α − TaB2. The changes in the relative stability and also the elastic properties of α − TaB 2 − x with respect to those of α − TaB2 can be explained by the competitive effect between the decrease in the number of electrons filling in the antibonding states of α − TaB2 and the increase in the number of broken bonds around the vacancies, both induced by the increase in the concentration of boron vacancies. A good agreement between our calculated lattice parameters, elastic moduli and hardness of α − TaB 2 − x and the experimentally measured data of as-synthesized AlB2-type tantalum diborides with the claimed composition of TaB ∼ 2 , available in the literature, suggests that, instead of being a line compound with a stoichiometric composition of TaB2, AlB2-type tantalum diboride is readily boron-deficient, and its stable composition in equilibrium may be ranging at least from TaB ∼ 1.833 to TaB ∼ 1.75 . Furthermore, the substitution of vacancies for boron atoms in α − TaB2 is responsible for destabilization of WB2-type tantalum diboride and orthorhombic Ta2B3, predicted in the previous theoretical studies to be thermodynamically stable in the Ta−B system, and it thus enables the interpretation of why the two compounds have never been realized in actual experiments.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

In order to decrement the pollutants and energy consumption, it is essential to apply promising technologies with proper performance and reliability. Regarding the better performance of heat pumps, in term of energy consumption and environmental effects, compared with the conventional cooling and heating technologies, these systems have attracted attentions in recent years. These systems can become more environmentally friendly by integration with other renewable energy systems and clean technologies. PV module, as a clean technology for power generation can be integrated with heat pumps to enhance the overall performance in terms of Coefficient of Performance (COP), environment and economy. Regarding several advantageous of these systems and existence of different configurations and systems, i.g. conventional, solar-assisted and ground source heat pumps, and great progress on their modification by the scholars, it is requisite to provide an updated and complete review on these systems by considering various technologies and particular focus on the recent research works. In this study, research works on the heat pumps systems integrated with PV modules are reviewed and their findings are discussed. According to the findings of the reviewed researches, the systems performance is depending on various elements such as the operating condition, configuration of the system, characteristics of the units etc. Making use of PV cells and integrating them with heat pumps could lead to energy and cost saving. For instance, it has been observed that by using hybrid systems composed of optimal control, PV cells, heat pumps and wind energy, energy saving of more than 50 % is achievable. Aside from the technical and cost benefits of using the PV integrated heat pumps, CO2 emission can be reduced, by up to 73 % reported in a study, for both heating and cooling purposes which means that these systems are proper towards decarbonization in buildings.","fuel and energygy; others, sociology, energy, environmental","Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law"

The accurate quantification of such risks is crucial in managing beaches effectively and establishing warning guidelines. In this study, we employed a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to assess marine water quality and estimate the risks associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an autochthonous pathogen that causes gastrointestinal illnesses, and enterococci, a traditional fecal bacteria indicator. The microbial contamination levels of V. parahaemolyticus and enterococci were determined from 48 water samples collected at two beaches in Thailand during dry and wet seasons. The accidentally ingested water volumes were obtained through a survey involving 438 respondents. The probability of illness (Pill) was estimated using dose–response models and Monte Carlo simulation. The results revealed that enterococci posed a higher risk of illness than V. parahaemolyticus at all seven study sites. The median combined gastrointestinal (GI) risk from both bacteria at all sites met the US EPA risk benchmark of 0.036 and the 0.05 benchmark set by the WHO, but the 95th percentile risk data at all sites exceeded the benchmarks. This emphasizes the need for the continuous monitoring and management of microbial pollution at these sites. The site-specific exposure data showed higher estimated risks with increased variations compared to the WHO-referenced values, which highlights the significance of locally measured microbial concentrations and survey exposure data to avoid underestimation. Estimating the risks from recreational exposure to waterborne bacteria can inform beach management policies aimed at reducing public health risks to swimmers. The study findings improve the understanding of the risks associated with water recreation activities at Southeast Asian beaches and offer valuable insights for the development of water quality guidelines, which are crucial for the sustainable development of the blue economy.","coastal and ocean engineeringneering, environmental","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution"

The Nuclear Accident Consequence Analysis Code (NACAC) has been developed as an in-house code by the Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology to develop its capability for understanding the transboundary radiological effect of a hypothetical nuclear accident. To verify the performance of the NACAC, a comparison between the calculated results using the NACAC with those from the well-developed Java-based Real-time On-line Decision Support (JRODOS) code is performed with representative cases of all seasons in a year. Two hypothetical severe accidents at the Fangchenggang pressurized water reactor, namely, (i) a loss of off-site power and (ii) a large-break loss of coolant, are utilized as the initial boundary conditions. The air concentration characteristic maps obtained from both codes are analyzed, revealing that the dominant radionuclide dispersion pathways are similar in all study cases. The air concentration, ground concentration, and total effective dose rate at several locations up to 500 km away from the release point are directly compared. Typically, the calculated results from the two codes are in reasonable agreement. However, for specific locations and directions, the NACAC predictions of the concentrations and total effective dose rate are lower than those from the JRODOS. These differences may be influenced by the different trajectory calculations between the two codes, which resulted in varying plume densities in certain areas. However, it does not significantly affect the radiation effect assessment. The NACAC still provides a total effective dose rate corresponding to the JRODOS, lower than one mSv throughout the main dispersion direction.","energy, engineering, environmental","Nuclear Energy and Engineering, Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Waste Management and Disposal"

Herein, new phases of Mg − B − H ternary hydrides are predicted from the first-principles evolutionary techniques, as a result of which the corresponding phonon and electronic calculations for the three candidate phases are performed successively to confirm their dynamic stability and the possibility to become conductors. The metallic MgBH9 undergoes a superconducting phase with a maximum Tc of 64 K at 110 GPa, with its spectral function predominantly active around optical modes. The significant increase in cumulative electron-phonon coupling constant is associated with a relatively low cutoff frequency according to the bandwidth function. As for the non-metallic candidate, hydrogen-vacancy diffusion kinetics of the MgB2H8 phase are determined by means of total energy calculations. Stable pathways at varying pressure are reported, suggesting that elevated pressure lowers the activation energy which is presumably due to an optimal level of average nearest H − H(B) inter-fragment distances.","fluidex; related topics, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

However, no clear evidence exists concerning antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) opportunistic pathogens that cause wound infections and pyoderma in canines and zoonotic disease. Aim of the study: The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of P. betle extract were assessed against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP strains. Materials and methods: Ethanol leaf extract of P. betle was investigated for its antibacterial effect on S. pseudintermedius and MRSP by broth microdilution and time-kill assays. Biofilm inhibition and production assays were performed to evaluate antibiofilm and biofilm eradication effects, respectively. Biofilm-associated gene expression was further studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The possible interaction between IcaA and major compounds in P. betle was analyzed by molecular docking. Results: The extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 250 μg/mL. Growth inhibition of P. betle at 1 MIC against the bacteria was initially observed after treatment for 4 h. All isolates were completely killed after 18 h exposure to the extract. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) of the extract against the tested isolates ranged 1/2 MIC to 1 MIC, while minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of P. betle was initialed at 8 MIC.

The extract at 1/2 MIC and 1 MIC values inhibited biofilm formation up to 100%, with bacterial biofilm removed at up to 94.21% by 4 MIC of the extract. The extract downregulated the expression of the icaA gene among biofilm-producing isolates. The most abundant compounds, 4-allyl-1,2-diacetoxybenzene and eugenol showed a strong affinity with IcaA protein at −5.65 and −5.31 kcal/mol, respectively. Conclusions: P. betle extract demonstrated the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and biofilm-removal activity against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP. Downregulation of the icaA gene expression and protein interaction were possible modes of action of the extract that impacted biofilm production. This extract showed promise as an alternative treatment for S. pseudintermedius infection, especially drug-resistant and biofilm-associated cases.",pharmacology,"Pharmacology, Drug Discovery"
"In silico molecular docking approach and in vitro cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of Ixora brachiata Roxb","Veeramuthu K., Annadurai P., Gideon D.A., Sivaramakrishnan R., Sundarrajan B., Dhandayuthapani K., Pugazhendhi A.",2023-01-01,"Anti-inflammatories, Anti-inflammatory activity, Cytotoxic, Free radical-scavenging activities, Gaschromatography-mass spectrometry, In-silico, In-vitro, Ixorum brachiate, Leaf extracts, Molecular docking, Anti-inflammatory, Antioxidant, Cytotoxicity, GC-MS, Ixora brachiate, Molecular docking","The Ixora brachiata Roxb. methanolic leaf extract yielded significant in vitro free radical scavenging activity against DPPH (60% of inhibition obtained in 100 μg/mL) and ABTS (62% of inhibition obtained in 100 μg/mL) radicals, compared to ascorbic acid positive control. The antibacterial activity was modest when compared with antibiotics controls. The extract was effective, especially against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, yielding 5 ± 0.9 (mm) and 4 ± 0.5 (mm), respectively, at a 10 mg/mL concentration. MTT assay showed an IC50 value of 51 μg/mL. The plant extract was rich in antioxidants, and anthraquinones were detected. When compared to aspirin (100–800 μg/mL) which had much greater anti-inflammatory (HRBC stabilisation) activity of 45–84%, the methanolic extract of I. brachiata was found to possess 10–45% activity in the same concentration range of 100–800 μg/mL. Since aspirin is a pure compound (and a routinely employed anti-inflammatory standard) and the plant extract contains multiple compounds with differential anti-inflammatory activities, the activity of aspirin may have been much higher. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed the presence of different classes of primary and secondary metabolites in the leaf extract. The GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) study in the plant extract showed that ∼22 different volatile compounds were present. The in vitro cytotoxic potential of the extract was assessed in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, and the bioactive compounds β-sitosterol, γ-sitosterol, δ-tocopherol and squalene, which were identified through GC-MS, were further assessed for binding to salient receptor proteins which are routinely involved in breast cancer pathophysiology, like PI3K, MMP-9, mTOR and ERβ.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Bioengineering, Biochemistry, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

However, there is a lack of studies examining the relationship between sediment trapping efficiency and electricity generation on a basin-wide scale over time. This study aims to assess the efficiency of hydropower production in terms of reservoir sediment trapping. Modified Brune's method examined the relationship between trapped sediments in reservoirs and hydropower production, considering sediment projections for the near future. We divided the cases of existing and planned reservoirs in the mainstream river and subbasins to assess cumulative sediment trapping. Using the Lancang-Mekong River Basin as a case study, the following main findings were observed. Firstly, the existing reservoirs, under baseline conditions (2018), had the potential to trap approximately 60.9% or 82 Mt/yr of the total sediment load. Secondly, around 69% or 110 Mt/yr of the total sediments could be significantly trapped when considering the existing reservoirs and those planned according to the development plan of riparian countries. Thirdly, the hydropower production efficiency of most reservoirs in 2030 and 2040 experienced a significant decline of approximately 10%–20% and more than 30%, respectively. Therefore, sediment management is crucial for maintaining efficient hydropower production and achieving sustainable hydropower development through effective planning strategies.","petroleum substitutes; energygy sources; unconventional, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"
Oral status is associated with chewing difficulty in Thai older adults: data from a National Oral Health Survey,"Kaewkamnerdpong I., Harirugsakul P., Prasertsom P., Vejvithee W., Niyomsilp K., Gururatana O.",2023-12-01,"Aged, Cross-Sectional Studies, Dental Health Surveys, Humans, Mastication, Oral Health, Southeast Asian People, Thailand, Chewing difficulty, Older adults, Oral status, Thailand","Background: The number of older adults in Thailand is increasing. Better chewing ability is associated with healthy aging. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship between social backgrounds, dental service utilization, oral status and chewing difficulty, there is no study in Thailand using national oral health data to identify the variables involved with chewing difficulty among Thai older adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association between oral status, and chewing difficulty, adjusting for social backgrounds, and dental service utilization among Thai older adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the eighth Thai National Oral Health Survey (TNOHS). A stratified multi-stage method was used for sample selection. The eighth TNOHS was conducted from June–August 2017. Data were collected using interviews and clinical oral examinations by trained interviewers and trained dentists, respectively. The bivariate analysis, chi-square test was used to explore the associations between social backgrounds, dental service utilization, oral status, and chewing difficulty. Dependent variables with p-values of < 0.2 for their association with independent variables in the bivariate analysis were entered into the multiple logistic regression models. Results: This study found that older adults with at least 27 teeth (p < 0.05), or at least eight occlusal pairs (p < 0.05) or income exceeding 15,000 baht per month (p < 0.05) were more likely to have less chewing difficulty (p < 0.001), while the elderly who utilized dental services in the past 12 months were associated with more chewing difficulty than those who did not utilize dental services in the past 12 months (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We suggest that policymakers increase the number of preventive plans and set a goal for more than 20 remaining natural teeth and four posterior occlusal pairs in young and working aged people, especially in the low income group.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Its high commercial price and huge volume consumption currently pose a constraint regarding operational costs and environmental burdens. Therefore, this work aims to propose the adsorption by granular activated carbon (GAC) as a facile method for recycling the spent EL contaminated with oil. The results from batch experiments revealed that the adsorption of oil in EL was favorable and endothermic, reaching the maximum oil adsorptive capacity of 1053 mg g−1 at 35 °C. The adsorption process was best described by the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-first order kinetic models. Oil adsorption mechanisms were mainly controlled by film diffusion, hydrophobic interaction, and coalescence. The competitive adsorption of EL onto GAC through hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding was also observed. For column adsorption, all breakthrough curves were well explained by Clark and bed depth service time models. The maximum breakthrough removal efficiency of 99.3% was achieved from the flow rate of 1 mL min−1, initial oil of 500 mg L−1 and bed height of 12 cm. The spent GAC was regenerated by heating at 350 °C, provided with a regeneration efficiency of 95% after five adsorption-desorption cycles. The payback period of using EL extraction and recovery was estimated at 1.8 years, considering secure landfill as a baseline. These findings prove the industrial applicability of GAC adsorption for solvent recovery and promote EL as a more economically feasible solvent for greener management of oil-contaminated drill cuttings.","mixing and separation, coastal engineering, environmental","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Process Chemistry and Technology"

The proposed technique was implemented in a general framework that allowed the treatment of finite cracked bodies with general configurations, material anisotropy, and mode-mixity. A system of integral equations governing unknown data on the boundary, crack surface, and material interface was established using a pair of weakly singular weak-form displacement and traction integral equations together with continuity along the material interface. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method along with the finite element technique were implemented to solve the governing integral equations. In addition, the special near-front interpolation was employed to enhance the approximation of the relative crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack front. The solved crack-face data were used directly to post-process the stress intensity factors and T-stresses along the crack front. An extensive numerical study was carried out not only to demonstrate the accuracy, convergence, and capability of the proposed technique, but also to explore the influence of material stiffness and distance to the material interface on fracture data along the crack front.","vessels and marine engineeringneering, Materials Science, physics, engineering, Mathematics","Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mathematics"

Real-time quaking-induced conversion assay using a small-scale substrate production workflow for the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"Thanapornsangsuth P., Chongsuksantikul A., Saraya A.W., Hiransuthikul A., Hemachudha T.",2023-07-01,"Aged, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Sporadic, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prion Diseases, Prion Proteins, Prions, Sensitivity and Specificity, Workflow, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, diagnostic biomarker, low- and middle-income countries, prion disease surveillance, real-time quaking-induced conversion assay","The lack of a dedicated surveillance program for prion disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), has hindered the global effort to address this public health threat. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is considered the most reliable test for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), its availability in LMICs is limited because of its cost and technical difficulty in generating the recombinant prion protein substrate (recPrP). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of RT-QuIC with recPrP produced in-house through a small-scale method—that is, the application of reusable prepacked chromatography columns and subsequent dialysis. Here, CSF specimens from patients suspected of having prion disease were consecutively collected and stored between October 2015 and January 2023. Electronic medical record data were reviewed to clinically classify participants as probable sCJD or non-sCJD. CSF RT-QuIC was performed using in-house recPrP. Its specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing probable sCJD were reported, along with details of other clinical data and investigations. We found that among 39 eligible participants, with a median (interquartile range) age of 64 (56–70) years and 16 (41%) female, 13 had probable sCJD and the remaining 26 unequivocally suffered from nonprion disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were suggestive of sCJD in 100% (13/13) and 46.2% (6/13) of sCJD participants, respectively. RT-QuIC was positive in 12/13 sCJD participants (sensitivity 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.99) and negative in all non-sCJD participants (specificity 1.00, 95% CI 0.87–1.00). CSF tau/p-tau ratio showed sensitivity and specificity of 0.62–1.0 and 0.85–1.0, respectively. In summary, RT-QuIC using recPrP generated through a small-scale workflow demonstrated great performance in detecting sCJD. Given its performance results along with its low cost, this technique could feasibly be implemented in LMICs and potentially be the first step toward establishing local prion disease surveillance programs.

Process Optimization and CO2 Emission Analysis of Coal/Biomass Gasification Integrated with a Chemical Looping Process,"Sornumpol R., Saebea D., Arpornwichanop A., Patcharavorachot Y.",2023-03-01,"Biomass Gasification, Calcium looping, Capture process, Carbon dioxide capture, CO 2 emission, Co-gasification, Feed ratios, Gasifiers, Mass ratio, Process optimisation, biomass, calcium looping, co-gasification, CO2 emission, coal","Biomass gasification is an attractive technology and one of the pathways for producing hydrogen. Due to the variable seasons and low calorific value of biomass, the addition of coal in the gasifier is suggested because coal has a high calorific value and carbon-to-hydrogen ratio. In general, the gaseous product obtained in gasification always contains a high amount of carbon dioxide, therefore, the co-gasification of biomass and coal should integrate with the calcium looping carbon dioxide capture process to provide purified hydrogen. In this work, the model of the co-gasification of biomass and coal integrated with the calcium looping carbon dioxide capture process was developed through an Aspen Plus simulator. The developed model was used to analyze the performance of this process. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that increasing the gasification temperature, steam-to-feed (S/F) ratio, calcium oxide-to-feed (CaO/F) ratio, and regenerator temperature could improve hydrogen production. Next, further optimization was performed to identify the optimal operating condition that maximizes hydrogen production. The results showed that the optimal operating temperature of the gasifier is 700 °C with an S/F mass ratio of 2 and coal to biomass (C/B) mass ratio of 0.75:0.25. However, the carbonator and regenerator temperatures should be 450 °C and 950 °C, respectively, with a CaO/F mass ratio of 3. Under these operating conditions, the maximum H2 content and H2 yield can be provided as 99.59%vol. (dry basis) and 92.38 g hydrogen/kg biomass feeding. The other results revealed that the energy efficiency and carbon capture efficiency of this process are 42.86% and 99.99%, respectively, and that the specific emission of released CO2 is 80.77 g CO2/MJ.","heat exchange, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Grid planning and decision-making can be based on accurate long- and short-term power load forecasting. Recently, machine learning techniques have gained wide-spread adoption for both long- and short-term power load forecasting. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is customized for time series data analysis. This research proposes an LSTM model for forecasting the power load of a single house containing electrical appliances over the next 20 days. We conducted a comparative analysis of the impact of dropout layers in load forecasting applications using the LSTM model. The proposed model comprises dropout rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. Their impact on load forecasting is examined. The experimental results demonstrate slight variations in predictions when altering dropout layers. The results show that the effect of dropout layers on the forecast varies the accuracy by only approximately 1%. However, the models with significant dropout rates are more general than those with lower or higher rates. So the model with a dropout rate of 0.4 is suggested.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, Mathematics, physics","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Applications, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Control and Optimization, Instrumentation"

However, it provides a low CO2 conversion and produces a syngas product with a high H2O content. To improve the H-SOEC for syngas production, H-SOEC coupled with a dry methane reforming process (H-SOEC/DMR) was proposed in this work. The process flowsheet of the H-SOEC/DMR was developed and further used to evaluate the performance of the H-SOEC/DMR process. From the performance analysis of the H-SOEC/DMR process, it was found that the CO2 and CH4 conversions were higher than 90% and 80%, respectively, when the process was operated in the temperature range of 1073–1273 K. In addition, the result showed that a syngas product with a low H2O content could be obtained. Energy efficiency was then considered and the results indicated that the highest energy efficiency of 72.80% could be achieved when the H-SOEC/DMR process was operated at a temperature of 1123 K, pressure of 1 atm, and current density of 2500 A m−2. Based on a pinch analysis, a heat exchanger network was applied to the H-SOEC/DMR process that improved the energy efficiency to 81.46%. Finally, an exergy analysis was performed and showed that the H-SOEC/DMR unit had the lowest exergy efficiency as a high-temperature exhaust gas was released.","heat exchange, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"

The understanding of potential molecular targets is necessary for clinical implications in precision diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major deacetylase enzyme, is a promising target for cancer therapy; however, the molecular mechanism regulating cancer pathogenesis is largely unknown. Methods: The clinical relevance of HDAC6 expression levels and their correlation with the overall survival rate were analyzed based on the TCGA and GEO databases. HDAC6 expression in clinical samples obtained from lung cancer tissues and patient-derived primary lung cancer cells was evaluated using qRT–PCR and Western blot analysis. The potential regulatory mechanism of HDAC6 was identified by proteomic analysis and validated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, microtubule sedimentation, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays using a specific inhibitor of HDAC6, trichostatin A (TSA) and RNA interference to HDAC6 (siHDAC6). Lung cancer cell growth was assessed by an in vitro 2-dimensional (2D) cell proliferation assay and 3D tumor spheroid formation using patient-derived lung cancer cells. Results: HDAC6 was upregulated in lung cancer specimens and significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Inhibition of HDAC6 by TSA and siHDAC6 caused downregulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), which was dependent on the tubulin acetylation status. Tubulin acetylation induced by TSA and siHDAC6 mediated the dissociation of p-ERK on microtubules, causing p-ERK destabilization. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was an important scaffolder required for p-ERK localization on microtubules, and this phenomenon was significantly inhibited by either TSA, siHDAC6, or siGRP78. In addition, suppression of HDAC6 strongly attenuated an in vitro 2D lung cancer cell growth and an in vitro 3D patient derived-lung cancer spheroid growth. Conclusions: HDAC6 inhibition led to upregulate tubulin acetylation, causing GRP78-p-ERK dissociation from microtubules. As a result, p-ERK levels were decreased, and lung cancer cell growth was subsequently suppressed. This study reveals the intriguing role and molecular mechanism of HDAC6 as a tumor promoter, and its inhibition represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy.","medical, biochemistryistry","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Molecular Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Biochemistry (medical), Pharmacology (medical)"

Several mitigation efforts were made but were considered less than optimal. Multilevel governance adaptation and digitalization are starting to be considered for issues around climate change. This tendency prompted this study to search for available research documents to check on these topics. The method used is a bibliometric analysis by maximizing the Vosviewer analysis tool. The findings of this study indicate that research trends related to multilevel governance have only recently been seriously studied by global researchers because of a change in perspective on the understanding that mitigation that has been implemented thus far is not sufficient to avoid climate change. The arguments then target a new pattern of climate change adaptation by developing policies focusing on multilevel climate change governance. This focus targets intercross-policy development. The topic of digitalization has just begun to be associated with climate change, with arguments for digitalization opportunities that are considered capable of overcoming future sustainable development challenges. Digitalization is projected to be a key supporter of sustainable development with the potential to promote a climate-friendly environment. Future projections of this digitalization approach will likely influence climate change publications.

In Thailand, the molecular detection of S. digitata is lacking and its genetic diversity is still unknown. This study aimed to phylogenetically characterize equine S. digitata from Thailand based on sequences derived from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal DNA (12S rDNA), the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and Wolbachia surface protein (wsp). Five samples of S. digitata were characterized, submitted to the NCBI database, and used for phylogenetic analysis as well as the assessment of similarity, entropy, and haplotype diversity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the S. digitata Thai strain was similar to S. digitata from China and Sri Lanka, with 99 to 100% similarity. The entropy and haplotype diversity indicated that the S. digitata Thai isolate was conserved and closely related to S. digitata worldwide. This is the first report on the molecular detection of equine ocular setariasis caused by S. digitata in Thailand.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, biochemistryistry, medical","Microbiology, Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics, Molecular Biology, Genetics, Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Historically, it is used to define the control of how tasks are coordinated and executed. Its importance has been continuously increasing with the incorporation of rapidly developed Service-oriented Architecture (SoA), Blockchain, and Internet-of-Thing (IoT); new information technologies have expanded the coverage of workflow across various applications. Workflows often interact with services, where SoA is a key driver to smoot service discovery and provide standards for interoperation. In decentralized collaborative environments, a workflow often deals with disparate services dynamically and interacts with services on demand. This not only unlocks the potentials of workflow applications in business process managements (BPM), but also precipitates significant challenges and has brought considerable attentions to the research community. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art of service workflow modelling and enabling technologies. It begins with the identification and examination of workflow and IoT characteristics; it proposes a workflow architecture to classify existing works on service workflows, and it summarizes the methods for workflow modeling, service interoperation to identify the limitations of existing works and clarify future research directions in using service workflows.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, decision sciences","Hardware and Architecture, Computer Science Applications, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management"
Reinforcement losses in soil stabilisation due to decomposing roots of Chrysopogon zizanioides and Chrysopogon nemoralis,"Phan T.N., Leung A.K., Kamchoom V., Likitlersuang S.",2023-02-28,"Biomechanical properties, Herbicide application, Land managements, Mechanical, Root biomechanical property, Root decomposition, Root reinforcement, Secant modulus, Soil stabilization, Vegetated soil, root biomechanical properties, root decomposition, root reinforcement, vegetated soil","Quantifying evolutions of the biomechanical properties and mechanical root reinforcement to soil with the duration of root decomposition is important to land management strategy and to soil stabilisation purposes. However, the variations of these properties of the roots of herbaceous species, especially following herbicide application in agriculture practices, have rarely been studied. This study aims to measure the effects of root decomposition due to herbicide on the root biomechanical properties and root reinforcement provided by two contrasting vetiver species (Chrysopogon nemoralis and Chrysopogon zizanioides). We applied herbicide (i.e., propanil) to four treatments of each species, considering four different durations of decomposition (7-, 28-, 56- and 112-days since herbicide application). The biomechanical properties were measured by uniaxial tensile tests, whereas the root reinforcement to poorly graded sand (SP) was quantified by direct shear tests. Root decomposition significantly reduced mean root tensile strength, secant modulus and breakage strain of C. nemoralis and C. zizaniodes roots after 112 days since the herbicide application. Significant negative power correlations between root diameter and root strength (or root secant modulus) (R2 = 0.39–0.86; p-value < 0.05) were identified. Root decomposition did not change the shape of these correlations, but they shifted downwards as roots decomposed. The root reinforcement also declined with the decomposition duration, in terms of root cohesion and maximum dilatancy within the study period. C. nemoralis displayed greater and quicker loss of both the root biomechanical properties and root reinforcement to soil than C. zizanioides.","fluidex; related topics, environmental, sociology, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Environmental Chemistry, Development, Environmental Science (all), Soil Science"

(Fo) and columnaris disease caused by Flavobacterium oreochromis (For) is negatively impacting Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) production, especially when high stocking densities are used. A new and innovative bivalent mucoadhesive nanovaccine was developed in this study for immersion vaccination of tilapia against francisellosis and columnaris disease. It was shown to have the potential to improve both innate and adaptive immunity in vaccinated Nile tilapia. It increased innate immune parameters, such as lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity, phagocytosis, phagocytic index, and total serum IgM antibody levels. Additionally, the vaccine was effective in elevating specific adaptive immune responses, including IgM antibody levels against Fo and For vaccine antigens and upregulating immune-related genes IgM, IgT, CD4+, MHCIIα, and TCRβ in the head kidney, spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and gills of vaccinated fish. Furthermore, fish vaccinated with the mucoadhesive nanovaccine showed higher survival rates and relative percent survival after being challenged with either single or combined infections of Fo and For. This vaccine is anticipated to be beneficial for large-scale immersion vaccination of tilapia and may be a strategy for shortening vaccination times and increasing immune protection against francisellosis and columnaris diseases in tilapia aquaculture.","Immunology, environmental, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology, Environmental Chemistry, Aquatic Science, Immunology and Microbiology (miscellaneous)"

Volumetric bone measurements were performed starting from the DICOM files of previously available postoperative CT scans. The 3D images were then resampled into the master box, and ‘Skull 3D models’ were derived. The percentage of bone reformation was investigated using automated 3D analysis software. The intra-rater reliability analysis revealed high reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99, p < 0.001). The median bone reformation volume and rate were 11.2 ml and 1.98 ml/week, respectively. The median percentage of bone reformation was 56.7% when the median postoperative CT timing was 6.1 weeks. As a statistic model, the linear plateau showed the highest Pseudo R2 in both volume and percentage of bone reformation predicting patterns. By using the calculated model at 9 weeks postoperatively, the re-osteogenesis reaches 80% of the total cranial defect. After CVR, the early bone reformation pattern was demonstrated as a linear plateau model rather than logarithmic. This study gives a better understanding of the pattern and quantity of re-osteogenesis at cranial defects after CVR. The statistic model can facilitate healthcare practitioners to predict bone reformation and improve postoperative care protocol in sagittal craniosynostosis management.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Oral Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology"
Long-chain bio-olefins production via oxidative dehydrogenation of oleic acid over vanadium oxides/KIT-6 catalysts,"Le D., Chaidherasuwet N., Rueangthaweep A., Kulsing C., Hinchiranan N.",2023-01-01,"High selectivity, Long chain olefins, Long chains, Mesoporous, Mesoporous KIT-6, Molar ratio, Olefin production, Oxidative dehydrogenations, Synthesised, ]+ catalyst, Long-chain olefins, Mesoporous KIT-6, Oleic acid, Oxidative dehydrogenation, Vanadium oxide","Long-chain α-olefins (≥ C10) are normally applied in detergents, lubricants, and oil field chemicals. Due to the abundance of palm oil, the derivatives derived from palm oil, such as oleic acid (OA), can be converted to long-chain olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) over a series of vanadium oxides (VxOy) incorporated with KIT-6 (nV-KIT-6 catalysts) synthesized by a direct hydrothermal method. Various ammonium metavanadate/tetraethyl orthosilicate molar ratios (V/Si) were evaluated over the range of 0.01–0.09. The results obtained from X-ray diffractometry, hydrogen-temperature programmed reduction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the VxOy were mainly in a tetrahedral form when the V/Si molar ratios were lower than 0.05. Above this point, the formation of V2O5 crystallites was observed. The ODH of OA was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure in the absence of solvent to avoid the interference of by-products generated from solvent oxidation. The results showed that the OA conversion and selectivity towards the desired products strongly depended on the V/Si molar ratio and the reaction temperature. The highest selectivity of olefins (alkenes + dienes) with carbon atoms in the range of C7–17 was 44%. Moreover, the selectivity to aromatics at 24% was observed at a 76% OA conversion level when the ODH was activated using the 0.05 V-KIT-6 catalyst under a 1/1 (v/v) oxygen/nitrogen gas mixture at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 at 450 °C. Although the high selectivity towards alkenes was promoted by a higher dispersion of VxOy species on the catalyst, overdose of V/Si molar ratios produced more oxygenate compounds. The reaction mechanism for the ODH of OA was likely to be decarboxylation and decarbonylation followed by dehydration. The 0.05 V-KIT-6 catalyst also exhibited reusability over two cycles.","process equipment, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

In this study, red hybrid tilapias (Oreochromis spp.) were experimentally infected by intracoelomic injection with Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) to gain a better understanding of the clinicopathological changes during infection. Pale bodies and gill were observed in infected fish after 7 days of post-challenge (dpc) associated with severe anaemia. Further haematological analysis in TiLV-infected fish revealed decreased levels of haemoglobin and haematocrit at 3 dpc. Common pathological findings included pale and friable liver, pale intestine with catarrhal content, and dark and shrunken spleen in TiLV-infected fish at 7 dpc and 14 dpc. Histologically, reduced numbers of red blood cells and accumulation of melano-macrophage centre in the spleen were found in infected fish at 3 dpc, and severe lesions were more commonly observed at 7 and 14 dpc. Lymphocyte infiltration, syncytial cell formation and multifocal necrotic hepatitis were the prominent pathological findings in the liver of infected fish. The severity of pathological changes was associated with TiLV-infection with higher viral loads and with the expression pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral genes, including interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf1), interleukin (il-8), radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (rsad2) and mx. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the haematological profile and pathological changes in tilapia during TiLV infection. Overall, lesions present in various organs, together with alteration of host immune response in TiLV-infected fish, indicate the systemic infection of this virus. The knowledge gained from this study improves our understanding of how TiLV causes pathological and haematological changes in tilapia.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Veterinary Science","Aquatic Science, Veterinary (miscellaneous)"

The doped glasses were studied at varying ZnO concentrations to investigate their properties, including density, transmittance, photoluminescence, and the oxidation states of dopants The glasses were tested for their sensitivity to detect X-ray and proton radiation, and calculations of the half-value layer and proton range were used to investigate their shielding properties. The results showed that an increase in ZnO concentrations induced a higher glass density and shifted the absorption edge to a longer wavelength (redshift) in the optical transmittance spectra. The cerium dopant mainly formed the Ce3+ oxidation state, resulting in a single broad band emission due to the 5d→4f transition of Ce3+ ions. The luminescence behavior of the doped glasses under x-ray irradiation showed a single broad emission at 375 nm. In contrast, under proton irradiation, the single broad emission shifted to a longer wavelength at 400 nm. The increase in ZnO concentration decreased light emission when exposed to x-rays and protons. The results also demonstrated that increasing ZnO concentrations improved the shielding properties of the glasses. We found that the glass with a 25 mol% ZnO concentration revealed a half-value layer of the 100 keV photon energy equal to 0.116 ± 0.001 cm, and a 70 MeV proton energy penetrated the maximum range in the glass at 1.308 ± 0.019 cm. We concluded that ZnO could be used to control the fraction between Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions in the cerium ions of the CeF3-doped glasses.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, chemistry, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Spectroscopy, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

A material with such enormous potential requires a variety of synthesis methods. Here, we report a library of relatively sustainable redox-active organic molecules for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) namely N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), ferrocene (Ferro), and decamethylferrocene (DFerro). Among them, the reduction of GO using TMPD starts even with simple hand-shaking for just a few minutes. By controlling the sonication time under ambient conditions, one can control the electronic properties of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The resulting free-standing films delivered a capacitance of 185 F/g when tested them as supercapacitor electrodes. We also demonstrated that TMPD can exfoliate graphite into few-layer graphene sheets with simple sonication. We further show that under mild heating, these molecules can serve as dopants during the reduction process to produce nitrogen-doped graphene. Our results may guide researchers to explore sustainable organic molecules for the large-scale production of graphene-based materials for diverse applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

Endoscopic-modified medial maxillectomy (EMMM) can reshape the maxillary sinus and avoid a “sumping” effect, preventing secondary bacterial colonization, encouraging dependent drainage, and promoting effective nasal irrigation. Objectives: We describe a modification of the EMMM surgical technique in patients with recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis and perioperative outcomes. Methods: Consecutive adult patients with nonfunctioning maxillary sinuses managed with EMMM were assessed. Primary outcomes were the resolution of the presenting symptom and the absence of mucostasis. Secondary outcomes were early (<90 days) and late (>90 days) morbidity. Results: Fifty-seven patients (51.7 ± 17.5 years, 56.1% female) were assessed. Fifty-two patients had complete resolution of their presenting symptom (91.2% [95% CI: 80.7–97.1]) and 52 patients had an absence of mucostasis (91.2% [95% CI: 80.7–97.1]). Those with persistent crusting were also those with symptoms. Early morbidities included temporary dysesthesia (3.2%), bleeding (1.1%), and pain (3.2%), with no late morbidities. Conclusion: EMMM is a robust approach for salvaging a nonfunctioning maxillary sinus.

Previous studies attempt to identify factors influencing material management in different stages such as procurement, transportation and utilization. However, they lack a model to explain the relationship between influential factors and the effectiveness of material management. Therefore, this study aims to validate the variables and key factors influencing the effectiveness of material management processes. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 42 variables were reviewed from literature in different stages of material management process. Survey questionnaires were used to collect data about participants' perceptions on these variables. The respondents were 200 project engineers and project managers from construction sites and offices in Vietnam. Then factor analysis techniques were undertaken to validate the structure of factor groups. Two methods of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were, respectively, performed to evaluate and verify the model's fit. Findings: Factors influencing the effectiveness of material management were grouped into nine main factors, which are procurement issues, site conditions, planning and handling on site, industrial environments, contractual issues, quality control, suppliers and manufacturers' issues, transportation in and out site and security on site. Practical implications: The paper has several implications for theory and methodology related to material management. It features influential factors in association with the material management effectiveness. Therefore, senior managers can more fully understand the errors in their works and propose timely solutions to limit the unwanted risks. Originality/value: This research contributes on theoretical development on factors influencing effectiveness of material management processes.

The release of ethylene gas from fruits and vegetables causes them to ripen and undergo physical, chemical and biological changes, such as changes in the appearance in terms of shape and colour, changes in firmness and texture, changes in taste and changes in nutritional value. Furthermore, it also facilitates the growth of microorganisms. These changes lead to spoilage if the fruit or vegetables are left to over ripen. Therefore, the prevention and reduction of damage caused by the ripening of fruits and vegetables entail reducing or slowing down the release of ethylene gas produced by them. This research project aimed to study the properties of activated carbon and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) modified activated carbon, applied as a printing layer on plastic materials for bananas, in terms of their adsorption and decomposition of ethylene. Active and water-based flexography printing inks were prepared from water-based binder and ethylene adsorbing and scavenging agents (activated carbon and KMnO4 modified activated carbon) at various concentrations of active agents, that is, 0.0, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0%w/v. Then, those inks were printed on polypropylene plastic substrate. The delayed ripening of fruits results showed that the plastic materials coated with modified activated carbon inks delayed the physiology disorder (colour and firmness changing about 250% and 226%) and prolonged the storage time up to 14 days when compared with control. In addition, the functional ink layer also presented a high efficiency of abrasion resistance of about 75 cycles of rubbing at 1.8 kg. The products that stem from this research can be applied as packaging for fruits and vegetables in the form of bags, stickers and product pads that can help extend the life and slow the ripening of fruits and vegetables.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science, engineering","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Mechanical Engineering"

By applying the mixture design, the optimal compositions of rice bran (RB) oil (oil; X1), Kolliphor® RH40 (surfactant; X2), and Span® 20 (cosurfactant; X3) were determined based on the preliminary screening studies. The optimization models were validated by comparing the regression coefficient (R2) of the predicted values to the experimentally measured ones. Based on the desirability function, the optimized AST SMEDS was composed of 33.67% rice bran oil, 34.70% Kolliphor® RH40, and 31.63% Span® 20 which contained AST concentration (Y1) of 0.04% in the formulation and yielded microemulsion droplet size (Y2) of 40.79 ± 3.11 nm. The experimentally measured values obtained from the optimized AST SMEDS were in accordance with its predicted values with relatively low prediction errors (< 2%). The validated models were investigated by the contour plots, three-dimensional surface plots, and main effect plots. It was found that surfactant and cosurfactant inversely affected on droplet size changes whereas all three components (oil, surfactant and cosurfactant) did not relatively impact AST solubilizing capacity. In vitro release of AST SMEDS was significantly increased more than 90% compared to the raw AST powder. The optimized AST SMEDS was successfully developed by the mixture design and could be economically effective to enhance dissolution of poorly water-soluble AST.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, chemistry","Surfaces, Coatings and Films, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics"

However, these methods usually use toxic chemicals and demonstrate low gold extraction efficiency (Ge) due to the negative influence of organic materials and other industrial metals also present in the waste. In this work, a more efficient and more environmentally friendly process is proposed that can achieve a high Ge from electronic waste by pre-treatment and pre-extraction before gold extraction. The powdered waste was first pre-treated by a supercritical water oxidation (SWO) process to remove organic materials and then pre-extracted using a mixture of FeCl3 and HCl to remove industrial metals. The solid powder thus produced was then re-extracted by a DMF-CuCl2-NaCl mild extraction system to complete the recovery of the gold content. Experimental results indicated that pre-treatment temperature, pre-treatment time, and the concentration of the FeCl3 and HCl solutions all significantly influenced the amount of gold extracted. The optimal parameters for achieving the highest Ge extraction (99.6%) using the DMF-CuCl2-NaCl extraction system were determined as follows: an extraction temperature of 65 °C, an extraction time of 70 min, a stirring speed of 420 rpm, a sample size of ≤ 850 µm, a solid/liquid (S/L) ratio of 1:12 g·mL−1, a CuCl2 concentration of 0.8 mol·L−1, and a NaCl concentration of 1.6 mol·L−1. After gold extraction, water was then used to precipitate the gold in the form of nanoparticles. Under optimal conditions (70%v/v water, 80 min), over 98.4% of the gold could be recovered in this way.","mixing and separation, environmental, coastal engineering, engineering","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (all), Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality"
Internal rotation of the shoulder in the beach chair position may increase the risk of iatrogenic suprascapular nerve injury at the spinoglenoid notch during surgical treatment for shoulder instability,"Promsang T., Limskul D., Moonwong S., Kulrat P., Kongrukgreatiyos K., Kuptniratsaikul S., Itthipanichpong T.",2023-01-01,"Arthroscopy, Cadaver, Humans, Iatrogenic Disease, Joint Instability, Peripheral Nerve Injuries, Scapula, Shoulder, Shoulder Injuries, Shoulder Joint, Bankart repair, Beach chair, Latarjet, Lateral decubitus, Shoulder arthroscopy, SLAP repair, Spinoglenoid notch, Suprascapular nerve injury","Purpose: Suprascapular nerve (SN) at the spinoglenoid notch is a mobile structure which is vulnerable to iatrogenic injury from screw or guidewire penetration during shoulder surgery such as Latarjet procedure or SLAP/Bankart repairs. The primary objective is to identify the distance between posterior glenoid and SN in different shoulder abduction and rotation. The secondary objective is to identify the distance in standard lateral decubitus position. Methods: Nineteen shoulders from 10 Thiel embalmed soft cadavers were used in this study. The dissection of posterior shoulder was done to identify the SN at spinoglenoid notch. The distance between the posterior glenoid rim and the SN was measured. In beach chair position, the SN distance from six combinations of shoulder position was obtained: adduction/90° internal rotation (ADIR), adduction/neutral rotation (ADN), adduction/90° external rotation (ADER), 45° abduction/90° internal rotation (ABIR), 45° abduction/neutral rotation (ABN), 45° abduction/90° external rotation (ABER). Subsequently, the suprascapular nerve distance was measured in standard lateral decubitus position with 10 lbs. longitudinal traction. Results: In the beach chair position with the shoulder in adduction, the mean distances between the glenoid and the SN in ADIR, ADN and ADER were 15.0 ± 3.3, 19.3 ± 2.6 and 19.5 ± 3.1 mm, respectively. During shoulder abduction, the mean distances when the shoulder was in ABIR, ABN and ABER were 15.2 ± 3.4, 19.4 ± 3.0 and 19.3 ± 2.6 mm, respectively. The mean distance for the lateral decubitus position was 19.3 ± 2.4 mm. The distance between the glenoid and SN was significantly shorter when the shoulder was positioned in internal rotation than in neutral (p < 0.001) or external rotation (p < 0.001) when compared to the same shoulder abduction position. The lateral decubitus position had comparable SN distance with the shoulder position of abduction/neutral rotation in beach chair position. Conclusion: The SN was closest to posterior glenoid rim if the shoulder was in internal rotation. Therefore, shoulder internal rotation must be avoided during guidewire and cannulated screw placement in the Latarjet procedure and drill bit insertion during anchor placement in SLAP/Bankart repair.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

We extend its capability by introducing the coaxial tilting rotors that can generate thrust force with lateral component. They are installed at the center of the body frame with a gimbal mechanism to control the thrust direction. The original and new rotors together produce control force and torque that make attitude stabilizing, tilting, and sideway translation possible. Based on contraction analysis, we propose a nonlinear PID controller for this new UAV to follow admissible desired trajectories. The new special integral error term addresses modeling uncertainties, loss of thrust force, and disturbances. Moreover, we apply optimization technique to allocate rotor thrusts considering the gimbal dynamics and rotor speed limit. Simulation and experiments are conducted to compare the effectiveness of the special integral error, validate the range of achievable motion, and demonstrate the tracking robustness and motion tracking on a 3D-Lissajous curve.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, computer science, Mathematics","Control and Systems Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science Applications, Control and Optimization, Artificial Intelligence"

However, the computational cost and model parameters are the most challenging limitations in real-world applications. Additionally, designing an efficient and lightweight SR algorithm to improve the perceptual quality of the SR images is a critical issue. According to these considerations, we propose a Multi-FusNet of Cross Channel Network (MFCC) network by modeling a multipath residual network, named multi-RG, with cross-filtering fusion. Additionally, a pixel shuffling fusion technique is used to fuse low-level features into the up-sampled features of the multi-RG. The experimental results show the comparison of the proposed MFCC to the state-of-the-art SR models.

Herein, zinc acetate was used as the green electrolyte. The structure, ionic conductivity, and cycle performance of the prepared composites were estimated. The composite here showed favorable fibrous structure. Furthermore, the introduction of alginate into the cotton pad improved its surface hydrophilicity, electrolyte uptake ability, and mechanical stiffness. Tensile strength and elongation at break were found to be 11–13 MPa and 49–54%, respectively. Young’s modulus was in the range of 214–287 MPa. The alginate-doped cotton pad also showed substantial ionic conductivity ranging from 0.91 to 1.96 mS/cm. This composite offered a balance between excellent mechanical properties, electrochemical stability, and ion flow. Additionally, the preliminary electrochemical studies showed that the half zinc-ion battery assembled with the alginate-doped cotton pad separator was stable throughout 200 h of cycling. This work implemented the versatility of cotton and alginate as a biocomposite in energy storage application. Cotton matrix, alginate and electrolyte are entirely green component which is not a threat to the environment.

Study design: A Retrospective study of 28 mandibular prognathism patients who underwent BSSRO setback surgery at Chulalongkorn University. Both titanium and the bioabsorbable group would take lateral cephalometrics immediately postoperative in 1-week(T0), 3(T1), 6(T2), and 12(T3) months. These radiographs were analyzed with Dolphin imaging programTM. The vertical, horizontal, and angular indices were measured. To compare immediately postoperative and follow-up periods within the group, the Friedman difference was used, and the Man-Whitney U test was used between the two groups. Result: The measurements within the group presented no statistically significant differences. But this study showed that at T0-T1, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the mean of Me in horizontal linear measurement. T0-T2 found differences between Me in both horizontal and vertical linear measurements, and the difference between ANB. The differences between B-point, Pog, and Me in vertical linear measurements at T0-T3 were also reported. Conclusion: The significant difference values were within the normal range which indicated that using the bioabsorbable system could be well maintained as well as the titanium system. Statement of clinical relevance: The second operation for removing titanium plate and screw after conventional orthognathic surgery may leads patient discomforts.

Acute cerebellar syndrome may occur, which can be explained by the extremely high accumulation of the drug in the cerebellum. However, presentation mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome similar to our case has never been reported. Case presentation: Here, we describe a 68-year-old Thai male presenting with advanced-stage cecal adenocarcinoma, as well as symptoms and signs indicative of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. He received two doses of intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg 6 hours before his symptoms occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral white matter. Further evaluation showed that his thiamine level was extremely low. Thus, he was diagnosed with fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The concomitant fluorouracil-induced thiamine deficiency eventually leads to rapid depletion of thiamine and was considered a risk factor for fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Conclusion: Fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy is believed to be caused by insult causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown, but our finding suggests that thiamine deficiency plays a crucial role in fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy.

Branched-chain biofuels derived from hydroisomerization of palm olein using Ni/modified beta zeolite catalysts for biojet fuel production,"Hunsiri W., Chaihad N., Ngamcharussrivichai C., Tungasmita D.N., Reubroycharoen P., Hinchiranan N.",2023-09-01,"Acid leaching, Beta zeolite, Biojet, Fuel production, HF concentration, Hydro-isomerization, Liquid biofuels, Palm olein, Zeolite catalyst, ]+ catalyst, Acid leaching, Biojet, Hydroisomerization, Palm olein, Zeolite","To overcome mass transfer limitation and adjust zeolite's acidity, the modification of beta zeolite via etching with hydrofluoric acid/ammonium fluoride (HF/NH4F) solution was revealed and the modified beta zeolite was then applied as a support of nickel (Ni) catalysts used for hydroisomerization of palm olein. HF/NH4F solution containing 0.25 M HF concentration was appropriate to enlarge original existing intercrystalline mesopores of beta zeolite (beta-0.25), which resulted to the higher pore volume. The Ni/beta-0.25 catalyst also exhibited the better Ni dispersion and lower acidity. These features suppressed overcracking and provided 43.4 wt% bio-jet fuel yield with 22.1 wt% iso-alkanes fraction when hydroisomerization was operated under 40 bar initial hydrogen (H2) pressure at 340 °C for 5 h. At 0.75 M HF concentration, the excessive leaching of aluminum species out of the zeolite framework provided beta-0.75 with very low acidity, which was ineffective to convert molecules of palm olein to bio-jet fuel range. Initial H2 pressure at 40 bar was sufficient to activate the hydroisomerization of palm olein over Ni/beta-0.25 catalyst to produce liquid biofuel containing iso−/n-alkane ratio of 2.61.

In this study, we develop a facile method, involving the co-assembly of zinc (Zn2+) ions and PDAs in an aqueous medium, for creating reversible thermochromic materials. We have found that the Zn2+ precursors play a crucial role on achieving a reversible thermochromism. The PDA/Zn2+ assemblies prepared from Zn(CN)2 and Zn(CH3COO)2 exhibit reversible thermochromism whereas other Zn2+ precursors such as ZnCl2, Zn(NO3)2 and ZnSO4 do not yield reversibility. The reversible thermochromic PDA/Zn2+ assemblies can be synthesized via the solution mixing method in ambient conditions, making them suitable for large-scale production. The color-transition temperature can be tuned from 60 to 120 °C by changing PDA side chains. The synthesis of reversible thermochromic PDA/Zn(CN)2 assemblies in the liquid phase allows the fabrication of smart inks, sprayed coatings, and nanofibers, extending their fields of applications.","clinical and experimental biochemistryistryhemistry, fluidex; related topics, physics, chemistry, coastal engineering","Surfaces and Interfaces, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Colloid and Surface Chemistry"

The adsorption energy, adsorption distance, and the d-band center reveal the stability of H2 and CO on the heterojunctions. Interestingly, the density of states reflects that the heterojunctions show an n-type response to CO and a p-type response to H2. When H2 and CO are adsorbed on CoO(110)/SnO2(100)-O2, there is a strong bond between CO and O2, while the chemical bond between H2 and O2 is weak according to electron density. Consequently, heterojunctions have a high selectivity to CO over H2. This work provides meaningful theoretical insight into the selective adsorption of reducing gases by heterojunctions.","mixing and separation, Materials Science, physics","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Biomaterials, Condensed Matter Physics, Materials Chemistry"

Pneumococcal infection has been shown to cause elastase, an intracellular host defense factor, to leak from neutrophils. However, when neutrophil elastase (NE) leaks extracellularly, it can degrade host cell surface proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and potentially disrupt the alveolar epithelial barrier. In this study, we hypothesized that NE degrades the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR in alveolar epithelial cells and inhibits alveolar epithelial repair. Using SDS-PAGE, we showed that NE degraded the recombinant EGFR ECD and its ligand epidermal growth factor, and that the degradation of these proteins was counteracted by NE inhibitors. Furthermore, we confirmed the degradation by NE of EGFR expressed in alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. We showed that intracellular uptake of epidermal growth factor and EGFR signaling was downregulated in alveolar epithelial cells exposed to NE and found that cell proliferation was inhibited in these cells These negative effects of NE on cell proliferation were abolished by NE inhibitors. Finally, we confirmed the degradation of EGFR by NE in vivo. Fragments of EGFR ECD were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pneumococcal pneumonia mice, and the percentage of cells positive for a cell proliferation marker Ki67 in lung tissue was reduced. In contrast, administration of an NE inhibitor decreased EGFR fragments in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and increased the percentage of Ki67-positive cells. These findings suggest that degradation of EGFR by NE could inhibit the repair of alveolar epithelium and cause severe pneumonia.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles of 2-kidneys-1 clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats after feeding with GD flower extract. Rats were randomly divided into the following 4 groups: sham operation (SO) receiving corn oil (CO) (SO + CO), SO receiving GD (SO + GD), 2K1C receiving corn oil (2K1C + CO) and 2K1C receiving GD (2K1C + GD). Body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were measured weekly throughout the study. Gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were measured from fresh fecal contents. Alpha diversity results demonstrated a similar microbial richness and diversity between groups. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) suggested that GD treatment affected gut microbial community structure in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. Feeding rats with GD caused metabolic alterations that rendered 2K1C + GD rats similar to SO + CO and SO + GD rats.

However, recent studies have revealed the presence of subtle microstructural abnormalities of the extracellular matrix in some cases of BrS, ERS, and iVF, particularly within right ventricular subepicardial myocardium. Substrate-based ablation within this region has been shown to ameliorate the electrocardiographic phenotype and to reduce arrhythmia frequency in BrS. Patients with ERS and iVF may also exhibit low-voltage and fractionated electrograms in the ventricular subepicardial myocardium, which can be treated with ablation. A significant proportion of patients with BrS and ERS, as well as some iVF survivors, harbor pathogenic variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, SCN5A, but the majority of genetic susceptibility of these disorders is likely to be polygenic. Here, we postulate that BrS, ERS, and iVF may form part of a spectrum of subtle subepicardial cardiomyopathy. We propose that impaired sodium current, along with genetic and environmental susceptibility, precipitates a reduction in epicardial conduction reserve, facilitating current-to-load mismatch at sites of structural discontinuity, giving rise to electrocardiographic changes and the arrhythmogenic substrate.","cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular surgery, medical","Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Physiology (medical)"
Analytical Solution for Circular Microbeams with Strain Gradient Elasticity,"Aung Z.Y., Vo D., Le T.M., Rungamornrat J.",2023-01-01,"Analytical solution, Beam theories, Circular beams, Circular microbeam, Ehrenfest, Influence of curviness, Micro beams, Skeletal structures, Strain gradient elasticity, Timoshenko-ehrenfest beam theory, Analytical solutions, Circular microbeams, Influence of curviness, Strain gradient elasticity, Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theory","In the analysis of skeletal structures, circular beams are widely studied since their simple geometry allows the derivation of analytical solutions which are useful tools to assess the accuracy and efficiency of numerical ones. With such feature, the present study aims mainly to establish the key governing equations, boundary conditions, and corresponding analytical solutions of circular microbeams within the framework of strain gradient elasticity and Timoshenko-Ehrenfest beam theories. It is worth highlighting that the curviness is also included in the formulation, and its influence on the predicted responses is explored. A solution procedure is implemented to establish the analytical solutions for general loading and boundary conditions. A representative semi-circular beam is subsequently analyzed with the adopted procedure, and a selected set of results is reported to illustrate the effects of the curviness.","mechanical variables measurements, fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering
Association between Liver Stiffness and Liver-Related Events in HCV-Infected Patients after Successful Treatment with Direct-Acting Antivirals,"Rodprasert N., Hongboontry T., Cherdchoochart C., Chaiteerakij R.",2023-03-01,"Antiviral Agents, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Hepatitis C, Chronic, Humans, Infant, Liver Cirrhosis, Liver Neoplasms, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, chronic hepatitis C infection, fibrosis score, liver cancer, liver fibrosis, liver steatosis, liver-related complications, transient elastography","Background and Objectives: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the risk of liver-related events and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains after successful therapy. We aimed to evaluate post-treatment changes in liver stiffness (LS) and identify a cut-off LS value for predicting such events in chronic HCV-infected patients receiving DAA. Materials and Methods: A total of 185 patients who had achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) after DAA therapy were included. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were retrospectively abstracted. LS was measured by transient elastography at baseline, 12, 24, 48, and 96 weeks after SVR. FIB-4 index was assessed at baseline and 48 weeks after SVR. Development of liver-related events (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), portal-hypertension-related decompensation, listing for transplantation, and mortality) after SVR were identified. The association between liver fibrosis and the occurrence of liver-related events was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Results: Significant differences in LS values were observed between baseline and 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks after SVR. FIB-4 index at 48 weeks after SVR was significantly lower than the FIB-4 index at baseline. During the 41.6-month follow-up time, the incidence rates of all liver-related events and HCC were 2.36 and 1.17 per 100 person-years, respectively. Age, LS ≥8 kPa, and FIB-4 ≥1.35 at 48 weeks post-SVR were significantly associated with the occurrence of any liver-related events. By multivariate analysis, LS ≥8 kPa at 48 weeks post-SVR remained significantly associated with any liver-related events, with an adjusted hazard ratio (95%CI) of 5.04 (1.01–25.26), p = 0.049. Conclusions: Despite a significant reduction in LS after SVR, patients with LS ≥8 kPa at 48 weeks after SVR should be regularly monitored for liver-related complications, particularly HCC development.",medical,Medicine (all)
Tailoring proton transfer species on the membrane surface: An approach to enhance proton conductivity for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell,"Pokprasert A., Chirachanchai S.",2023-01-16,"Anhydrous systems, Donor/acceptor, Functional molecules, Heterocycles, Layer by layer, Membrane surface, Polymer brushes, Proton donors, Proton exchange membranes, Surface-modification, Fuel cell, Heterocycles, Layer-by-layer, Polymer brushes, Proton exchange membrane, Surface modification","The efficiency of proton conductivity in proton exchange membrane (PEM) depends on how proton species can effectively transfer through the membrane either in hydrous system or anhydrous system. Although the incorporation of proton donors and/or acceptors via chemical modification, blending, including preparing composites in polymer solution state before casting the membrane is a general approach, the proton transfer species may not be effectively functioned as they were randomly existed in PEM. As proton transfer initially occurs at the PEM surface, the decoration of the proton transfer species on the surface can be considered as an alternative choice to develop PEM. The surface modifications can be carried out by attaching the functional molecules and/or polymers to favor the proton transfer. The present review summarizes the approaches to construct the PEM surface with proton conductive species, especially via layer-by-layer, and polymer brushes to enhance the PEM performances.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"
Modelling the impact of climate change on dengue outbreaks and future spatiotemporal shift in Pakistan,"Saeed A., Ali S., Khan F., Muhammad S., Reboita M.S., Khan A.W., Goheer M.A., Khan M.A., Kumar R., Ikram A., Jabeen A., Pongpanich S.",2023-06-01,"Animals, Climate Change, Dengue, Disease Outbreaks, Pakistan, Seasons, Climate change and health, CMIP5, Dengue suitable days, Quantile delta mapping, Statistical downscaling, Vector-borne diseases","Climate change has a significant impact on the intensity and spread of dengue outbreaks. The objective of this study is to assess the number of dengue transmission suitable days (DTSD) in Pakistan for the baseline (1976–2005) and future (2006–2035, 2041–2070, and 2071–2099) periods under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. Moreover, potential spatiotemporal shift and future hotspots of DTSD due to climate change were also identified. The analysis is based on fourteen CMIP5 models that have been downscaled and bias-corrected with quantile delta mapping technique, which addresses data stationarity constraints while preserving future climate signal. The results show a higher DTSD during the monsoon season in the baseline in the study area except for Sindh (SN) and South Punjab (SP). In future periods, there is a temporal shift (extension) towards pre- and post-monsoon. During the baseline period, the top ten hotspot cities with a higher frequency of DTSD are Karachi, Hyderabad, Sialkot, Jhelum, Lahore, Islamabad, Balakot, Peshawar, Kohat, and Faisalabad. However, as a result of climate change, there is an elevation-dependent shift in DTSD to high-altitude cities, e.g. in the 2020s, Kotli, Muzaffarabad, and Drosh; in the 2050s, Garhi Dopatta, Quetta, and Zhob; and in the 2080s, Chitral and Bunji. Karachi, Islamabad, and Balakot will remain highly vulnerable to dengue outbreaks for all the future periods of the twenty-first century. Our findings also indicate that DTSD would spread across Pakistan, particularly in areas where we have never seen dengue infections previously. The good news is that the DTSD in current hotspot cities is projected to decrease in the future due to climate change. There is also a temporal shift in the region during the post- and pre-monsoon season, which provides suitable breeding conditions for dengue mosquitos due to freshwater; therefore, local authorities need to take adaption and mitigation actions.","environmental, earth sciences","Environmental Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Water Science and Technology, Environmental Science (all), Geochemistry and Petrology"

Methods: This retrospective study included 192 primary TKA patients. Group A (76 patients) received LIA only, Group B (61 patients) had ITM, adductor canal block and LIA, while Group C (55 patients) received ITM, femoral nerve block and LIA. A propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare visual analog scales (VAS) for pain intensity, total amount of morphine consumption (TMC), angle of knee flexion, and length of hospital stay (LHS). Results: Group A showed significantly higher VAS than Group B at 12 h (4.27 ± 2.70 vs 2.42 ± 2.35) and 18 h (4.24 ± 2.35 vs 2.18 ± 2.02), and significantly higher than Group C at 6 h (3.46 ± 3.07 vs 0.60 ± 1.50), 12 h (4.27 ± 2.70 vs 0.89 ± 1.48), and 18 h postoperative (4.24 ± 2.35 vs 1.82 ± 2.18). However, the VAS of Group C and B converged to equalize with Group A after 12 and 18 h, respectively. The TMC at 48 h postoperative of Group A was higher than that of Group B (p < 0.01). Nevertheless, there was no difference between groups in terms of knee flexion and LHS, except the LHS of Group B was longer than Group A (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Triple analgesic pathways could provide a better initial analgesic profile. However, the pain seems to be rebound after resolution of nerve block and ITM, with potentially longer LHS.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

This research thus investigates the effect of hydrolysis temperatures and time on the yields of CNC from water hyacinth. The aim is to determine the optimal acid hydrolysis condition for water hyacinth fiber that effectively enhances the CNC yield. The acid hydrolysis temperatures were varied between 50 and 60°C and the hydrolysis time between 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Prior to the hydrolysis, raw water hyacinth fiber was treated with alkaline and bleached by hydrogen peroxide. The results showed that the optimal hydrolysis condition was 60°C and 30 min, with the crystallinity index of 80%, the crystalline size of 3.91 nm, and the CNC yield of 71.5%. The transmission electron microscopy morphology of CNC from water hyacinth was of whisker shape, with the diameter and length of 10 nm and 200–500 nm. The results also indicated that, unlike the hydrolysis time, the hydrolysis temperature had a negligible effect on the crystallinity index. Besides, under the optimal hydrolysis condition, CNC was of stable aqueous suspension with a zeta potential of −43.21 mV, indicating high physical colloidal stability.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science",Materials Science (miscellaneous)

Unfortunately, there is still a lack of studies about the energy production of such a system in real working conditions with the impact of partial shading conditions (PSC). In this study, we evaluated the electrical energy production of the PV systems which use two typical configurations of power optimization at the PV panel level, a DC optimizer and a microinverter, using their real datasets working under PSC. Firstly, we compared the energy utilization ratio of the monthly energy production of these systems to the reference ones generated from PVWatt software to evaluate the effect of PSC on energy production. Secondly, we conducted a linear decline model to estimate the annual degradation rate of PV systems during a 6-year period to evaluate the effect of PSC on the PV’s degradation rate. In order to perform these evaluations, we utilized a mixed-effects model, a practical approach for studying time series data. The findings showed that the energy utilization ratio of PVs with MLPE was reduced by about (Formula presented.) ((Formula presented.) confidence interval: (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.)) under PSC, compared to that under nonshading conditions (NSC). Another finding was that the PSC did not significantly impact the PV’s annual energy degradation rate, which was about (Formula presented.) (Wh/kW) per year. Our finding could therefore be used by homeowners to help make their decision, as a recommendation to select the gained energy production under PSC or the cost of a rooftop PV system using MLPE for their investment. Our finding also suggested that in the area where partial shading rarely happened, the rooftop PV system using a string or centralized inverter configuration was a more appropriate option than MLPE. Finally, our study provides an understanding about the ability of MLPE to reduce the effect of PSC in real working conditions.","fluidex; related topics, energy, engineering, Mathematics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Building and Construction, Fuel Technology, Engineering (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Control and Optimization, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

The formation of TNP was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Only 2 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) of TNP increases the maximum rheometric torque (R∞), cure rate index (CRI), tensile strength (TS), percent elongation at break (%EB), modulus, hardness, and cross-link density, and considerably reduces the energy consumption of vulcanization. The dispersion of TNP throughout the rubber matrix was confirmed by FESEM. The TNP-NR compatibility was confirmed by the thermodynamic parameters, elastic Gibbs free energy change (∆G) and conformational entropy change (∆S).

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted from 194 consecutive patients who underwent TELD due to lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Patients with incomplete clinical improvement were defined from patient-reported outcomes of poor improvement in pain or disability after surgery and patient dissatisfaction. Clinical and radiographic characteristics were evaluated to identify predicting factors of poor outcomes. Results: Of 194 patients who underwent TELD procedures, 32 patients (16.5%) had incomplete clinical improvement and 12 patients (6.1%) required revision surgery. The mean ages were 46.4 years and most of the patients suffered from predominant leg pain (48.9%). The most common surgical level was L4–5 (63.9%). Overall, the Oswestry Disability Index (44.3–15), visual analog scores of back pain (4.9–1.8) and leg pain (7.3–1.6) were significantly improved after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high body mass index, history of previous surgery, preoperative disability, weakness, and disc degeneration were related to incomplete clinical improvement. There were 15 recurrent LDH (7.7%) with a total of 12 revision surgeries (6.2%). Conclusions: We identified independent risk factors associated with incomplete clinical improvement following TELD, including overweight, significant preoperative disability or weakness and history of previous surgery. Advanced age, disc degeneration, vacuum phenomenon, and spondylolisthesis were also possible risk factors. Recognizing these risk factors would help decide whether patients are good candidates for TELD, and optimize the surgical planning preoperatively to achieve good surgical results.",medical,"Surgery, Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"

ORF3a is an accessory protein that plays a significant role in virus-host interactions and in facilitating host immune responses. Using putrescine, spermidine and spermine, an aliphatic polyamine for the activity suppression of ORF3a appears to be a promising approach in finding new targets for drug design. In this study, we explored the possible binding poses of polyamines to the ORF3a protein using a combination of various computational approaches i.e. pocket prediction, blind and site-specific molecular docking, molecular dynamics and ligand flooding simulations. The results showed that the tip of cytoplasmic domain and the upper tunnel of transmembrane domain of ORF3a provide a suitable binding site specific for the polyamines. MD simulations revealed the stability of spermidine binding in the upper tunnel pocket of ORF3a through salt bridge and hydrogen bond interactions between the amine groups of the ligand and negatively charged residues of ORF3a.

Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is considered as the most important source of mite allergens worldwide, with high sensitization rates for the major allergens Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 23. The aim of this work is to generate a hypoallergenic hybrid molecule containing T-cell epitopes from these three major allergens. Methods: The hybrid protein termed Der p 2231 containing T-cell epitopes was purified by affinity chromatography. The human IgE reactivity was verified by comparing those with the parental allergens. The hybrid was also characterized immunologically through an in vivo mice model. Results: The hybrid rDer p 2231 stimulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from allergic patients with higher levels of IL- 2, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-γ, as well as lower levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α and GM-CSF. The use of hybrid molecules as a therapeutic model in D. pteronyssinus allergic mice led to the reduction of IgE production and lower eosinophilic peroxidase activity in the airways. We found increased levels of IgG antibodies that blocked the IgE binding to the parental allergens in the serum of allergic patients. Furthermore, the stimulation of splenocytes from mice treated with rDer p 2231 induced higher levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ and decreased the secretion of IL-4 and IL-5, when compared with parental allergens and D. pteronyssinus extract. Conclusions: rDer p 2231 has the potential to be used in AIT in patients co-sensitized with D. pteronyssinus major allergens, once it was able to reduce IgE production, inducing allergen-specific blocking antibodies, restoring and balancing Th1/Th2 immune responses, and inducing regulatory T-cells.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Hybrid macaques from Koram Island (Thailand) provide an opportunity to examine the roles of inheritance and social learning to skill acquisition within a single ecological setting. These hybrids are a cross between tool-using Burmese long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis aurea) and non-tool-using common long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis fascicularis).

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is used to generate expectations for how social/asocial learning and inheritance structure the patterning in a social network. The results of the simulation show that various transmission mechanisms can be differentiated based on associations between individuals in a social network. The results provide an investigative framework for discussing tool use transmission pathways in the Koram social network.

We assessed treatment outcomes among youth living with HIV (YLHIV), initiating first-line ART and assessed the association between virological failure (VF) and timing of ART initiation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data for YLHIV aged 15–24 years, initiating non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART from 2014 to 2019, through the NAP database. We classified the timing of ART into three groups based on duration from HIV-positive diagnosis or system registration to ART initiation: (1) <1 month (rapid ART); (2) 1–3 months (intermediate ART); and (3) >3 months (delayed ART). VF was defined as viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of first-line ART. Factors associated with VF were analysed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Of 19,825 YLHIV who started ART, 78% were male. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 21 (20–23) years and CD4 count was 338 (187–498) cells/mm3. After registration, 12,216 (62%) started rapid ART, 4272 (22%) intermediate ART and 3337 (17%) delayed ART.

Miang extracts treated with and without tannase were investigated for their inhibitory effects on digestive enzymes. The optimal conditions for ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction of the highest total polyphenol (TP) (136.91 mg GAE/g dw) and total flavonoid (TF) (5.38 mg QE/g dw) contents were as follows: 1 U/g cellulase, 1 U/g xylanase, 1 U/g pectinase, temperature (74 °C), and time (45 min). The antioxidant activity of this extract was enhanced by the addition of tannase obtained from Sporidiobolus ruineniae A45.2 undergoing ultrasonic treatment and under optimal conditions (360 mU/g dw, 51 °C for 25 min). The ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction selectively promoted the extraction of gallated catechins from Miang. Tannase treatment improved the ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities of untreated Miang extracts by 1.3 times. The treated Miang extracts possessed higher IC50 values for porcine pancreatic α-amylase inhibitory activity than those that were untreated. However, it expressed approximately 3 times lower IC50 values for porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) inhibitory activity indicating a marked improvement in inhibitory activity. The molecular docking results support the contention that epigallocatechin, epicatechin, and catechin obtained via the biotransformation of the Miang extracts played a crucial role in the inhibitory activity of PPL. Overall, the tannase treated Miang extract could serve as a functional food and beneficial ingredient in medicinal products developed for obesity prevention.","mixing and separation, environmental, coastal engineering, medical, physics, chemistry","Environmental Chemistry, Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging, Acoustics and Ultrasonics, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Role of periosteum during healing of alveolar critical size bone defects in the mandible: a pilot study,"Duong L.T., Petit S., Kerner S., Clerc M.M., Arnoult C., Nowwarote N., Osathanon T., Fournier B.P.J., Isaac J., Ferre F.C.",2023-08-01,"Animals, Bone Regeneration, Female, Humans, Mandible, Periosteum, Pilot Projects, Swine, Swine, Miniature, X-Ray Microtomography, Alveolar bone loss, Bone regeneration, Bone remodeling, Minipig, Periosteum","Objectives: Minipigs present advantages for studying oral bone regeneration; however, standardized critical size defects (CSD) for alveolar bone have not been validated yet. The objectives of this study are to develop a CSD in the mandibular alveolar bone in Aachen minipigs and to further investigate the specific role of periosteum. Materials and methods: Three female Aachen minipigs aged 17, 24, and 84 months were used. For each minipig, a split-mouth design was performed: an osteotomy (2 cm height × 2.5 cm length) was performed; the periosteum was preserved on the left side and removed on the right side. Macroscopic, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), microcomputed tomography (µCT), and histological analyses were performed to evaluate the bone defects and bone healing. Results: In both groups, spontaneous healing was insufficient to restore initial bone volume. The macroscopic pictures and the CBCT results showed a larger bone defect without periosteum. µCT results revealed that BMD, BV/TV, and Tb.Th were significantly lower without periosteum. The histological analyses showed (i) an increased osteoid apposition in the crestal area when periosteum was removed and (ii) an ossification process in the mandibular canal area in response to the surgical that seemed to increase when periosteum was removed. Conclusions: A robust model of CSD model was developed in the alveolar bone of minipigs that mimics human mandibular bone defects. This model allows to further investigate the bone healing process and potential factors impacting healing such as periosteum. Clinical relevance: This model may be relevant for testing different bone reconstruction strategies for preclinical investigations.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

However, data on cellular immune responses in this population have not been established. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases and included studies reporting cellular immune response rates in kidney transplant recipients after receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Studies that reported factors associated with cellular immune responders or non-responders were also included (PROSPERO: CRD42022375544). Results: From a total of 1,494 articles searched, 53 articles were included in the meta-analysis. In all, 21 studies assessed cellular immune response by interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (IFN-γ ELISPOT), 22 studies used interferon-γ release assay (IGRA), and 10 studies used flow cytometric analysis. The pooled response rate after two doses (standard regimen) and three doses of vaccination was 47.5% (95%CI 38.4-56.7%) and 69.1% (95%CI 56.3-80.6%) from IFN-γ ELISPOT, 25.8% (95%CI 19.7-32.4%) and 14.7% (95%CI 8.5-22.2%) from IGRA, and 73.7% (95%CI 55.2-88.8%) and 86.5% (95%CI 75.3-94.9%) from flow cytometry, respectively. Recipients with seroconversion were associated with a higher chance of having cellular immune response (OR 2.58; 95%CI 1.89-3.54). Cellular immune response in kidney transplant recipients was lower than in dialysis patients (OR 0.24; 95%CI 0.16-0.34) and the general population (OR 0.10; 95%CI 0.07-0.14).

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the literature on assessing masticatory performance before, after orthognathic surgery and normal occlusion. Methods: An electronic search was performed via Pubmed, Scopus, LILACs and Web of Science without any restrictions until June 2022. The articles assessing masticatory performance using a comminution assay, bite force or occlusal contact area in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery with or without comparing controls were included. The risk of bias of the selected articles was assessed using the appropriate tools according to the study design. Results: Of the 2507 records identified, 21 studies were included in the qualitative evaluation and 17 studies in the meta-analysis. Nine articles were cohort studies, and the other eight were before–after studies. Moderate to high risks of bias were found among the articles. Comparing the values before and after surgery, the meta-analysis revealed a significant improvement in the bite force and occlusal contact area at 1- and 2-year post-surgery. However, regardless of the assessed parameters, the masticatory performance in patients with normal occlusion was significantly greater than those in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery at all evaluated time points. Conclusion: Although combined surgical orthodontic treatment can improve impaired masticatory function, assessed by the comminution method, bite force and occlusal contact area, the improvement may not reach that of normal occlusion.",dentistry,Dentistry (all)

Amongst formally known anti-coupling factors, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), produced by osteoclasts, plays a key role in downmodulating osteoblastogenesis. Sema4D is produced in both membrane-bound and soluble forms; however, the mechanism responsible for producing sSema4D from osteoclasts is unknown. Sema4D, TACE and MT1-MMP are all expressed on the surface of RANKL-primed osteoclast precursors. However, only Sema4D and TACE were colocalized, not Sema4D and MT1-MMP. When TACE and MT1-MMP were either chemically inhibited or suppressed by siRNA, TACE was found to be more engaged in shedding Sema4D. Anti-TACE-mAb inhibited sSema4D release from osteoclast precursors by ~90%. Supernatant collected from osteoclast precursors (OC-sup) suppressed osteoblastogenesis from MC3T3-E1 cells, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, but OC-sup harvested from the osteoclast precursors treated with anti-TACE-mAb restored osteoblastogenesis activity in a manner that compensates for diminished sSema4D. Finally, systemic administration of anti-TACE-mAb downregulated the generation of sSema4D in the mouse model of critical-sized bone defect, whereas local injection of recombinant sSema4D to anti-TACE-mAb-treated defect upregulated local osteoblastogenesis. Therefore, a novel pathway is proposed whereby TACE-mediated shedding of Sema4D expressed on the osteoclast precursors generates functionally active sSema4D to suppress osteoblastogenesis.",biochemistryistry,"Molecular Medicine, Cell Biology"

There are several factors that can complicate the healing process of wounds, including inadequate conditions for cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis, microbial infections, and prolonged inflammatory responses. Current therapeutic methods have not yet been able to resolve several primary problems; therefore, their effectiveness is limited. As a result of their remarkable properties, bio-based materials have been demonstrated to have a significant impact on wound healing in recent years. In the wound microenvironment, bio-based materials can stimulate numerous cellular and molecular processes that may enhance healing by inhibiting the growth of pathogens, preventing inflammation, and stimulating angiogenesis, potentially converting a non-healing environment to an appropriately healing one. The aim of this present review article is to provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying wound healing and its pathophysiology. The development of bio-based nanomaterials for chronic diabetic wounds as well as novel methodologies for stimulating wound healing mechanisms are also discussed.","chemistry, biochemistryistry, pharmacology","Analytical Chemistry, Chemistry (miscellaneous), Molecular Medicine, Pharmaceutical Science, Drug Discovery, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry"

TENGs are known for being self-energy harvesters, converting wasted mechanical energy to useful electrical energy under an ambient environment. Advantages of TENGs include a clean energy supply, a wide range of materials selection, and an energy scavenging capability in the ambient environment. However, TENGs still suffer from their low electrical outputs compared to existing electrical supplies such as fuel cells and batteries. In bio-photovoltaic (BPV), there has been an interest in the use of microalgae, which are photosynthetic microorganisms capable of carbon capture and generating bioelectricity both day and night through electron transport chains via photosynthesis and cell respiration. To increase the current output of BPV, many have tried to immobilize living microalgal cells onto electrodes for higher mass transfers leading to higher photosynthetic rates. In this study, we have used immobilized living microalgae (Chlorella sp.) onto aluminium sheets to fabricate the TENG systems and investigate biomechanical energy harvesting. This proof of concept shows that this integration of microalgae with TENG can enhance the voltage and current output achieved by the dual operation modes of TENG. One issue raised during the tests was maintaining microalgae alive for several days, which has given opportunities for further studies in nutrient and light supplies to this innovative sustainable hybrid technology. The results confirm that the microalgae can be an excellent triboelectric layer in TENG for biomechanical energy harvesting.

The oral cavity is the second most common site affected by cGVHD. In 2014, the 2005 National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria were revised to address areas of con-troversy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of oral cGVHD using the 2014 NIH consensus criteria. Material and Methods: The baseline data of oral manifestation of patients, who were diagnosed with oral cGVHD, in the first dental visit were analyzed (n=22). The oral mucosal disease was evaluated by NIH modified Oral Mucosa Rating Scale (OMRS) and Thongprasom sign score. The salivary gland disease and sclerotic disease were determined by the presence of signs and symptoms. The functional impact was assessed by the organ-specific severity score. Results: The median time from transplant to oral cGVHD diagnosis was 11.9 months. White striae with an erosive area was found in 72.7% of the patients. The mean ± SD of NIH modified OMRS was 6.1 ± 3.0. The most common and severely affected site of lichen planus-like features was buccal mucosa. Xerostomia, superficial mucocele and limited mouth opening were found in 18.2%, 9.1%, and 9.1%, respectively, of the patients. Almost all patients (90.9%) had partial limitation of oral intake. There were no significant differences in NIH modified OMRS or organ-specific severity score among the patient characteristic groups. Moreover, there was no association between the oral manifestations of cGVHD and the patient characteristics. Conclusions: The most common oral manifestation of cGVHD was white striae with an erosive area of oral mucosal disease, followed by xerostomia, superficial mucocele, and limited mouth opening. The 2014 NIH consensus criteria for diagnostic and severity assessment are informative and feasible in real-world practice.","medical, dentistry","Surgery, Otorhinolaryngology, Dentistry (all)"

Methods This retrospective study was performed at a large quaternary care medical center. All adult patients who presented to our institution between March and June 2020 with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and had a CXR up to 48 hours before a CTAP were included. Primary outcomes were the severity of lung disease before CTAP and mortality within 14 and 30 days. Logistic regression models were constructed to quantify the association between CXR score and CTAP findings. Penalized logistic regression models and random forests were constructed to identify key predictors (demographics, CTAP findings, and CXR score) of mortality. The discriminatory performance of these models, with and without CTAP findings, was summarized using area under the characteristic (AUC) curves. Results One hundred ninety-five patients (median age, 63 years; 119 men) were included. The odds of having CTAP findings was 3.89 times greater when a CXR score was classified as severe compared with mild (P = 0.002). When CTAP findings were included in the feature set, the AUCs for 14-day mortality were 0.67 (penalized logistic regression) and 0.71 (random forests). Similar values for 30-day mortality were 0.76 and 0.75. When CTAP findings were omitted, all AUC values were attenuated. Conclusions The CTAP findings were associated with more severe CXR score and may serve as predictors of COVID-19 mortality.","fluidex; related topics, medical","Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging"

Cu2+ is also counted among heavy metal pollutants in the environment, especially in water. Thus, a new approach towards quantifying Cu2+ ion is appealing. Here, we reported new ratiometric mixed-QDs probe for Cu2+ detection in an aqueous solution with the combined concept of ratiometric and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. This probe consists of blue Si QDs (donor) and yellow CdSe QDs (acceptor). The energy transfer from Si QDs and CdSe QDs was confirmed using the time-resolved fluorescence. The changes in the ratiometric fluorescence response of the mixed-QDs probe upon exposure to Cu2+ were studied using fluorospectrometry, while the mechanism of the Cu2+ quenching to the probe was studied using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. This approach provides a simple, fast, sensitive, selective, and accurate method with low detection limit (3.89 nmol L−1) with high selectivity to Cu2+ versus other biological and environmental relevant ions. Furthermore, this new mixed-QDs probe could be used as a naked-eye detection of Cu2+ for water samples and biological specimens with further development.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry","Analytical Chemistry, Spectroscopy, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

Complexation of CND with alginate can improve its therapeutic outcome. Here we have studied the complexation of CND with alginate under a range of pH values from 2.5 to 5. CND is positively charged at low pH, and becomes neutral, and then negatively charged as pH increases. CND/alginate complexation was studied by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, STEM, UV–Vis spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD). CND/alginate complexes at pH 4.0 and 5.0 form chiral fibres with a fractal structure. At these pH values, CD spectra show very intense bands, which are inverted compared with free CND. Complexation at lower pH results in disordered polymer structures and CD spectra show the same features as for CND in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest the formation of parallel CND dimers through complexation with alginate at pH 3.0, while at pH 4.0 CND dimers form in a cross like arrangement.","fluidex; related topics, chemistry, Materials Science","Organic Chemistry, Polymers and Plastics, Materials Chemistry"

Traditionally, an optimal basis is obtained via the iterative simplex method which improves from the current basic feasible solution to the adjacent one until it reaches optimal. The obtained result is the value of the optimal solution and the corresponding optimal basis. Even though learning the optimal value is hard but learning the optimal basis is possible via deep learning. This paper presents the primal-optimal-binding LPNet that learns from massive linear programming problems of various sizes casting as all-unit-row-except-first-unit-column matrices. During the training step, these matrices are fed to the special row-column convolutional layer followed by the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture and sent to two fully connected layers. The result is the probability vector of non-negativity constraints and the original linear programming constraints at the optimal basis. The experiment shows that this LPNet achieves 99% accuracy of predicting a single binding optimal constraint on unseen test problems and Netlib problems. It identifies correctly 80% LP problems having all optimal binding constraints and faster than cplex solution time.","fluidex; related topics, computer science",Computer Science (all)

In this article, we summarize the current position of SABAs when used as reliever medications and examine the challenges to appropriate use including a critique of the data that have led to the condemnation of SABA used as a reliever. We consider the evidence for the appropriate use of SABA as a reliever together with practical solutions to ensure such use, including identifying patients at risk of misusing their SABA relievers and managing issues of inhaler technique and treatment adherence. We conclude that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based maintenance treatment with SABA used as-needed as a reliever is an effective and safe treatment for patients with asthma, with no scientific evidence of a causal link between SABA use as a reliever and mortality or serious adverse events (including exacerbations). Increased SABA use warns of a deterioration in asthma control, and patients at risk of misusing their ICS and SABA medication should be rapidly identified to ensure they are receiving adequate ICS-based controller therapy. Appropriate use of ICS-based controller therapy and as-needed SABA should be encouraged and promoted with educational activities.",medical,Pharmacology (medical)
Carboxymethyl cellulose as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase for stable zinc-based anodes in aqueous electrolytes,"Tangthuam P., Kao-ian W., Sangsawang J., Rojviriya C., Chirawatkul P., Kasemchainan J., Mahlendorf F., Nguyen M.T., Yonezawa T., Kheawhom S.",2023-01-01,"Anionic polyelectrolyte, Carboxymethyl cellulose, Cyclability, Polyiodides, Protective layers, Solid electrolyte interphase, X-ray tomography, Zinc anodes, Zinc battery, Zinc-polyiodide, Anionic polyelectrolyte, Cyclability, Protective layer, X-ray tomography, zinc battery, Zn-polyiodide","Zinc (Zn) is viewed as a promising anode material for large-scale secondary batteries. However, due to parasitic reactions and uneven Zn distribution during repeated stripping/plating cycles, Zn anodes show inferior performance and stability. To overcome such drawbacks, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) is fabricated on a Zn sheet and Zn-graphite composite anode. The roles of CMC-ASEI are examined using X-ray tomography, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Results show that the carboxyl group in CMC can regulate the flux and local concentration of Zn ions at the surface, allowing uniform Zn dissolution/deposition, and can suppress corrosion by reducing water activities on the anode's surface. At 5 mA cm−2, the Zn-iodine battery having CMC-ASEI can cycle up to 2,000 cycles. This work provides a simple and scalable solution for advanced Zn anodes for Zn-based batteries.","corrosion, coastal engineering, energy, Materials Science","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Materials Science (miscellaneous), Fuel Technology"
Does social participation make Thai psychologically abused elders happier? a stress-buffering effect hypothesis,"Amornkitvikai Y., Prachuabmoh V., O'Brien M.",2023-01-01,"Adult Children, Aged, Elder Abuse, Female, Humans, Social Participation, Southeast Asian People, Thailand, Elder abuse, life satisfaction, older adults, stress-buffering","This study investigates the influence of psychological elder abuse on life satisfaction levels in Thailand. This study also analyses the stress-buffering effect of social participation on the life satisfaction levels of Thai mentally abused elderly. Elder abuse has been proven to dramatically reduce Thai elders’ levels of life satisfaction as their function in society shrinks owing to ageism. As a result, individuals are more likely to lose their independence and status and be forced to rely on others, increasing the danger of abuse. Elder abuse has a more significant negative impact on life satisfaction levels among Thai older women. Nonetheless, the mentally abused elderly who participate in social activities are happier than those who do not. Thai elders who live with their daughters are more satisfied in life than those who do not, but living with adult offspring does not assist psychologically abused elders in escaping their psychological suffering.","sociology, medical","Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Geriatrics and Gerontology"

However few studies have measured the ability of individuals to “withstand setbacks, adapt positively, and bounce back from adversity” on a global scale. We aimed to examine the level of resilience, its determinants, and its association with maladaptive coping behaviours during the pandemic. Methods: The Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU) conducted a global survey involving 26 countries by online, self-administered questionnaire (October 2020-December 2021). It was piloted-tested and validated by an expert panel of epidemiologists and primary care professionals. We collected data on socio-demographics, socioeconomic status, clinical information, lifestyle habits, and resilience levels measured by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) among adults aged ≥ 18 years. We examined factors associated with low resilience level, and evaluated whether low resilience was correlated with engagement of maladaptive coping behaviours. Results: From 1,762 surveys, the prevalence of low resilience level (BRS score 1.00–2.99) was 36.4% (America/Europe) and 24.1% (Asia Pacific). Young age (18–29 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.31–0.58 in older age groups), female gender (aOR = 1.72, 95% C.I. = 1.34–2.20), poorer financial situation in the past 6 months (aOR = 2.32, 95% C.I. = 1.62–3.34), the presence of one (aOR = 1.56, 95% C.I. = 1.19–2.04) and more than two (aOR = 2.32, 95% C.I. = 1.59–3.39) medical conditions were associated with low resilience level. Individuals with low resilience were significantly more likely to consume substantially more alcohol than usual (aOR = 3.84, 95% C.I. = 1.62–9.08), take considerably more drugs (aOR = 12.1, 95% C.I. = 2.72–54.3), buy supplements believed to be good for treating COVID-19 (aOR = 3.34, 95% C.I. = 1.56–7.16), exercise less than before the pandemic (aOR = 1.76, 95% C.I. = 1.09–2.85), consume more unhealthy food than before the pandemic (aOR = 2.84, 95% C.I. = 1.72–4.67), self-isolate to stay away from others to avoid infection (aOR = 1.83, 95% C.I. = 1.09–3.08), have an excessive urge to disinfect hands for avoidance of disease (aOR = 3.08, 95% C.I. = 1.90–4.99) and transmission (aOR = 2.54, 95% C.I. = 1.57–4.10). Conclusions: We found an association between low resilience and maladaptive coping behaviours in the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk factors identified for low resilience in this study were also conditions known to be related to globalization-related economic and social inequalities. Our findings could inform design of population-based, resilience-enhancing intervention programmes.","medicalcal geography, medical","Health Policy, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health"

A simple green synthesis approach of novel silver (Ag)-doped copper oxide (CuO) anchored graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (Ag-CuO@GO) via energy-efficient microwave heating method has been developed for photocatalytic and antimicrobial applications. Tea extract is used as a capping and reducing agent. The prepared Ag-CuO@GO nanocomposites (NCs) used for photocatalytic and antimicrobial activities are investigated systematically. The highly crystalline, well-interconnected Ag-CuO nanoparticles (NPs) over GO provide an enhanced surface area of 24.1 m2/g and an efficient pore diameter of 15.1 nm with more active sites. A reduced optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.48 eV obtained for the Ag-CuO@GO NCs, less than that of the bare and Ag-CuO, indicates that it can function as an efficient photocatalyst by harvesting solar energy. As demonstrated by the suppressed PL of the ternary Ag-CuO@GO nanocatalysts, additional of Ag and GO can efficiently separate the charge carriers. Ag-CuO@GO exhibited an 89% increase in the dye removal rate of MB dye and high antimicrobial activity against S.aureus, E.coli and Candida albicans that that of bare CuO and binary NCs. The synthesized novel Ag-CuO@GO NCs show promise as potential photocatalysts for the pollutant degradation and antimicrobial activity.","heat exchange, coastal engineering",Chemical Engineering (all)

The AISI 304L black and white coils from a company containing 1.08-1.71Mn and 0.22-0.40Cu (wt%) were used to study the effects of Mn and Cu on descaling rate by potentiodynamic polarization technique at 25 °C. The pickling solutions were 0.5 M HCl and 0.5 M HCl mixed with H2O2 of 0.5, 0.88 and 1.76 M. The polarization curves of black and white coil samples measured in HCl-H2O2 mixture showed no passive range. The descaling rate of black coil oxide scales, and the corrosion potential (Ecorr) increased with H2O2 concentration. Low-Mn sample, that is 1.08%Mn0.23%Cu sample, showed higher descaling rate than high-Mn samples. No effects of Cu content on the descaling rate were observed. For white coil samples, the descaling rates were almost constant, but pitting on surface was observed. Passive films were eliminated. The corrosion potentials of black and white coil samples increased when adding H2O2 in HCl solution indicating an increase in cathodic reaction due to increase in dissolved oxygen. The corrosion potentials of 1.08%Mn0.23%Cu black and white coil samples were lower than those of high-Mn samples corresponding to less Mn oxide.","steel, fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, engineering","Materials Science (all), Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering"

In this study, the stability of three-dimensional (3D) undrained clay slopes subjected to pseudo-static seismic load is investigated by utilising the finite element limit analysis (FELA) of rigorous upper and lower bounds. The FELA solutions are normalised and presented by a seismic stability number influenced by four dimensionless variables, namely, a depth factor, a slope length ratio, a slope inclination and a horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient. The impacts of a horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient on the mechanisms of 3D slope failures based on FELA are examined and discussed for the first time. The respective influence and sensitivity of each design parameter on the seismic stability number of 3D undrained slopes under the influence of seismic load is investigated using the multivariate adaptive regression spline analysis. A predicted equation that can be used to effectively estimate the seismic stability number, which can be of great interest to practitioners, is also developed.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, earth sciences, Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Architecture, Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology, Soil Science, Geology"

The cultural elements are found to be superficially universal in that they retain the language used in the guidelines found in the west but contain interestingly unique cultural elements when probed deeper. For example, many non-western guidelines have an injunction “Be ethical” without specifying the content of the ethical in question. We present an analysis of this and other unique aspects of the non-western guidelines in terms of broad cultural traditions that inform the guidelines and their drafters. This leads to a normative argument that what is understood to be universal in intercultural ethics is in fact based on the desire of many cultures to live and work together, and not, as ethical universalists seem to argue, on some culture-transcendent standard of morality.","fluidex; related topics, arts, computer science","Philosophy, Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence"

The objective of the proposed work is to detect cephalometric landmarks automatically on CT (computational tomography) images. Twenty cephalometric landmarks were automatically localized on 100 CT scans using hybrid coarse-to-fine computational method. The mean error for landmark detection was computed as 2.88 mm and standard deviation of 1.85 mm. The highest detection rate for cephalometric landmarks was received as 100% for Nasion landmark under 4-mm error and the highest detection rate was received as 99% for Nasion landmark under 3-mm error.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate corticosteroid efficacy on facial nerve regeneration and functional recovery after complete disruption and neurorrhaphy. Methods: Randomized controlled trials on both human and animal models from Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE studying corticosteroid efficacy in complete facial nerve disruption followed by neurorrhaphy were included. Data were extracted and pooled for meta-analysis. The outcomes were evaluated from electrophysiology, histology, and functional recovery. However, no randomized controlled trial in human was performed. Possibly, performing human trials with histopathology may not be feasible in clinical setting. Results: Six animal studies (248 participants) met inclusion criteria. Electrophysiologic outcomes revealed no differences in latency (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = −1.97, 95% CI −7.38 to 3.44, p = 0.47) and amplitude (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI −0.44 to 1.18, p = 0.37) between systemic corticosteroids and controls.

SC electrodes are commonly fabricated via the coating of MOs particles, conductive carbon and binders. However, such electrodes, can weaken the performance of SCs. In this work, binder-free nanocluster Cr-doped NiO thin films are grown on flexible stainless-steel (SS) foils using a one-step co-sputtering technique. The distinctive nanocluster structure of Cr-incorporated NiO thin film electrodes (TFEs) has the benefit of reduced ion diffusion length and good charge transport, and can increase the accessibility of ions onto the active surface area. The developed TFEs are examined in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, demonstrating highest areal capacitance of 429 mF cm−2 (251 mC cm−2). Subsequently, an asymmetric coin cell (ACC) SC is assembled. Even after 5,000 cycles, the developed ACC SC demonstrates exceptional cycling stability. Thereafter, the aging test is conducted after 720 h and reveals good electrochemical performance with minimal capacitance fading. Results reveal that Cr-doped NiO TFEs show excellent electrochemical performance with higher areal capacitance and stability compared to NiO and other metal oxide-based TFEs reported previously. The grown Cr-doped NiO binder-free TFEs are good candidates for high-performance and flexible energy storage systems.","fluidex; related topics, physics, Materials Science","Condensed Matter Physics, Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

However, none have studied this association using the very low frequency (VLF) band of HRV in adolescent populations. This study aimed to fill this gap by recruiting 90 adolescents to perform a light physical task at varying heights. Heart rates were used to calculate short-term HRV. The results showed a positive correlation between VLF bands and parasympathetic indices and a negative correlation with sympathetic indices, demonstrating the balancing effects of the autonomic modulation associated with height. The lowest VLF bands were obtained as 79.25 ms2 at 10 m (p < 0.001) and 62.87 ms2 at 9 m (p < 0.001) for the experienced and non-experienced male groups, respectively, and 28.09 ms2 at 6 m (p = 0.001) for the female group. The results also suggested the need for a relatively lower height restriction for female adolescents than for males. Practitioner summary: Increased working heights can cause stress, which leads to falling accidents. The very low frequency band was shown to be associated with parasympathetic and sympathetic indices. Furthermore, the results suggested that the height limit necessary for providing a safe working environment may be lower for female adolescents than for males.

To assess and tackle such issues, the researchers adopted the user-centric Design Thinking methodology to empathize with target users' pain points in this study. They proposed a solution in a user-centric manner by assessing the usability flaws of existing mobile navigation applications, such as Google Maps and ViaBus. By developing a holistic mobile application called 'Disgovery' that covers all modes of public transit in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and provides relevant information about their trips, the researchers aim to help commuters in Bangkok easily access it in a timely fashion. Through the user-friendly interface, commuters can eliminate the difficulty of finding routes and prices suitable to their needs. By making public transit more accessible with the help of ubiquitous mobile computing, commuters are also encouraged to switch from using private vehicles to public transit, which also can reduce accidents and carbon emissions. The findings from the usability testing in this study suggest that 'Disgovery' is an effective and user-friendly application for daily commuters in Bangkok that can help them achieve their goals without difficulties. The findings also indicate the importance of user interface and user experience guidelines in designing such applications.","fluidex; related topics, computer science, engineering","Computer Science (all), Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

Ultimately, this skin patch is successfully applied for the detection of sweat urea at its cut-off value (60 mM) for indicating chronic kidney disease (CKD) in artificial sweat with satisfactory results. By using dual-detection technique on single silk substrate, this platform might be an alternative approach for a non-invasive sweat urea detection with high precision.","mixing and separation, biochemistryistry","Structural Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology"
Acute kidney injury in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors: a retrospective real-world study,"Lumlertgul N., Vassallo P., Tydeman F., Lewis N., Hobill A., Weerapolchai K., Nordin N.Z., Seylanova N., Martin L., Cennamo A., Wang Y., Rigg A., Shaunak N., Ostermann M.",2023-09-01,"Acute Kidney Injury, Female, Humans, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Incidence, Kidney, Male, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Acute kidney injury, Cancer, Chronic kidney disease, Immune checkpoint inhibitors, Immunotherapy, Malignancy","Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including acute kidney injury (AKI). We investigated the incidence of ICPi-associated AKI (ICPi-AKI) and AKI from other causes (non-ICPi-AKI) in cancer patients treated with ICPi. Methods: This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of patients receiving ICPi therapy between December 2011 and August 2020. AKI was defined and staged by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria. The primary outcome was the incidence of AKI and ICPi-AKI. Results: A total of 1037 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 63 years, 60% were male, and 22% had pre-existing chronic kidney disease. Overall, 189 patients (18.2%) developed AKI of whom 37 patients (3.6%) had ICPi-AKI. In patients with progressive cancer, AKI was not associated with increased mortality. In treatment responders, non-ICPi-AKI was associated with an increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–3.67), whereas ICPi-AKI was not linked to an increased risk of death (adjusted HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.18–1.96). Patients with ICPi-AKI were more likely to have higher AKI stages and less likely to have complete kidney recovery compared with non-ICPi-AKI (54% versus 79%, p = 0.01). Conclusion: AKI was common in cancer patients treated with ICPi. Patients with ICPi-AKI had worse kidney outcomes compared to those with AKI from other causes. However, non-ICPi-AKI was associated with a higher risk of death. These findings emphasise the importance of identifying different sub-phenotypes of AKI.","medical, biochemistryistry","Oncology, Cancer Research"
Induction of Antimicrobial Resistance of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by Exposure to Nonlethal Levels of Antibiotics,"Chatree Y., Charoenlap N., Vanitshavit V., Ruangrassamee P., Mongkolsuk S., Vattanaviboon P.",2023-04-01,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Ceftazidime, Ciprofloxacin, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections, Humans, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, AMR, antibiotic, antimicrobial resistance, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","The effects of the sequential subculture in the presence of a driving force on antimicrobial resistance of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a were investigated. Stationary-phase cells were inoculated into the lysogeny broth medium, with and without antibiotic supplementation, and grown until the stationary phase before being subcultured into the same antibiotic-supplemented medium for six consecutive cycles. Thirty colonies from each cycle and treatment condition were selected and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined. The sequential subculture of K279a for a number of cycles reduced susceptibility to diverse classes of antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, co-trimoxazole, and chloramphenicol, regardless of the antibiotic used. Supplementation with antibiotics that is, ampicillin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime, at sublethal concentrations significantly accelerated the development rate of strains that reduced susceptibility to other antibiotics. The patterns of reduced susceptibility were different depending on the antibiotic used for supplementation. Thus, without gene transfer, antibiotic-resistant strains of S. maltophilia can readily develop, especially after antibiotic treatments. Whole-genome sequence analysis of the selected antibiotic-resistant mutants identified gene mutations that might be responsible for antimicrobial resistance of S. maltophilia.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, Immunology, pharmacology, medical","Microbiology, Immunology, Pharmacology, Microbiology (medical)"

We aimed to estimate the treatment effect and find the best gait rehabilitation to regain velocity, distance, and Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) among incomplete spinal cord injury patients. Method: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from inception to October 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in comparison with any of the following: conventional physical therapy, treadmill, functional electrical stimulation and robotic-assisted gait training, and reported at least one outcome. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted the data. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects or fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was indirectly compared with all interventions and reported as pooled unstandardized mean difference (USMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated to identify the best intervention. Results: We included 17 RCTs (709 participants) with the mean age of 43.9 years. Acute-phase robotic-assisted gait training significantly improved the velocity (USMD 0.1 m/s, 95% CI 0.05, 0.14), distance (USMD 64.75 m, 95% CI 27.24, 102.27), and WISCI (USMD 3.28, 95% CI 0.12, 6.45) compared to conventional physical therapy. In NMA, functional electrical stimulation had the highest probability of being the best intervention for velocity (66.6%, SUCRA 82.1) and distance (39.7%, SUCRA 67.4), followed by treadmill, functional electrical stimulation plus treadmill, robotic-assisted gait training, and conventional physical therapy, respectively. Conclusion: Functional electrical stimulation seems to be the best treatment to improve walking velocity and distance for incomplete spinal cord injury patients.

There are currently multiple treatment options in this group of patients such as oral and intranasal corticosteroids, olfactory training, oral vitaminmineral supplementation, amongst others. This meta-analysis aims to consolidate existing evidence for current therapies in patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction related to COVID-19 infection and evaluate the possible role of corticosteroid add-on therapy in olfactory training. Methodology: A systematic review and meta-analysis to study current treatments/interventions for olfactory dysfunction in post-COVID-19 infection were conducted. Data were pooled for the meta-analysis. The outcomes include subjective or objective olfactory assessment major and minor adverse reactions. Results: Eleven studies (1414 participants) were included in this review, with six studies (916 participants) then assessed for the meta-analysis. Combined treatment of intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) with olfactory training (OT) has no benefit over OT monotherapy from both a VAS score improvement and identification component of Sniffin' Sticks test standpoint. In addition, there were no differences in improvement of TDI score between combined oral corticosteroid (OCS) with OT therapy compared to OT alone.

Improved electrochemical supercapacitive properties of CuO-Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites by eco-friendly low-temperature synthesis,"Govindarajan D., Murugadoss G., Kirubaharan K., Manavalan R.K., Manibalan G., Shaikh J., Etesami M., Kheawhom S.",2023-05-05,"Composites electrodes, CuO-ni(OH)2 nanocomposite, Cycling stability, Dunn approach, Electrochemicals, Low temperature synthesis, Lows-temperatures, Oxygen evolution, Oxygen evolution, cycling stability, Property, CuO-Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite, Dunn's approach, Low-temperature synthesis, Oxygen evolution, Cycling stability, Supercapacitors","Due to its impressive electrochemical supercapacitive behavior, low-temperature processed CuO-Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite-based electrode materials have gained much attention. In the present study, a facile, low temperature chemical precipitation technique was employed using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant for the synthesis of CuO-Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite. To examine the structure and phase purity of the prepared nanocomposite, XRD is carried out. FT-IR analysis confirms the presence of functional groups related to the bare CuO, and Ni(OH)2, as well as the CuO-Ni(OH)2. The CuO-Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite formation and surface chemical properties is examined by FE-SEM, TEM and XPS analyses. The obtained UV result reveals a narrow band gap of ∼1.47 eV for CuO-Ni(OH)2. In this study, the developed electrodes show a specific capacitance of 151 F g-1 for CuO, 180 F g-1 for Ni(OH)2, and 436 F g-1 for the CuO-Ni(OH)2 electrode, which is two-fold greater than that of pristine sample. Additionally, the CuO-Ni(OH)2 electrode's capacitive and diffusive charge contributions are investigated using Dunn's method, which shows 90.52% of capacitive and 9.48% diffusive contributions at 20 mV s− 1. Charge-discharge profiles reveal a symmetrical and non-linear trend, confirming the electrodes' pseudo-capacitive behavior. Furthermore, after 3000 cycles, the CuO-Ni(OH)2 composite electrode reaches maximum efficiency of ∼89%. Results demonstrate that the developed CuO-Ni(OH)2 composite proves to be a promising alternative electrode for energy storage devices. Additionally, the synthesized CuO-Ni(OH)2 composite electrode demonstrates a better OER performance (overpotential: 0.396 V at 10 mA cm-2) compared to the reference catalysts. Due to its superior OER and supercapacitive properties, CuO-Ni(OH)2 based composite electrodes are envisaged to be used in next-generation electrochemical energy devices.","fluidex; related topics, engineering, Materials Science","Mechanics of Materials, Mechanical Engineering, Metals and Alloys, Materials Chemistry"

Since brokerage offers early access to diverse perspectives and autonomy in exchange relations, the benefits of brokerage should rise when crises erupt. However, evidence on the subject has been inconclusive, raising the question of whether crisis actually imposes a boundary condition on structural hole theory. Using longitudinal data on investment banks, and exploiting the 2000 dot.com crisis as well as the 2008 financial crisis, we explore whether crises moderate the favorable effect of brokerage on performance. Our results reveal that only exclusive, and not shared, structural holes are advantageous for performance, as they facilitate ambidextrous responses to crisis. Implications for brokerage theory and new research on crisis are discussed. Managerial Summary: Crises, in the form of pandemics, wars, or market crashes, affect the relationship between a firm's position in collaboration networks and its future performance. Our analyses bring into focus a finding of interest to managers of firms operating as brokers in these networks: when a crisis erupts, a firm that serves as the sole bridge between its otherwise disconnected collaborators performs especially well. Uncontested by other intermediaries, such firms achieve a better mix of search and stability, and thus higher performance, amidst crisis. These advantages disappear when other intermediaries are present. This implies that firms frequently exposed to crisis may benefit from constructing entry barriers around their bridging positions in collaboration networks.","fluidex; related topics, Business","Business and International Management, Strategy and Management"

Pyocyanin is one of the popular markers to identify Pseudomonas infections. However, no existing sensors are on the verge of being used as a suitable sensor for detecting pyocyanin in real-world applications. This study employed a physically cross-linked approach to decorate the surface of a working electrode with a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs/PVA) nanocomposite, which increases electron transport, sample absorption, and biocompatibility. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical behavior of a pyocyanin sensor was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. The developed pyocyanin sensor demonstrated an excellent analytical range covering a clinically relevant range of 1-100 μM pyocyanin in various sample matrices including phosphate buffer, Lysogeny broth, simulated wound exudate, and Mueller-Hinton broth, showing a detection limit of 0.48, 0.10, 1.63, and 0.39 μM, respectively, with R2 > 0.99. The sensor’s potential wearability and point-of-care capability were demonstrated by detecting pyocyanin in wounds on ex vivo porcine skin and an in vivo animal model with excellent biocompatible property, achieving cell viability of L-929 > 80%. The detection could be performed directly in various sample matrices without any preparation processes. The sensor demonstrated high selectivity and sensitivity in the presence of common wound interferences. As a result, the proposed method has the potential to be a promising sensor for the early detection of P. aeruginosa infection in wounds in the perspective of wound care technology in the future.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, chemistry","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Materials Chemistry, Electrochemistry"

There is a scarcity of research on how to implement dynamic CAIS training in the settings of postgraduate university education. Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of two modes of CAIS training programs on motor skill acquisition of novice surgeons. Materials and methods: Thirty-six postgraduate students without experience in dynamic CAIS systems were randomly assigned to a distributed training program (3 training sessions over 3 days) or a massed training (3 training sessions over the same day). A post-test involving the placement of one implant was conducted for both groups, 7 days after completion of the training. Surgical time and implant accuracy were recorded and analyzed, using independent t-tests, with 0.05 significant level. Results: Both groups reached the accuracy benchmarks expected by current standards in the use of CAIS. No significant differences with regards to accuracy were found between the groups, but a trend was documented favoring performance of distributed (mean difference—0.4, 95% confidence interval—0.7–0.1) in the accuracy at platform level. Distributed training students performed faster than massed for the third trial (mean difference—95.0, 95% confidence interval—178.8 to −11.2). Conclusions: Novice students reached the accuracy benchmarks with the use of CAIS through both a massed and a distributed training program, while there was a strong but marginally not significant trend for higher accuracy in the distributed group.

The reductase (C1) module of a hydroxylase from the soil microbe Acinetobacter baumannii catalyzes the oxidation of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by oxygen with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product, in a reaction that is allosterically activated by concentration-dependent binding of the disease biomarker 4-HPA. Here, we show an economical, facile fabrication of a disk electrode based on an electrical copper (Cu) cable that produces a functioning analytical tool for C1-based 4-HPA biosensing with interference-free H2O2 amperometric readout. In phosphate buffer with C1, the Cu disk is operated at H2O2 reduction potential. Sample addition and the start of electrochemical cell current acquisition are followed by NADH injection, with the resultant H2O2 formation monitored as an increase in current. Samples containing 4-HPA produce allosteric activation of C1, while 4-HPA-free samples have no effect. The activation of 4-HPA, resulting in a steeper H2O2 current trace, is dependent on the 4-HPA concentration: calibration plots showed a sensitivity of about 20-μM H2O2 s-1/μM 4-HPA and were linear up to 20 μM before approaching a signal plateau on saturation of the effector binding sites. The methodology was able to differentiate between healthy and pathological 4-HPA concentrations in urine samples. The development of the proposed methodology into a diagnostic assay for clinical analysis and personal healthcare is feasible by transferring to screen-printed Cu electrode platforms in combination with handheld potentiostats.","fluidex; related topics, physics, engineering","Instrumentation, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

It was found that P. purpureum's shoots and roots grown in the presence of EDTA accumulated significantly higher Cd than those grown in the absence of EDTA. Synchrotron μX-ray fluorescence imaging demonstrated the significant Cd accumulation in the internal tissues of root: endodermis, xylem and phloem, while at stem, it was found at the external tissues: epidermis and phloem. Synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy was used to characterize the Cd speciation in plant cells. P. purpureum was discovered to accumulate Cd (II) form. In order to determine the possibilities of Cd bonding in chemical compounds, linear combination fitting of Cd K-edge XANES spectra was carried out. The EDTA-free condition as a control revealed mainly Cd–N/O bonding ligand, while the EDTA-treated condition mostly showed Cd–N/O and Cd–S bonding.

The SOFC–H+ and single-stage LiBr absorption chiller models were developed through Aspen Plus V10. From the sensitivity analysis, the results show that increases in temperature and fuel utilization can improve the performance of the SOFC–H+. Conversely, the air to fuel (A/F) molar ratio and pressure negatively affect the electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency. In the case of the absorption chiller, the coefficient of performance was increased and made stable according to a constant value when the generator temperature was increased from 90 to 100 °C. When the optimization was performed, it was found that the SOFC–H+ should be operated at 700 °C and 10 bar with fuel utilization of 0.8 and A/F molar ratio of 2 to achieve a maximum overall efficiency of 93.34%. For the energy and exergy analysis, a combined heat and power SOFC–H+ was found to have the highest energy and exergy efficiencies, followed by the trigeneration process. This indicates that the integration of the SOFC–H+ and LiBr absorption chiller is possible to efficiently produce electricity, heating and cooling.","petroleum substitutes; energygy supply; conversion and storage, heat exchange, energy, physics","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Fuel Technology, Condensed Matter Physics, Energy Engineering and Power Technology"
Alcohol Solvent Assisted Synthesis of Metallic and Metal Oxide Catalysts: As-Prepared Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 Catalysts for Low-Temperature Methanol Synthesis with an Ultrahigh Yield,"Chen F., Liang J., Wang F., Gao W., Kugue Y., He Y., Guo X., Yang G., Liu G., Wu J., Reubroycharoen P., Vitidsant T., Tsubaki N.",2023-05-05,"Alcohol solvent, Alcohol solvent assisted method, Cu/ZnO/al2O3, Low-temperature methanol synthesis, Lows-temperatures, Metal oxides catalysts, Metal-oxide, Metallic oxides, Methanol synthesis, ]+ catalyst, alcohol solvent assisted method, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, low-temperature methanol synthesis, metal oxide, oxalic acid","Metallic (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) and metal oxide (Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO) catalysts are prepared by a facile alcohol solvent assisted method without additional aging and washing steps. In contrast to the conventional solid-state method using an oxalic acid/M2+ (M = metal cation) molar ratio as high as 4/1, this method is easily operated at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and an oxalic acid/M2+ molar ratio of only 1.06/1, which prevents the release of lots of flammable gases from the decomposition of excessive oxalic acid. The effect of alcohol solvent types on the physicochemical properties of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and catalytic performance for low-temperature methanol synthesis is systemically studied. Using 1-propanol as solvent, the catalyst realizes an ultrahigh methanol yield of 1782.5 g/kgcat·h-1 at 220 °C and 5.0 MPa, much higher than most reported Cu-based catalysts for conventional high-temperature methanol synthesis. Besides, the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by the alcohol solvent assisted method displayed much higher catalytic activity compared to other catalysts synthesized by conventional methods such as co-precipitation, impregnation, sol-gel, solid-state, and urea hydrolysis. Such good catalytic activity was due to the higher Cu0 surface area, smaller Cu crystallite size, greater surface basicity, and stronger H2 adsorption ability. This work provides not only a hopeful strategy for the large-scale fabrication of metallic and metal oxide catalysts but also a self-catalysis reaction pathway to achieve low-temperature methanol synthesis from CO and CO2 hydrogenation.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, chemistry","Catalysis, Chemistry (all)"

In this study, selected cultivars of yeasts isolated from a variety of locations such as botanical gardens in Thailand urban areas, which are often found highly polluted in the air such as carbon dioxide which is a cause of acid rain. There is limited information about how tolerant yeasts, are or their functional properties related to the environment. Yeast species were determined by using the 18S rDNA sequence guide. The level of acid tolerance was evaluated by adding to the culture medium lactic acid (300–900 mM), acetic acid (100–400 mM), and propionic acid (25–100 mM). 18S rDNA analysis has shown a %similarity of the nucleotide sequence higher than 98.65% compared to the database. Schwanniomyces etchellsii strains found in urban city soil were notable for their tolerance of lactic acid up to 100 mM. There are two main types of yeasts in overall acid tolerance: S. etchellsii, which is recognized as an osmotic pressure-resistant species that is highly resistant to fermentation inhibitors and produces ethanol; and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which cell wall has been reported to be characterized by accumulation of α-(1,3)-glucan and malic acid can be used in metabolic pathways. The results show that S. pombe, isolated from rice paddy fields, can grow efficiently in acetic and propionic acid up to 400 mM and 100 mM, respectively. This species could be cultured in ethanol at a concentration of 12.5% (v/v). Moreover, it presented high ethanol and acetic acid production of 14.5–15.9 g/L and 7–10 g/L, respectively, with or without acidic conditions. In comparison, S. etchellsii, isolated from the botanical garden soil, which is grown in acetic, propionic, and lactic acid, was also indicated to be an organic acid-tolerant species.","fluidex; related topics, biochemistryistry, Immunology","Biotechnology, Physiology, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology"

Conclusions: Liraglutide added with insulin infusion can attenuate perioperative BG and is beneficial in the aspect of lowering GV together with BG at the postoperative period in DM patients. Liraglutide can be applied in cardiac surgery but a rearrangement of time and dosage should be further investigated.",medical,"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"
Preparation of Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed) loaded hydrogels and the effect of electrical potentials on the total flavonoids releasing behavior for wound healing application,"Kantha P., Phiw-on S., Pinyakong O., Teepoo S., Bootchanont A., Barnthip N.",2023-01-01,"Chromolaenum odorata (siam weed), Electrical potential, External voltages, Flavonoid, Gelatin hydrogels, Siam weeds, Total flavonoids, Wound care, Wound healing, Wound healing material, biomaterials, Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed), Gelatin hydrogel, wound care, wound healing materials","Gelatin hydrogels containing the Chromolaena odorata (Siam Weed) crude extract were fabricated to study the morphology, the percentage of swelling, the total flavonoids released under a system without and with the external voltage stimulation, and the antibacterial properties. The percentage of pore area per cross-sectional area of the hydrogel was 23.56%. The hydrogels showed the extraordinarily high swelling percentage of 1,087.32 ± 16.16%. The total released flavonoids increased over time for both the systems without and with the external voltage stimulation. The total released flavonoid content from the systems with the external voltage stimulation was in larger quantities and more rapidly release comparing to the system in the absence of external voltage stimulation. The equivalent amount of the total released flavonoid tended to increase with the stimulating voltage of 0–0.3 V, but decreased when the excitation voltage was more than 0.3 V. Preferred amount of the total flavonoids released from hydrogels could be partly controlled by specific voltage stimulation. The fabricated hydrogel exhibits novel and great initial properties for wound healing materials and wound care application not only due to its extremely water absorption characteristic, but also perfectly in Gram-positive bacteria growth inhibition, which is ideal for the treatment of certain wounds with infection.","mixing and separation, chemistry, Materials Science, physics","Chemistry (all), Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics"

The purpose of developing glasses is to be applied as proton or x-ray energy detectors for medical purposes. Physical and scintillating properties of the fabricated glasses were tested and analyzed, including glass density and spectroscopic properties such as transmittance, photoluminescence, x-ray absorption near edge structure, and x-ray-induced luminescence. Moreover, the glasses were impinged by a 70 MeV proton beam at the Proton Center of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital to observe their proton-induced light emission. The absorption edge of the transmittance revealed that the glasses showed a redshift at high concentrations of BaO and CeF3. The glasses had a broad emission band centering around 400 nm due to the 5d–4f transition of Ce3+ induced by x-ray. The higher light yield was observed at a higher cerium compound glass. Our glass can clearly measure the depth-dose profile of the impinging proton beam by varying different water thicknesses. Moreover, the depth-dose profile results are in good agreement with that of the energy deposition of proton beams in glass calculated via GATE simulation.","fluidex; related topics, Materials Science, physics, engineering","Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials, Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Electrical and Electronic Engineering"

RA07 on the phytoremediation potential of lead (Pb)- and copper (Cu)-contaminated soils by Sorghum bicolor L. The strain RA07 was able to tolerate Pb and Cu, and exhibited plant growth-promoting features like siderophore production, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity and phosphate solubilization. The combined application of CA and strain RA07 significantly increased S. bicolor growth, chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzymatic activity, and decreased oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content) under Pb and Cu stress circumstances as compared to individual treatments (i.e., CA and strain RA07). Furthermore, the combined application of CA and RA07 significantly enhanced S. bicolor ability to accumulate Pb and Cu by 64.41% and 60.71% in the root and 188.39% and 125.56% in the shoot, respectively, as compared to the corresponding uninoculated plants. Our results indicate that inoculation of Nocardiopsis sp. together with CA could be a useful practical approach to mitigate Pb and Cu stress on plant growth and increase the effectiveness of phytoremediation in Pb- and Cu-polluted soils.","geobase; related topics, environmental","Environmental Chemistry, Pollution, Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis"

This study identified four forms of the secretin family of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) from the Y-organ of mud crab, Scylla olivacea (ScoGPCR). A full-length sequence of ScoGPCR-B2 was isolated and identified as a lipoprotein receptor while three forms of GPCR in Methuselah-like (Mthl) or B3 subfamilies were reported as ScoGPCR-B3a, -B3b, and -B3c. These four forms exhibit common features of the 7-trans membrane (7TM) domain and distinct aspects in the extracellular region (ECR) at the N-terminus. At the ECR, disulfide bridges are predicted to generate structural stability in all four forms while the putative ScoGPCR-B3 proteins retain conserved Tyr, Trp, Pro, and Phe residues, possibly to form the aromatic-proline interactions and function as key residues for receptor recognition. Expression levels of ScoGPCR-B2 and -B3 in eyestalk, thoracic ganglion, and hindgut between intermolt and premolt stages are similar. Only ScoGPCR-B2 and ScoGPCR-B3a in Y-organ (YO) seem to be premolt-specific responses. An upregulation of ScoGPCR-B2 in YO at the premolt stage is correlated with the demand for cholesterol used in ecdysteroid synthesis, resulting in increased ecdysteroid titers. The effects of ecdysone on YO were pursued by in vitro incubation and revealed that ScoGPCR-B3a and -B3b expressions were induced in a different time frame: early in ScoGPCR-B3b and late in ScoGPCR-B3a. The early response of ScoGPCR-B3b was followed through immunohistology and showed that the newly synthesized protein was located primarily in the cytosol.",biochemistryistry,Genetics

METHODS: Rats were orally given chlorogenic acid or quercetin (100 mg/kg; 5 days), followed by indomethacin (40 mg/kg; single dose). After 24 h, GI tissues were assessed for histopathological damages, then analysed by ELISA and western blot methods. Cell viability was measured in vitro by MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Unlike quercetin, chlorogenic acid could not prevent gastric ulcers in indomethacin-treated rats. The levels of gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the chlorogenic acid-treated group were not different from those receiving indomethacin alone. Nevertheless, both compounds alleviated jejunum ulcers through suppression of PERK/eIF-2/ATF-4/CHOP-related endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and decrease Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Moreover, at 100 µM, they abolished the cytotoxicity of tunicamycin (an ER stress inducer) in gastric (AGS) and intestinal (Caco-2) cells. In silico docking studies suggested that both compounds could interact with key amino acid residues in the -catalytic domain of PERK. CONCLUSION: Chlorogenic acid and quercetin exerted comparable protective effects against indomethacin-induced intestinal ulcer through suppression of ER stress-mediated apoptosis but, unlike quercetin, chlorogenic acid offered no protection against gastric ulceration due to its -inability to increase PGE2 production.",medical,Medicine (all)

However, salable CaCO3 products need to meet specific requirements. For the paint and paper manufacturing industries, the whiteness index (WI) of CaCO3 is an important property because it strongly influences the final color of paper and paint products. In this study, the effects of retention time and pulp density on the WI after attrition-scrubbing of calcite tailings were investigated. To increase the whiteness index, an attrition scrubber was used to remove impurities on the CaCO3 surface with different pulp densities—40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 70% solids—and retention time—10, 15, 20, and 25 min—as process variables. The results of laboratory-scale experiments found that the attrition-scrubbing process improved the whiteness index of CaCO3 tailings and reduced its iron content. The optimum condition was at the pulp density of 55% solids, which was used in the pilot-scale experiments. The results of the pilot-scale tests were consistent with the laboratory-scale, indicating that the attrition-scrubbing process can be used to improve the quality of CaCO3 tailings.","mixing and separation, chemistry, coastal engineering","Chemistry (all), Chemical Engineering (all), Process Chemistry and Technology, Filtration and Separation"

Methods: This study recruited children aged 5-7 years. All samples were tested for anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and total anti-RBD Ig. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against Omicron BA.5 were determined using a focus reduction neutralization test. Results: A total of 196 serum samples from unvaccinated children with infection (n = 57), vaccination alone (n = 71), and hybrid immunity (n = 68). Our results showed that 90% of the samples from children with hybrid immunity, 62.2% from two-dose vaccination, and 48% from Omicron infection alone had detectable nAbs against Omicron BA.5. The highest neutralizing titer was observed in infection plus two-dose vaccination, which reached 6.3-fold increase, whereas nAb titers in two-dose vaccination was comparable to Omicron-infected sera. However, sera from pre-Omicron infection and single-dose vaccination failed to neutralize Omicron BA.5; although, the total anti-RBD Ig were comparable with Omicron-infected sera. Conclusion: This result highlights that hybrid immunity provided cross-reactive antibodies to neutralize Omicron BA.5 compared with either vaccination or infection alone. The finding emphasizes the importance of vaccination in unvaccinated children who are infected with pre-Omicron or Omicron variants.",medical,"Microbiology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Acne severity, sebum level and tolerability were assessed concomitantly in each visit. We found that both VAA and BP could significantly reduce the bacterial diversity at month 1 (p-value = 0.010 and 0.004 respectively), while no significant reduction was observed in DC group. The microbiota compositions also significantly altered for beta diversity in all treatments (all p-value = 0.001). An increased Cutibacterium with decreased Staphylococcus relative abundance was observed at months 1 and 3 in DC group, while an opposite trend was demonstrated in VAA and BP groups.

Sb doping enhanced the lamellar orientation, decreased the grain size, and created an acceptor impurity level. The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient decreased with increasing Sb doping. A minimum reduction in the thermal conductivity by approximately three times that of the undoped sample was obtained at x = 0.005 with a value of 0.40 W/m K at 523 K. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) was obtained at x = 0.005 with a value of 0.47 at 523 K.

Therefore, the factors contributing to this intervention should be identified in order to minimize failures. Aims: We sought to determine the factors associated with immediate and early extubation in pediatric living-donor liver transplant recipients. Methods: The medical records of pediatric liver transplant recipients at our center from January 2013 to December 2021, a 9-year period, were retrospectively collected and divided into early or delayed extubation groups. Factors associated with early extubation were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses, as the primary outcome. Comparisons of the postoperative management and outcomes between groups were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results: Seventy-nine patients were included in the analysis, of whom 19 (24%) were immediately extubated in the operating room while 12 patients (15%) were extubated early, within 24 h postoperatively. These 31 patients (39%) were assigned to the early extubation group, whereas the others were assigned to the delayed extubation group. Shorter anhepatic time was the only factor associated with early extubation (adjusted odds ratio = 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.30, 0.89 per 30-min increment; p-value =.018) in patients with the same characteristics, including diagnosis, total operative time, and intraoperative volume of albumin and packed red blood cells. The length of intensive care unit stay was shorter in the early extubation group than in the delayed extubation group (p =.001). The rates of total and early medical complications and total reintubation in 30 days were significantly higher in the delayed extubation group than in the early extubation group (p-value =.002,.044, and.006 respectively). There were no significant differences in the length of hospital stay between the groups. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that 39% of the pediatric living donor–liver transplantation patients tolerated early extubation and that the only associated factor was anhepatic time. Early extubation significantly reduces the number of days of intensive care unit stay but may not change the length of hospital stay.",medical,"Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine"

The fluorescence changes of immobilized molecules from the interaction with gaseous amines were used to monitor changes in freshness levels. Thanks to the high-throughput nature of macroarray synthesis, a set of highly responsive molecules such as pyridinium and dicyanovinyl moieties were quickly revealed. Importantly, this method offers flexibility in sensing applications including (1) sensing by individual sensor molecules, where the fluorescence response correlated well with established titration methods, and (2) collective sensing whereby chemometric analysis was used to provide a cutoff of freshness with 73–100% accuracy depending on meat types.

Prevalence and associated factors were assessed in a multicentre, Asian longitudinal paediatric cohort. Methods: CLHIV were considered to have lipid or glucose abnormalities if they had total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ≤35 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ≥100 mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) ≥110 mg/dL, or fasting glucose >110 mg/dL. Factors associated with lipid and glucose abnormalities were assessed by logistic regression. Results: Of 951 CLHIV, 52% were male with a median age of 8.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0–12.0) years at ART start and 15.0 (IQR 12.0–18.0) years at their last clinic visit. 89% acquired HIV perinatally, and 30% had ever used protease inhibitors (PIs). Overall, 225 (24%) had hypercholesterolemia, 105 (27%) low HDL, 213 (58%) high LDL, 369 (54%) hypertriglyceridemia, and 130 (17%) hyperglycemia. Hypercholesterolemia was more likely among females (versus males, aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.40–2.67). Current PIs use was associated with hypercholesterolemia (current use: aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09–2.20); low HDL (current use: aOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.94–5.15; prior use: aOR 10.55, 95% CI 2.53–43.95); hypertriglyceridemia (current use: aOR 3.90, 95% CI 2.65–5.74; prior use: aOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.31–6.39); high LDL (current use: aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.09–2.76); and hyperglycemia (prior use: aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.42–4.18). Conclusion: More than half and one-fifth of CLHIV have dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, respectively. Routine paediatric HIV care should include metabolic monitoring. The association between PIs use and dyslipidemia emphasizes the importance of rapidly transitioning to integrase inhibitor-containing regimens.","pharmacology, medical","Pharmacology, Pharmacology (medical), Infectious Diseases"

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of lung cancers, shows chemotherapy resistance, metastasis, and relapse. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has been implicated in the carcinogenesis and disease progression of NSCLC, suggesting that it may be a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Although phenylurea derivatives have been reported as potent multiple kinase inhibitors, novel unsymmetrical N,Nʹ-diarylurea derivatives targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway in NSCLC cells remain unknown. Methods: N,Nʹ-substituted phenylurea derivatives CTPPU and CT-(4-OH)-PU were investigated for their anticancer proliferative activity against three NSCLC cell lines (H460, A549, and H292) by 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, colony formation, Hoechst33342/PI staining assays, and apoptosis analysis. The protein expressions of Akt pathway-related proteins in response to CTPPU or CT-(4-OH)-PU were detected by Western blot analysis. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes mapper was used to identify the possible signaling pathways in NSCLC treated with CTPPU. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Molecular docking was used to investigate the possible binding interaction of CTPPU with Akt, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), and PI3Ks. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were used to validate our prediction. Results: The cytotoxicity of CTPPU was two-fold higher than that of CT-(4-OH)-PU for all NSCLC cell lines. Similarly, the non-cytotoxic concentration of CTPPU (25 µM) dramatically inhibited the colony formation of NSCLC cells, whereas its relative analog CT-(4-OH)-PU had no effect. Protein analysis revealed that Akt and its downstream effectors, namely, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β (Ser9), β-catenin, and c-Myc, were reduced in response to CTPPU treatment, which suggested the targeting of Akt-dependent pathway, whereas CT-(4-OH)-PU had no effect on such cell growth regulatory signals. CTPPU induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells. Immunofluorescence revealed that CTPPU decreased p-Akt and total Akt protein levels, which implied the effect of the compound on protein activity and stability. Next, we utilized in silico molecular docking analysis to reveal the potential molecular targets of CTPPU, and the results showed that the compound could specifically bind to the allosteric pocket of Akt and three sites of mTORC2 (catalytic site, A-site, and I-site), with a binding affinity greater than that of reference compounds. The compound cannot bind to PI3K, an upstream regulator of the Akt pathway. The effect of CTPPU on PI3K and Akt was confirmed. This finding indicated that the compound could decrease p-Akt but caused no effect on p-PI3K. Conclusions: The results indicate that CTPPU significantly inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest via the Akt/GSK-3β/c-Myc signaling pathway. Molecular docking revealed that CTPPU could interact with Akt and mTORC2 molecules with a high binding affinity. These data indicate that CTPPU is a potential novel alternative therapeutic approach for NSCLC.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"
Impact of temperature on gluconic acid production during acetification by Acetobacter aceti,"Sriphochanart W., Krusong W., Mekkerdchoo O., Suwapanich R., Sriprom P., Tantratian S.",2023-06-01,"Acetobacter aceti, Acid content, Acid production, External venturi injector bioreactor, Gluconic acids, Highest temperature, Impact of temperatures, Normal acetification temperature, Semi-continuous process, Venturi injectors, Acetic Acid, Acetobacter, Acetobacter aceti, Fermentation, Temperature, external Venturi injector bioreactor, normal acetification temperature, organic acids, semicontinuous process","The current approach to gluconic acid production is acetification at 30°C, a temperature that can be difficult to maintain in tropical countries. This study investigated the production of gluconic acid during acetification by Acetobacter aceti WK at high temperatures. An acid-tolerant and thermotolerant species, A. aceti WK, was used for acetification at three different temperatures, namely, 30°C (normal temperature), 37°C, and 40°C (high temperature). Acetification was performed in a 100 L bioreactor with 0.15% CaCl2 for protection of the cells against high temperatures. The production of the organic acids, that is, acetic acid, gluconic acid, 2-keto gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, and formic acid, was analyzed. Under acetification in the target total concentration of 80 g/L, the highest acetic acid content (39.3 g/L) was obtained at 37°C with an acetification rate of 0.3013 g/L/h, while the acetic acid content and acetification rate achieved at 30°C were 31 g/L and 0.3089 g/L/h, respectively. Additionally, gluconic acid presented at the highest concentration of 2.17 g/L. The rate of production of gluconic acid was 0.0169 g/L/h at 37°C. This acetification process at 37°C will be valuable as an alternative source for gluconic acid production for commercial applications.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, process equipment, biochemistryistry, coastal engineering, engineering, Immunology, pharmacology","Biotechnology, Bioengineering, Molecular Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Drug Discovery, Process Chemistry and Technology"
A Deep Learning Approach for Locating Microalgae in Image Captured by Smartphone and Digital Microscope Camera,"Kaewman N., Charoenkwan P., Yana J., Suanoi P.-U., Duangjan K., Pekkoh J., Pumas C.",2023-01-01,"Digital microscope camera, Digital microscopes, Efficientdet, Fast-rcnn, Micro-algae, Microalga detection, Microscope cameras, Retinanet, Smart-phone cameras, Yolov5, digital microscope camera, efficientdet, faster-rcnn, microalgae detection, retinanet, smartphone camera, yolov5","The utilization of microalgae as a bioindicator for water quality assessment has traditionally relied on the expertise of morphological identification. With the advent of technological advancements, particularly the smartphone camera, there has been increasing interest in using it as a tool for various fields of microbiological and medical diagnostics, including image analysis of microalgae. Despite the growing popularity of smartphone-based image analysis, the image quality of smartphone cameras for detecting microalgae has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the suitability of smartphone-based camera for collecting microalgae images and compare it to that of a digital microscope camera. Additionally, the effect of different microscopic magnifications at 100x and 400x on model performance was thoroughly studied. Four models, YOLOv5, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and Faster-RCNN, were trained on microalgae image datasets taken by both a smartphone camera (SC) and a digital microscope camera (DMC) under 100x and 400x magnification. A total of 11,608 images were divided into three parts: train (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%), with the test dataset separated into four parts for each device and magnification. The results of the study indicated that Faster-RCNN was the best model for microalgae detection, with the highest average precision (AP0.5) values of 0.60, 0.84, 0.91, and 0.96 at 100x magnification of SC and DMC and 400x magnification of SC and DMC, respectively. The comparison between the image quality of SC and DMC at each magnification revealed that the SC was less suitable for microalgae identification, particularly at 100x magnification. Conversely, the 400x magnification of SC had the potential to identify microalgae through the use of smartphone-based photography, as well as digital microscope camera.","fluidex; related topics, sociology, arts, computer science, decision sciences, engineering, medical","Education, Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous), Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Information Systems and Management, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Media Technology, Health Informatics"
"Species diversity of phlebotomine sand flies and sympatric occurrence of Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis, Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani complex, and Trypanosoma spp. in the visceral leishmaniasis focus of southern Thailand","Preativatanyou K., Chinwirunsirisup K., Phumee A., Khositharattanakool P., Sunantaraporn S., Depaquit J., Siriyasatien P.",2023-08-01,"Animals, Female, Insect Vectors, Leishmania donovani, Leishmaniasis, Leishmaniasis, Visceral, Phlebotomus, Psychodidae, Thailand, Trypanosoma, Anuran Trypanosoma, Leishmania donovani complex, Leishmania martiniquensis, Phlebotomine sand flies, Southern Thailand, Visceral leishmaniasis","Autochthonous leishmaniasis in Thailand has recently been a public health concern due to an increasing number of new clinical cases. Most indigenous cases were diagnosed with Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis, and Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis. However, some doubts regarding vector misidentification have arisen and need to be elucidated. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the species composition of sand flies and determine the molecular prevalence of trypanosomatids in the transmission area of leishmaniasis in southern Thailand. In the present study, a total of 569 sand flies were caught from the vicinity of a visceral leishmaniasis patient's house in Na Thawi District, Songkhla Province. Of these, 229 parous and gravid females consisted of Sergentomyia khawi, Se. barraudi, Phlebotomus stantoni, Grassomyia indica, and Se. hivernus, accounting for 31.4%, 30.6%, 29.7%, 7.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. However, Se. gemmea, which has previously been proposed as the most abundant species and putative vector of visceral leishmaniasis, was not found in the present study. Based on ITS1-PCR and sequence analysis, two specimens of Gr. indica and Ph. stantoni showed positive amplification of L. martiniquensis and L. donovani complex, respectively, the first one being presumed indigenous and the second one being not. Anuran Trypanosoma was also molecularly detected using SSU rRNA-PCR and ubiquitously found in 16 specimens of four dominant sand fly species except for Se. hivernus. The obtained sequences could be phylogenetically categorized into the two major amphibian clades (An04/Frog1 and An01+An02/Frog2). The existence of the monophyletic subgroup and distinct lineage suggests them as novel Trypanosoma species. The TCS network analysis of these anuran Trypanosoma sequences also revealed high haplotype diversity (Hd = 0.925 ± 0.050), but low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.019 ± 0.009). Furthermore, the living anuran trypanosomes were microscopically demonstrated in a single specimen of Gr. indica, supporting the vectorial capacity. Importantly, our data confirmed the scarcity of Se. gemmea and also uncovered, for the first time, the co-circulation of L. martiniquensis, L. donovani complex, and suspected novel anuran Trypanosoma spp. in phlebotomine sand files, implicating their potential role as vectors of trypanosomatid parasites. Therefore, the novel data from this study would greatly facilitate the comprehension of the complexity of trypanosomatid transmission and the establishment of prevention and control measures for this neglected disease more effectively.","microbiology: bacteriology, mycology, parasitology and virology, geobase; related topics, Immunology, medical","Parasitology, Infectious Diseases"
Managing prolific sows in tropical environments,"Tummaruk P., De Rensis F., Kirkwood R.N.",2023-07-01,"Animals, Eating, Female, Lactation, Litter Size, Milk, Pregnancy, Reproduction, Sus scrofa, Swine, fertility, gilt, heat stress, litter size, puberty, sow","Litter size in modern sows has been dramatically improved in recent decades by genetic selection for highly prolific sows. In a tropical environment, the average total number of pigs born and number born alive are reported to be as high as 17.2 and 15.1 piglets per litter, respectively. Therefore, the new production target in many herds aims to achieve 30–40 pigs weaned per sow per year. Despite the improvements in litter size, the mean preweaning piglet mortality rate remains high, at between 10% and 20%, in major pig-producing countries. A sufficient daily feed intake by lactating sows is important for high milk production as sow milk yield is the limiting factor for piglet growth rate. Heat stress, which can occur when the ambient temperatures rise above 25°C, is one of the major problems that decreases daily feed intake and compromises milk yield. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage high feed intakes to achieve high milk yields. However, even with high nutrient intakes, productivity can be constrained by intestinal barrier function, limiting digestive ability, and allowing potential pathogens and/or toxins to become systemic. This is more likely greater under tropical conditions because of heat stress, exacerbating sow fertility problems. Underpinning sow herd performance, including responses to environmental challenges, is the selection of appropriate gilts, for example, selection and management for early puberty, thus presumably selecting the more fertile gilts and the correct management of lactation to improve the number of weaned piglets are some of the key factors for future reproductive efficiency of the farm under tropical conditions.",biochemistryistry,"Genetics, Developmental Biology, Cell Biology"

Two methodologies were explored: the decoration with copper and anodic doping with copper ions. The porous oxide layers produced in silicate media presented two porous layers consisting of γ-Al2O3 crystalline phase and amorphous phases of aluminosilicate, silica, and Al(OH)3. Small amounts of copper (<0.3 at.%) were detected in the PEO films. In the Cu-decorated film, copper clusters composed of Cu0 and Cu2+ species were observed visually as small black dots on the surface. In the Cu-doped film, the Cu2+ and Cu+ species were homogeneously distributed on the surface. The copper content affected the corrosion performance in aggressive corrosive media. The PEO coatings showed a remarkable antimicrobial activity after 24 h in standard tests. The antimicrobial effectiveness of the Cu-decorated sample was higher against S. aureus, while the Cu-doped sample was more effective against E. coli. The results demonstrated that differences in the PEO coating architecture can affect the material composition and, consequently, the bacterial inactivation mechanism. These findings can serve as a guide to tailor aluminum alloys for specific antimicrobial surfaces.","corrosion, chemistry, physics, Materials Science","Chemistry (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physics and Astronomy (all), Surfaces and Interfaces, Surfaces, Coatings and Films"

Applying fiber extended the initiation stage and postponded the crack propagation stage of corrosion process in RC structure. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) for its application in a chloride environment. To investigate the flexural behavior of the corroded SFRC beam under static loads, the concrete with the water-to-cement ratio of 0.4 containing steel fibers of 0, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% were used. The impressed current method was applied to accelerate the corrosion of steel to reach 5% by applying the constant current of 250 µA/cm2 within 38 days. The flexural strength of eight beams having an identical section of 150 × 200 mm and a length of 1400 mm were examined under a four-point bending test. The experimental results showed that the presentation of mill cut steel fibers significantly influenced the flexural performance of the corroded SFRC beams. Corrosion of steel led to a more significant reduction of load capacity of the RC beams, whereas the beam containing the steel fiber remained the ultimate or yield load capacity. Fibers take account for compensating the flexural strength of the structure due to the loss of cross-section of the steel bar by corrosion effect and limit the propagation of the width crack.","corrosion, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

This unique property of SMPs makes them an appealing candidate in application for soft robotics, such as smart actuators, artificial muscles, and biomedical devices. In this contribution, we have developed multi-stimuli-responsive SMPs from bio-based benzoxazine resin and iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) that could be actuated by magnetic field and light. The nanocomposites were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, in which molecular interaction between benzoxazine/epoxy copolymers and Fe3O4 NPs was observed. Effects of nanoparticle content (0–5 wt%) on magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and thermo-mechanical properties of nanocomposites were investigated. Shape memory performance of nanocomposites was significantly improved with incorporation of Fe3O4 NPs. Shape fixity increased from 85% of neat copolymers to 93% of copolymers filled with 3 wt% Fe3O4 NPs, while shape recovery increased from 94% to 98%. Moreover, shape fixity could be done without external force contact by 808 nm-light actuation and magnetic attraction, due to photothermal and magnetic properties of nanocomposites. Shape recovery was tested under actuation by magnetic field. The highest shape recovery ratio was 99% within 26 s for copolymers filled with 5 wt% Fe3O4 NPs. Lastly, preliminary application of nanocomposites was demonstrated as they could push a 1 g-object within 10 s of actuation by magnetic field. In overall, these nanocomposites with multi-stimuli-responsive shape memory property had a good potential to be applied for soft robotics.","fluidex; related topics, coastal engineering, Materials Science, engineering","Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous), Materials Science (miscellaneous), Polymers and Plastics, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

In this study, two types of hydrophobic and hydrophilic SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were used in conjunction with a binary surfactant system (extended Carboxylate and Dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) surfactants at the ratio of 0.6:0.4 by volume). An extensive series of experiments were performed in the presence of API brine containing NaCl: CaCl2 at the 8:2 wt ratio to study microemulsion phase behavior, interfacial tension (IFT), surfactant adsorption onto NP surfaces, solution and microemulsion viscosity, and oil recovery. The results indicate that the microemulsion phase behavior, optimum salinity (S*), and IFT were influenced by the concentrations and surface characteristics of the NPs. Hydrophobic or hydrophilic NPs at 500 ppm in the binary surfactant system could form Type III microemulsion and decrease the S* from 2 to 1.75 wt%. When the NP concentration reached 1000 ppm, the S* reduced to 1.5 wt%. The IFT value of the neat binary surfactant system at the S* was obtained in an ultralow range (0.0013 mN/m), and the IFT value of the hydrophobic NPs exhibited a more significant reduction than the hydrophilic NP systems. The adsorption result demonstrates that Carboxylate surfactant had lower adsorption onto hydrophilic NP than AOT. COSMO σ-profile and screened charge density illustrated that the low coverage of Carboxylate surfactant was from hydrogen bonding interaction, making the surfactant lie flat on the surface. The viscosity of the NP-surfactant solution was affected by the capacity of the surfactant adsorption onto the NP surface. In this regard, adding the hydrophobic NPs at 1000 ppm provided the highest solution viscosity over the entire shear rate and temperature range. The viscosity of the microemulsion formulated by hydrophobic NPs was higher than that of the microemulsion formulated by the hydrophilic NPs. The system with the lower NP concentration had higher microemulsion viscosity than the system with the higher NP concentration. The oil recovery results indicate that the appropriate NP type and concentration in the surfactant system could increase the displacing viscosity and decrease the microemulsion viscosity compared with the neat surfactant flooding system. The success in improving oil recovery was achieved with recovery efficiency of 88% original oil in place (OOIP).","geobase; related topics, energy, earth sciences","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Energy (miscellaneous), Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology"

Combined Fe2O3/CaO-Al2O3 multifunctional catalysts were demonstrated and prepared by different methods including sol-gel, mechanical mixing, and impregnation at different Fe contents (5, 10, and 15 wt%). The results showed that the multifunctional catalyst prepared by impregnation method with 5 wt% Fe loading provided the highest H2 purity of 70% in the pre-breakthrough period which lasted for 60 min at 600 °C. This was attributed to the preserving of Ca12Al14O33 inert support in the structure during the preparation as shown by XRD results, leading to higher surface area as determined by N2 physisorption and to prevention of particle agglomeration as evidenced by SEM-EDX. Although the H2 production was inhibited by the presence of Ca2Fe2O5 phase, a stable performance was found for at least 5 repeated cycles both for sorption capacity and oxygen carrier. The ease of decarbonation was also observed with this material as confirmed by DSC-TGA analysis. This highlighted the mutual advantages of Fe in CaO sorption stability and Ca in Fe oxygen carrier stability which could offset their intrinsic weak robustness.","mixing and separation, energy","Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment"

Granite stone powder waste can be obtained free of cost from marble factories as factories spend on the disposal of this waste. In the present study, novel granite stone powder waste composite has been prepared and utilized for the effective removal of Terasil dye. Two types of granite including gray granite and white granite were used in pure, calcinized, and chemically modified forms. Freundlich adsorption isotherm model best explained the adsorption mechanism of dye removal using granite composites as compared to other adsorption isothermal models. Characterization techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used for the determination of morphological features and functional groups of granite composites. The obtained results were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) along with the post hoc Tukey test. An extraordinarily high Terasil dye uptake capacity (more than 400 mg/g) was exhibited by granite composites prepared using sodium metasilicate.

However, the study of oculomotor and abducens nerve is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oculomotor and abducens nerves were harvested with a portion of brainstem and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal and serial sections from ten of each cranial nerve were stained and a photomicrograph was taken to make the following observations and measurements: 1) patterns of central myelin portion, 2) length of central myelin portion, and 3) depth of central myelin- peripheral myelin transitional zone. RESULTS: For oculomotor nerve, the longest central myelin bundle was always seen on the first nerve bundle and that the length of central myelin decreased gradually. For abducens nerve, morphological patterns were classified into four types based on number of nerve rootlets emerging from the brainstem and number of nerve bundles in each rootlet. Length of central myelin portion was between 0.36-6.10 mm (2.75 ± 0.83 mm) and 0.13-5.01 mm (1.66 ± 1.39 mm) for oculomotor and abducens nerves, respectively. The oculomotor nerve transitional zone depth was 0.07-058 mm (0.23 ± 0.07 mm), while for abducens nerve, depth was 0.05-0.40 mm (0.16 ± 0.07 mm). Positive weak correlations between central myelin and depth of TZ were found in oculomotor nerve (r +0.310, p < 0.05) and abducens nerves (r +0.413, p < 0.05).

Vehicle rollover accidents occur in one of two ways: tripped and untripped rollovers. For detecting tripped rollovers, the traditional rollover index is ineffective; most precise rollover indicators depend on dynamic models that must identify all the parameters for computations. In this study, we focused on exploring a new index for detecting tripped and untripped rollovers using a neural network (NN). Four types of NNs, i.e., FNN, Tanh, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were examined to develop models for estimating rollover indices. The results demonstrated that the GRU and large Tanh network are the most suitable NNs for untripped and tripped rollover prediction, respectively. Moreover, the untripped rollover prediction model having a small GRU network could precisely anticipate the trend of the untripped rollover indicators for up to 0.2 s in advance. Moreover, the created tripped rollover anticipation model with a large Tanh network could precisely forecast the trend of the tripped rollover index up to 0.5 s in advance. Based on these results, rollover prediction in future can be advantageous for rollover prevention and warning systems.","accidentistrys and accidentistry prevention, fluidex; related topics, engineering",Automotive Engineering

As per the 2020 annual global survey by the World Federation of Hemophilia, only 1828 Thai hemophiliacs have been registered to the national healthcare system. The reason for the low number is the underdiagnosis which is a major concern in the real-world practice among Asian countries. In Thailand, most hemophiliacs are diagnosed by general practitioners, pediatricians or internists at rural hospitals and are referred to hemophilia specialists at the Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs).

Although radiotherapy is the mainstay for treatment of cavernous sinus lesions, histologic diagnosis allows access to a wide variety of alternative treatment modalities. The region is considered a high-risk area for open transcranial surgical access, and the endoscopic endonasal approach presents an alternative technique for biopsy. Methods: A retrospective case series was performed of all patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal biopsy of isolated cavernous sinus lesions at 2 tertiary institutions. The primary outcomes were the percentage of patients in whom a histologic diagnosis was achieved and the proportion of patients in whom therapy differed from radiotherapy alone. Secondary outcomes included preoperative and postoperative 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test symptom scores, as well as perioperative adverse outcomes. Results: Eleven patients underwent endoscopic endonasal biopsy, with a diagnosis achieved in 10 patients. The most common diagnosis was perineural spread of squamous cell carcinoma, followed by perineuroma and single cases of metastatic melanoma, metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma, mycobacterium lepri infection, neurofibroma, and lymphoma. Six patients had treatments other than radiotherapy, including immunotherapy, antibiotics, corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and observation alone. There was no significant difference in prebiopsy and postbiopsy 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores. There was 1 case of epistaxis requiring return to theater for cautery of the sphenopalatine artery and there were no mortalities. Conclusions: In a limited case series, endoscopic endonasal biopsy was safe and effective in obtaining diagnosis for cavernous sinus lesions and had a significant impact on therapeutic decision making.",medical,"Surgery, Neurology (clinical)"

Herein, in order to improve the safety and durability, a succinonitrile (SN) modified composite SSE is proposed. In this SSE, SN is introduced for eliminating the boundary between ceramic particles, increasing the amorphous region of polymer and ensuring fast ionic transport. Subsequently, the symmetric battery based on the proposed SSE achieves a long cycle life of 3000 h. Moreover, the elaborate cathode interface through the SN participation effectively reduces the barriers to the combination between lithium ions and electrons, facilitating the corresponding electrochemical reactions. As a result, the solid-state Li-O2 battery based on this SSE and tuned cathode interface achieves improved electrochemical performance including large specific capacity over 12,000 mAh g−1, enhanced rate capacity as well as stable cycle life of 54 cycles at room temperature.

Our previous study revealed the in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of fingerroot [Boesenbergia rotunda (L.) Mansf. (Zingiberaceae)] and its phytochemical, panduratin A. Objective: To investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of panduratin A as a pure compound and in a fingerroot extract formulation in beagle dogs. Materials and methods: A total of 12 healthy dogs were randomly divided into three groups, a single dose of 1 mg/kg panduratin A by intravenous and multiple doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg panduratin A fingerroot extract formulation by oral administration for seven consecutive days. The plasma concentration of panduratin A was determined by LCMS. Results: The peak concentrations of a single dose of 5 and 10 mg/kg panduratin A fingerroot extract formulation were 12,416 ± 2,326 and 26,319 ± 8,221 µg/L, respectively. Increasing the oral dose of fingerroot extract formulation, equivalent to panduratin A 5–10 mg/kg, showed dose proportionality, with an approximately 2-fold increase in C max and AUC. The absolute oral bioavailability of panduratin A in the fingerroot extract formulation was approximately 7–9%. The majority of panduratin A was biotransformed into several products via oxidation and glucuronidation, and predominantly excreted via the faecal route. Conclusion: The oral formulation of fingerroot extract was safe in beagle dogs, and increasing dose showed dose proportionality in terms of the systemic exposure of panduratin A.

Identification and validation of a novel ferroptosis-related gene signature for prognosis and potential therapeutic target prediction in cholangiocarcinoma,"Sae-fung A., Mutirangura A., Jitkaew S.",2023-01-17,"Bile Duct Neoplasms, Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic, Biomarkers, Cholangiocarcinoma, Ferroptosis, Humans, Prognosis, cholangiocarcinoma, ferroptosis, gene signature, prognosis, risk score","Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy of the bile ducts with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. Effective targeted therapy and accurate prognostic biomarkers are still lacking. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death implicated in cancer progression and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers. However, a comprehensive analysis of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) for predicting CCA prognosis and therapeutic targets and determining the role of ferroptosis in CCA remain to be performed. Here, we developed a prognostic FRG signature using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analysis in a training cohort. We then validated it using four independent public datasets. The six-FRG signature was developed to predict CCA patient survival, stratifying them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on survival time. Significantly, the high-risk CCA patients had shorter overall survival. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis further confirmed the prognostic FRG signature’s strong predictive ability, indicating that it was an independent prognostic indicator for CCA patients. Furthermore, the high-risk group was associated with fluke infection and high clinical stages. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) score and CAF markers were significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. Moreover, our FRG signature could predict immune checkpoint markers for immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. The mRNA expression levels of the six-FRG signature was validated in 10 CCA cell lines and dividing them into low-risk and high-risk groups using the FRG signature. We further showed that high-risk CCA cell lines were more resistant to ferroptosis inducers, including erastin and RSL3, than the low-risk CCA cell lines. Our study constructed a novel FRG signature model to predict CCA prognoses which might provide prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for CCA patients. Ferroptosis sensitivity in high-risk and low-risk CCA cell lines suggests that ferroptosis resistance is associated with high-risk group CCA. Therefore, ferroptosis could be a promising therapeutic target for precision therapy in CCA patients.","medical, Immunology","Immunology and Allergy, Immunology"

Strain AA8T formed a tight taxonomic position in the 16S rRNA gene tree with Streptomyces roseifaciens MBT76T. In contrast, the genome-based taxonomic analysis showed that strain AA8T shared low average nucleotide identity-BLAST (94.1%), the digital DNA–DNA hybridization (58.2%), and the average amino acid identity (93.6%) values with S. roseifaciens MBT76T. Moreover, a combination of physiological and biochemical properties indicated that strain AA8T was distinguished from all Streptomyces species with effectively published names. Strain AA8T, therefore, represents a novel species of Streptomyces, and the name Streptomyces telluris is proposed for the strain. The type strain is AA8T (= TBRC 8483T = NBRC 113461T).

The region's population is expected to increase up to 60% in the coming decades. Many tropical countries continue to experience public health problems such as high rates of infectious diseases, lack of sanitation, climate change impacts, poor regulation of herbal medicines and low access to healthcare. These conditions produce the unique problem of tropical acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Tropical infections such as leptospirosis, dengue and malaria have varied mechanisms of AKI, including both direct kidney invasion and indirect effects, depending on the disease characteristics. Animal toxins from snakebites and arthropods along with plant toxins, such as djenkol beans, starfruit and herbal medicine, are characterized by a harmful renal effect from each toxic substance. Environmental factors such as heat stress, natural disasters and chemical compounds also lead to AKI and have a systemic effect from their own pathogenesis. The long-term kidney prognosis varies among these etiologies depending on the cause and severity of disease. However, all these conditions are potentially preventable and treatable. Prompt management and good preventive approaches are needed.

The boundary conditions on the free surface, the continuity and discontinuity conditions along the coating interface, and the remote conditions are subsequently enforced together with the established general solution to solve for all key unknowns. Results are collected to demonstrate the effect of material contrast between coating layer and coated substrate and the crucial role of material microstructures on predicted response as the length of displacement discontinuity and the thickness of coating layer becomes comparable to the material length scale.","fluidex; related topics, engineering",Civil and Structural Engineering

Catheter ablation is increasingly performed but a large study with long-term outcome data is lacking. We report the results of the multicenter, international BRAVO (Brugada Ablation of VF Substrate Ongoing Registry) for treatment of high-risk symptomatic BrS. Methods: We enrolled 159 patients (median age 42 years; 156 male) with BrS and spontaneous VF in BRAVO; 43 (27%) of them had BrS and early repolarization pattern. All but 5 had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for cardiac arrest (n=125) or syncope (n=34). A total of 140 (88%) had experienced numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for spontaneous VF before ablation. All patients underwent a percutaneous epicardial substrate ablation with electroanatomical mapping except for 8 who underwent open-thoracotomy ablation. Results: In all patients, VF/BrS substrates were recorded in the epicardial surface of the right ventricular outflow tract; 45 (29%) patients also had an arrhythmic substrate in the inferior right ventricular epicardium and 3 in the posterior left ventricular epicardium. After a single ablation procedure, 128 of 159 (81%) patients remained free of VF recurrence; this number increased to 153 (96%) after a repeated procedure (mean 1.2±0.5 procedures; median=1), with a mean follow-up period of 48±29 months from the last ablation. VF burden and frequency of shocks decreased significantly from 1.1±2.1 per month before ablation to 0.003±0.14 per month after the last ablation (P<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier VF-free survival beyond 5 years after the last ablation was 95%. The only variable associated with a VF-free outcome in multivariable analysis was normalization of the type 1 Brugada ECG, both with and without sodium-channel blockade, after the ablation (hazard ratio, 0.078 [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.753]; P=0.0274). There were no arrhythmic or cardiac deaths. Complications included hemopericardium in 4 (2.5%) patients. Conclusions: Ablation treatment is safe and highly effective in preventing VF recurrence in high-risk BrS.

Targeting Akt is beneficial for the development of cancer drugs. renieramycin T (RT) has been reported to have Mcl-1 targeting activity, and the study of the structure-activity relationships (SARs) demonstrated that cyanide and the benzene ring are essential for its effects. In this study, novel derivatives of the RT right-half analog with cyanide and the modified ring were synthesized to further investigate the SARs for improving the anticancer effects of RT analogs and evaluate CSC-suppressing activity through Akt inhibition. Among the five derivatives, a compound with a substituted thiazole structure (DH_25) exerts the most potent anticancer activity in lung cancer cells. It has the ability to induce apoptosis, which is accompanied by an increase in PARP cleavage, a decrease in Bcl-2, and a diminishment of Mcl-1, suggesting that residual Mcl-1 inhibitory effects exist even after modifying the benzene ring to thiazole. Furthermore, DH_25 is found to induce CSC death, as well as a decrease in CSC marker CD133, CSC transcription factor Nanog, and CSC-related oncoprotein c-Myc. Notably, an upstream member of these proteins, Akt and p-Akt, are also downregulated, indicating that Akt can be a potential target of action. Computational molecular docking showing a high-affinity interaction between DH_25 and an Akt at the allosteric binding site supports that DH_25 can bind and inhibit Akt. This study has revealed a novel SAR and CSC inhibitory effect of DH_25 via Akt inhibition, which may encourage further development of RT compounds for cancer therapy.","coastal engineering, biochemistryistry, chemistry, computer science","Catalysis, Molecular Biology, Spectroscopy, Computer Science Applications, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry"

The transmission lines are simulated by using the upwind finite volume method (FVM). The influence of wind direction from positive to negative conductors yields higher current density and electric field peaks than that in the opposite direction. The ground-level electric field is similar for both wind directions. The peak positions of current density on the ground are close to the center line under the wind from the positive to the negative conductors. The opposite wind has the current peak near the right of way.
